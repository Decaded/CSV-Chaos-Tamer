1,,Free,Zombie Physiology,Marvel Zombies,Transformation,"You are a zombie. That comes with its benefits and its downsides. You retain your intellect and have a choice of what kind of zombie you are. There are a lot of variants, but we’re cutting it down to just the originals for brevity’s sake. The classic Marvel Zombies. The disciples of the Hunger Gospel, you could say. You’re a bona fide zombie, save for your intelligence. While you’re necrotic and always hungry now, you’re now functionally immortal. You don’t even feel pain anymore (save for some very rare, very unusual cases). Being undead makes it so that you can’t age anymore. Most wounds, including dismemberment and decapitation aren’t lethal anymore - it’d take the destruction of your brain to do you in for real. Breathing isn’t much of an issue, either. The only problem is that you’re really, really hungry all the time. Also your lips have disappeared and you’ve got a very toothy, skull-like face now. All the better to eat with."
2,,Free,Amphibian Physiology,Amphibia,Transformation,"Amphibi-Man,
Amphibi-Man, does whatever an amphibian can... oh sorry, anyways this perk lets
you use the various abilities found in amphibians. You can breathe underwater,
stick to walls, croak, jump really far, shoot out your tongue. Basically anything
your chosen amphibian race could do you can now do in any body you have."
3,,Free,Freak Physiology,Akame ga Kill!,Transformation,"You’re one of the
Danger Beasts, also referred to as Risk Species sometimes and as Freaks in
Wakoku, starting as a Class 2 or Class 1 Beast by default, the classes of monsters
that is the closest to strength of the average captain. You’ll still be regarded as a
mundane beast in terms of your power, having little to no supernatural traits beyond
your innate physical prowess and natural weapons, but, like how mentioned before,
you’ll perfectly retain your human intellect, unlike the rest of your kind and the
humans that were turned into beasts through artificial means, and thus you won’t
need to worry about any monstrous instincts affecting your mind and personality.
While you can customize within reason the kind of beast you’re, you can also choose
a canon species of your class to be part of, as long as said species don’t have any
too special trait, like a Tree Beast, a Jackaleo, a Flying Death or even an Earth
Dragon for example."
4,,Free,Ant Man,Worm CYOA v17,Transformation,You can shrink yourself to the size of 1 cubic centimeter. You retain your human strength while in this form. You can grow back to normal with a thought.
5,,Free,Meathead,Worm CYOA v17,Transformation,"You can grow and increase your muscle mass significantly, enough to roughly triple your base strength."
6,,Free,Shinigami,Bleach,Transformation,"Those who guide souls from this world to the next and protect the cycle of reincarnation. The
Shinigami are gods of death, human spirits who take up the ceaseless battle for the souls of mankind
against Hollows, Quincy and all other dark threats to the innocent. Or so they say. A Shinigami is nothing more than an above-average human soul who has bonded with an Asauchi, a
blank vessel in the shape of a sword that was forged through the combination of many empty souls.

Yet that bond brings them great power, as the sword unlocks the true spiritual potential within their
souls. Over the thousands of years, the Shinigami have established an organisation known as the
Gotei 13, among other factions. Organised into a military force, they now guard the Afterlife and the
Mortal World as they attend to their psychopomp duties. As your primary choice, you become a Plus or human spirit in Soul Society that passed on from the
Mortal World. Having noticed your above average spiritual pressure and thus need to eat, you set
out to train yourself. You will be a new graduate from the Shin’o Academy, where all Shinigami learn
the four core techniques of the Shinigami and are trained for their duties. Zanjutsu, the art of sword
fighting. Hakuda, unarmed combat. Hoho, mobility techniques. Kido, demon magic. You were an
average student, as trained in each art as any unseated Shinigami could claim to be and while your
Asauchi has bonded to you, you have not yet heard it’s call. Perhaps through the fires of battle or
deep introspection, you could make contact with your inner sword.

Note: Only one Bleach race may be purchased without Hybridisation."
7,,Free,Quincy,Bleach,Transformation,"A sub-species of mankind, one split between the mortal and spiritual realms. Quincy are humans
who, long ago, gained the ability to naturally manipulate spiritual particles known as Reishi. They
could gather them from the air and shape them to their will, to create or destroy. They took on roles
as ancient protectors of humanity, particularly so when the Shinigami were too late or too few to
protect mankind everywhere. But the Quincy powers were terrible indeed, as the spiritual weapons
they crafted went far beyond a Zanpakuto. The Heilig Bogen, spirit weapons, destroyed souls
permanently. Not something the cycle of reincarnation could stand. Tensions rose between them and the Shinigami, guardians of the cycle, and it came to a head when
the Quincy King emerged. Yhwach, mightiest of the Quincy and claiming to be their father, united
them into an empire and led them against Soul Society in a terrible war a thousand years ago. He
was defeated and the Quincy race left smashed into fragments. In time, they would rebuild and yet
again face misfortune, almost exterminated by the Shinigami to protect the cycle. You are one of the few Quincy remaining, as either one of the last mortal families or one of the
hidden servants of the slowly recovering Quincy Empire called the Wandenreich. You’ve been
trained to gather and manipulate Reishi, enough to form a Heilig Bogen from raw blue energy. You’ve had some lessons with the Quincy spells and tools, enough to make basic use of low level
equipment, and have a good idea of where to focus to improve. Necessary, given how hard it is to
find a teacher. You’re little better than an unseated Shinigami for now.

Note: Only one Bleach race may be purchased without Hybridisation."
8,,Free,Fullbringer,Bleach,Transformation,"Humans with a little something special in their souls. As they were conceived, a shining golden
fragment made contact with their newly born soul, a piece of the greatest soul that ever was. This
royal shard would bring great spiritual potential later in life but unfortunately, it draws Hollows to
attack the new human. Even before they are born. Those that survive are often left scarred by loss, others sacrificing themselves so that this Fullbringer, the name of what you are now, could live. Fullbringer’s possess a natural level of spiritual power and awareness, as well as the Fullbring ability. Using it, they can ‘pull’ on the souls of things around them. Move objects through telekinetic forceby pulling on their soul, accelerate one’s movement by pulling on the air, even stand on water by
forcing it to remain cohesive. With this and the natural uses of Reiryoku, Fullbringers can achieve the
power of a Shinigami or Hollow despite their living bodies. Some Fullbringers, who feel affinity for an
object, even find a greater power awaiting them. Fullbringers are naturally drawn together and doubtless, as a newly awakened Fullbringer, you’ll
soon encounter at least a few others of your kind despite your rarity. They’re likely to at least give
you a rundown on your abilities, as you have only the most rudimentary skill right now. Show a
friendly face and you might get some useful lessons too. 

Note: Only one Bleach race may be purchased without Hybridisation."
9,,Free,Hollow,Bleach,Transformation,"Not all humans pass on peacefully to Soul Society once they die. Those with regrets, hatred or
something chaining them to this world are trapped without the aid of a Shinigami to guide them. If
left to fester long enough, their souls will rot and turn in on themselves, as the poor spirit transforms
into a monstrous Hollow. Hollows are tragic beings, the process stealing away their hearts and turning it into a bone white mask for them, stuck on their face. An empty hole appears on their bodies to represent that lost
heart, as well as symbolising the endless hunger for souls that the Hollows feel. That hunger is what
turns them into such predatory beasts as well, with even newly born Hollows having a vast variety of
forms. There are common powers all Hollows possess, beyond what their physical form allows. A touch that
burns like acid, an ability to separate souls from living bodies on contact and a quick regeneration of
physical damage. Many Hollows will develop unique powers of their own as they grow in power, particularly as they begin to evolve. Evolution is as central to Hollows as their hunger and their are four primary stages. The first is the basic Hollow, which spirits become upon Hollowfication. If they continue to consume
many souls, they will eventually become a Gillian, the first of the Menos class Hollows. Gillian are
colonies of hundreds or thousands of Hollows in a great, shadowy mass. The many souls within
compete to be the leading mind and once one establishes themselves as fully dominant, the Gillian
can transform into an Adjuchas. Taking on a superior form to their original Hollow shape, an
Adjuchas has great power but a constant need for souls to prevent degradation into a Gillian. Rarely,
if an Adjuchas can devour a truly vast number of souls without regressing or being bitten themselves, they can become a Vasto Lord. The peak of Hollow evolution, who naturally come into humanoid bodies. Alongside this is the Arrancar form, made by purposefully tearing off one’s own mask or through
special rituals. This grants a human form to the Hollow, sealing their original shape and powers into
the form of a ‘Zanpakuto’ like a Shinigami. The Arrancar, and other high level Hollows, have created
quite the number of racial techniques as well. The high speed Sonido, the powerful Cero blasts, defensive Negacion and more.

You will be a newly formed basic Hollow, of shape of your design. You’ll kill any normal human with
ease and be considered a threat to an unseated Shinigami but not be of much note. You’ll have a
natural instinct for combat, especially with your new form, but any unique powers are yet to come.

Note: Only one Bleach race may be purchased without Hybridisation."
10,,Free,Ascension,RWBY: Ever After Gauntlet,Transformation,"Beings of the Ever After don’t ‘die’ the way people on Remnant might. Once they have fulfilled their purpose they are simply remade into something else, maybe something they wanted to be in their past live. The Tree gives them a new purpose in life but they are still them in a way.

For Free during the duration of this Jump you can enjoy this benefit as well. There is no real ‘death’ for you anymore. If you die you come back but simply changed. Some part of you will be used to remake you. You won’t remember who you were and the new you might be entirely different in body, mind and soul, your memories erased... but it will still be you somewhere on some level, your Heart not forgetting your most prominent moments. The later part of this Perk also comes into play whenever you are ‘reforged’ into something else, some core ‘Heart’ of your being not forgetting the moments that most defined who you were.

Upon completion of this Gauntlet this Perk will change and fuse with your Bodymod. You yourself can decide what part of you would be changed. If you are ever remade or reborn you can simply chose for yourself how much of your old being is in the new you. This also makes it impossible for others to change you, your mind or soul, in any way without your permission. You are you. And that is enough.

You can toggle whether or not you want to use this Perk or to what degree you want to use it at any time."
11,,Free,Colour Scheme,RWBY,Transformation,"Colours are a bit of a Theme in this World. They are meant to represent the vast variety among the people of Remnant, in particular when contrasted with the Grimm. As a result people tend to have a theme with colours associated to them. Be it red, white, black, yellow or a different colour, you may now have a similar theme for a colour of your choice, guaranteed to look great with it. This also concerns to colours of your body if you want natural green hair or purple eyes for example. The only thing you can’t do is make your skin some non-human colour like blue but other than that... show them your True Colours Jumper."
12,,Free,Grimm        ,RWBY,Transformation,"And than there are the Grimm. Older than even humanity itself, created by the God of Darkness to destroy all life, the Grimm are creatures of pure destruction. They lack a soul, making it impossible for them to use Aura and are drawn to feelings of negativity. Envy, sadness, despair, loneliness, all these things can cause Grimm to gather en masse if enough of it were to be present. Incredibly large amounts of Aura also seem to attract Grimm but less so than pure negativity. Grimm come in all shapes and forms and are usually mindless beasts of destruction and malevolence. However your mind will stay in tact. You wouldn’t even have to follow your current Mistress Salem… After this Jump your Grimm form becomes an Alt form.

Grimm may gain 1000 GP (Grimm Points) to customize their form. This can be purchased multiple times.

Note: Form Build in Associated Jump Document. "
13,,Free,Faunus,RWBY,Transformation,"When humanity came back from nothing, they weren’t alone. Somehow the species known as the Faunus had come with them. At its core, Faunus are the same as humans, only difference between them being the presence of one animal trait. What that trait is can vary vastly. It could be a pair of Cat Ears, a set of Bull Horns, a Monkey Tail, Rabbit Ears, skin that can camouflage like a Chameleon etc. You may choose what trait you have that makes up your Faunus heritage. Depending on what you pick it may prove rather advantageous like being able to shoot web as a Spider Faunus or having a poisonous stinger as a Scorpion Faunus. Also Faunus generally have better eye sight and can see in the dark and some Faunus display certain characteristics aligned with their animal heritage. Be warned though, there are cases of discrimination spread throughout the Kingdom... even if the most hate nowadays seems to come from a Terrorist Cell known as the White Fang. After this Jump your Faunus body becomes an Alt form."
14,,Free,SOLDIER,Final Fantasy VII: Remake,Transformation,"Like many of Gaia’s youths, you grew up listening to the tales of SOLDIERs. These incredible super soldiers were among the Shinra Company’s most elite warriors, and you aspired to join their ranks. Through training and tenacity, you beat the odds and were selected for the SOLDIER program, outshining the vast majority of your fellow applicants. Your body was enhanced with mako, infusing your cells with magic and pushing your physical capabilities well past human limits. Your strength and speed make you one of the few humans capable of fighting the monsters of this world, while your senses and reflexes make fighting an army by yourself a real possibility. You are durable enough to walk off high-speed impacts and ignore terminal-velocity falls, you can continue to function after substantial injuries, and natural diseases have no chance of overcoming your resilient physiology. Even your affinity for magic is boosted by the very energies that transformed you, making materia and other spells easier to use.

Of course, these kinds of augmentations come at a significant cost. Though you won’t have to worry about the severe cellular degradation that most SOLDIERs suffer from, your very existence represents many trade secrets and a significant financial investment to Shinra. You’ll spend most of your days working for the powerful company, and even those who manage to walk away are carefully monitored. No matter where you go on Gaia, you can expect Shinra to take a keen interest in your activities."
15,,Free,Ultimate Life Form,Kurohime,Transformation,"You have been bit by both a werewolf and a vampire, and managed to survive the months-long struggle as the cells on your body warred with each other to become one of the most powerful non-divine beings on the planet. For one thing, you no longer possess the weaknesses of being a werewolf or a vampire, and may freely walk during the day, have no vulnerability to silver, and retain your vampiric powers at all times. However, you are also able to transform... but this is far from the weak transformation of a werewolf. No, you resemble some monstrous beast that only loosely looks lupine at all, and when transformed all of your physical abilities are elevated to a great extent, and your claws can shear through even solid iron.

Requires Werewolf and Vampire to Purchase"
16,,Free,Mermaid,Kurohime,Transformation,"Despite the name, this also lets you be a merman. Mermaids are common to the seas around the island of Yamato, but are currently hunted by the Yamato people due to baseless myths that eating their flesh will grant immortality. You’re capable of breathing both air and water, but are very slow on land."
17,,Free,Cursed Spirit Physiology,Jujutsu Kaisen,Transformation,"As a cursed spirit, your body is rather different from that of a human. Instead of being made of flesh and blood, you’re instead a being composed entirely of cursed energy given form. As a result of this, your appearance does not necessarily conform to human norms. As long as you’re roughly humanoid in form, you may design your appearance freely. You could be almost indistinguishable from a human except for a patchwork face; a grey-skinned, cyclopean man with a volcano atop your head; a humanoid cockroach with a body cloaked in a black shroud; or perhaps something even stranger. Possessing some minor natural weapons, such as claws or the ability to spit weakly caustic mucus, is also acceptable, though nothing that’d give you too large an advantage, such as having more than a single pair of arms or something equivalent to a cursed technique. As a guide, most cursed spirits have forms based around concepts that evoke feelings of hatred and fear in humanity, such as natural disasters, plagues, or a mythological creature.

Being a cursed spirit comes with a number of additional traits. For one, you’re completely imperceptible to non-sorcerers. They may be able to see you if you’re seriously threatening them, such as by attempting to kill them, but otherwise the most they’ll get is a sense of unease when you’re around, and that’s only if they’re unusually sensitive. As an innate property of the cursed energy that makes up your form, this cannot be turned off, and sorcerers have no trouble seeing you.

You’re also immune to attempts to harm you by mundane means – physical attacks can still hit you, and they may still knock you back, but unless they’ve got some cursed energy behind them they’ll completely fail to injure you. As such, you’ll only suffer harm when attacked using cursed energy or some other form of supernatural energy. Furthermore, even if you do get harmed you’re capable of using your own cursed energy reserves to heal yourself without having to rely on the reverse cursed technique used by sorcerers, though this is far from an instant process. Being a cursed spirit does come with a minor weakness, that being the positive energy generated by reverse cursed technique, which will neutralise the cursed energy making up your body and thus cause severe injuries. Given how few sorcerers are capable of outputting this energy, this is unlikely to come up however.

All of the above assumes that you will be a regular cursed spirit. If you wish, you may instead choose to be a mixture of cursed spirit and human, similar to the Cursed Womb: Death Painting or Tengen. In general, your appearance will be far more conventionally human, possibly even being completely indistinct from one. By choosing this option, you lose the imperceptibility a normal cursed spirit would have, as well as the immunity to mundane harm and weakness to positive energy. You retain the ability to heal using cursed energy, however, and may take one free purchase of the Cursed Form perk."
18,,Free,Servant Origin,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Transformation,"In the Servant Universe, everyone is a Servant. You’re no different. So of course, you have everything that a Servant would be expected to have. Supplement? Never heard of any such Servant Supplement. You shouldn’t be talking about such strange things here. Servants aren’t much different from the mortal humans of some other time and place. Most Servants are pretty unremarkable, maybe a little stronger and faster than ordinary for a Human. The common sort of Servant doesn’t even have their own Noble Phantasm or set of Skills. But all Servants share certain traits. Immortality, for one. Servants do not age unless they want to, which makes all the older looking Servants a little weird, and even death isn’t permanent for the denizens of the Sapphire Galaxy. As physical souls in this ether filled universe, death is not permanent. Servants will eventually reincarnate as themselves, some years after they die, and continue to enjoy their own lives. More thorough deaths can require a lengthier reincarnation but only the destruction of the soul, a very rare attribute, can permanently lay low the Servants here. Servants still need to eat and drink but, curiously, have no need of breathing. They can survive unharmed in the vacuum of space and resist many of the dangers of this environment. Some old scholars say that this is so all the Servants don’t have to obscure their iconic features during gameplay fights outside of spaceships. "
19,,Free,Godly Beards and Other Divine Accessories,God Of War (2018),Transformation,"As you may notice, many who wander this land have curious looks, complex hairstyles, and of course full, glorious beards! You may also benefit from these minor cosmetic boosters by having easily manageable, luscious hair and great beard genetics, as well as the knowledge on how to manage and style them however you like (this part is toggleable if you don’t want a beard). You can also have any purely cosmetic changes such as the literally ashen-look of a certain god of war, horns like Mimir, or even something like the blue skin of Brok."
20,,Free,Jotunn(Lesser),God Of War (2018),Transformation,"A Jotunn!? Here I thought you were all hiding in Jotunheim, waiting for Ragnarok to come. You were a relatively peaceful lot though some of your kind are great, such as Laufey and Jormungandr. Be careful to not be found by the Aesir for they will surly torture you to find a way to enter Jotunheim. Not all Giants are giant and should you choose the free option you would be similar to Laufey, far shorter than the average giant but still possessing enough power to fight against a minor Aesir with relative ease. "
21,,Free,Vanir(Lesser)        ,God Of War (2018),Transformation,"A Vanir? Not many of you leave Vanaheim, not since the war ended with the Aesir. Though you are a far more peaceful folk then the Aesir, valuing magic and peace over war and strength. Though not as strong as your Aesir counterparts you have a greater understanding of magic, especially that related in some way to nature. The free version would have you receive the same lesser domain ability that the free Aesir race gives you along with the 150 CP Divine Physiology perk. "
22,,Free,Aesir(Lesser),God Of War (2018),Transformation,"A god of the Aesir, I hope you are not as cruel as your kin. The majority of the Aesir gods seem to revel in battle and conquest, taking what they desire and slaying those who get in their way. Though some, such as Tyr, have proven to desire true peace for all. Perhaps you desire the same? The free option would have you be a demigod Aesir on par with Magni and Modi, possessing the ability to utilize a single domain along with the 150 CP Divine Physiology perk."
23,,Free,Monster,HighSchool DxD,Transformation,"A dangerously broad category. Here are the creatures of western folklore such a as lamias, harpies, cerberus, birdmen, elves, dwarves, and so on. Their powers, talents, and culture vary between them, for example lamias and harpies are mostly composed of females, and it’s known that elves and dark elves are attuned to magic. Much like with the previous option, you can freely choose what specific species you want to be, as long as it’s a creature from western myths or legends."
24,,Free,Dhampir,HighSchool DxD,Transformation,"These are hybrids born of the union between Vampires and other species, usually humans. These types of Vampires have all basic Vampiric powers but are immune to their weaknesses such as the effects of sunlight. However, the vampiric powers they inherit are also somewhat weakened and because of how vampire society works, they’re abused, shamed, and most of the time not even thought of as real vampires. Still, they are daywalkers and that already is a bonus. By default, you’re the spawn of a vampire and a human, but you can pay up the cost of another race to partially inherit their characteristics as your non-vampire parent."
25,,Free,Living Legend(Tier 1)       ,Fate/Strange Fake,Transformation,"You are Ghost Liner, also known as Servants under the Holy Grail War system. You are the manifestation of one of the Heroic Spirits engraved in human history. Even at your weakest, you are many more times more resistant, faster and stronger than any human not reinforced by magical energy, and find that any physical phenomena not coated with magical energy or mystery will not be able to hurt you, and even then, weak spellcasters of this era find it hard to affect you with magecraft. You are capable of entering a spiritual form in which your body becomes completely unable to affect or be affected by the physical world.

You may choose a legend, be it an actual historical figure or a more mythological one, even fairy tales, to incarnate in a class of your choosing. Each class has different strengths and weaknesses, as well as a few base ‘Skills’. See the Notes section for more information. You may choose any existing Servant that fits your tier, or create a new one that would fit the rules of summoning in this world. While you may choose demigods, those who called themselves gods while being mortal and avatars of gods who were human, you may not choose a full divinity with just this option alone. The potency of your legend and the power of your servant container is initially dependent on how much you decide to invest in this option.

For no cost, you may be a decently powerful Heroic Spirit. Depending on your legend, you could be decently powerful in combat, like one of the many Greek Heroes that act as side characters in the big legends, or be something like a Caster or Assassin with a quite fearsome trump card but being very subpar outside of that. Your name is lost among the many historical figures, so there is no much fame boost for you unless you are right there on your own homeland.

However, the fact that you are now a Ghost Liner, a manifested record from the greatest that mankind has seen, comes with some downsides as well. First and foremost, you require a link with a Master who supplies you with magical energy to exist, and also to draw the full use of your power. If you lose your Master, you will need to quickly find another Master, or a powerful source of mana to maintain your existence. How quickly depends on your own Skills and energy reserves when summoned, as Archers may remain for longer due to their Independent Action Skill, and Casters may also prolong their fading using some trick. Otherwise, you may need to resort to eating the souls of humans to maintain your form. Those of the 800 CP option may have some ways to remain existing even without this due to either a powerful Skill or Noble Phantasm, and other Servants such as experienced Casters may pull out something on the same effect, but without a Master or some other source of magical energy you will not be able to draw your full strength during this jump, unless you somehow manage to incarnate. After the end of this jump, you will be considered as having been incarnated and will not necessitate a Master or external supply to go all out and maintain your existence.

Additionally, Heroic Spirits have weaknesses related to their legends: if a specific tool was used to kill them, they will become extremely weak to them. This requires it to be something truly specific, like Heracles falling to the Hydra Venom, or the specific weapon that was used to befell you, such as Mordred dying to Rhongomyniad. But things like recreating the situation of one’s death may also prove to have a much greater effect on the Heroic Spirit, and if you were to cross paths with those that had already defeated you in your legend, or even killed you, it would take a lot to overcome that burden."
26,,Free,Common Destiny ,Records of Ragnarok Gauntlet (Humans),Transformation,"The Bond between mankind and Valkyiries is deeper than most divine beings. As such they are mankinds greatest ally in the coming Tournament. By entrusting your life to another, you become a Volund for them to wield. It will unleash not only your wielders full potential but the Volund you become will be a Weapon perfect for their fighting style. Volunds are able of harming and killing Gods and some are able to give their wielders special abilities. As such any ability you possess may be wielded by your wearer. With this Power... perhaps mankind stands a chance.

For this Jump the ability you can grant your wielder is under the same limitations as the Human Origins Greatest Quality Perk in that it cant be to versatile, an ‘instant win’ and must be something you possessed before taking the Gauntlet. Post Jump you may gift your wielder whatever power you possess with no restrictions other than the obvious fact that it is your power.

You may change partners at will as long as you are capable of making a connection with the next partner and break your bond whenever you like. If your bonded partner dies you will as well, due to your souls being connected. You will also feel their pain but not get injured like they are, instead reverting back to normal upon leaving Volund form.

Lastly... as this was a technique the Valkyries learned from Buddha, you may Post Jump become capable of teaching this Technique to others as well."
27,,Free,Valkyrie Physiology,Records of Ragnarok Gauntlet (Humans),Transformation,"As a Valkyrie you are a Demigod in flesh. It is only fitting that you posses some extraordinary capabilities. You can fly and your physical abilities far greater than any ordinary human. You are ageless, able to live forever. Only by violent means can you die which isn’t made easy. Much like a Gods body, your body can not be harmed by mortal weapons. However you can still be harmed by attacks from individuals with their unarmed superhuman strength and Items like Divine weapons and Volunds. Lastly, as it was your duty to guide souls to the afterlife, you may take a deceased human soul to transport to somewhere and enter and leave afterlives. The only place of death you couldn’t reach would be something akin to Niflhel which amounts to non existence."
28,,Free,Demi-human,Elden Ring - Liurnia of the Lakes,Transformation,"Among the Lands Between are those who resemble a fusion of man and beast, of which you are now a member. Perhaps you are one of the Man-Serpents found within Mt Gelmir, or you resemble one of the lupine protectors of myth and legend, or you are a fusion of something else entirely."
29,,Free,Albinauric,Elden Ring - Liurnia of the Lakes,Transformation,"An artificial race created by human hands and believed to live impure lives due to being untouched by the Erdtree’s grace. Whether you are counted amongst the first or second generation of these homunculi, the silver blood that flows through your veins make you naturally adept at sorcery."

32,,Free,Gummi Bear,Gummi Bears,Transformation,"You're a 2-4 foot tall brown, black, white or pastel-colored anthropomorphic bear. In spite of your size you are about as strong as an average human of your age range. You heal about ten times faster than a normal human does (a broken leg heals in a few days) and you can drink an unlimited amount of Gummi Berry juice without any issues. You are also really good at moving while bouncing and have a fantastic sense of smell.

Your species also has a reputation of just being fairytales in human-ran lands. Most humans have a leprechaun-like attitude to you and believe that if they catch you, you’ll grant wishes."
33,,Free,Archtree Inhabitant,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Transformation,"Though you possess stone scales, you are not considered one of the true Everlasting Dragons. You are, in reality, a drake, akin to a dog when compared to your eternal kin, but your size and strength, teeth and claws, as well as your elemental breath still allow you great power compared to those hollow beings seen roaming around, at least until they discovered Fire."
34,,Free,Cat,Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,Transformation,"You shouldn’t be surprised that this option is here given the hero in which our story follows. This option allows you to become a cat similar to Puss in Boots and Kitty Softpaws. Cats here retain all of the abilities associated with them and a few unique traits. For example, cats are able to stand straight on their back legs similar to humans. If you wish you may now become a cat similar to our heroes.

Thanks to the otherworldly powers at play on Earth, you aren’t even limited to what can be found on this planet- six-limbed mammals and bipedal insects are but some of the possibilities here. Your new form can be up to a large elephant in size, and can be any shape or color from the rainbow, within reason- it can have any number of limbs or other organic features within the confines of Earth, with no need to limit yourself by genus, species, or family; if you want to have the wings of an eagle, the pincers of a crab, and the body of a monkey, you are free to do this. You can have fur, feathers, skin, scales, chitin, etc. Feel free to get inventive, or use a design from an existing creature- such as a lava dog or the Kraken- as a basis for your design, though keep in mind that aside from your strange appearance your form doesn’t inherently break any laws of physics- wings on a horse will result in a horse that cannot fly, for example.

36,,Free,He’s A Toon,Who Framed Roger Rabbit,Transformation,"You have a Toon alt-form of your own design; it could be an animal, a human, or something stranger, so long as it’s roughy the size of a human. Toons are significantly more durable than humans; in fact, the only thing that can really harm them (that is commonly known) is Dip, a combination of turpentine, acetone, and benzene which burns through Toons like acid, killing them in a matter of seconds. Toons are also capable of strange, almost magical things like pulling objects out of nowhere, absurd feats of strength, agility, durability, and comedy, as well as many other inhuman abilities. Some Toons say that they can do pretty much anything as long as it’s funny… unfortunately for you, you’re not one of them. While you’re here you’ll enjoy the full benefits of being a Toon- minus fun based reality warping- but afterwards you’ll be significantly less durable. The full extent of your abilities will be outlined in the notes section.  

Toons have a wide variety of abilities, such as a Hammerspace for small tools, the ability to ignore gravity due to ignorance, an elastic, strong body, and more. (Basically, if it’s from an old timey cartoon and isn’t too far- fetched, you might be able to do it.) Post-Jump, your durability is based more on intent. You’re immune to damage from accidents, for one, but if someone means you harm they’ll still harm you as normal. If someone has no knowledge that you’re in their line of fire, you’ll be fine; if someone attacks your area, knowing you’re there but not wanting to hurt you, or don’t know you’re there but mean to destroy EVERYTHING that they aim at, you’ll be hurt as normal. Post-Spark, you’ll enjoy the full benefits of being a Toon, including fun-based reality warping, near immortality and incredible durability, and as a bonus you’ll also lose your weakness to Dip and similar substances."

You have no need to eat, breathe or defecate. You are unaging and can choose to have cosmetic physiological differences that can be useful, such as dog ears for better hearing and canine fangs or indestructible horns growing out of your hair, but they must be demonic in nature or related somehow to hell.

Yordles also have a greater empathic bond with others, but this is also a downfall of theirs  as extended periods of loneliness and isolation frequently cause them to develop psychopathic tendencies.

You might take a Troll's strength or size, a Fetch's ability to feed on terror, or even a Pixie's wings.

When selecting this origin, you may choose whether to start as an adult drake that dwarfs many of the monsters and wandering souls in these lands, or a fledgling drake. Fledgling drakes are much smaller and weaker, being roughly the size of a bear, but can actually fit through doors and will grow with age into a full-scale adult with time."

You may choose to be either a second-generation Albinauric, short and squat of form with a head like a grey frog, or one near-identical to human form externally.

Others, like certain wolf-men, seem to have anuncanny devotion to divine beings they serve-much like old legends claiming that wolves themselves as shadows of the Empyrean. Regardless, there’s certainly no end to the variety of such mishappen creatures-and while many of them form roaming, barbaric packs with little ambition beyond hunting and gathering, some like a certain talented seamster or Carian champion are civilised and driven as any man.

Of course, being denizens of the Wilds, they tend to have a few advantages over their more mundane counterparts. For one, they tend to be man-sized, or at least big and physically mighty enough to be capable of tearing a peasant apart if they were so inclined.

You have no requirements or ability to do bodily functions such as eating, drinking, sleeping or breathing. You have no organs to damage or blood to bleed. The only way to kill you would be to smash up your bones till nothing the size of a skull or larger remains.

You are enchanted so that, even despite lacking muscles or skin, you can move with superhuman strength and speed, as well as move and think at all. Whilst many lesser Nehekharan undead require the presence of a Liche Priest to maintain awareness and only have the most basic of personalities, you have no requirement for support from a Liche Priest and you maintain your full cognitive functions in this form. However, as you are just old bones, you are quite vulnerable to fire, despite the relative sturdiness of your form.

58,,Free,Soul Gem ,Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline,Transformation,"As part of your contract with Kyubey, your soul has been partially separated from your body. It is contained within a tiny gem with a color and aesthetic matching your personality and your wish...well, what WOULD have been your wish if you chose a background, or just a look that ‘fits’ for Drop-In. The benefits to this state are as follows:

Unaging - You do not physically age from the point of your contract onwards.

Magical Body - You can transform into a Magical Girl form by activating the Soul Gem, where it will rest on a part of your body either embedded onto your skin or as a piece of jewelry (it can remain in this form in your ‘civilian’ persona, as well). This creates a ‘projection’ around your physical form that is much more physically athletic and can take a lot of physical punishment with only some of the damage and the pain. Being knocked around or juggled by a powerful Wraith is still an unpleasant and painful experience, but you’d have a good chance of surviving the first few attacks instead of immediately dying like an ordinary person would. It’s in this form that you can use your Magic, detailed below. Even better? As long as your Soul Gem is still intact, you can use magical energy to regenerate your body even if you were just a smoldering pile of ash, though this takes time and is a huge drain on your resources - you’re more likely to disappear without a full ‘tank’ of energy ready than completely regenerate from a single cell. You will also be conscious through the entire experience, so...try not to get to that point.

Magical Girls, Represent! - As a bonus, your ‘transformed state’ has a neat costume and aesthetic of your choosing. It doesn’t change its function, but if you want to wear a pretty dress into battle or look like an armored knight of some kind, you can. Just note that what you choose remains the same unless you find another way to modify it.

That said, this isn’t all sunshine and pink dresses. There are some downsides.

No Wish For You - I’m holding onto that wish of yours until we’re finished with your chain. Believe me, it is not worth cashing in here.

Energy Requirements - Everything I explained above, and the Magic it powers, is a product of the Soul Gem. The Soul Gem only has so much energy to spend and for the duration of this jump, you can only regain energy by using the remnants of Wraiths after defeating them. While you generally won’t have to worry about this if you pick your fights wisely, using a huge amount of power or coming back from atomization will put you in the red fairly quickly. Your mood will also dampen and become increasingly manic and depressed the more severe your energy deficit is. This also ties into…

It’s Called a Soul Gem For A Reason You Moron - The Soul Gem literally houses your soul. If you’re separated from it (more than a small room’s distance would do it), your body will drop dead and start decomposing, utterly helpless until the Gem is returned to it. You have no motor control or awareness in the Soul Gem itself, to boot. What’s more, it’s amazingly fragile and if destroyed, will instantly kill you. Hm? You can survive this somehow? Then your Soul Gem will reform with you, but it will lose the same amount of energy needed to restore your body from the ground-up. You’ll need to ‘refill’ quickly.

Game Over - If your Soul Gem is destroyed (without some way to cheat death) or you exhaust all of your energy, you suffer the same fate as other Magical Girls and vanish from existence...although, in your case, you just go home safe and sound as if nothing happened. Thankfully, this only applies to this jump - I’ll get to alternatives and how things work onwards in a little bit.

59,,Free,Mankai Form ​,Yuki Yuna is a Hero,Transformation,"Every Hero has access to a powerful, but temporary form that completely changes their outfit, and super powers their weapon. In order to access it, one needs to build up energy by fighting Vertexes or hostile foes. You will be able to tell from a stamp somewhere on your clothes displaying a flower on it. The more flowers that bloom on the stamp and the more elaborate it gets, the more energy that has built up. Energy cannot be gained via training alone. This form is capable of destroying the bodies of the weaker Vertexes to expose the soul that dare to threaten humanity in a single strike and tearing into the outer shells of the strongest Vertexes. This form is also capable of growing different, but thematically fitting powers, such as a protective flowerbud holding two people in to protect them from the flames of atmospheric reentry. One may also be able to fly in this form. However, this form comes at a cost, called Sange.

See, all your power is borrowed from the god Shinju-Sama, and you must make a sacrifice to gain this power. When the form ends, you lose a part of your body or your mind. This can range from memories, to losing your sense of taste, to losing your eyesight in one eye. Thankfully, your outfit will change to accommodate for any physical losses so you won’t be affected by bigger sacrifices like losing the use of your legs, and your instincts will never leave you if you lose your memory. And post-jump, you will gain everything back and no longer need to give up any part of you to use Mankai.

It even comes with some handy dandy informational material in the app, such as the history of and how to fight the Vertex.

The dwarves recorded them as “beardless manlings we first thought to be children.” That description is not far off. As a halfling, you are only about three- to four-feet-tall, with the proportions to match. Most halflings, both male and female, oft have a beergut to match their desire for both good food and a comfortable life. I’ll leave that particular detail up to you. Their feet, large and hairy on the tops, are naturally thick-skinned and leathery - rendering boots and other forms of footwear redundant as they can even walk on broken glass or jagged mountainous trails without damage. This and their naturally quick fingers and quiet movement lend halflings a natural intuition at stealth and sneaking about - fitting with their lack of physical strength.

Lastly, halflings have a native resistance to magic, both beneficial and harmful. It is not to the same extent as dwarven near-immunity, but a fireball that would severely burn a human soldier will leave a halfling singed and momentarily blinded.

After your decade here is up, you may choose to have your halfling form available as an alternate form to transform into.

Amber: You bear the features of some animal whose aspect you favor. Perhaps instead of human hair, you have a wolf’s mane, or your fingers have become eagles’ talons.

Amethyst: Your body is as hairless and pale as a bleached skeleton, and your head most likely is as well.

Bright: Your face and arms are marked by crimson tattoos, which shift like flames when you cast, and your hair is likely bright red and actually aflame at the tips.

Celestial: Your eyes may glow a faint blue at all times. Not the most obvious of effects, but it is there.

Gold: It is likely that your experiments have led you with deep burns from fire and acid on your skin, but that is not the sort of thing that keeps a good Gold Wizard down. It is also possible that parts of your flesh have turned to solid gold.

Grey: You are likely lean and fit from your many wanderings, but otherwise this is the least conspicuous effect. Perhaps your face is a little too forgettable, even...

Jade: Rather than an obvious elemental manifestation of some sort, you may seem to be more ‘alive’ in general – at least during the spring and summer. More vibrant flesh, hair, and eyes reflect the increased life within you. Of course, you might wrinkle and wither somewhat during the fall and winter, but it is nothing too noticeable.

strength by their appearance, as their muscles and other similar features aren't
necessarily related to their physical prowess, as a slender girl can be far stronger
than this world’s bodybuilders, a massive muscle-man can still be as flexible and as
quick as a professional gymnast and an obese man can still be perfectly fit despite
his bad shape. By taking this perk, your physical appearance will no longer have any
bearing on your physical abilities or vice versa if you want to, as long as you have
previously achieved such abilities.
For example, if you have ever been an adult once, then you’ll have the physical
attributes and mental faculties of an adult member of your current race regardless of
your current biological or apparent age. This also prevents your abilities or faculties
from eroding due to your aging, allowing you to remain in your prime health and
condition even in old age. In a similar way, your musculature also isn’t directly
proportionate to your physical attributes, meaning it’ll be exactly as large and defined
as you want it to be without having any actual impact on your actual abilities, be it
positive or negative.
Lastly, as an added bonus, the physical traits you might have gained from any of
your perks will never negatively impact your appearance if you don't want them to,

To make up for this you receive +200cp for use on Embodiment of Fear only. You have a human’s physiology and appearance aside from your uniquely shaped head (whether this is horns, inhuman eyes, or whatever else is up to you).

This purchase grants you the powers of a devil. All devils can regenerate from anything short of death by drinking blood. The rate at which you regenerate depends on your race, with hybrids having the fastest and fiends the slowest. You can design your general powerset, appearance, and otherwise around your tier or make the choice to sacrifice some aspects for others, such as forgoing the parameter boosts in exchange for more potent abilities.

At the start of each Jump you have the option to adjust the effects of this perk to the setting or opt to keep things how they were in this world. For example, a Ninja Devil might be massively stronger in Naruto than they would here but choose to go back to this setting’s level when they visit a world without ninjas.

The first tier allows you to choose any obscure fear to represent such as the fear of tomatoes or pillows. You will be strong enough to take on most civilians and have a few unique characteristics related to your name but little in the way of supernatural powers or abilities. Any Devil Hunter worth their job title will be able to make short work of you, at least if they’re semi-prepared.

Cannot be Taken With Devil / Embodiment of Fear(Tier 1), or Hybrid / Embodiment of Fear(Tier 1)"

79,,50,Changeling(Little Guy),The Dresden Files,Transformation ,"One of your parents was a vanilla mortal. The other one was a Faerie straight out of the Nevernever, and now you're caught between both worlds. While you might look like a normal person, if maybe a bit of an odd one, you've got access to a lot of your faerie parent's power. That power comes at a cost, though: the more you call on, the more you'll be drawn towards their nature, until the point where you take all of it and you stop being a human permanently. So, which of the myriad creatures of the Nevernever did the deed? Depends on how much you want to spend.

You're the offspring of a human and a minor faerie, something like a Cobb, a Pixie, or a Sylph. Most of these guys are pretty tiny, so I'm not sure how this was physically possible, and quite frankly, I don't want the gory details. The powers your parents offer are pretty minor, and for the most part you won't notice them, but that also means they're a lot weaker at twisting your nature towards them. Plus, since most of these faeries are social creatures, odds are good that they actually hung around and were pretty supportive, at least in their limited way.

Your faerie parent was one of the Nevernever's common critters, something along the lines of a goblin, a troll, a gruff, or a nixie. Most of these guys are much stronger, faster, or more durable than people, which means you're going to start off as a heavy hitter, and they also have some other useful tricks to call on. Of course, given how handy these abilities are, you can expect to be regularly tempted to relinquish just a bit more humanity for one more trick for your repertoire. Most of these guys make terrible parents, so odds are you're not going to be unhappy they ran off.

Appears to be a plain sack of plain, albeit ornate, rocks. Some are marked with the body of a dragon, others with the dragon's head. You can grant a pair of these stones to your followers, those who travel the path of dragon worship. Through prayer, meditation with the stones and your teachings on dragon worship, they will eventually be able to pull on the power of the stones and transform into a partial dragon. They'll receive the equivalent of the ""Dragon's Body"" perk upon finally reaching this point, and the power to breath fire. Upon such time they will absorb the stones. There are sixteen stones total, and any ""spent"" ones will be replaced next jump. The transformation is irreversible through any normal means."
82,,50,Irregular Appearance,BlazBlue: Phase Zero,Transformation ,"Maybe it’s the magic in the air, but the people in this world all seem to be lookers of one kind or another. Some of them are also stylish motherfuckers, and that’s not accounting for things like unusual hair and eye color. I mean, Nine has pink hair, Terumi has green, and both have yellow eyes. It’s gotta be magic, right? Well, regardless of whatever fancy name the locals have given it, the fact of the matter is that you’re some combination of beautiful, stylish, and strikingly unusual in looks. Enough to stand out from all the normal people if nothing else."
83,,50,Celtic Thighs,Fate/Legends - Land of Shadows,Transformation ,"Legs that drive men to madness or eyes that look like living rainbows, people here don’t seem to
settle for less then the most outrageous bodies they can think of. There are great slabs of muscle
walking around as warriors, lithe young maidens performing magic as witches or perfectly
proportioned, divinely gorgeous young women teaching the arts of combat and dark magics to
warriors that can manage to find them. Just like all these characters, taking this option ensures you
have quite the wild and fantastic body to look at. This can be as simple as being very handsome or
beautiful or take a more classic look at things, adding many varied colours, new features and
fantastical traits, though none can be more than cosmetic."
84,,50,Grey Knight,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Transformation ,"Dost thou call ancestry back to great King Arthur? Or are you just another admirer obsessively
chasing that lost legend, enough to conduct strange rituals to get closer to them? The explanations
are many but the end result is the body you now possess, as either a doll or as in literal possession of
the body. In the visage of Arturia, this vessel was created, some believe to attempt to call her spirit
or powers into it for service in modern times. While that hasn’t worked out here, the vessel acts as
an exceptional container for willing spirits, able to hold a host of any power without penalty to body
or spirit within. It does have a tendency to impart certain traits of the King of Knights however, which may range from a growing fondness for honourable behaviour, a restrained expression of
emotions or even a bewildering and endless love for burgers. While only a cosmetic effect, the items
held by a host in this body can be restyled to fit into the aesthetics of the ancient Knight King if
desired. No import."

grant any abilities or superhuman powers with it.
Mirror can only modify the same person once during the same jump. Additionally, this
mirror can transform into a handheld version for travel convenience."
87,,100,Troyverse Physiology,A Mage of Sorothustra,Transformation,"This perk grants you absolute control over your fertility, your
attractiveness is boosted enough to at least make you an 8/10, you are perpetually clean, and
you gain an ability to learn languages spoken by others through physical touch. More intense
kinds of physical touch can grant you greater knowledge of languages, but we’re applying a very
loose definition to the phrase “more intense”. If you are giving someone a massage that is
considered “more intense”, as is engaging in an unarmed brawl, and, of course, dancing and
other fun activities can also be considered “more intense”. The other person doesn’t sense
anything supernatural when this occurs. You can also have hybrid children with others that
inherit the best possible traits from both parents (this effect tapers off and loses potency when it
comes to traits like Omega Sparks and Ascensions, not guaranteeing such effects but
somewhat boosting the odds children inherit those things when they are inheritable)."

appearance, giving you pitch black eyes and green,
black or ash grey skin from which the unarmed will

89,,100,Size Alteration,Rapturous Rhapsody Jump,Transformation,"There are a variety of beings with the ability to shift their size at will. Size Alteration
allows you to shrink down for stealthy movement or grow larger for intimidating combat
purposes. This ability also affects your mass, enabling you to hit much harder when you
increase your size. Conversely, when you shrink down, you'll typically become much
faster and more agile. Initially, you can alter your size by a factor of ten, but with
practice and training, you can enhance this skill even further."

keep them happy. With just a touch, you are able to alter any other being in a very specific pair of
ways. First, you are able to switch their gender between being male or female at will and second, you are able to make them a much more attractive version of themselves or stay the same during
this switch. Using this, you can turn an ugly brute into a beautiful young girl or just into a female
version of what he already was. There is no drop or lessening of their abilities because of these
changes. "

side of the gender line too. Not only that but these effortless good looks really are as effortless as
they seem. You don’t need to spend any time at all in the morning preparing, you’ll find yourself
looking, smelling and feeling just as good waking up as if you’d spent a few hours at a luxury spa

94,,100,Mortal Monsters,Greek Mythology,Transformation,"Living disasters and plagues most likely born from Echidna and Typhon or
perhaps born from mortal and beasts, you may even be the product of the gods whether
because of a curse or actually being a child of said god. Allowed to live by the gods “mercy” to
act as challenges against the “heroes” and champion that the gods will most likely send to hunt
you down, or they may simply allow you to live to torment an area that spited them (then wait for
you to be killed by a hero)."
95,,100,Blessed with a Curse,Demon Slayer,Transformation,"You know, in another life, you might be rather bitter about what's
become of you; forced to hide from the sun, to hunt what was once your fellow man to sustain yourself, to
live in fear of the Demon Slayers...but honestly? Not having to worry about your own moral high ground can
be really liberating. So, you're making the most of it no matter how atrocious an action would be to your
""moral code"" (something which doesn't usually survive long in a demon's life), you feel no qualms about it,
and the universe doesn't seem to find it so unusual either. Your brand of villainy is karmically neutral, for
when that matters. As a Demon, you possess a regeneration factor that increases in speed with age and power. Even as a newborn, you are functionally immortal, the sun and wisteria being your only weaknesses, and your strength already surpasses even newly initiated Demon Slayers.

Should you reach the power of an Upper Moon, you'll be matched only by Hashira who've unlocked the Demon Slayer crest, and you'd be capable of leveling buildings with a single blow, and regenerating limbs as soon as they are severed.

Similar to the Upper Moons, while you might have incredible control over your urges, that doesn't change the fact you're no longer human. You will find nothing wrong with eating others and inflicting pain, and will find yourself increasingly eager to do so the longer you go without."
96,,100,My Purpose,Demon Slayer,Transformation,"You're not just a demon, you're a demon who retained their humanity - which,
in this world, is an amazingly rare thing. The willpower to resist even the most instinctual cravings takes
focus, of course; you have something, whether it be a bond with another individual, a personal ideal you
held before your transformation, or a deep essential innocence, that pushes you to overcome the seemingly
impossible obstacle of self-control required to live alongside humans as a demon without devouring them
on sight. For those without such cravings, well, a strong mind is still a useful thing to have... Unfortunately, the sun is still quite fatal without requisite perks.

Note: Requires Blessed with a Curse."
97,,100,The Golden Man,Worm CYOA v17,Transformation,"You can transform your body into a solid gold-like form that is both sturdy and weighty. Despite your external appearance, your physical characteristics are vastly different from that of a soft metal, possessing considerable strength and durability, making you highly resilient to damage. This power allows you to withstand physical attacks and emerge unscathed, but it also renders you susceptible to being overly weighed down by your newfound weight and mass, hindering your mobility and agility. Nonetheless, this power grants you immense strength and endurance, giving you an edge in hand-to-hand combat and enabling you to withstand formidable amounts of punishment."
98,,100,Daymare,Worm CYOA v17,Transformation,"You can enter a Changer state based on the fears of people around you. You can remake this form without leaving it. The greater and more primal the fear around you, the more powerful the form. Power level is based on total fear, more people will mean more fear, and thus a more powerful form."

100,,100,Change Size,Worm CYOA v17,Transformation,"You can change the size of any inorganic object you touch, and changes are permanent. The size you can change an object to ranges from the size of an ant to the size of a car, and you cannot affect objects that are already outside this range. Mass is not changed, and you may undo this change at will."
101,,100,Null,Worm CYOA v17,Transformation,"You can fly at 15 miles per hour and can phase through matter. However, when in this state, you cannot interact with anything except light. You cannot talk, you cannot hear, you can only see and be seen. Useful, if you can lip read or need to get somewhere secure. You do not need air in this state."
102,,100,Griffin Hybrid,The Witcher Novels,Transformation,"There's a reason no mad zoologist had the half-baked idea to splice the genes of an Archgriffin and Royal Griffin. Not that it matters, however, as you are now the culmination of such research.

Do you wish to replace them with sex and the erotic energies drawn from it? ...well, you don't have a choice, now do you? While you don't crave blood and flesh like most monsters, you feast on humans all the same, killing them with exhaustion if you aren't careful. Like all incubi (or succubi!) you possess latent sexual talents, a beautiful form (the goat legs are a plus), and the ability to wring out whatever your partner has left, regardless of their fatigue. Oh, as well as bone-crushing strength and weak pyrokinesis. "

Forming a major part of the Elder Races​ (along with ​dwarves​ and ​gnomes​), those known as ​Aen Seidhe came to the Continent on their white ships much earlier than humans, but later than the other Elder Races. Like most elves in fiction, they are characterized by their attractive appearance, long lifespan, and magical aptitude.

height for the human sized races, and appropriately more for Hollow forms, plus the natural
strength that comes with such size. It gives a certain intimidating factor to your presence, towering
over almost everyone, but you can show a gentle side when the need comes. If you’re not hostile to
others, your size won’t make them scared of you. In fact, it’s easier than ever to see the kind soul
that lies beneath your outer looks."
107,,100,Good Looking,Naruto,Transformation,"Kaguya, Minato, Madara, Kakashi--what do they all have in common? A stunning appearance, of course! Your appearance is now an 11/10, making you among the most beautiful people in this world. This also comes with a free appearance change to your choice."
108,,100,Professionally Designed Avatar,Bofuri,Transformation ,"You’ve got a great-looking avatar! And because the VR technology here uses the real appearance of the user for the avatar, that means you have a great-looking body! In addition to the boost to your appearance, you get a one-time redesign of your body. This rework is retroactive, so your friends and family don’t freak out. And the retroactivity means you won’t be clumsy from having the wrong limbs, and you’ll feel comfortable in your body. You get a redesign for each new form you get. It can’t change species though.

And if you want to go maximum anime with your hair and eyes, feel free. Your hair and eyes will be considered “normal” and “acceptable” in all situations. (I mean, if you’re trying to sneak around and have a massive shock of white hair, your friends will probably ask you to cover it up because it’s still a massive shock of obviously white hair in the middle of a forest or whatever.)

You’re also always perfectly clean and healthy, as those avatars don’t have a model for getting dirt stuck to them or looking ill."
109,,100,The Drifting Iron Body,Cradle V1,Transformation ,"This iron body involves undergoing a process to weaken gravity's hold on the body, making you lighter. The normal transformation process involves being woven into a silken cocoon made by refiners from plants that grow among the clouds. It feels like being suspended among hundreds of pillows for several hours a day over many weeks"
110,,100,Hidden Spring Iron Body,Cradle V1,Transformation ,"This Iron body allows the user to maintain large amounts of water. So-called because they can go a long time without drinking water, so the idea is that they have a ""hidden spring"" inside their bodies and they never have to drink at all."
111,,100,The Golden Sun,Egyptian Mythology,Transformation ,"All gods age gracefully, but some truly become otherworldly as the centuries pass. You are possessed of immense longevity: the centuries are as years to you, and though there is still a gradual aging, you never wither away into a decrepit state. Your body transmutes into one of living precious metals and gemstones as the decades pass, gradually turning more and more of your body into a brilliant walking and living idol. Silver bones, golden flesh, and hair of lapis are the marks of the sun god Ra, thought the precious materials which make up your body might be gemstone eyes, onyx hair, platinum skin and bones of amber, or some other combination which pleases you."
112,,100,A God’s Body,Egyptian Mythology,Transformation ,"The gods are known for being more than ordinary in many ways. Their voices are like thunder, the evening rain or the chime of bells. Their appearances may be flawless in their complexion and sweat sweet perfume or incense, or terrible as the jaws of a lion. You gain a body as that of the gods, imbued with great beauty or a fearsome appearance (or both).

On purchase of this perk you gain up to three altforms which you can change into at will. Each of these three new forms may be:
• A human form (either like your normal human form in appearance, or a new human body), with optional cosmetic changes to your features, such as green or blue skin, or hair made of feathers.
• A theriocephalic form, with an animal head and a human body. This animal may be one native to these lands, or may be an imaginary type of animal (such as in the case of Set).
• An animal form, with optional changes to coloration or patterning, such as a falcon with brilliant blue wings or a specific marking around its eyes.
• A hybrid body of multiple animal and/or human parts, such as a snake with human legs, a lion with a scorpion’s tail, or a leopard with a falcon’s wings and the head of a human sprouting from its back, a cobra with a human’s beard, leopard with a snake neck, or something even stranger.

You may take this perk multiple times. Purchases beyond the first are undiscounted, each purchase granting three more altforms.

113,,100,Monstrous Body ,Percy Jackson and the Olympians,Transformation ,"Ah, I see that you are one of monsterkind. Yours is a hated species, often seen as the underlings of dark forces, if not formidable forces on their own. Monsters such as yourself tend to range from a humanoid to completely inhuman form, although it is noted that most humanoid monsters tend to have some sort of tell that they are inhuman (such as cloven feet or snakes for hair). With your starting body here you can be any existing monster in this setting so long as their maximum size is that of twenty feet long and/ or wide. Any existing supernatural powers that each species possess must be bought with the following perks below, however. In addition, while monsters have the ability to respawn after death within the Underworld, doing so with this perk alone will be considered death for the purposes of a Chain."
114,,100,Tuireann’s Rod,Irish Mythology,Transformation ,"A druid’s wand. Whomever you strike with it, yourself included, turns into whatever animal you were last thinking of. Struck again, they revert to their true form, making this also a good way of breaking transformative curses."
115,,100,Blood of Osraige,Irish Mythology,Transformation ,It is said the kings of this small kingdom could take the form of wolves whenever they wished. There are conflicting sources on whether they physically transformed or ran as wolves in spirit while their bodies slept. We’ll just say you can do both.

Your escape, your escape, your escape...you can only get out by eating them. The others you come across, their flesh, their bones, their organs - the key to your deliverance lies within. To facilitate this, you move faster - especially in the dark when vulnerable prey cannot spot your arrival - and your limbs have become bladed implements of death, strong enough to tear apart rock and bone and skin, your hide a wall that blades can barely penetrate and even what damage you do suffer is heavily mitigated. You will find your freedom, you have to."
117,,100,Faces Of The Vessel ,Slay the Princess,Transformation ,"Are we really doing this? ...Fine, fine! But you'll see, when this inevitably blows up in your face, that your shortsighted focus on more and more power was completely meaningless and we would have all been much better off if you had just focused on slaying. the. Princess. Sigh. Anyways, with that out of the way and without further adieu: A voice, thousands of them, no - even more than that. A vast multitude of voices and personal flicker through your mind all at once and you realize that on one level, they are you, but on another level, one just as deeply rooted as your personal existence, they are also all of the potential shapes that people can fit you into. Everyone's perceptions bonsing in that uniquely bizarre manner that such things do and creating a mold into which you can slide yourself into, a shape whose predefined abilities and limitations are determined only by what people believe you to be in that specific moment."
118,,100,Ruffled Feathers,Slay the Princess,Transformation ,"Oh for the love of-Must everything here be some sort of jab at my expense? ...Sigh, nevermind. In case the name didn't clue you in (and I wouldn't be surprised), this allows for the personification of our thoughtform ‘essence’ into a shape perceivable by those we inhabit. In our case, we appear as a bird and no - I cannot give you a good reason as to why. Just know that this is what happens and there's no changing that. Now this effectively helps when we need to be more ‘direct’ I suppose, it makes us something that appears concrete and of substance but like in all things relating to us, it is...ephemeral, insubstantial. We are just echoes of things long passed and so even such a form as this is as much a thought as it is something real. The best I can say about it is that it works well if you must speak plainly and give a face to yourself for someone who would be less than thrilled at a simple voice in their head."
119,,100,Growth        ,Final Fantasy XI,Transformation ,"Normally the wyvern companion raised by a dragoon will take decades to grow larger than a dog, you however know a few techniques to shorten that time an maximise the growth of your pet, which is saying something since dragons can grow extremely large as it is. Within your time here your wyvern will grow large enough for a pair of large humans to comfortably ride. You could also choose to use this knowledge on other creatures as well but it works best on reptiles."
120,,100,Fusion        ,Dies Irae,Transformation ,"Certain Ahnenerbe possess unique properties with their wielder, a closer connection that allows the wielder to utilise them in a surprising way. Taking this option turns your Relic into a fusion-type Relic. This allows you to summon the Relic as part of your own body, even in multiple instances at once. A single long sword Relic for example, that is turned into a Fusion-Type could be made to extend from many points on your body and turn yourself into a porcupine.

121,,100,Demihuman,80s Sword and Sorcery,Transformation ,"Perhaps you’re a giant, standing a foot taller than a man with greater strength. Perhaps you’re an elf with better than human senses, long life, and improved dexterity. Perhaps you’re a dwarf, or a pigman, or a viking... Used for strength will be somewhat behind Mighty Thews, though this would be the base for your species as opposed to slightly above peak, and combined with Mighty Thews would be stronger, and this would likely give you other miscellaneous advantages (such as larger size and the increased reach which comes with it, resistance to alcohol, improved night vision, increased stamina, etc).

The advantages of this perk are capped at approximately the level of those granted by a race designed for PC use in D&D being relatively minor benefits."
122,,100,Born With It,The God of High School Jump,Transformation ,"You’re one heckuva big guy, even if you’re a God you tower over most of your brethren. Built like a brick shithouse and at least twice the height of any other adult male around you, if it was a contest of just raw muscle power, and not bringing in supernatural powers or training, you’d be pretty much sure to win against any other man on earth. This doesn’t just apply to your form here, if you want to you can give this proportional increase in size to any form or body you are able to take on."
123,,100,Hybrid / Embodiment of Fear(Tier 1),Chainsaw Man,Transformation ,"You are a unique being, a human capable of turning into a Devil whether through experimentation, accident, or a contract of some sort. You have a physical trigger that activates your hybrid form, whether it’s a pin on your neck or something odd like a wind-up toy’s key. It takes a lot to put you down and you can regenerate from more damage than even devils and fiends. However, being in devil form will passively drain your energy and blood (this can be reduced with training or by constantly drinking blood).

This purchase grants you the powers of a devil. All devils can regenerate from anything short of death by drinking blood. The rate at which you regenerate depends on your race, with hybrids having the fastest and fiends the slowest. You can design your general powerset, appearance, and otherwise around your tier or make the choice to sacrifice some aspects for others, such as forgoing the parameter boosts in exchange for more potent abilities.

At the start of each Jump you have the option to adjust the effects of this perk to the setting or opt to keep things how they were in this world. For example, a Ninja Devil might be massively stronger in Naruto than they would here but choose to go back to this setting’s level when they visit a world without ninjas.

The first tier allows you to choose any obscure fear to represent such as the fear of tomatoes or pillows. You will be strong enough to take on most civilians and have a few unique characteristics related to your name but little in the way of supernatural powers or abilities. Any Devil Hunter worth their job title will be able to make short work of you, at least if they’re semi-prepared.

At the start of each Jump you have the option to adjust the effects of this perk to the setting or opt to keep things how they were in this world. For example, a Ninja Devil might be massively stronger in Naruto than they would here but choose to go back to this setting’s level when they visit a world without ninjas.

The second tier grants you a more significant fear and one or two useful and decently powerful abilities on the physical side. Things like the fear of bats or leeches are included. You can bring down small buildings with your best attacks and are a tough fight for inexperienced Devil Hunters.

125,,100,Disguise Potions,Elantris,Transformation ,"Brewed by a Hrovell alchemist, these three vials contain a powerful Invested concoction that can alter the appearance of whoever should imbibe it. By default, these potions replicate the effects of the Shaod, causing the drinker to lose their hair and develop sickly black bruises over their now-gray skin. Given how those who undergo the Shaod are forsaken by society, this could be an effective way at eliminating a pesky rival. Just be warned that the change will wear off after five days.

Alternatively, you may choose to receive three doses of a potion that causes another severe change in physical appearance. This change can’t alter one’s physiology, but so long as the desired appearance is humanoid, these potions offer a reliable way to produce drastic, temporary transformations."
126,,100,Monster,Solo Leveling,Transformation ,"Turns out you are not even human! No, you are one of the beings that populate the other world that the Gates lead into. You are a monster, whatever race and what your strength is up to you, but you must choose inside the limits of your chosen rank. An E-Rank monster could be a mere small goblin or skeleton, but an A-Rank monster could be a being as mighty as a High-Orc or a Death Knight. For reference, monsters are usually more powerful than humans on their same Rank, so barring special equipment and team-work, a monster would have higher chances of winning against a human that ranked in the same category, given that their bodies are more used to magic, and thus boast superior physical and magical abilities and special racial abilities, and even their weakest are impossible to defeat by regular humans.

You can decide whether you awake in one of the Monarchs’ pocket dimensions with the rest of their armies, or inside one of the dungeons that plague the Earth, that has just broken a few hours ago, is convenient for you. As you were never a prisoner of the Rulers, you are not subjected to their mental command to harm humans, nor are you an automatic enemy of the other monsters, but that doesn’t mean that any of those groups besides those of your same kin will have any special liking to you. And you shouldn’t provoke the ire of your Monarch progenitor, if you value your life.

Note: You start at the level of a D Rank Monster, or what you would best compare to, whichever is higher. You can train to increase this if you wish. "
127,,100,Devilish Form: Unnatural Monster,Avesta of Black and White,Transformation ,"The Dagravant, and specially the Daeva, often take more monstrous forms that seem to defile the good order of things just by existing. From tentacled monsters as large as hills, to small dragonoids and basically any kind of thing that you may imagine. You may also now create your own form for this jump, following whatever design that you wish for."
128,,100,The Head’s Definition(Tier 1),Library of Ruina: HamHamPangPang,Transformation ,"The City is host to tons of things that don’t look or even act human by most definitions, the tailors of the Carnival are humanoid externally but under their robes and masks they are closer to silkworms than anything, full-body prosthetics are a common sight among those who use them as an upgrade for whatever their job may be or after selling their natural body for some quick money, even the Bloodfiends who are vampires in all but name count as human. Most notably there are the Sweepers, liquified people within special suits who use heated hooks to kill and absorb their victims into tanks of flesh on their backs which they use as fuel, hard to kill but normally seen as nuisances to Fixers and Syndicates, but to anyone else in the Backstreets, they are effectively a curfew since Sweepers do what they are named for every night during what is effectively a nightly martial law. But the Head still says they’re human so at least you’re not getting declared an Impurity?

Pay 100 CP for weaker distortion abilities(up to an Urban Legend), regular Sweepers, and beings like the Carnival, this is free if you pick the Distortion origin."
129,,100,Andrea’s Touch,Final Fantasy VII: Remake,Transformation ,"True beauty is an expression of the heart, beyond notions of gender. Jenova was referred to as male, female, or neither across history. Perhaps you have their malleable biology. Or perhaps you just use fashion and makeup to maximum effect. Either way, you can change your appearance to look masculine, feminine, or androgenous. You can also apply these makeover skills to others, though without a separate method of physically transforming them, you’ll be limited to using more mundane tools to alter their appearance."
130,,100,Sea Person,Kurohime,Transformation ,"You’re a finned humanoid person of the same origin as Otohime of the Dragon Palace. You are unaging, and will live forever unless you are killed. You are capable of breathing water as easily as air. You don’t swim quite as well as a mermaid, but are still better at swimming than a human could hope to be, and are significantly better off than a mermaid when on land. Sea life is able to converse with you, will never willingly attack you, and will overall do as you command."
131,,100,HIDDEN,Final Fantasy VII,Transformation ,"When the Crisis from the Sky first descended onto the Cetra, it approached them with the face of friends and family before unleashing its true nature. You have acquired a similar ability, now able to shapeshift your body's appearance to that of any other member of your current species. This also makes you a terrifyingly effective actor, letting you pretend to be someone else with ease, though this doesn't provide memories or context if you're imitating someone in particular. Also, drastic mutations or changes in form aren't included here – you're still changing into whatever species your current form is."
132,,100,DRIVE,Final Fantasy VII,Transformation ,"Most lifeforms are a byproduct of many individual cells together forming a cohesive whole. Each cell performs its individual function automatically, without regard to the rest of the body that is irrelevant to its function. You are something...different. Instead of being a single 'whole', your being is spread out across each individual cell in your body, your cells and body responding to your thoughts and will. Each cell responds to your desires with a simple mental command. Will yourself to heal a wound, your wounds will close a bit more quickly than if you let them heal automatically. Squint to see a distant target and your vision will sharpen a noticeable amount. So long as it is possible for them to perform in the first place, your cells will respond to your commands as best they can, though by itself this merely makes your body more efficient and responsive to your conscious desires. Your mind and body will always act in harmony with one another, opening up many interesting possibilities to what you can accomplish."
133,,100,Unusual Biology,Final Fantasy VII,Transformation ,"Maybe you're not really part of human stock in the first place? You may be some sort of bizarre mix of a beast with cat and dog-like features and a flame on your tail. You may be some sort of disfigured Mako mutant or creature. You might even be a sapient Chocobo or a real-live Moogle! Keep in mind some of these don't come with the ability to speak. You may designate yourself as a monster or a unique creature in this world, though aside from some natural weapons and new physical capabilities, you don't start off any stronger than a human with the base abilities of Still More Fighting. Also, being something as gigantic or powerful as WEAPON is off the table. Post-jump, whatever you chose for this perk becomes an altform."
134,,100,Little and Furry,Legends of Runeterra,Transformation ,"Most inhabitants of Bandle City are... fun sized, at the very least. You may not be, but it doesn’t matter. You gain the ability to magically reduce your own height."
135,,100,Vastaya ,Legends of Runeterra,Transformation ,"Vastaya are the descendants of an ancient race of spiritual beings with power over nature. In modern times, the Vastaya are humanoid people with animal traits. Depending on the animal traits they possess, they could have an increased affinity with magic or animalistic strength, speed and agility."
136,,100,Golem,Legends of Runeterra,Transformation ,"Golems are magically animated statues (or magictech robots if you’re from Piltover) that come in a variety of shapes or forms. They’re usually not very smart, programmed for a limited number of actions and nothing more, but that’s not the case for you."
137,,100,Minotaur,Legends of Runeterra,Transformation ,"The minotaurs of Runeterra are big, powerful humanoid with bull’s heads. They’re common pretty much anywhere, but are especially numerous in the legions of Noxus."
138,,100,Yordle,Legends of Runeterra,Transformation ,"Short, usually furry but always with big ears, yordles are the inhabitants of Bandle City, even if you can find them pretty much anywhere on Runeterra. What they lack in height they balance with sharp minds and the ability to perform yordle magic."
139,,100,Kull ,Inheritance Cycle,Transformation ,"You are among the tallest and most powerful of the Urgals, the Kull, standing above eight feet tall on average and have legs like a tree trunk. Other races beside Urgal that buy this, will be at greatest height of what their race is capable of with a similar increase in physical ability."
140,,100,Fairy,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Transformation ,"Even the Servant Universe doesn’t see this kind of thing too often. A Fairy-based Servant, instead of any kind of human or animal. A weak one to be sure but that still has quite a few useful effects. Fairies are more physically gifted than humans, have an ability to easily connect with nature or planets around them and can even utilise magical energy without the use of magic or magecraft. These Divine Patterns let fairies create magical effects through intent, though at a much greater cost than a skilled magician might do the same thing. Normally, it’d even out since strong fairies have so much magical energy but it looks like any stronger fairy options have been delayed here. You do find your eyes able to easily separate most truths from lies, a trait known as Fairy Eyes, helping to pierce through illusions and falsehoods."
141,,100,Cosmo Cat,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Transformation ,"Of the many family classifications of the Servant order, the Homid family is by far the biggest. But here and there, others exist. The Felidae family, of mischievous spectral kitties or the Canidae family of everything from magical doggy trackers to charming vulpine illusionists. Having been born or made into one, you’ve gained the traits of one of the many animalistic classifications of Servants. Whatever kind of animal you choose, you’ll take on superficial traits like ears and tails from them, along with significantly increased physical attributes to fit. A Cat Servant might leap about as fast as many orbital vehicles and slip through many attacks with ease, while a hulking Bear Servant could be known as a starship wrecker if they get close. 

Most animal Servants have a minor power fitting their kind, as long as they suit a special condition fitting to the animal. Cats can go invisible as long as they’re hungry, whereas a bird might briefly move fast enough to teleport when wet and in need of quick shelter. "
142,,100,Jotunn(Mythical),God Of War (2018),Transformation ,"A Jotunn!? Here I thought you were all hiding in Jotunheim, waiting for Ragnarok to come. You were a relatively peaceful lot though some of your kind are great, such as Laufey and Jormungandr. Be careful to not be found by the Aesir for they will surly torture you to find a way to enter Jotunheim. Not all Giants are giant and should you choose the free option you would be similar to Laufey, far shorter than the average giant but still possessing enough power to fight against a minor Aesir with relative ease. For 200 CP you are a greater giant around the size of Thamur (or Sutr), though possessing a greater gift for combat than your smaller brethren, having the potential to require several realms to come together in order to kill you. You also receive a discount on the Divine Physiology perk. The 300 CP option would have you become something similar to the World Serpent, a monstrous giant that is closer to a beast than anything else. Your power would allow you to fight against greater Aesir like Baldur and Thor and potentially win, should you go all out. Choose an animal found in nature such as a snake or a wolf, and your form would be a ludicrously sized version of that beast. You receive the 200 CP Divine Physiology perk free, you can also pick a natural weapon such as venom and have it be strong enough to kill the Gods themselves.

143,,100,Charismatic Transformation,Thailand Mythology and Folklore,Transformation ,"Supernatural beings can sometimes have... unfortunate appearances. There’s no need to worry however, as you’ve learnt a specific technique that is oddly common among the likes of ogresses. Specifically, this lets you shapeshift into a human form (and a very pretty human form at that) indefinitely. Your powers and might will be mostly restricted in this form should your true countenance be too inhuman, but it doesn’t take more than a thought to return to your true form. Even if you’re not naturally ugly, this could help beings such as mermaids walk on land, or birdmen to prowl unseen within human cities. It does not help ghosts very much, however. This gives you a human form, not a human body. Additionally, you can teach this technique to others, in case you ever feel like doing so in the future. It’s a technique after all, not some kind of innate power. As a side note, the details of one’s appearance when using this technique varies by person, generally being somewhat recognizable as the same person if their true form isn’t too ugly or simply has some inhuman feature and looks fine otherwise, such as mermaids.

Note: Comes with Phi Form of Your Choice"
144,,100,Change,DxD Universe,Transformation ,"You are pretty talented when it comes to changing forms, while for normal dragons it would take it for somebody in the level of the dragon kings to actually change to a human form you were able to do it since you were born, who knows how far you can take this ability."
145,,100,Guide of Naraka,Asura’s Wrath,Transformation ,"You gain a secondary form that of a golden spider. You gain the ability to visit Naraka, the space between the living world and the engine of reincarnation, dangling from a single spool of divine spider silk. When inside Naraka, you may manipulate souls who are attempting to climb the infinite towers and return to their lives, rendering them your cats­paws.

Finally, when in this state your voice takes on an eery intonation that subliminally influences a subject's emotional state. The spider­form also helps you think up armor­piercing questions and baffling koans.

You cannot spend more than 24 hours in Naraka. If you do, you must climb out as described in Tower of Naraka."
146,,100,Greek Monster,God of War,Transformation,"There are numerous monsters to be found in the annals of mythology, from the simple to the downright bizarre. As such, you will now have the freedom to design your current form however you desire. From centaurs to hydras to chimeras to just a human with horns, there’s a lot you can do with this. After your time here, your chosen look will be another Alt-Form for you to access whenever you desire."
147,,100,Form of the Beasts,God of War,Transformation,"Tales often tell of the gods' many exploits, and none more so than Zeus' escapades with mortals. Oftentimes, in the form of an animal. You seem to have a similar ability, capable of taking on the forms of five different animals, from mammals to fish to insects to everything in between. Hopefully you use this ability in a kinder manner than the King of the Gods."
148,,100,Obviously Terrifying,Hades,Transformation,"Not all godly beings are born with a face fit to be the envy of any mortal who sets eyes on them. Chthonic entities can be truly alien in their appearance, even horrifying if Charon the Boatman is any indication. You will share his fate though your visage will be terrifying to behold in a way unique to you. It will send small children scrambling and crying, cause women to gasp, and even make the bravest of men shudder to behold you."
149,,100,Nature's Blessing,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Transformation,"When you were younger you were part of a ceremony where you bonded with an animal spirit, and had it become part of you. This bond had some effect on your growth, as you gained some traits from the creature. For example, someone with a rabbit spirit or a deer spirit would both likely be quick, but the one with a rabbit spirit would likely be smaller, and the one with a deer spirit would likely be larger than if they did not have a bond at all.

As a secondary effect of this, you will be able to momentarily take on the form of your bonded spirit. While in this form, the spirit will take the damage that would be dealt to you. The spirit will be generally unharmed by mundane attacks; as due to their nature, they are above the petty physical world."
150,,100,Magical Hair ,Out of Context: Disney Princess Supplement,Transformation,"You have control over your hair allowing you to freely alter, grow out, regenerate, reshape, shorten, shape and clean it at will as well as weave it into different shapes and styles of hair cut."
151,,100,Troll ,Elden Ring - Liurnia of the Lakes,Transformation,"In the ancient war with the Fire Giants, your people sided with those of the Golden Order. Though many have been reduced to emancipated, mindless brutes, you are one of the rare few that have retained your mind. Possessing great strength and durability, your kind are naturally adept smiths and artisans."
152,,100,Otherworldly Lord ,Elden Ring - Liurnia of the Lakes,Transformation,"A race of ancients with stone skin who are said to have risen to life when a meteor struck long ago. Regardless whether you are Alabaster or Onyx, your innate power over the forces of gravity is impressive to say the least, which is only heightened should you delve into mastering gravitational sorceries."
153,,100,Crystalian,Elden Ring - Liurnia of the Lakes,Transformation,"A being that is seemingly made entirely of glintstone, your kind have only one known purpose; safeguarding those very crystals until your end. As one might expect, not only are you incredibly durable, but you have a nearly unmatched aptitude for glintstone sorceries and magic related to the primeval current."
154,,100,Beast,Elden Ring - Liurnia of the Lakes,Transformation,"The Lands Between is filled with all manner of beasts, and you are proud to be counted amongst their number. For [Free], you are a relatively normal beast, such as a tumbling ram or spirit jellyfish, though one no larger than an average horse. By paying [100], you are something greater, an equal to the Beast Regent Serosh, the Red Wolf of Radagon, or even a Rune Bear."
155,,100,Were-form ,Outlaw Star,Transformation,"It’s your time of the month. Specifically, transformation time. You have the capability of assuming a stronger, more animalistic form at the cost of being much more energy intensive, allowing for feats you’d think impossible otherwise. The intensity of Ctarl-Ctarl transformations are based upon that of the phases of the moon, but there have been others noted in other species."
156,,100,Spiritual Presence(300),Godbound,Transformation,"Insubstantial supernatural beings, the spirits of this world come in three makes. Elementals are non-sentient accretions of magical power linked to their place of origin. Eidolons are intelligent beings related to the undead, guardians of the places marred by significant deaths. And Animas are artificial spirits, ones created by theurgy or theotechnical engineering for forgotten roles. You yourself now have the qualities of spirit, being normally insubstantial but able to inhabit an appropriate material shell with some effort. Eidolons tend to possess humans while Elementals shape a lump of the appropriate material or energy, and Anima are normally bound to a certain created body. 

For 200 CP you are a weak spirit by this world’s reckoning possessing a few lesser Gifts of one Word which along with your inherent abilities make you dangerous to humans, but never to Godbound. For 300 CP you are considered bound to one Word and deft enough to give a Godbound some challenge.

For 300 CP you are considered bound to one Word and deft enough to give a Godbound some challenge. For 400 CP in addition to that Word at your beck and call, your might and swiftness could give a group of Godbound a good fight. In addition to all the above you can gain some power through worship if you fancy setting yourself up as a false god, though the amount gained is much smaller compared to that of a Godbound or Parasite God.

158,,100,Palette Swap,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Transformation,"You have access to eight different appearances, which you may freely switch between. The first is your current, “default” appearance. The other seven appearances may either be your current appearance, but in a different colour palette, or they may be another distinct appearance which you had in the past. All additional appearances will be roughly equivalent in size to your “default” appearance. All of these appearances are identical in power; they are purely an aesthetic change. Should you choose to somehow take on one of the additional seven appearances without using this power, you will still be treated as having switched to that appearance. This means that if you chose an appearance based on a specific mode or transformation you had access to, you would be able to be in that form whilst retaining your usual look by using this power after the transformation.

Once per jump, you may rechoose what the seven additional appearances are, whether colours or other distinct appearances. Post-chain, this becomes once every ten years."
159,,100,Humanoid,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Transformation,"This option allows you to design a humanoid form for yourself. Would you like to appear human but actually be a mushroom? Maybe only one or two changes away from a human, such as pointed ears, or an odd skin colour? How about being an anthropomorphic animal, such as a fox, bird, or bear?

There are five important rules to remember when designing your form. First, you must be at least as big as Olimar (in his upsized Smash Bros. appearance). Second, you must not be larger than Ridley (in his downsized and hunched over Smash Bros. appearance). Third, you must be bipedal. Fourth, any additional features you give yourself (such as a tail) must not provide you any additional advantages which an ordinary human does not have. Finally, regardless of your size, your raw abilities (strength, speed, stamina, etc.) are no better than an ordinary human.

For an additional 100cp (100cp total), your form may provide one or two minor advantages, such as possessing natural weapons like claws, or being able to contort itself up into a small ball you can roll around as."
160,,100,Part-Vampire,Wizarding World,Transformation,"Vampires are an example of what witches and wizards call Dark creatures. Despite this, vampires are far from the monsters people believe them to be. You are a product of that fact, proof that vampires and humans can live together and even love one another. Of course, such a union has given you some benefits.

First, while the average wizard’s lifespan is around 138 years, you can expect to live up to at least 200 years, barring outside causes. Second, as a Dark creature, you are naturally inclined to the Dark Arts, finding it easier to pick up on such subjects. Finally, like other vampires, you can sustain yourself on blood alone rather than mere food or drink, along with possessing more stamina than most. And you do not need to worry much about the classical vampire weaknesses. All you have is a distaste for garlic, strong enough that it is hard to stomach, but little else to worry about."
161,,100,Part-Goblin,Wizarding World,Transformation,"Of every magical being in this world, goblins will likely be the one you’ll have the most interactions withs, besides your fellow witches and wizards, of course. And now, you can count yourself as one of them. Or at least, partially so. Anyways, it seems that your goblin ancestry has left you a few benefits. For one thing, you have an innate knack for metal forging, making it easy for you to learn how to work with all sorts of metals, magical or mundane. And like other goblins, you have a longer lifespan than wizards do. On a final note, your ancestry seems to afford you a modicum of respect amongst goblins and their ilk, in this world or the next."
162,,100,Aspects of the Crucible,Elden Ring - Limgrave,Transformation,"You draw your power from the primordial Crucible, manifesting powers that were once exalted before this age of gold.

This empowerment results in you taking on an elemental empowered form, which you are able to toggle on and off at will, with the elemental abilities only being available to you in your empowered form. Your elemental abilities are enough for you to slightly wound a veteran Viltrumite or kill a young Viltrumite. You may buy multiple elements here for an extra 100 cp per element. (All elements must be generally natural with no esoteric ones allowed. Earth, Air, Lava, Lightning would all be acceptable choices. Magic, Gravity, Light, Shadow, Time, Energy, etc... would not). Any additional elements are integrated into your elementally empowered form and you can use all elements at once.

169,,100,Demon Form,The Owl House,Transformation,"Demons come in all shapes and sizes on the Boiling Isles, and you are no exception. You may customize your appearance to craft a suitable demon form. Usually this form is generally humanoid in shape, with several pronounced animalistic qualities. However, demons like the Bat Lady show that this is not always the case, and more grotesque and unique forms do exist. Whatever form you choose to take, your capabilities cannot greatly exceed that of the average witch or human. You may have a hard protective shell or a few extra tentacles, but nothing more powerful than that."
170,,100,Clawthorne Curls,The Owl House,Transformation,"It seems you’ve inherited the mighty mane of the Boiling Isles’ most interesting family. You find it easy to grow, style, and care for long, luxurious hair. Wear a clean coif like Gwendolyn, an unruly mane like Eda, or even a magnificent beard like Dell. As an added bonus, these hairdos come with a touch of magic. Small, handheld items can be stored safely in your hair and then retrieved when needed. You can’t accomplish this with close-cropped hair, but so long as you’ve got sufficient volume, you can store all kinds of interesting knick-knacks in your hair without a fuss."
171,,100,Dog,Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,Transformation,"Let’s be honest who doesn’t like dogs. They are man’s best friend and some of the nicest beings you can encounter. So if you want to become one of these fluffy creatures then this option is the one for you. For Free you may become a normal type of dog like Perrito or design a similar body. You may freely choose to become any type of canine as long as this does not grant you any supernatural abilities. If you pay 100 CP however, then you may acquire a much stronger body resembling Deaths. This will not give you his power or anything special, but it will make you much more physically imposing. Your stature will be similar to Death making you slightly larger than an average human male in this world. Your natural speed, strength, and agility will allow you to match veteran warriors even with little training."
172,,100,Unusual Evolution,Atlantis - The Lost Empire,Transformation,"The strange energies of the Heart of Atlantis have not only given rise to the Atlantean people, but also to many strange creatures that live in the subterranean world that it has created; bathed in the glow of its power, they have evolved to have traits that may be considered unnatural to the surface world. Stone-like skin, wings that can bear a tremendous amount of weight through the sky, a tongue several meters in length that can shoot out like a bullet, a sub- sonic vocalization that lures those who hear it towards you, or even an internal body temperature hot enough to set materials like cloth or paper alight, easily burning the skin of any would-be attackers. A single adaptation on the level of any of these can be yours for a single purchase of this, with the possibility of purchasing three in total. Note that while these traits can be highly unusual, they must still (mostly) follow the laws of physics. You can make your body host to a toxin powerful enough to kill a man in a few minutes, but you can’t have the ability to teleport or anything along those lines."
173,,100,Wild Growth ,Rapunzel’s Tangled Adventure,Transformation,Your hair is now around 20 feet long and can shrink and extend at will with nothing but a bit of concentration. This is now your minimum length of hair no matter your form as long as your form has hair.

Dhampire’s like you have superhuman strength enough to lift about 1 ton, superhumanly acute senses with your sense of smell being especially enhanced, enhanced speed that lets you move faster than a human appearing as a blur to the human eye over short distances, superhuman agility, stamina, durability. You also have a healing factor that lets you heal cuts, and wounds in minutes, almost on par with wolverine albeit limited in being unable to regenerate lost limbs or organs. You would also find that you have a prolonged lifespan, enough that at age 93 you would look to simply be in your late 20’s early 30’s, and an immunity to standard vampire vulnerabilities. Except for needing to drink blood or a special serum you now know the recipe for."
176,,100,Rune of Beast's Embrace,Bloodborne: Covenants,Transformation,"Within your mind, the Caryll Rune of Beast’s Embrace has been engraved, marking you as one who has embraced their inner beast. A beast eschews the tools of man, relying on their own power. You will find yourself three times stronger than before, as well as seeing an increase in your skill at unarmed combat. The beastly appearance one would normally gain from this rune is optional."
177,,100,Mark,Marvel Primal,Transformation,"You have a glowing tattoo of your own design that vanishes or goes dark at your will. At the very least, it’s an identifying mark that is really, really hard to fake."
178,,100,Dragon(Tier 2),Pet Avengers,Transformation,"You are a dragon. By default this makes you one of the Flock like Lockheed; this means you can fly, breathe fire, and communicate telepathically. This will also generally increase your physical capabilities somewhat, generally speaking similar to one Tier higher, with your fire breath hitting with enough force to make you a bit more of a threat even then. Coupled with Behemoth you could be a full and credible threat to many of the human Avengers. You may choose to have another type of breath weapon than fire, such as lightning, cold, acidic gas, or a sonic scream; this cannot include esoteric effects like transforming people or manipulating time, only roughly equivalent damaging effects.

Tier 2 Dangerous: You could be a threat to an unarmed adult. You might be a wolf, a large dog, or combined with Utility a black widow, or potentially deadly small snake.

180,,100,Spirit of Vengeance(600),Marvel Midnight Suns,Transformation ,"There is something else inside you, something that screams for vengeance like Johnny Blaze and Robbie Reyes. Just like any other Ghost Rider your Spirit of Vengeance allows you to channel hellfire in different shapes, give souls a Penance Stare to hurt them with their soul with their own sins and a healing factor of the damned.

For an extra 100 CP your Spirit is rather one of Justice making giving you the additional choice of holy fire and enhanced abilities.

181,,100,Daywalker(400),Marvel Midnight Suns,Transformation ,"You were born a partial vampire giving you a dhampir physiology similar to Eric Brooks. Just like Blade you are a vampire human hybrid that is immune to the monster's bite while having similar powers. Your ageing is slowed due to the enzymes in your blood, and you have strength, speed and other senses only a step below vampires while being able to walk in the day.

For an extra 100 CP the need for blood is not a pressing concern to you.

182,,100,Werewolf ,Marvel 2099,Transformation ,"You possess the ability to transform into a werewolf-like form, growing slightly in size as your hands become clawed, and your mouth becomes a wolf-like snout. This grants you low level superstrength, speed, and agility - above that of a ‘peak human’ even slightly above the likes of Captain America - as well as enhanced hearing and a dog-like sense of smell."
183,,100,Bone Daddy ,Helltaker,Transformation ,"You now have an alt-form which is a large bone demon (not a skeleton), which allows you take harder hits and push giant blocks of stone as easily as the Helltaker could. It also allows you to meld through demonic materials, phasing through them. This also translates to limited control of other demonic materials, such as demonic metals or demonic creatures with weak wills."
184,,100,Beaut ,Helltaker,Transformation ,"Just as if Vanripper himself had designed you, you are top tier waifu material. Choose one archetype, no matter how niche or specific, and combine it with a maximum of three flavors; you are now the best combination of those elements. This is fiat-backed to make you a top tier waifu no matter what you choose. In Canon, for example, you have Malina; she’s a turn-based game nostalgic fangirl (archetype) with slavic roots, alcoholic tendencies, and slight social awkwardness (three flavors). Modeus is an example of a combination with less than three flavors: lonely lust-crazed demon girl, who is naïve about romance and wholesome-ish (two flavors). This is an oversimplification for simplicity’s sake and it depends on what you consider an ‘archetype’ and what you consider a ‘flavor,’ but my rule of thumb is that flavors should never be longer than the archetype."
185,,100,Vampire,Avengers Vs X-Men,Transformation ,"Bitten by one of Dracula’s own lineage, you have become a mythical vampire. This race may be taken in addition to any other race by paying the cost. A whole range of vampiric abilities are added to your repertoire. Increased strength to lift several tonnes and the speed to move faster than an ordinary human can see, spider like reflexes and agility, a minor healing factor that can regenerate bullet wounds and cuts in minutes and eternal life, so long as you regularly ingest blood from other sources. More magical abilities are also available, such as being able to transform into various rat, wolf, bat or mist made creatures, hypnotising others through eye contact, moderate control over the weather around you and even small influence over the elements such as fire and wind. However, your vampiric abilities come at a price. Your semi-regular need for fresh blood or else slowly weakening and falling into a comatose state and a severe allergy to silver and vulnerability to wounds from silver weapons. Your body will quickly crumble to ash if exposed to direct sunlight, a wooden stake through your heart could kill you instantly and you have a strong aversion to religious symbols brandished by those of great faith."
186,,100,Mutation(100)        ,Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Transformation ,"Not necessarily as a result of being a mutant or mutate, your body has been altered significantly in some way. For 100 CP, this alteration is cosmetic, though with a wide range of possibilities; from as minor as having feathers instead of hair, or green blood instead of red, to as major as having your skin look like a section of space, with stars, planets, and such (though this would only be for appearance’s sake, and has no benefit beyond being intimidating and helping to conceal your identity). "
187,,100,Immaculate Hair ,Bayonetta,Transformation ,"Oh. Oh my. Such... glorious hair you have. It's wonderful. Envy-inducing, actually. Along with excellent shine and health, your hair will never tangle or knot up regardless of length, and you can forget about ever having split ends ever again. It will also not only let you decide the color, style, and length of your hair, but it only gets as dirty as you want it to get, meaning it could stay perfect and styled for quite some time along with perfectly clear skin! This also applies to any other fur or feathers you may have... what's that? You have scales instead? Well they'll be equally enhanced and protected as well! I don't judge. Mostly."
188,,100,Alchemist’s Physiology(300),Generic Alchemist ,Transformation ,"Your body has undergone changes from the application of various alchemical processes over the course of your studies. For 100cp, you need only a fourth the normal amount of food, water, and sleep, as well as allowing you to go four times as long without air before detrimental effects set in.

For an additional 100cp, you become immune to poison and disease, age at a quarter the normal rate to extend your life considerably, and no longer need to sleep. You are also less affected by pain, seeming to feel it as a detached sensation rather than something that can overwhelm you.

For a final 100cp, you gain a minor form of regeneration that allows you to regrow any limb or organ, though this doesn’t accelerate your healing, you can survive anything short of your brain being destroyed, you cease aging entirely, and no longer need to eat, drink, or breathe.

191,,100,Marai,League of Legends,Transformation ,"The Marai are an aquatic race of merpeople who live deep under the ocean, very rarely interacting with the outside world. They have humanoid torsoes with fish tails, but are covered in smooth scales often in a myriad of patterns. Though dependent on water as aquatic creatures tend to be, Marai possess a small level of water magic to let them coalesce water around them, and hover slightly above ground to traverse over land. Marai generally possess greater magical power than humans."
192,,100,Beastman,League of Legends,Transformation ,"Not so much a race as it is a collection of disparate species, there are a great many demihuman races on Valoran that are a cross between human and animal, from the Ursine of the Freljord, the Minotaur of the Great Barrier, or even another sort of bestial species resembling a humanoid mammal, with varying degrees of anthropomorphism. In general, Beastmen possess greater physical strength and survival instinct than humans."
193,,100,Yordle,Arcane,Transformation ,"You’re an adorable, three-foot-tall spirit-creature. You probably look a bit like someone brought a teddy bear to life, but there are some yordles which have a bit more of a fishy look to them. Yordles are essentially spiritual beings, a little like the concept of ‘goblins’ or ‘brownies’ in some other worlds, adapting themselves to the environments they find themselves in, and being one comes with a few benefits.

First of all, you’re absolutely adorable, which can be very useful in some circumstances. Secondly, you’re small, which can be useful for sneaking around places but you can use human-sized tools, weapons and similar without difficulty, though armour and clothes will need to be adapted to you. Thirdly, you have a subtle kind of glamour which makes you seem less remarkable. This doesn’t necessarily hide you from sight, but it means people won’t comment on your strange nature unless they’re particularly perceptive. Finally, you’re ageless. Not immortal; you can be killed, but age won’t get you – you’re part-spirit, after all."
194,,100,Vastaya,Arcane,Transformation ,"You’re a catguy! Or a catgirl. Or a fishgirl. Or a- Look, there’s a lot of different types of Vastaya. The long and short of the thing is, Vastaya are people who exist as hybrids of human and animal, descendants of ancient and powerful part-spirits. For free, you can be a Vastaya that doesn’t get any particular benefits from your nature; you just look kinda
neat. For 50 CP, you can either:


● Gain some useful physical benefits from your state (e.g. a fishy Vastaya might have excellent swimming speed, resistance to pressure and the ability to breathe water, while a tiger-Vastaya might be particularly stealthy, have excellent hearing and claws)
● Inherit a small degree of your ancestors’ spiritual power, allowing you to create short-lived illusions, or manipulate a particular element to a limited extent; not enough to really be useful in combat, but enough to be handy.

For 100 CP, you can have both. You can’t take one option twice."
195,,100,With Nature’s Claws,Super Dragon Sword,Transformation ,"Living among the wild beasts and untamed land has taught that you’re just another animal - and all life is one, so why not borrow their form? You are capable of transforming parts of your body to mimic that of non-magical beasts, allowing you to fly, stride, dig, and slice with claw and tooth, as well as gain access to the armored hide of a rhino or an armadillo."

While in combat, you can expend a substantial portion of mana to manifest that feature. While utilizing this Godhand, you have a small chance at any moment during the fight to become Godwoken. The Godwoken status effect acts as a combination of the Berserk, Confused, Courage, and Hope statuses."
198,,100,Blood Drinker,Super Dragon Sword,Transformation ,"To battle monsters, one must become a Monster. You are capable of drinking the blood of a Monster in order to “learn” its form.

In addition, dying while in this form reverts you to your normal form. You unable to use any other Job’s perks while in this form. You are only capable of holding one “learned” monster form with just this ability."

Not only are you quite attractive in terms of appearance, you have a special quality that adds to the sort of ‘mystical’ look befitting your heritage...colorful eyes, hair, perhaps some tattoos or skin without a single blemish. Careful, you might charm someone with that."

201,,100,Minor Power ,Dresden Files,Transformation ,"There are many ways to achieve power in this world, and even more ways to achieve this kind of small-scale power. Too many to name, really. You are a supernatural being with this, but one that’s strictly small scale. A werewolf like the Alphas, a Half-Yeti, an Einherjar, a Ghoul (though why would you want to be one I don’t know). Essentially, you have one or two powers or abilities to set you beyond most mortals."

The other one was a Faerie straight out of the Nevernever, and now you're caught between both worlds. While you might look like a normal person, if maybe a bit of an odd one, you've got access to a lot of your faerie parent's power. That power comes at a cost, though: the more you call on, the more you'll be drawn towards their nature, until the point where you take all of it and you stop being a human permanently. So, which of the myriad creatures of the Nevernever did the deed? Depends on how much you want to spend.

Lucky (or unlucky) you! You're the scion of one of the strongest breeds of faerie in the Nevernever, along the lines of an Elder Fetch, the Dino-sized Elder Gruffs, or even one of the Sidhe themselves. All of these guys are certified badasses, which means you have access to a wide variety of versatile and powerful abilities. Of course, the stronger the ability the easier it is for them to warp you, and there's a lot of temptation to give in. Some of these guys might have actually been parents to you, and I'm not sure if it's better or worse if you just grew up without them in your life.

You are one of many who worshiped the Everlasting Dragons in hopes of reaching their heights. On some level, you have made progress. This perk grants you a body only somewhat resembling a dragon, but it's a tough body nonetheless. Your skin becomes gnarled, leathery and dark gray. Your head becomes reptilian and grows four twisting horns, you get small claws and your bones become more pronounced. This scaleless body isn't immortal, but the unique, leathery skin does ward you in many ways from danger somewhat. Burning flame, biting cold, deadly toxins, corrupting darkness and even the mystical dangers of curses and magic are all softened a bit on contact with your form. Lightning, the weakness of dragons, is the only thing that digs as deep as before."
204,,100,"""Bottom Feeder""",Dark Souls 3,Transformation ,"Aldritch was infamous for devouring men, eating and eating until he resembled a bloated pig, then continued until he melted into sludge. He had the desire to share his tastes with others, and his followers grew to consider Gluttony a virtue. Taking this perk causes gluttonous overeating to actually contain a benefit. By feasting well past what is necessary, you can grow in size, the useless mass of the additional food funneling into height. You can eventually cap out at twice your normal size in this way. Additional mass can continue to be consumed, funneled into a dense layer of fatty tissue beneath your skin that can soften blunt strikes, though the additional weight can grow a bit unwieldy if you indulge yourself too much.

(Sidenote: You won't actually grow obese through the use of this perk unless you're really pushing it.)"
205,,100,“Aloft” ,Dark Souls 1,Transformation ,"Eternal Dragons have scales of stone. While their diminutive cousins the drakes aren’t quite so absurdly heavy, it’s a wonder that either of them can soar through the air so smoothly, gracefully. No more wondering for you. With this perk, it is as if you become much lighter while in the air, as if gravity’s hold on you has lessened. With your muscular and powerful wings as a drake, it is simple to thrust yourself through the air. Additionally, your grace in flight is enhanced, allowing you to take to the skies like a bird. This also applies in other forms, allowing you to float or fly gracefully no matter how heavy or poorly designed from an aerodynamics point of view you might be, as long as you have some thrust."
206,,100,“Strength of Taurus”,Dark Souls 1,Transformation ,"Demons come in many shapes and sizes, sporting varying abilities. Those like the Capra Demon and Taurus Demon have bodies and muscles as resilient and durable as stone, and you too have developed these qualities. Your flesh and muscle are as dense as they are resilient, taking on a quality somewhere between stone and leather. As a result of this bodily warping, you’re much stronger and hardier compared to before, and much heavier too. At your discretion, you may also bestow yourself growths of bone to give yourself horns or spines."
207,,100,“Egg Head” ,Dark Souls 1,Transformation ,"Taking the eggs from our Fair Lady to ease her burden has, let’s say, minor complications. Complications that will wrap your head in silk, to keep it together you understand. On purchase, you will find that your body has become host to a gigantic maggot that can be commanded freely. The silk that it has covered your head with is permeable enough to see, hear and breath through, but it’s mostly there to make sure what’s left in there doesn’t fall apart. The way the maggot exits your head is by making your head split apart like a blooming flower, allowing it to lunge and bite targets in melee range. The maggot feeds on ‘souls’ collected from enemies or the energy of your soul to sustain itself, and can mutate over time because of this. Mostly this affects physical abilities or resistances."
208,,100,Beast Claw ,Bloodborne,Transformation ,"“Crafted by chiseling the long bones of an undead darkbeast. The bones are still alive, and when unleashed, grant its wielder beastly power. As flesh is flayed and blood is sprayed, the beast within awakens, and in time, the wielder of this weapon surges with both strength and reverie. 

The wielder may will the weapon to grant them a measure of its power, transforming the opposite hand of the one it is held in to transform into a darkbeast's claw. Be careful when wielding this, for the beast awoken may just assume control.” "
209,,100,Lead Elixir,Bloodborne,Transformation ,"“A vial of strange, metallic liquid. When imbibed, it temporarily causes your skin to harden itself like metal against physical attacks while making your body much heavier. 

This doesn't really help against the elements or arcane though, or other less than physical attacks. For an additional 100CP, it will refill over the course of a few hours once fully consumed.” "
210,,100,Dragon King’s Cragblade ,Elden Ring,Transformation ,"A thrusting sword with a regal air to it despite seemingly carved from stone, a portion of the Dragonlord’s power remains in it-and it commands great power over mortal dragons of all kinds. Though not enough to stop them from actually attacking you, apparently. Through it, you gain the power to transform into a red thundercloud and fly through the air-then plunged down with a lightning-infused blade. Or fly to hard to reach places, if you wish."
211,,100,Spawn of the Stars(100),Elden Ring,Transformation ,"There is a form of life unlike any found in the Lands Between, unrestricted by the conditions imposed by the Erdtree’s order, contained in trickles of glintstone that descend from the cosmos above. There, strange forms of life with mysterious powers emerge from the very substances of the heavens. Would you care to be one of them? 

For 100 CP, you may be one of the Alabaster of Onyx Lords: Tall, long-limbed, thin and almost fey-like ancients with flesh of stone that rose to life when a meteor struck the Lands Between long ago. Their innate powers over gravity are formidable-and at least somewhat compatible with the sorcery of this land, considering General Radahn learned gravity magic from an Alabaster Lord. It seems your kind are no less skilled in the arts of war, and care little for the danger of exposure to the elements since it is rare for you to don clothing."
212,,100,Crystalian,Elden Ring,Transformation ,"Tall, inscrutable beings with a clearcut purpose, your kind are spirits with humanoid but crystalline bodies that have one clear purpose: To safeguard the crystals you watch over until the end. And perhaps, to await a creator that will carve more of you. Such is your skill at craftsmanship that you are able to make fine blades and staves that human hands cannot create. Such is your gift for sorcery that the sorcerers of Raya Lucaria consider you honoured guests, for the crystal-infused torrents, burst and barrages are beyond the reckoning of most mortal mages. It is said that your cogitation and inorganic way of being is close to the ideals of the primeval current, and therefore that your intellect is close to the stars. Whether or not that is true, your power over magic is as undeniable as your slow but graceful prowess in battle-and a resilience beyond most mortal men."
213,,100,Giant of the Erdtree ,Elden Ring,Transformation ,"It is uncommon knowledge that during Marika’s war against the giants long ago, some giants fought for the Erdtree. And though most have lost their minds, degenerating into what are known instead as trolls in the modern era, somehow like Ranni’s war councillor Iji (and other troll knights still loyal to the royal family of Caria) you have kept yours. You are a gigantic, somewhat emaciated, grey humanoid with a talent for smithing; in times past your people forged gold-plated swords and other marvellous weapons in elaborate ceremonies. And though your kind’s best days are behind you, none would doubt your smithing skills."

Your mystical powers are enhanced, to the extent an untrained elk could gallop on temporary platforms through the air and launch barrages of mystic missiles, and though you reside in a surreal pocket dimension you may re-enter reality near the site of where you died.

215,,100,Great Beast ,Elden Ring,Transformation ,"On second thought, why burden yourself with humanoid form at all when many seemingly natural animals have obtained great might and prowess of their own? The Red Wolf of Radagon is bigger than a bull, capable of conjuring mystic blades it swings with uncanny skill using it’s jaws and launching mystic blades-and mighty yet agile enough to around a building smashing furniture with a mere brush. On the other hand Miriel, Pastor of Vows, is a kindly tortoise knowledgeable in the ways of sorceries, incantations and the lore of the land despite her immobility. Now, you are one such animal of note-the kind folklore would spring up around were your presence known to the wider world, just as King Godfrey himself took Serosh, Regent of Beasts, as his bosom companion. The trade off, of course, is there are neither armour nor weapons in this land fitted for such a beast. Perhaps a trifling concern for a true warrior.

For 100 CP, you may be an example like those listed above-a beast with skills and knowledge to match it’s might akin to that of a veteran adventurer of this land. For free however, you may simply be an unusual natural species of this world or simply a natural animal of any kind. This includes the mysterious spirit jellyfish, poisonous but peaceful creatures that yearn to protect-and are apparently somehow capable of travelling to the stars in an instant."

217,,100,Wishful Merfolk,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Transformation ,"Compulsively curious, the Merfolk are obsessed with learning all they can, occasionally to the brink of murder and madness. Merfolk hoard secrets and lord them over others. As a result, little is known about merfolk origins, customs, or magic - only that they are potentially some of the wisest beings in the land, though that wisdom is only important to them as a treasure to hold above others. They are capable of moving quickly in the water and can hold their breath indefinitely."

They are adept at hiding among the trees and attuned to the mana of the forests.. Due to their innate connection to the natural world, elves often patrol the forests as rangers, archers, scouts, and druids - some still hold bitterness over the loss of their lands to the humans, while others simply keep to the Wilds where they are not hampered by the Realm’s laws."
219,,100,SIMIC GUILDMAGE ,MtG - Ravnica,Transformation ,"As a member of the Simic Combine, you know a lot about the processes involved with... improving nature’s course, and have a fairly thorough understanding of biotechnology. You also have the option to improve your own body as so many of the Simic have, and become a mutant. If you so desire, you may add the subtypes Crab, Ooze, Octopus, Lizard, or any other creature commonly used by the Simic to your original creature type."
220,,100,A body made for a purpose,MtG - New Phyrexia,Transformation ,"You were made to fit a purpose in the Great Evolution, the path to perfection-whatever you believe that is. As such, your body (which will become an alt-form after this jump if you so wish) is made out of flesh and metal, in the way other denizens of New Phyrexia are. You may specify a purpose you were made for, and your body will be adapted to it things like “carrying molten metal from one place to another” or “killing fleshy things really efficiently”, for example, or simply be somewhat of an all-rounder, something almost unheard of in this land."
221,,100,Ogre   ,MtG - Kamigawa,Transformation ,"Known as o-bakemono, the ogres of Kamigawa are more intelligent than ogres of other worlds and possess considerable brute cunning. They originated in the Sokenzan Mountains, though most of their kind later removed to the swamps of Takenuma. Most of these ogres cared for little but to inflict pain, murder innocents, and worship the demonic oni, though some ogres rejected the oni and remained in the mountains were cursed and made outcast by their brethren; some of these joined forces with the ronin of the mountains and became samurai themselves."
222,,100,Bizarre Form,MtG - Kamigawa,Transformation ,"The form a Kami takes is partially representing its connection with the world as well as their own whimsy. This is an alternate form that is inspired by the forms of Shinto/Buddhism and allows you full customization of its shape inside those parameters, though while they are usually grossly affected by their Symbolic Links you are not necessarily held to that standard. This form is decided upon acquisition of this perk. The form must be the size of a human, at least, and can be no larger than five or six story building. This form can become even larger and more powerful, topping out at a body the size and weight of a twenty story building, for a second purchase at 100 CP."
223,,100,The Path of Flame,MtG - Lorwyn,Transformation ,"Flamekin are a much wiser race than one might expect for a race possessing such intense and passionate emotions, being adherents of the Path of Flame, a process of physical and spiritual self-discovery that revolves around the fires that constantly burn upon their bodies. Each stage along the paths marked by a different color of fire, and new stages are reached by exploring the world, understanding one's inner self, and deep meditation.

Though you have only started walking this path at the first stage, the red flame, your fiery nature still affords you some advantages. The flame of your body burns magically cool, but you can choose to burn hot at will. This and the ability to heat any weapons you carry into battle, makes you a deadly enemy to anyone, and especially to flammable opponents. On the more creative side, your flames could be used to draw burning glyphs in the air for a few moments or serve as a boon with any tasks that require fire, such as smithing."
224,,100,Faultless,MtG - Lorwyn,Transformation ,"The faultless are the lowest caste of elf, the lowest status an elf could have and still be an accepted as an elf. To sink any lower is to lose nature's blessing entirely; such wretches have no status and deserved no name. These are cast out of elven society as the ugly, disfigured, or non-elves (which is by definition an ugly thing to be) are deemed eyeblights, creatures unworthy of respect or even, if it is deemed so, life. 

Luckily, you now meet the minimum threshold of beauty and grace to be granted at least the basic rank of Faultless. Possessing no physical flaws and graceful enough that even as an untrained courtier you could somersault gracefully off a tall cervin mount, shimmy effortlessly up a tree, harvest a moonglove flower, and backflip fifteen feet to the ground while suffusing each and every movement with the agility and predatory grace expected of an elf."
225,,100,Survival of the Fittest ,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Transformation ,"While Green values the community, it is ultimately a meritocracy, and those who have no use are hunted by predators. You are not one to be hunted and your body has been thoroughly enhanced by Green Mana permanently. While you can still be enhanced by spells, your body’s natural state has been improved to at least the peak of your species and outright superior in one area of physical development. If that area is strength, an ordinary human could be an eight to nine foot tall giant of a man that could lift boulders and split open metal armor with their bare hands. Or if that area is agility, that same human would be lithe, with efficient movements letting them jump into the air several meters and perform masterful contortions with ease. Now you hold a place in nature, and you shall not lose it."
226,,100,Shining Example,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Transformation ,"Civilization, morality and rules help guide one to better serve the group. You know this all too well, and it comes to you to spread the word. With your being infused with White Mana, your appearance has become more refined and beautiful. Not only that but your charisma has become magnified such that it feels like you speak with the intensity of more than merely yourself. With such force of personality, it would not be difficult to spread gather followers and start uniting people in pursuit of a goal."
227,,100,Royal Locks ,Warbreaker,Transformation ,"A trait found in those descended from a Returned, you can alter the color and length of your hair at will. If you relax your self-control, your hair will shift with your mood. With a great deal of time and practice, you might learn to color your skin."
228,,100,WOLFWALKING,Wolfwalkers,Transformation ,"The most basic bits, you can talk to wolves and when you sleep, unless you specifically wish otherwise, your spirit leaves your body to its rest and manifests as a wolf. To wake up, just touch your human body to become ghostly and jump in. Be aware that your body will sleep, unresponsive, until you return, though it may take years. Your body will not age nor require food or drink while you’re away. At least you won’t suffer any problems from sitting or laying still so long. Also any wounds suffered by one of your bodies translates to the other."
229,,100,Jumper Larva,Fate/Extella,Transformation ,"Surviving terrible danger and injury is one thing, coming back from it safely is an entirely separate ordeal. This safety mode you now have makes it much easier. When badly wounded or critically low on energy, you can enter a Larva state that reduces you to the appearance of a child. Your overall power is cut to a tiny amount of your normal ability but your current negative conditions from your true form are sealed away, allowed to heal without endangering your actual life. Being hurt again while in this child state will force you to deal with the wounds as normal, changing back while negative conditions have been sealed but before they have fully healed only results in them being re-applied. You’re awfully cute as a Larva though, it’d take a real bastard to want to hurt you like that."
230,,100,Amazon,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Transformation ,"The Amazon are an intensely secretive sub-species of human, found only in the isolated wild places that they make their kingdoms in. An all female race, they possess more power than an ordinary human and are quite warlike in demeanour, perhaps due to their leaders being descended from the God of War. From being born as a true member or some strange circumstance that gave you their qualities, you are an Amazon yourself. You have somewhat greater physical ability and bodily potential than the males of your ‘species’ do in this world and with other races you might be, enough that a comparison between an untrained youth and a fit soldier would be fair, as well as the fighting training and instincts all Amazons have access to. These aren’t those of Penthesilea or other legends but do make you capable. You also have the ability to instantly reproduce upon taking sperm into your body, skipping any pregnancy or gestation time. Even if you’re male. In regards to which, by buying this, you may ignore the impossibility and be a male Amazon, even one born and raised, without issue. "
231,,100,Monster Form,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Transformation ,"No beast is such without a form to much. You’re no common beast either, not a wolf or a hawk or
anything so mundane. Centaurs, Minotaurs, other hybrid creatures. Little drakes and would-be
hydra snakes. You have the form of a beast but for now, it’s still a little beast. It might be because
you are young and inexperienced or it may just be a beastly form that is not that far beyond a
normal human. Whatever you choose, you’re a fair bit stronger than any ordinary human, bending
steel and travelling faster than a horse is a simple matter, but you don’t have much power to
threaten a hero with. Any magical abilities you have, if any at all, are very minor such as spitting
smaller fireballs as a drake and you have the instincts to perform well as a natural member of your
species, in and out of combat. Depending on your choice, you may grow significantly stronger with
years of growth and/or effort but your potential is not particularly higher than any young hero. Your
monster form will become an alt-form at the end of the jump. "
232,,100,In the Guise of Man,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Transformation ,"Both the half-monsters and those fully entrenched in the other side may find times when taking a
lesser form, a human form, is almost vital to their goals. Like many of the more experienced or
magically powerful creatures of the world, you are able to swap between monstrous and human
forms or in between states at will, able to draw on just a small part of the power of your true form
when as a full human or taking a smaller, humanoid state that keeps some of your monstrous traits
to retain a larger fraction of power.You do need to draw on everything at once, so taking on some of
the power of your monster form when that monster form has intense killing instincts will force you
to take some of those instincts on as well. It can be helpful though, to gain the use of opposable
thumbs without reducing your capabilities too far. This applies to other alt-forms or races as well, allowing you to take human or humanoid forms in them without fully giving up the powers of those
forms. It’s also possible that, with significant experience or magical skill, you could learn to retain a
greater percentage of power despite taking a human state. "
233,,100,Living Fantasy,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Transformation ,"The line between fact and fiction is ever blurry in a world where magic is real. Sometimes the
favourite childhood fairy tale is just what it seems, a flight of fancy. Other times, it is a true account
of history or the only way the author could make sense of things his mind could not comprehend. You are a being from the very pages of these fanciful stories, a supposedly fictional character
brought to life or even the true basis for the story originally. A fairy tale, folk story, legend or even
urban myth can be used as the basis for your new self, provided it is English in origin. Gaining a new
appearance, set of skills and even relatively limited supernatural abilities are all possible. 

A knight from a classic fable may be able to manifest steel plate armor, a trusty longsword and
barded horse. They’d have the skills to do chivalrous battle with these and perhaps their weapon has
magical power as well. The Invisible Man, a rogue with larcenous talents and the power to make his
power completely unseen is another possibility. Even a form of the Lambton Worm, a great worm
able to crush knights in it’s coils. 

Alternatively, you can also take the form of a literal book, an English story animated by magic. In
book form you are able to levitate freely or take on a humanoid state styled after your chosen story. This book form possesses minor magical abilities connected to the chosen story, similar to the above
characters. "
234,,100,Age of Monsters(Inhuman),Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Transformation ,"In the Age of Gods, humanity is just one of many great kinds of creature. Far from the rulers of the
planet, they share with many powerful creatures. Some as intelligent as they, some relying only on
raw power and strange abilities to get by. At times, these creatures can even mate with humans to
produce half-breeds with traits of both, a not uncommon sight in ancient times. The following perk
offers several different tiers to represent different species that you may become a part of.

Having left your humanity behind, you take on the form of one of the weaker monsters. At least for
the Age of Gods. Skeletons, animated with unholy green fire and with strength well beyond what
any ordinary man could hope for. Minor elementals who can naturally use element magic at a expert
mages level. Even a Dead Apostle, a newly created vampire of notable power and potential. Abilities
gained here can be useful and numerous but any decent hero would likely slay you easily enough, without more time for you to grow.

235,,100,Phantom of France,Fate/Legends - Vive la France,Transformation ,"Sometimes beauty must be found on the inside, since the outside is so monstrous as to drive any
normal person far away. The heart of some kind of monster beats in your chest, visible outwardly by
the vicious claws that you can turn your hands into on a whim. Able to cut steel like it was air, they’re supported by the murderous instincts you have that make it feel natural to hunt and kill
others.Others might see that you move in an inhuman manner, like a beast or ghost, but it just
makes you even harder to put down. However, despite the unnatural power you have, your mind
remains clear. You have a strangely strong control over your own desires and emotions, letting you
keep any urges to kill and slaughter clamped down on."
236,,100,Beast of Legend,Fate/Legends - Strange New World,Transformation ,"In the woods of olden times, strange things roamed. Things that science couldn’t explain yet they
still existed. One of those things might even be what you’ve become now, a beast of folktales and
legends. Taking this grants you a new form, even a transformation from a normal human form if you
want, that turns you into a massive, monstrous version of an animal native to the Americas. A
mighty wolf with a head the size of a man’s body and unnatural speed, a vampiric bat with a
wingspan greater than a house that sucks horses dry of blood in one gulp, an invisible predator with
too many deadly talons and legs or even a murderous duck capable of swallowing people whole. Whatever form is chosen, you gain excellent instincts for using that form in combat or hunting and
most normal people will be unable to put up much resistance, even with basic firearms, against your
might."
237,,100,Transformation Trinket ,Generic MG,Transformation,"You know what this is. The amulet or whatever that a magical girl uses to transform. Although recent series have started turning the girls’ phones into the transformation trinkets. Weird. Most magical girls have a different appearance when transformed, but there are plenty of examples where the “transformation” is just an outfit change and instant hairstyling. Uses this once transforms you into your magical girl form. Using it again transforms you back.

For most girls this also enables them to use their powers (see the Powers section and Work-Life Balance).
"
238,,100,Redshift Jumper ,Tsukihime,Transformation,"The greatest expression of power isn’t anything as subtle as presence or a mere sense of having moved forward somehow - it’s bright and flashy colors that show you’re not someone to mess with! When you achieve or use any supernatural power of your choosing, you may have your body change in appearance somehow to match it - whether a different hair color, longer hair, a change in skin tone or eye color, or other ‘minor’ changes in appearance. This is purely aesthetic and doesn’t allow full-blown shapeshifting, but you can freely customize when and how these forms appear, as well as change the appearance of similar transformations that don’t change your body very much freely. This can be toggled and adjusted at will.

239,,100,Unliving Abomination ,Valkyrie Profile,Transformation,"The undead condition comes with all it implies, including the lack of vital organs or the need to breath and the like, except they do not rot. Undead vary vastly in strength, but the intelligent ones are much more powerful physically and magically than they ever were in life, and possess the same capacity for growth the Einherjar do. Being one of these, you have a choice between becoming a Demon, a kind of undead with greater physical power, endurance, and speed than other undead, or a Vampire, which is inferior physically (but only when compared to a Demon) in all but speed while instead possessing much more powerful magic. It should be noted that neither of these creatures possess the weaknesses they are said to in folklore.

240,,100,Unison Compatibility ,Lyrical Nanoha,Transformation,"Interesting. This is a rare talent - near-perfect compatibility with the Unison System. Normally a particular skill set and a bit of luck is needed for this, but you seem to be the exception. Should you ever use it yourself, the fusion is almost seamless and immediate, letting you function in near-perfect unison with any Device regardless of function. Outside of this, you become better at working as a duo with someone in a team, letting you move in sync that most coordinated dancers or sports players would envy.
"
241,,100,Henshin ,Generic MG,Transformation,"You gain two more forms at the start of this jump, for a total of three. One will be an ordinary human form (or at least easily disguised as such,) but the other two are obviously not human, and are related in some way. For example, a wolf and a puppy.

The two nonhuman forms have boosted attributes in some way. For example, a tougher wolf form and a puppy form with boosted healing magic.

At the start of future jumps, you may adjust your forms and boosts they provide.

Unless of course you start to introduce magic into the equation. This overly large suit of armor somehow manages to fit anyone inside, no matter how big or oddly shaped they are. Make no mistake, the armor itself is still huge compared to your average hylian. Or... well, maybe it doesn’t have to be. In short, this suit of armor - which doesn’t have to be a suit of armor, you could go with Veran’s half dress half pauldrons thingee - condenses huge monsters into relatively normal sized people. It also comes with an axe, a flail, and Onox’s weirdass flail-axe.

you! Your lost eye has been replaced by a magical prosthetic that is in the shape of glass eye
with a silvery iris color. This eye is capable of all the things a normal eye can do and more.
Your vision with these eyes becomes much clearer than normal sight. By closing your
intact eye and focusing your vision on solely this one, you zoom in and out just as well as a
telescope can do. You can see through illusions that effect only sight and detect invisible
creatures that are trying to hide within your line of sight.
Told you it was better."
257,,200,Transcendence,Baldur's Gate 3 ,Transformation,"For 200 CP, you break the barriers that restrict you from transcending and become a half-
illithid as if you were to consume an astral-touched tadpole. This means couple of things for

you. Your thought process becomes faster and more efficient, and you gain slight boost to your
intellect. You gain a slight resistance to mental influences of all kinds and gain a tremendous
boost to your psychic potential, allowing you to access high-tier powers from illithid power
tree. Meaning you gain +6 TP spent in illithid powers sections.
One downside of gaining these abilities is that you gain a slight illithid-like appearance.
Your body color just so slightly turns into a more purplish hue, traces of black veins appear on
your face and your eyes become slightly darker in color. But surely this is a little price to pay
for glorious evolution, right? And at worst you could disguise it with a bit of makeup.
For 400 CP, you have decided that losing your soul is a small cost to pay for a true evolution
and lowered you mind barriers to become a full illithid. But since you pay for this perk instead
of just succumbing to the Absolute, you get a couple of things extra. You get all the powers
from being a half-illithid and they become even stronger. Your mind is so alien that none but
the strongest psychic beings even attempt to scratch the surface of your mental defenses. Your
sheer mental power is equal to what you get from All 20s intelligence purchase, and if you were
to get that perk as well, you’ll find that your mind becomes even stronger (around 22-23 in
terms of stats). Your multitasking ability allows you to keep dozens of strains of thought without
any effort, allowing you to be a match for an elder brain in terms of sheer computing power.
Your psychic might get a huge boost too. And since you paid for it, normal consumption
methods still work for you, meaning you don’t have to worry about feeding from people’s
brains. Unless that is what you want to. You instead gain +12 TP to spent in illithid powers
section.
So, is this worth the cost of becoming a tentacled alien freak, a pragmatic sociopath and a
soulless monster? Kinda, if you were to ask me, especially with this perk. You see, by spending
your points buying this perk allows you to keep your soul, while still becoming an illithid. Don’t
ask how it works. Your illithid body is broadly in the shape of your previous race’s body that is
selected from this jump. For exotic races like dragons or ogres, you keep your races unique
body shape to some extent but still sprout tentacles from the location of your mouth and gain
an inflated head. You also gain a small shapeshifting power that allows you to change back to
your previous mortal body with but a brief thought, allowing you to walk freely within human
society. No need to thank me, you paid for it after all."

stealing energy from other people, that is, by consuming their blood and their
lifeforce. While you don’t possess an innate way to do it, fully consuming someone’s
blood is enough to maintain you young for a few days before you return to your
actual age and need to consume another person. Additionally, when you consume
someone’s life, you’ll temporarily gain a basic degree of healing factor, however, your

their physical bodies into a specific animal. Such techniques were even adapted and
used by the ancient alchemists of old to create Teigu, more specifically the belt
Lionel, and again was used to create the Water-Dragon Sword. These arts were
passed down from generation to generation until the Gravekeepers, the guardians of
the First Emperor’s tomb. Apparently, either you’re one of the Gravekeepers that
managed to escape from the Elite Seven and Esdeath or you managed to steal their
Secret Arts and use them on yourself, you’ve acquired their special ability of body
transformation that allow you to morph your body parts into that of an single creature
in varying degrees, like fully transforming a body part or just altering your body’s
traits for example, giving you access to their unique properties and abilities.
For 200 CP, you may pick any ordinary animal to morph into, regardless if they be
mammals, reptiles, insects or even sea life, with each one giving you different
abilities, like how morphing into a grasshopper will greatly increase your leg muscles
strength, morphing into a snake will increase their flexibility and gives you poisonous
fangs and morphing into a bear will enhance your strength and durability.
However, for 400 CP, you’ve been enhanced by one of the forbidden secret arts
which usually are only used by the Gravekeepers’ royal family. Instead of being
restricted to only ordinary animals, you can morph into a Special Class Danger
Beast, one on par with Nubis, the beast worshiped in Putra as a deity and whose
abilities involve enhanced strength, powerful regenerative abilities and the ability to
breathe fire. While the Gravekeepers were limited to only choose Nubis, you’re free
to pick any other Special Class beast, like the Apemen, Wyverns, Kaiser Frogs or Air
Mantas for example.
Lastly, for 600 CP, you’ve surpassed the limit and managed to gain the ability to
morph into a Super Class Danger Beast without needing to worry about losing your
mind due to the strain in your body, as well as gaining a power that rivals the
stronger Teigu. Like the other options above, you may pick any Super Class beasts,
including the Tyrant, however, if you actually pick that draconic beast, you’ll acquire a
pale imitation of its adaptive ability, so, while the Tyrant would be able to fully evolve
to counter a type of damage, you could adapt to just become slightly more resistance
against that damage."
261,,200,Diamond Body,Rapturous Rhapsody Jump,Transformation,"Interesting... I wonder if you're related to Miss Frost, given your power. Like the infamous
mutant, you have the ability to shift into a diamond form. While in your diamond form you
possess superhuman speed, strength, and durability. Granted, you're going to be
throwing around cars not mountains. Durability wise, you’re extremely resistant to
intense temperatures and everything up to cruise missiles. The user can switch to this
form instantaneously if needed. Additionally, the form can be maintained indefinitely
though it may revert if the user is knocked unconscious. Lastly, while using this form
your mind is completely unbreachable by any telepath."
262,,200,Grand Beauty,Rapturous Rhapsody Jump,Transformation,"The multiverse is filled with numerous beautiful individuals from all walks of life. Hell, this
is one of the biggest selling points of the Waifu Catalog. Given this trait, it shouldn’t
surprise you that nearly every notable individual here is an incredibly attractive being. For 200 CP, the only things that could possibly rival you in beauty are conceptual beings related to the idea of beauty, or beauty gods/goddesses. Lastly, this will allow you to fully customize your body and alter the size of any... appendages. This will also remove any issues such as back pain from excessively large assets."
263,,200,Special Body,Medaka Box Abnormal Jumpchain,Transformation,"You might not be a true Abnormal but one part of you certainly makes an effort to match them. Choose a single organ or part of your body such as your arms or legs to be made abnormally good in
its function. Perhaps you choose your lungs and become able to hold your breath for a month
through sheer lung capacity, focus your exhalation into a cannon that can blow a man across a large
room or scream loud enough to kill someone outright. Pick your legs and you could jump ten storeys
with ease, shatter concrete with the force of your legs or use yourself as a living jack to keep two
shrinking walls of a room apart. You may buy this perk multiple times, with further purchases at a
discount that does not stack. The only limit is that you cannot choose your brain as the part to be
enhanced. "
264,,200,Trans-mortal-fication,Greek Mythology,Transformation,"Sometimes people will insult
you and you can be the bigger person and let it go... Or you can be like a god and curse
them into the form of monsters and animals (then offer a prize to the next person who
brings you their head?). This transformation doesn’t always have to be a curse; it can
also be a “gift”, after all, in some versions of Arachne’s story, Athena changes her into a
spider when she (Athena) sees that Arachne has hung herself. In a similar fashion, should
you find use this power on someone who has recently died, they will return to life as an
animal that most fits with how they were in life.

Requires Fluid Form to purchase."
265,,200,Hundred Handed One,Greek Mythology,Transformation,"The Hecatoncheires where a race of giants that had fifty heads
and one hundred arms. With this perk, you can appear in a similar matter, with the ability to create
multiple limbs that will be just as effective as the original. The only catch is you will be unable to
create more than one hundred fifty limbs at a time."
266,,200,Víxla Hömum Skipta Hömum,Germanic/Norse Mythology Jump,Transformation,"Many beings change hamr in different ways for different reasons, but now you have a gift of forms unseen by most. You could live freely as an otter or a tree or rest as a stone beside the sea if you so enjoyed with none the wiser, any natural form within this world you wish to take is yours even so as to appear to be as someone else. You could grow to be a giant or dragon in size and shape but your strength and gifts would not grow with it, only ever as powerful as you were. As a man you could be a full woman and bear children or as a woman be a man and provide seed, even as other species.  This provides a mastery of disguise, cloak, and dagger,  even when not using this gift to take form, and a mastery to remain hidden beyond even Heimdall's gaze and prying eyes."
267,,200,Vættir,Germanic/Norse Mythology Jump,Transformation,"Whether you are of the Dvergar (dwarves), Alfar (elves), Ljósálfar,  Hvítálfar,  Dökkálfar, or something else entirely, you are now beyond the form of mortals. The Dwarves are dark skinned, sometimes pitch black in appearance, natural smiths and craftsmen, being strong enough to hold up the sky; some scholars believe that the Dökkálfar (Dark Elves) are these people by another name. The Light Elves are said to be luminous beings that are more beautiful than the sun and possess innate powers such as to cause,  cure, and heal illnesses."
268,,200,Indra Susano'o,Naruto,Transformation,"While you don't otherwise have access to the Tailed Beasts (unless you're a Jinchuuriki), your Susano'o now has the option to utilize the combined might of their chakra, condensing it into its armour. In this state, nothing less than Baryon Mode Naruto would be able to harm you, and every one of your attacks has the potential to rend continents.

Requires Extra Big to purchase."
269,,200,Danzo's Arm,Naruto,Transformation,"A prosthetic made from an arm of Shin Uchiha using Hashirama cells and ten Sharingans. Unfortunately it isn’t connected to any visual receptors so you won’t be getting enhanced perception, but you could use an improved version of Izanagi giving you a period of time where any unwanted events including your death get erased. It lasts one minute per Sharingan. All eyes are restored at the start of a new Jump."
270,,200,Witcher,The Witcher Novels,Transformation,"You are a Witcher, subjected to the same enhanced trials the legendary Geralt of Rivia experienced. Even among other Witchers you possess incredible physical attributes, capable of wrestling trolls and enduring blows from higher vampires. You possess night vision, granted by your cat-like eyes, a bolstered immune system, extended lifespan, and accelerated healing. Strangely, the sterility common to all Witcher is absent in you, though the over-developed libido is very much present."
271,,200,Northern Berserkers,The Witcher Novels,Transformation,"Rip and tear. Anger is a weapon, but one you hardly have mastered. You've been cursed to transform to a werebear in times of great stress: an unnatural, lumbering beast with more strength than a bear should possess. Its hide is dense, and you'll find that while mundane arms and magic can harm it, silver is the only true weakness of this monster. With time, patience, and practice, you may be able to bring this curse under some semblance of control."
272,,200,Werewolf,The Witcher Novels,Transformation,"You'll find that during nights of a full moon, your memory inexplicably disappears, and you wake in strange places. Gristle in your teeth, surrounded by corpses of men and animal, such is the only proof you'll need of your affliction: Lycanthropy. Similar to their werebear brethren, werewolves are possessed of a supernatural ability relative to normal wolves. A sense of smell greater than any Bloodhound, strength to rend trees in two, claws hard as steel--worst of all, skin and fur seemingly impervious to all but silver and Witcher oils. Fortunately, cures and mitigating treatments are available, but such strength should not be so easily forfeited when this Grimoire provides its own means."
273,,200,Griffin,The Witcher Novels,Transformations,"You suddenly have the unprecedented ability to shift into a griffin at will. A chimera of bird and lion, griffins are relentless creatures who'd rather face death than retreat. While some mistake this as courage, the worldly recognize it for what it is: rabid fury. Strength and vitality unmatched by any natural animal, griffins take to the skies and harass with razor talons and screams sheer enough to dizzy and unbalance. Beware, however, as these monsters are but the surface of griffinkind."
274,,200,Great Serpent ,Egyptian Mythology,Transformation,"The great serpents who live in Duat and on the mysterious islands of the bitter lake grow to incredible size with age, and as one of their kin, so too does your body. You never stop growing as you get older, permitting you to reach absolutely terrifying size. The rate at which you grow is no faster, though you may choose to slow it to any lower rate or pause it completely, should you feel large enough. You may also choose to apply this to some of your forms and not others."
275,,200,Egyptian Soul,Egyptian Mythology,Transformation,"There are many parts to a person’s whole ‘self’, each necessary to keep them alive and well in the living world. The khet, the physical body. The ib, the heart and mind. The ka, or ‘double’, the essential animating power of life. The ba bird, the personality and individuality of a person. The shut, the shadow, and the sah, an astral or spiritual body.

Your ‘self’ now has all of these spiritual components, and this makes you...spiritually complicated. You may think with your ib, the heart located in your chest instead of your brain. Your personality in the form of your ba may survive an attack on your ib that erases your mind or memory. A voracious soul-eater may bite down but find it has only eaten your sah. The sah and shut of a mortal is an ethereal presence, normally anchored to the body, but the sah and shut of magicians and gods with heka may roam freely and even draw sustenance from offerings."
276,,200,Ape X Mask,Marvel Zombies,Transformation,"This magic red luchador mask originates from Earth-8101, one of those universes where everyone’s a simian. It belonged to Ape X - a hero that wouldn’t be found on the vast majority of Earths inhabited primarily by humans. When somebody dons the mask, they will transform into a 500-pound gorilla with more than proportional strength and the power to fire energy blasts out of their hands."
277,,200,Blazing Skull(Ghost Rider),Marvel Zombies,Transformation,"For an extra 200cp, you’re a bona fide Ghost Rider. Your Spirit of Vengeance was You’re much stronger than you were before, and you have substantially greater control and power over the flames you generate. That fire is now sourced from Hell itself, and aside from just throwing it at foes, you can also use it to make constructs or infuse items with it. Lastly, there’s the Penance Stare, that which every Ghost Rider is known for. You’ve got a sense for the sins committed by those around you, and by looking into their eyes, you can force them to experience the pain of all the wrongs they’ve done.

Requires Blazing Skull to Purchase"
278,,200,Phasing,Marvel Zombies,Transformation,"Through concentrating, you can turn intangible, becoming completely untouchable. You simply go through things. Attacks, barriers, and anything else that might be a danger to you will pass harmlessly through you, as long as you’re phasing. Getting around is a lot easier now. Nothing can really block your path when you can walk right through it. It isn’t without its offensive applications, either, as you could easily access someone’s internal organs. You can extend your intangibility to anything and anyone you’re in direct contact with. Any electronics you pass through will short out. Don’t let this get to your head, as you’re not invincible. You’re still vulnerable to magic and some forms of energy."
279,,200,Werewolf by Night ,Marvel Zombies,Transformation,"Another animalistic power. A bestial curse in the view of some. You are a werewolf, but your lycanthropy is such that you can turn into the wolf and back whenever you want without any difficulty or loss in faculties, with one exception. That’s the full moon. When it shows up, you’ll turn involuntarily and suffer a loss in intelligence, but that’ll go away with the full moon. You’ll have similar physical capabilities as the last two powers, plus the healing factor (which zombies lose). You’ve also got enhanced senses. Your canine sense of smell is particularly powerful, and your teeth and claws work as natural weapons. You do have the weakness to silver in werewolf form, though. The different biochemistry of each form can stave off zombification to some extent. This is unique. You won’t find it in any other power listed here. One form can be zombified and it will have no effect on the other."
280,,200,Winged Justice,Marvel Zombies,Transformation,"You have wings! Two great pinions coming out of your back. Just like Angel or Beak. Or Red Raven. They’re very flexible, so you can comfortably fold them into a harness so you won’t have trouble putting on a shirt. The sky is now your domain - you can swoop and dive and fly for hours, though flying too much will tire you. When you’re really putting your nose to the grindstone, you can fly at supersonic speeds! Plus, your physiology has adapted for the rigors of flight. Your body is nearly at the peak of human capability, you’ve got excellent eyesight, and breathe unaided at extremely high altitudes for a short while.

For an additional 100cp, you have the fancy-schmancy techno-organic wings that Archangel had. Your wings are covered with metal, which won’t poison you and counts as a part of your body. They’re quite durable, able to take high-caliber bullets with nary a scratch, and you can fire razor-sharp feathers back at attackers in return. Your wings will regenerate within a few days if damaged."
281,,200,Vampire,Marvel Zombies,Transformation,"The more glamorous form of undead. You’ve got a choice between what kind of vampire you are; whether you want to be a technically-living vampire like Dr. Michael Morbius or a pure vampire. Though you require the blood of the living to survive, the benefits of your affliction far outweigh this cost.

Firstly, your physical prowess increases to superhuman levels. You have the strength to lift from one to four tons, cross rooms faster than people can blink, and possess senses beyond the sharpest of humans. You do not age, eternal as long as you have sufficient blood to drink, and have a healing factor that’ll fix any damage short of lost limbs or organs within days or hours, if you’re strong. Additionally, you have shapeshifting limited to the forms of bats, wolves, rats, and other dark creatures. You can even turn into fog. You are also capable of mentally dominating others through hypnosis, usually through eye contact or bites.

However, you and your fanged ilk have your fair share of weaknesses. It turns out, all the stuff from the myths is true. Sunlight disintegrates you, and your large list of banes and weaknesses also include religious symbols wielded by people of faith, silver, garlic, and an inability to get around without the presence of soil from your native land or enter places uninvited.

Hybridized vampires, however, lack the vast majority of vampire weaknesses, only bearing the need for blood. If you choose to be a hybrid, you are most likely akin to Michael Morbius or Eric Brooks, a “living” vampire or a dhampir, respectively. Or maybe you’re a strange alien vampire never seen before..."
282,,200,Rebirth        ,Dies Irae,Transformation,"The manipulation of the soul is core to the process of Ewigkeit. You are far from the level of creating such a thing, yet you still possess a certain trick to use when interacting with souls. You are able to take any soul that you are in contact with that is currently without a body of its own and instantly form a suitable physical form for that soul. You can allow the soul’s self-image to form something for it, let random chance decide or specifically direct its physical appearance as you wish. Once formed, the soul will then exist independently, though you can revert this effect at any time with just a thought. You are able to apply this effect to any soul currently within yourself as well, forming it into a separate body outside your own. "
283,,200,Jumbo!,Final Fantasy X,Transformation,"Sometimes, running away just isn’t an option. It’d be nice if you could always run, but when you’re stuck on an airship facing off against a beast with its maw gaping open – well this ability will come in handy. It drains all of your energy to do so, but you can magnify your size by twentyfold for a short period of time, no longer than ten limits. Naturally all of your features will scale accordingly, and thankfully your equipment disappears – but skills you have won’t scale. On the other hand though, those cactus needles you have? They’re now the size of spears; a barrage of those will likely perforate everything in sight. Should you happen to move on and adopt a different form, you’ll still possess this ability in other forms."
284,,200,Devil / Embodiment of Fear(Tier 1),Chainsaw Man,Transformation,"You are a devil, a member of a race of monsters which range from giant beasts to beautiful humanoids and abominations from your worst nightmares. All devils originate from Hell and are given a name upon their birth that represents a fear. The fear they represent dictates their powers, personality, and appearance. The more feared and ancient the name, the stronger the devil.

This purchase grants you the powers of a devil. All devils can regenerate from anything short of death by drinking blood. The rate at which you regenerate depends on your race, with hybrids having the fastest and fiends the slowest. You can design your general powerset, appearance, and otherwise around your tier or make the choice to sacrifice some aspects for others, such as forgoing the parameter boosts in exchange for more potent abilities.

At the start of each Jump you have the option to adjust the effects of this perk to the setting or opt to keep things how they were in this world. For example, a Ninja Devil might be massively stronger in Naruto than they would here but choose to go back to this setting’s level when they visit a world without ninjas.

The first tier allows you to choose any obscure fear to represent such as the fear of tomatoes or pillows. You will be strong enough to take on most civilians and have a few unique characteristics related to your name but little in the way of supernatural powers or abilities. Any Devil Hunter worth their job title will be able to make short work of you, at least if they’re semi-prepared.

Cannot be Taken With Hybrid / Embodiment of Fear(Tier 1), or Fiend / Embodiment of Fear(Tier 1)"
285,,200,Embodiment of Fear(Tier 3),Chainsaw Man,Transformation,"This purchase grants you the powers of a devil. All devils can regenerate from anything short of death by drinking blood.

For example, a Ninja Devil might be massively stronger in Naruto than they would here but choose to go back to this setting’s level when they visit a world without ninjas.

The third tier is when you start becoming a true threat. You represent either a universally understood fear or a more local and potent one. You are sought after for contracts from people all around your country seeking to gain a portion of your power in exchange for life and limb. Includes things like the fear of ghosts, snakes, and curses. You have either one or two extremely potent abilities or an assortment of lesser ones. You might be able to devour other devils and regurgitate them as minions later or cause instant death to those who you pierce a few times. It would take a team of experienced and prepared hunters to take you on with no sacrifices, and you can easily bring down skyscrapers and then some.

Requires Fiend, Hybrid or Devil to Purchase"
286,,200,I turned them into Birds,RWBY,Transformation,"You made a deal with a Wizard and as a result he gifted something to you. You are capable of taking on the form of a small bird of your choice. Existing examples would be a Crow or a Raven but you may also choose to transform into other birds like a Dove, Hawk, Eagle, Canary or some other type of bird. This transformation is at your complete control and takes no longer than a second. Bird themed name is optional.

If asked, perhaps you should clarify that you chose this and no one forced this on you. Just to make sure there are no misunderstandings."
287,,200,Monster General ,Solo Leveling,Transformation,"For an extra 200 CP, you can instead become a boss-type monster. Usually these monsters are located deep in their dungeons in a special room where they may reside either alone or surrounded by bodyguards. Once tribal chiefs or generals of the Monarchs, now these monsters serve as the closing mechanism of the Gates and the last enemy that the Hunters must face in a dungeon, their death triggering its collapse. While regular monsters are already stronger than the human Hunters, boss-type monsters are even more so. An A-Rank boss would require the cooperation of several A-Ranked Hunters to take down, and they could even put in danger a mid-level S-Rank Hunter. An S-Ranked boss-type monster would be a walking natural disaster that could well signal the end of a nation, requiring teams of S-Ranked Hunters, and probably the presence of a National-Ranked Hunter, to be defeated. Boss-type monsters have superior versions of the skills of their race or even their own special abilities that differentiate from them from the rest of their species, such as enhanced magic or the ability to create lesser members of their species, and command a great authority over their lessers and superior tactical abilities. Some of these beings include Goblin Chieftains, Arch Liches or even mighty Ancient Dragons.

You can decide whether you awake in one of the Monarchs’ pocket dimensions with the rest of their armies, or inside one of the dungeons that plague the Earth, that has just broken a few hours ago, is convenient for you. As you were never a prisoner of the Rulers, you are not subjected to their mental command to harm humans, nor are you an automatic enemy of the other monsters, but that doesn’t mean that any of those groups besides those of your same kin will have any special liking to you. And you shouldn’t provoke the ire of your Monarch progenitor, if you value your life.

Requires Monster to Purchase

Note: You start at the level of a D Rank Monster General, or what you would best compare to, whichever is higher. You can train to increase this if you wish."
288,,200,Star Spirit: Living Celestial Body(Abnormal),Avesta of Black and White,Transformation,"If you decide to pay an extra 200 CP, you may go up an additional level, becoming an existence unique, or almost unique, among the Star Spirits. The exact form this gives you is up to you to decide. Perhaps your Star Body is that of a mechanical super-planet that preys on other celestial bodies in order to make itself larger. Or maybe you take the form of a living neutron star, with a gravity field that could threaten even the mighty Demon Kings. Or perhaps you are something even stranger? Maybe you are the first Star Spirit to be born from a Black Hole. As long as it's a celestial object of sorts, you can take it as your body.

Requires Star Spirit: Living Celestial Body to Purchase"
289,,200,Fou Fou,Fate/Grand Order,Transformation,"What a soft, cuddly, cute little thing you are. I’d call you a puppy or a kitty but you seem to be a unique sort of little fluffy animal. Who could imagine you were actually a dangerous dimension traveller? Well, pretty much no one. You can take on the form of a small, fluffy animal of your design at will and when in this form, your true power and true identity is totally hidden from everyone. No matter what they use, they will be unable to discern your abilities, the level of your power or who you truly are, though they might be able to get some hints if they use really roundabout methods. Being in this form does not hinder your abilities either, despite the teensy tiny puppy size of it. You’re just as strong and lethal in your full size as you are when you take on the form of a magical lap kitty."
290,,200,Lighthearted,Library of Ruina: HamHamPangPang,Transformation,"The librarians are not flesh and blood humans, neither are they using full-body prosthetics, rather they are composed out of the Light which is a matter initially gathered and dispersed by L Corp to further Carmen, Ayin, and later Angela’s plans. The Light is shorthand for the light of possibilities, which is why almost anything can be manifested from it within the Library but also why it is more concentrated in people who are potential EGO users or distortions. Since you’re entirely made out of Light this means that you have almost complete control over your outward appearance, and instead of being simply killed you turn into a book, with similar contents to what you kill if you have Book Smarts, you can be reverted from this state by anyone with the intent to do so."
291,,200,Vampire,Kurohime,Transformation,"You have become a vampire, a creature of the night which gains incredible powers when the sun hides its face. Not only are they physically superior to humans in all respects, but they also gain power over blood, able to perform acts such as create golems from the blood of victims or create weapons out of blood."
292,,200,Werewolf,Kurohime,Transformation,"You have become a werewolf, someone cursed to transform under the light of the moon. You don’t actually lose your mind when doing this, but you do gain a savage edge to your thoughts. You transform into a large and vaguely humanoid wolf form capable of shredding human beings to bits with ease. Even in your normal appearance, all of your senses are enhanced. You can also make yourself transform on purpose, even when the moon isn’t up."
293,,200,Plant Person ,Kurohime,Transformation,"You’re a humanoid plant person, similar in general appearance to Barahime before Kurohime drained her youth. You are able to manipulate plants around you, controlling them as though they had muscles and tendons to enable movement. You are also capable of producing plant growth from your body, allowing you to garb yourself in giant flower petals or lash out with branches and vines. The more magical power you have, the more you can create and control. You may similarly absorb plant matter into your body to heal yourself. You do still age, however."
294,,200,Angel,Super Smash Bros. Brawl,Transformation,"As an angel, you are a human-like being, distinguished by the two feathered wings growing from your back. Typically, these wings alone would not be enough for flight, and an Angel would require a Blessing in order to gain the power of flight. Fortunately, by purchasing this species you will always have this Blessing. With it, you are able to fly using your wings for brief spurts. And, as the Blessing is innate, you won’t have to worry about it being taken away by a patron being harmed or changing their mind."
295,,200,Trophy Form,Super Smash Bros. Brawl,Transformation,"You now have access to a special Trophy Form. 

In this form you appear as a life-sized statue with a golden circular base. Regardless of your body’s normal colouration, the statue is made up of shades of grey. The statue’s pose is free for you to determine each time you enter this state. 

When you are defeated in battle, you will be automatically forced into this state. In order to leave this state, another party must touch the statue whilst intending to free you from that state.

Whilst you are in this state, you cannot move or talk, and lack awareness of the world around you. The Percentage System perk, and similar effects, are not active whilst you are in this state. The statue is fairly sturdy; it could be thrown around a bit without being damaged. However, significant damage to the statue will result in your death.

Whilst the above seems disadvantageous, there are a number of benefits to this. First, being forced into this state can protect you from injury and even death caused by your defeat. Second, upon being turned back to your normal form, you will be immediately restored to perfect health.

Lastly, your Trophy Form has opened up a new potential for self-improvement. In this world you can find special Stickers. When these Stickers are applied to the underside of your Trophy Base, you will receive various passive enhancements. Stickers applied cannot overlap, else they will cease to offer a benefit. The strong the effect is, the larger the Sticker, so you will have to manage which effects matter to you. Stickers always remain proportional to your Base; attempting to grow or shrink to modify how much Base you have to work with will have no effect. Strangely, you will be able to add Stickers to your Trophy Base outside your Trophy Form by holding onto a Sticker and willing it into position, and remove Stickers by visualising your Trophy Base and willing a Sticker into your hands. Whilst in your Trophy Form, another party could choose to remove a Sticker and you would be unable to prevent them from doing so.

You can toggle this perk on or off as you like, except when you are in your Trophy Form already. When this perk is toggled off, you will not be forced into your Trophy Form on defeat, but will also not receive the passive bonuses from Sticker on your Base.

For an extra 100cp (undiscounted), you also gain access to an additional, similar transformation. When using this transformation, you will take on the appearance of a Trophy. Unlike the base level of this perk, this form is coloured, not greyed. Whilst you are still rendered immobile, you retain awareness and using any of your powers that do not require you to move. You can also change your size as desired, anywhere from 10 centimetres tall to 2 metres tall (this size change only lasts whilst you are in this transformation). If your natural size is outside this range, then that replaces the upper or lower limit of this size changing as appropriate. You can revert from this transformation at any time.

This extra transformation is considered separate from the base level. You can still be forced into
your Trophy Form from this transformation (and are not forced into this transformation on defeat), and the Percentage System perk can still be applied as normal. Reverting from this transformation does not restore your health, and Stickers cannot be directly accessed via this transformation.

For an additional 100cp on top of that (undiscounted), you can grant either the base level, or both the base and second level, of this perk to any willing target."
296,,200,Youkai,High School DxD,Transformation,"Surprised? As it turns out, the Christian Pantheon is only one of many that are real in this world, though many of the others aren’t openly involved in the events you’re being tossed towards. As this is Asia, however, some youkai of mythology do exist in hiding among humans. Like the other supernatural races, they appear human save for some telltale animal features like ears or a tail which can be hidden at will. In addition to physical abilities based off of their particular race (nekomata are agile like cats, kitsune can control fire, and so on) they have a natural talent towards both Senjutsu and Youjutsu, ki manipulation and their own unique system of magic respectively."
297,,200,Fallen Angel,High School DxD,Transformation,"Many years ago, Angels fell in love with humans and descended from Heaven to lay with them, falling to temptation and becoming unholy Fallen Angels in the process. Not quite Devils but not quite Angels, the Fallen hold a weakness to holy energies and have lost the halos of their loyal counterparts, but keep their light-based weaponry and attacks. Their wings also become blackened instead of the feather-white of their original selves. Many Fallen Angels habitually destroy religious icons of their creator out of spite, though you’re under no obligation to do so unless you just want to fit in. An Angel who falls in-jump becomes one of these...whether or not this can be reversed, it is unknown."
298,,200,Angel,High School DxD,Transformation,"The holy warriors of God from Heaven, the Angels appear akin to humans, save for the ability to manifest wings and a halo. They have similar innate abilities to their Devilish counterparts, along with a weakness against demonic weaponry meant to target or corrupt holiness. Angels receive powerful light-based attacks that smite the wicked and the infernal, and can further refine this with magic and training. However, should they fall to sin or wickedness, or openly consort with Devils, they will become Fallen Angels instead...though, in your case, this risk only exists until the jump is over."
299,,200,Mythical Beast Amber ,Jujutsu Kaisen,Transformation,"Upon activating this technique, you become wreathed in cursed energy, giving you a bestial appearance including features such as claws and horns. More than that, though, your very flesh is reconstructed in order for you to manifest phenomena based on electricity. Your agility is vastly improved due to heightened electrical signals in your brain. Furthermore, you can emit sound waves that attune to the natural frequencies of substances to destroy them that much easier, see through objects with x-ray vision, and fire off electromagnetic waves that vaporise objects irradiated with them. All these and more are available to you in a technique that far exceeds human ability.

There’s one large flaw with this ability, though: it can’t be used more than once. Upon the technique ending due to the user’s cursed energy running out or otherwise, their flesh collapses, killing them instantly. It’s probably best to only use this if you have no other choice, or can somehow avoid death."
300,,200,Hairplane ,Jujutsu Kaisen,Transformation,"A rather strange technique, you’re able to change your hair into the engine and wings of a fighter jet. Somehow this is fully functional, allowing you to fly through the air at speeds incredible speeds, even for a sorcerer. At your fastest, you could hit someone with enough force to send them flying straight through an apartment complex. Unlike a real fighter jet, you can also hover in midair using this, but using this cursed technique has a cost – while active, the rest of your body is much more vulnerable than normal. Damage you would normally be able to take with only a pretty nasty gash (but one you could still keep fighting on in spite of) would become enough to completely take you out of the fight.

Alternatively, you may choose to have your hair become a helicopter’s propeller blade instead. While not as fast as the above option, in exchange you’re able to change the length and rotational speed of your propeller blades, with their sharpness making them a surprisingly effective weapon in melee combat. This comes with the same drawback as the above option, though, your body being less tough while using it."
301,,200,Immortality,Jujutsu Kaisen,Transformation,"You have eternal life – though other means may still kill you as normal, you’ll never die of old age. Unfortunately, you’ll continue to age as normal, though once you leave the limits of a natural lifespan you’ll gradually begin to take on a more and more inhuman appearance. After about five hundred years, though, you will begin to ‘evolve’ into a higher state, becoming more cursed spirit than human. This probably isn’t a good thing though, considering that this evolution will cause your self- awareness to diminish as you become one with the world.

Fortunately, there is a way around this – certain individuals, known as Star Plasma Vessels, will be able to merge with you. You’ll take their body for yourself, replacing their mind and personality with your own, and the aging process will be reset for another several centuries. As someone intrinsically linked to you, you’ll know the general identities of any Star Plasma Vessels in both this Jump and future ones."
302,,200,Cursed Form,Jujutsu Kaisen,Transformation,"While humans and cursed spirits are two entirely separate forms of life, there are some beings who exist in a state between the two. Some, such as the Death Paintings, are quite literally the product of a human mother and curse father. Others, such as Tengen, started off as human but, due to a side effect of their cursed technique or other circumstances, ended up becoming something else entirely. Regardless, these “half-curses” tend to appear much more human than full curses, but possess unique abilities due to the strange nature.

By taking this perk, you gain the abilities possessed by the Death Paintings. These come in two parts. The first of these is the ability to directly convert their cursed energy into blood. As such, it is impossible for you to bleed out so long as you have cursed energy left, and this gives you a lot more ‘material’ to work with if you’re capable of Blood Manipulation. The second of these is that your blood is innately poisonous. Though it’s not particularly lethal, so long as it makes skin contact with someone it will begin to take effect, causing fatigue and their bodies to feel to heavier. You’ll need to either get quite a bit on them, or get it directly into their bloodstream, to start seeing significant effects though.

Alternatively, you may instead have a body similar to Ryomen Sukuna, a form uniquely suited for jujutsu sorcery. By taking this option, you now have two sets of arms, one directly on top of the other, as well as a second mouth in your abdomen, without any of the disadvantages such an unusual bodily structure might carry. As such, you can perform the hand signs involved in certain cursed techniques with one pair of arms while the other remains free for defence, wielding weapons, or anything else, or chant incantations with one mouth while leaving the other free, your heart and lungs remaining unburdened. Naturally, this is a rather large advantage over normal sorcerers, providing a level of versatility they could only dream of. Aside from doubling up on eyes and mouths, you may also have a second pair of eyes underneath your originals.

You may purchase whichever option you didn’t select for an addition 200 CP (undiscounted).

303,,200,Evolution,Legends of Runeterra,Transformation,"Adapt, survive, overcome. You’re able to mimic others creature biology to a limited extend. Each time you copy a creature’s powers, you become a little physically stronger and tougher. By itself it’s a minor boost, but as long that you continue to evolve, you could become really powerful."
304,,200,Undead,Legends of Runeterra,Transformation,"Undead are not uncommon on Runeterra, even if the biggest concentration of them is located on the Shadow Isles. Being an undead has several advantages on being alive, like the lack of biological needs and plethora of unnatural abilities, on top of being extremely hard to kill in general. Normally you’ll raise as a mindless mook, but since you’re paying for this, you’ll return as a fully sentient undead, free from any form of control."
305,,200,Troll ,Legends of Runeterra,Transformation,"The giant trolls are powerful humanoids with blue skin, one of the races that live in the icy lands of Frejlord. They’re as powerful and tough as minotaurs, but possess the ability to heal quickly, which makes them extremely dangerous warriors. They also possess an innate affinity with Ice magic, even if not all cultivate it. You can take the Regeneration Keyword for free."
306,,200,Werecats,Inheritance Cycle,Transformation,"Werecats are sentient creatures with shapeshifting abilities, being able to take on the appearance of either a human or a large, shaggy cat. Whether they migrated to Alagaësia or were native to the land is unknown. They are quite rare: the few who are alive during Eragon's time do not often reveal themselves. Werecats can also command regular cats as well as their own kind."
307,,200,King of Lions,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Transformation,"Such a mighty Saber unleashes it’s roar! You’re much more in touch with the national animal of Saberland, the majestic Lion. They calm in your presence and affectionately cuddle up to you, willingly to listen to almost any request you have. They’ll even come when called, manifesting through magical energy as either the real animal enhanced with your magic or constructs of light that fire explosive rays of energy. Your power over lions extends somewhat to things related to lions, letting you influence people and creatures of similar breed, if only at a weaker level. Finally, you too can take on the form of a mighty Lion, as either a true Lion or a lionsuit of your very own. While like this, your mighty roar can shake the foundations of the earth and cause terror far around. For those unwilling to unleash the roar, such a form also enhances natural strength and gives a wild instinct for battle. 

These Sabers are in touch with their wild side, often displaying cat-like attributes without thinking of them as strange. They love long naps in the sun, a strong preference for bloody meat and will vigorously attempt to knock over any unattended objects left on the edge of tables or desks. Those who go too far into the lion can even lose what makes them human, becoming lions in human form who can only communicate in one way. Gaaaooooo."
308,,200,Herrscher Physiology,Honkai Impact 3rd,Transformation,"A true, fully-mature Herrscher (as originally imagined by the Will of the Honkai) has incredibly high physical capabilities, being damn near godlike in physical capabilities. They are strong enough to lift and throw skyscrapers, move at hypersonic speeds, and cannot be harmed by conventional weaponry (as only attacks containing a significant amount of Honkai Energy are able to even touch them). It requires a Herrscher-Level amount of Honkai Energy to affect a Herrscher as if they were a normal person, and even then, their base durability is high enough to make them able to survive a thermonuclear missile barrage. And that’s if they decide to not use any other defenses beyond their natural durability."
309,,200,Half-Esper,Final Fantasy VI,Transformation,"Humans mixing with Espers is supposed to be impossible for a whole host of reasons. Not the least of which is the massive magical gate at the gateway between worlds kept solidly closed. Or that’s the idea at least. The long standing rule of isolation has been showing signs of cracking lately. And Humans are great at tackling the impossible.

Half-Espers are rare in the extreme. There is currently only one in the whole world and even she isn’t known for what she truly is. It is unknown what kind of talents these individuals would have except in the broadest sense. Half-Espers have a natural affinity for magic and appear Human nearly all of the time. They seem to exhibit some hints of their origin through unnatural hair or eye colors. Divided as they are between two very different worlds, one can surmise it would be common for them to have a hard time fitting in anywhere.

Innate Magic - Your unusual heritage has granted you a connection to magic as a whole. Your magic has two Focuses [Note 1] from which you naturally learn spells more quickly. Additionally, given time you will learn spells even from outside of your Focuses without needing Magicite to teach them to you. This extends to other magic systems you can access in a very limited sense, merely allowing you to learn spells from them a little bit faster."
310,,200,The Great Trickster,God Of War (2018),Transformation,"Like the Loki of myth you are a shapeshifter of great talent, able to change your form into any normal animal and there would be no way to tell that you aren't a normal animal, unless of course you speak or use your magic in front of others. However, much like Atreus the animal you turn into will largely depend on your emotions in the beginning. If you're angry you may turn into a bear for example. This also gives you an odd ability to create children of great power, like Loki with the World Serpent, Fenrir, and Hel in Norse Myth."
311,,200,Shrinking,God Of War (2018),Transformation,"You have found that you can shrink in size and disguise yourself as a human to the senses of other races, only by telling them what you are will they be able to tell that you are a Jottun. But if you are in your true form they can find out on their own what you are so be weary for this power is not infallible."
312,,200,Shapeshifter,God Of War (2018),Transformation,"You are now a shapeshifter of some talent, finding that you are able to turn into nearly any singular natural animal and appear to nearly any means of identification that doesn’t involve looking at your soul to be that animal. This comes with the instincts to do what these animals are able to do (knowing how to fly as a bird when taking its form, the best way to swim as a fish, etc)."
313,,200,Jotunn(Greater),God Of War (2018),Transformation,"A Jotunn!? Here I thought you were all hiding in Jotunheim, waiting for Ragnarok to come. You were a relatively peaceful lot though some of your kind are great, such as Laufey and Jormungandr. Be careful to not be found by the Aesir for they will surly torture you to find a way to enter Jotunheim. Not all Giants are giant and should you choose the free option you would be similar to Laufey, far shorter than the average giant but still possessing enough power to fight against a minor Aesir with relative ease. For 200 CP you are a greater giant around the size of Thamur (or Sutr), though possessing a greater gift for combat than your smaller brethren, having the potential to require several realms to come together in order to kill you. You also receive a discount on the Divine Physiology perk.

314,,200,Orb of a Serpent,Thailand Mythology and Folklore,Transformation,"What a shiny orb you have. Ocean blue, seemingly made of blue jade, and almost thrumming with energy, this is the orb of a Naga, essentially their heart, carefully harvested to retain their power. What is this power? Shapeshifting, and fairly freeform at that. It lets the nagas, who have the lower bodies of snakes, turn into humans, animals, furniture, or essentially any object they can think of. And now that you possess the orb, you can utilize this power as well. Needless to say, this would be invaluable for spies and infiltrators, and can generally be a fun ability to play around with. It has to be on your person to maintain the shapeshifting, though, as the moment it’s separated from you by more than about half a meter you’re instantly turned back to your true form. You can also give it to other people so they can use the orb’s power too. Perhaps you could implant it within your body? It did use to be the actual heart of a Naga, after all."
315,,200,Animal form,The Song of the Nibelungs,Transformation,You know the magic that allows you to transform into a common animal like an otter or a pike. In this form you can somehow still be almost as skilled as if you had your own hands at your own disposal. Beware of hungry gods looking for an easy meal if you are in this form!
316,,200,Anon’s Internet Defense Force,HighSchool DxD,Transformation,"The Evil Piece system is a centerpiece of how Devils gain prestige and is how Peerages are formed. A single High-Class Devil is designated as the ‘King’, and they choose up to 15 servants to fill the role of the other pieces on the board. The chosen Pieces receive a boost to their base abilities in a way fitting their role - Rooks are strong and durable, but relatively slow, Bishops are able to cast more powerful magic but exhausted themselves if they overuse this, and so forth. Purchasing this gives you a set of Evil Pieces that you can use to turn others into your demonic peerage, these pieces are even capable of ‘reincarnating’ a recently dead or dying individual. Your peerage will become Followers, maintaining the properties of their original race on top of the natural gifts of devils. This only works on that particular person once and doesn’t work on Angels or similar ‘holy’ beings, nor on Gods."
317,,200,Chick-Fil-A,HighSchool DxD,Transformation,"If things progress a certain way, Angels will soon be adopting a system similar to the Evil Pieces of Devils, creating a pseudo-peerage of Reincarnated Angels using cards instead of chess pieces. Whether from intuition or experimentation, you’re obtained early access to this system - you can reincarnate people, even the recently dead or dying individuals into Angels in a process identical to Reincarnated Devils, turning them into followers in the process. Much like its counterpart, this doesn’t work on Devils, Fallen Angels, Gods, or beings akin to them, nor does it work on the same being more than once. While adopting the 12 Card system will be up to the passage of time or further experimentation on your part, these Reincarnated Angels are purified of any corruption they had in life and are opened to the idea of God...or, if they’re not a religious sort, the idea that there is more to strive for and good they can do in their lives."
318,,200,Dragon(Five Dragon Kings),HighSchool DxD,Transformation,"Dragons are one of the staples and most iconic races in this world. Or at least they used to be. They aren’t as numerous as they once were, but the remaining ones are all strong, and the ones sitting at the pinnacle of strength are also Dragons. Creatures that represent power itself, there’s no one in the supernatural world that doesn’t know about them. Utterly free and selfish, their purity of thought compels them to give their all in everything they do. Greedy, lustful, prideful, and so on, all dragons possess the famous Dragon Breath depending on their individual element, an ‘Outrage Mode’ that drastically increases their abilities fueled by rage and anger until either they or their enemies are dead, and a ‘Dragon Aura’ that’s said to attract powerful allies and enemies, rivals and lovers. All dragons have a limitless lifespan, as a dragon doesn't age after reaching maturity and will only die if they are killed, which is extremely difficult without great power, or something attuned to Dragon-Slaying. Likewise, their magic affinity is the greatest out of all supernatural creatures.

You have three price options here, for 300cp you can choose to become a ‘mid-level’ dragon, on the verge of becoming a high level one in raw power. For 500cp you can become instead a dragon on par with the Five Dragon Kings or even surpassing them depending on your other choices.

It is composed of only female warriors. Half-Gods born in Asgard and trained to become Valkyries are here, although technically any female could learn and train to become one. They possess extraordinary magic prowess and are experts in the runic magic of the Norse Pantheon. They’re very much into ‘heroes’."
320,,200,Reincarnated Devil,HighSchool DxD,Transformation,"The Evil Pieces worked wonders in what repopulating devilkin concerns, at least on paper. Reincarnated Devils are those that used to be of another race and then got transformed into Devils by taking one of the Evil Pieces (pawn, bishop, knight, rook, or queen) of their new King. As such, you retain the original abilities of your race, but also gain the characteristics of a devil, including lifespan, magic, language, wings, and weakness to holy stuff. While they start as ‘Low Class Devils’ with time and training they can become as well regarded and influential as any Pure Blood Devil. They are linked to their King however, which might be good or bad depending on who that is. By default, you’re a reincarnated human, but you can pay the price of any other race, except God and Angel, to be your original one and keep their characteristics."
321,,200,Mass of Flesh,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Transformation,"Humans have a number of specialized organs for specific functions. A brain for thinking, a heart for moving blood around, etc. The Eldritch horde does not suffer the same issue. The Eldritch Things' cells are able to function as whatever they need to to keep the creatures alive. While this does mean that you functionally don't have weakpoints, sufficient damage to your body will still kill you as each function must still be performed and your cells can simply perform any task not every task."
322,,200,Fire Giant ,Elden Ring - Liurnia of the Lakes,Transformation,"The mortal enemies of the Erdtree, you are one of the worshippers of a fel god of ruinous fire. Being amongst the largest creatures in all the Lands Between, as well as possessing strength and vitality beyond that of your lesser kin, you possess an innate connection to fire. Due to the connection with the fel god, your torso can also act as a second face, one capable of spewing out plumes of deadly flame."
323,,200,Beastwoman,Fate/Legends - Baba Yaga,Transformation,"It appears you may have some strange ancestry. Should you wish it, your blood has some ancestry to a fantastical creature. Perhaps to a Giant like Nastasia the beloved of a certain Bogatyr? In any case this grants you to begin with some animalistic features which you can decide for yourself how this is seen. Maybe through a set of cat ears and a tail to match. Some additional boons are also part of this purchase depending on what it is you are related to. To once again use the example of Nastasia you would gain increased strength and an affinity for nature and animals. This ancestry is also of great help against anything that ought to harm humans more than anything else, giving you resistance to such weapons and powers that are supposed to be precisely more useful and dangerous against mankind."
324,,200,Yaga,Fate/Legends - Baba Yaga,Transformation,"In a different time this would have been the key to survival, if not living, allowing at least a meagre 10 % of Russia's population to endure the most extreme. You are now a Yaga, appearance wise a humanoid wolf, with all the benefits that entails. Physically you are superior to a normal human in many ways, able to haul large beasts on your back like it was nothing. Your arteries if cut would simply reconnect themselves and your body quickly produces more blood if you are ever lacking, making bleeding out something you need not fear. Furthermore your new form is very resilient to extreme colds, even harsh blizzards, ensuring you can’t die from these temperatures. Your resilience even extends to physical torture, though not immune or unbreakable. As powerful as you are you do require one thing much more. Food. You need several times the calories per day as the average human, meaning you would starve to death within three days. But you know how it is when strong and weak meet..."
325,,200,Legacy of the Former Empires(200)        ,Godbound,Transformation,"Many of the Former Empires explored certain paradigms of transhumanism in the pursuit of public wellbeing, religious ideals or simply for the sake of power. You yourself are the legacy of one such experiment, and more importantly by some miracle your extradimensional nature has stabilised the complex rituals, augmentations and arcane components that are normally heavily dependent on natural law. Not only will you not have to fear a catastrophic failure of bodily systems from any Celestial Engine malfunctioning that would not threaten a baseline human, but your traits are genetic and can be passed onto your offspring.

For 200 CP you have an exceptional bloodline on par with the Oasian royalty’s. One inherently above what is the norm for humans, but only just, and some supernatural traits resembling lesser miracles. The inhumanly beautiful and symmetrical Senai family of Ancalia is one such example. Each is a great beauty by human standards, such that most men will not offer life-threatening violence to one without orders or an immediately compelling reason. They have a crude empathy as well, and can charm others to offer them favours and wait on them hand and foot for a day in exchange for some plausible hope of reward. Another family, the Tilahuns, are gigantic specimens seven feet tall with the strength of four men. With some effort, they can do the work of four harnessed oxen instead and use their magical strength to carry extreme loads without fear of being bogged down or having lifted objects collapse under their own weight. The Kalay, whose blood is the lineage of kings, are all wiser than most men and can see in the dark like a cat. They cannot be surprised without magical effects, can tell when someone is trying to deceive them and gain intuitive knowledge from a fragment of a deeper mystery. Be warned that some bloodlines of this world have minor flaws, like a bloodthirst or physical deformity.

And yes, you can repurchase either option if you wish to have many such bloodlines invested in you along with whatever Words come with them.

Regardless of what order of such beings you are here, several traits are inherent to horrors such as you. You have some sort of means to strike bargains with the reckless and curious, whether secrets from beyond the borders of the real or liberty from conventional magic’s constraints. Furthermore entropy curdles around you like a foul black flame. With the dreaded Black Consumption, you can negate powers on the level of a Godbound’s Gift or miracle for a short while. The chilling Cold Breath on the other hand makes it harder for all manner of divine powers to be used in your presence not allied to those of Uncreated Night like your own.

All such powers become more powerful proportionate to your overall divine power.

Though having one or two dread powers like making your foes oblivious to their actions’ consequences or animalistic claws and teeth, you would be of little consequence to the Godbound without your entropic touch. That, and the fact that you bear a perverse shadow of a Word as your power, always in some way anathema to the natural order.

And Animas are artificial spirits, ones created by theurgy or theotechnical engineering for forgotten roles. You yourself now have the qualities of spirit, being normally insubstantial but able to inhabit an appropriate material shell with some effort. Eidolons tend to possess humans while Elementals shape a lump of the appropriate material or energy, and Anima are normally bound to a certain created body.

In truth the Many-Skinned are experiments by the Former Empires, either human bloodlines tainted with polymorphic potential or new creations lit with human souls. Whether you were one of those obscene experiments, received a particularly virulent curse or had a stroke of luck with some obscure ritual, you too have gained the mystical power to adopt the form, voice and clothing of any humanoid within three to eight feet after several seconds. Your resilient to mind-altering or reading effects is considerable, and your will can further enhance it. You do not age, and over the centuries your combative training manifests as a few lesser Gifts from the Sword, Deception or Alacrity Words alongside your supernatural fleetness in combat. As a bonus for your investment here, while your kind are generally programmed with a compulsion to kill for masters that no longer exist, for you that programming has been disabled."
331,,200,Inheritors of a Ruined Heaven(Parasite God),Godbound,Transformation,"Heaven is a broken house, torn apart from the violence of the Made Gods and the damage done to its celestial engines. Whether you shake in rage for what was done to it, creak wearily when your joints are not serviced properly or shiver for the next iota of faith you are an immortal, mighty threat to an entire pantheon of novice Godbound. Yet that is cold comfort when everything you once valued lies in rubble. You may have been cast down by force or cling to an uncertain existence, but your wrath is still great enough to punish those who would take what little you have left.

Whatever your nature, your very being is endowed with a divine force that can threaten an entire pantheon of the Godbound shared only by the most powerful of Eldritches and Uncreated. Short of the most dramatically focused and powerful forms of mundane damage, generally only supernatural forces have a hope of harming you. Spells, Gifts and magic swords would qualify. Like Eldritches and Uncreated, the lesser specimens among you can be harmed by open flame too; you are not especially vulnerable to them and likely can easily nullify flame as a threat with even passive Gifts or casual miracles, but unlike bullets and avalanches it can actually hurt you. Even Eldritches, generally the least resilient of such beings, would take something like sticking their heads in the muzzle of a magnetic cannon to receive harm from the mundane. In turn, all your attacks always count as magical weapons for the purpose of overcoming similar defences like the resilience of the Godbound-and whether with stronger spells or unnatural might, strike with more damage than mundane adversaries. Like the Godbound, your divine constitution also lets you shrug off certain supernatural effects as a “saving throw”.

Are you a Parasite God? For 200 CP, you can be. A human or animal struck by stray sparks from one of Heaven’s broken engines, nourished by the energies meant for the maintenance of natural law which grants you the power of one Word of Creation. You have a terrible thirst for celestial energy, with even the most noble of your kind giving into addiction within a few years-obsessing with elaborate edifices of worship and brutal, follower-consuming rituals. Your scant minor powers are primarily geared for visceral survival like functional insectile wings, extending razor-sharp limps that can be cracked like a whip made of steel chain and gouts of acid. Be aware your imperfect communion with your divine Word prevents you from creating Paradises as Godbound and other higher beings can. While more specialised in nature than the Godbound, you have a greater capacity for immediate growth simply by devouring divine energy of all sorts. As you grow in power you weaken the natural laws of the land with your appetite, spoiling it with cysts of dangerous magic and open sores. You are a lesser specimen of your kind, merely two to three times the size of your former self and marked in form by the Word you were haphazardly tainted by...for now, at least."

Unlike other Blades you may come across in your travels, this crystal does not act as a sole weak point on your body; your form can still be harmed as it would have been if you did not take this modifier. As a Blade, you will not age physically, allowing you to live indefinitely as long as you aren’t killed.

You do not require a Driver to maintain your form, and you will not become a Titan regardless of how long you live. However, as you do not physically age, this means that if you choose to take a younger form that is not fully developed (such as the cheaper version of Giant Koopa) you will not be able to grow beyond that state, even after the jump ends.

The weapon obtained from your purchase of the Legendary Weapon Set item is your Blade weapon. Should it ever be lost or destroyed, you are able to recreate it at will, with little effort on your part. If you acquired multiple weapons from the Legendary Weapon Set, then you must choose which of them will be your Blade weapon (this decision is made upon purchase of this Species Modifier).

Lastly, using your Blade weapon, and working together with another, you are able to deliver a very powerful attack. Whilst other Blades would require a Driver for such a technique, this is not the case for you. Instead, the other party must be someone with whom you have developed a strong, shared trust. Performing these attacks is exhausting to both you and the other party, making it unlikely you will be able to do it more than once in a given fight.

333,,200,Pokémon(Boosted),Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Transformation,"Choose any officially recognized Pokémon species; you are now that species. Choose up to four Moves which can be learned by your species of Pokémon (whether this would be via breeding, tutoring, TMs, or natural learning does not matter). You gain Super Smash Bros.-style versions of these Moves.

Should you choose a species more powerful than the Smash version of Mewtwo, you are capped at the level of Fighter Mewtwo. Any moves you have chosen are capped at the level of an average Fighter’s special.

If your chosen species is capable of Mega Evolution, for an additional 200cp (500cp total), you gain the ability to Mega Evolve into the Mega Evolution of your species. You do not need a Key Stone or a Mega Stone to do this. At first, you can only maintain this form for a single attack, but with training you may learn to hold it for up to a couple of minutes. Your Mega Evolution is capped at the power of the Smash Bros. appearance of Mega Mewtwo Y. Should you be a species with two Mega Evolved forms, you must choose which form you can Mega Evolve into upon purchase of your species.

If your chosen species is Greninja, for an additional 200cp (500cp total), you gain the ability to transform into Ash-Greninja. You do not need a trainer in order to do this. At first, you can only maintain this form for a single attack, but with training you may learn to hold it for up to a couple of minutes.

Alternatively, for an additional 200cp (500cp total), you gain the ability to perform a powerful Z-Move, in line with Incineroar’s Max Malicious Moonsault (if you picked Incineroar as your species, it may actually be Max Malicious Moonsault). You do not need a Z Crystal or a Z-Ring/Z-Power Ring in order to do this. Performing this move is extremely exhausting to you, and as such it is unlikely you will be able to do so more than once within a single fight. 

You may choose only one of the above three options.

334,,200,Metamorphmagus,Wizarding World,Transformation,"A Metamorphmagus is someone who was born with a rather rare magical ability. More specifically, they are people born with the ability to change their physical appearance through will alone, requiring neither spells nor potions, unlike the rest of the world. As mentioned before, it is rather rare but fortunately for you, you are a Metamorphmagus now.

The extent of your new abilities allows you to mimic the size and shape of just about anyone, be they someone as beautiful as the lovely Veela or someone as grizzled and battle-damaged as one Mad-Eye Moody. In fact, you already have enough skill that you can even form parts of your body to things that are not entirely human, things such as a duck’s bill for a mouth, just as an example. With a bit more creativity, who knows what you could do in the future?"
335,,200,Animagus,Wizarding World,Transformation,"An Animagus is a witch or wizard capable of transforming themselves into a certain animal and back to human form at will. Unlike normal Transfiguration however, an Animagus’ transformation can be done seamlessly, requiring neither the use of a spell nor a wand and of course, an Animagus is capable of communicating with other animals when transformed. Becoming an Animagus is difficult and tedious, but many would say that the advantages of becoming one are well worth it.

Fortunately for you, unlike many others, you have the option to skip past the dangerous and months-long process required to become an Animagus. This is an especially useful thing if you’re a werewolf since you probably won’t be able to go through the entire process at all. Of course, if you choose this, you get to decide what your Animagus form is. No magical creatures though. Only non-magical beasts are available to you. Extinct creatures are fair game though."
336,,200,Part-Veela,Wizarding World,Transformation,"Beauty is a magic all of its own and there are few quite as beautiful as the Veela. Perhaps that is how they entranced your own ancestor given that you are now half-Veela. And as befitting of one with Veela heritage, whether male or female, you are astonishingly beautiful, moving with perfectly flawless grace regardless of the circumstances. And with your supernatural allure, permeating every inch of your body and even your voice, your beauty shall only be made more apparent to those around you, distracting and attracting those of the opposite sex who do not have the will to resist such a beauty.

But beauty is not the only magic the Veela possess. While full-blooded Veela are capable of transforming into devilish harpy-like forms and tossing about fireballs, you possess only a magical affinity for fire, making it a bit easier for you to learn such spells and abilities."
337,,200,A Touch of the Wolf,Wizarding World,Transformation,"Werewolves are said to be monsters of the worst kind, preying on the good children of witches and wizards everywhere. While such a thing is an exaggeration even in the worst of times, you seem to have been the victim of one such attack. Fortunately, you were lucky enough to be scarred rather than bitten. Rather than being a werewolf yourself, you’ve only taken on a few of their traits, like a particular appetite for rare steaks. But let’s move onto your more important traits.

Like a certain monster of a wolf, you now have a considerably more bestial appearance. Your teeth are closer to fangs and your muscles have been made more defined. And this is not just for show. With this, you are clearly above most of your kind when it comes to brute strength and speed. But do not be too hasty. Such strength and speed alone shall not be enough when faced against any properly trained witch or wizard. Still, every advantage counts. 

Be careful not to let others know of your new lycanthropic abilities. Werewolves have never had the best reputation around here and the only other person like you has a reputation even worse."

Being amongst the largest creatures in all the Lands Between, as well as possessing strength and vitality beyond that of your lesser kin, you possess an innate connection to fire. Due to the connection with the fel god, your torso can also act as a second face, one capable of spewing out plumes of deadly flame."

340,,200,Giant Stature ,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Transformation,"Many can be seen standing heads and shoulders above the average members of their races, towering over them like an Archtree. You are one such example, being nearly twice as tall as before. This will also see an increase in both your strength and durability, being able to lift a steel ball the size of your body above your head all day with little strain. Additionally, your stature will in no way hinder your speed or agility, being just as swift as you were before."
341,,200,Stone Scales,Dark Souls: Covenants,Transformation,"The source of the Everlasting Dragon’s immortality, the stone scales that adorn their hides. But such scales, now found on yourself, do not just offer one everlasting life. You will find yourself much more durable than before, and very resistant to fire, though you will find that even such scales will do nothing to resist lightning."
342,,200,Merperson,Disney’s The Little Mermaid,Transformation,"As a merperson, you are half human, and half fish. You can choose the colour of your mermaid tail on purchase of this species. Your human half affords you a great deal of manual dexterity, but you are also a swift swimmer far beyond ordinary humans. You are able to talk to humans, but also sea creatures (including fish and crabs) and some water-adjacent birds (including seagulls and penguins). You can breathe both underwater and on land, but your mermaid tail makes actually living on land impractical at best and impossible at worst."
343,,200,Artificial Vampire,Hellsing Ultimate Abridged,Transformation,"Really scraping the bottom of the barrel here, aren’t we? You are the bootleg dvd of vampires; like the factory-made foot soldiers that make up Millenium’s ground forces. You can’t make new vampires, only mindless ghouls. You can’t absorb souls or employ any of the stranger abilities of a True Vampire. And on top of all that, you still need to quench your bloodthirst, and you’re still weak to holy and silvered weapons, as well as just overwhelming amounts of damage. That said, you’ve still got some potent physical advantages. You can run fast enough to match fleeing automobiles, have a healing factor that will let you walk off small arms fire or an airship crash, and have all the natural weapons commonly found in the most dangerous supernatural predators on the planet. You may be a small fry compared to the heavy hitters of this world, but you have more than enough power to slaughter ordinary humans like the cattle they are."
344,,200,Purebred,Wizards of Waverly Place,Transformation,"In this world, there exist two types of werewolves, mutts and purebreds, you appear to be the latter. You are like a traditional werewolf, possessing three forms: a human form, a half human and half wolf form, and a full wolf form. You possess all the powers of a werewolf, and since you are paying with your CP, you can transform at will, and can control yourself in transformed states.

345,,200,Phoenix ,Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,Transformation,"The noble Phoenix is a mighty creature who possesses the power of flames and rebirth. The Phoenix is a mythical red feathered avian creature a few feet long. The phoenix is capable of flying at high speeds through the air. If the Phoenix is slain it can be reborn from its ashes. You will be capable of using this ability as well should you purchase this race. Next, as previously mentioned the phoenix possesses powerful abilities to manipulate fire. The flames of the phoenix were easily capable of burning the magical plants throughout the Dark Forest demonstrating their destructive potential. Lastly, you will possess all other abilities said to be possessed by the phoenix in its legends."
346,,200,Witch   ,Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,Transformation,"Witches are a race of green skinned humanoids predominantly female. Most of them use brooms to fly, wear pointy hats, and are recognized by their evil cackle. The two main weaknesses that the witches possess are water and shamanism. Water is capable of melting a witch while shamanism is capable of driving them off due to their darker innate energy. Being a witch however, does come with some boons. The most notable is a large amount of magical energy, the innate ability to use magic, and enhanced durability. Lastly, if you wish you may remain normal looking rather than gaining green skin as some witches are known to resemble normal humans."
347,,200,Myriad Appearances,Disney’s Hercules,Transformation,"Spirits don’t really have all that much of a fixed shape, per se. You’re pretty ridiculously malleable, able to look like just about anything you can think of near your size. Depending on how big your natural form is, you can change everything about yourself while remaining close to the constraints of that form. That is, someone the size of a human child could appear about as big as six feet or so, and vice-versa.

Within these limits, you can change your colour, shape, features, everything. You can appear as people, animals, even objects if you want."
348,,200,Spirit,Disney’s Hercules,Transformation ,"You’re a spirit, maybe of nature or of the underworld, or maybe you represent a particular element or concept. You serve the gods, either directly or as a sort of freelancer they make use of now and then. You’re ageless and quite a bit more durable against injury and disease, but you do require sustenance and barring perk purchases, it doesn’t take that much more violence than normal to kill you."

350,,200,Self Shapeshifting,Marvel Magic,Transformation ,"You are you, no matter the form you take or the shape you wear. However, some forms are particularly suited for you, being near as natural to slip into as any other. You have the innate ability to shapeshift into forms that are you in some manner. You could shapeshift into an opposite-gendered version of yourself or take the form of a fox or even a humanoid fox of an opposite-gendered humanoid fox. However, such forms will always be you, whether it you as a woman or you as an animal or you as an elf, it will still be you as you would be in that form. It is impossible to use this to take the form of another individual."
351,,200,Demon,Marvel Magic,Transformation ,"​Demon isn’t a term meant to describe one uniform group of beings. Rather, it encompasses an incredibly diverse range of magical beings. Your appearance is largely up to you, allowing you to appear as anything from living flame to a classical demon with horns and bat wings to basically human or even something more bizarre such as a multi-headed snake. The only restriction is your base size must be between that of a squirrel and an average car. Your nature means that you’re likely to be at least several times stronger than a human as well as having natural talent with magic and more personal power to call on than humans. If you wish, you may instead choose to be the offspring of a demon and a human, with your natural form appearing to be a human but possessing the ability to take on more demoniac features when calling on your power or feeling anger."
352,,200,Elemental Evil        ,Ghost Rider,Transformation ,"Your form is composed of one of the four classical elements; air, earth, fire, or water. You are able to freely travel through your element, can produce small amounts of your element to attack at range, and you can fly or avoid attacks by taking on a less concentrated form of your element (air is self-explanatory; earth is dust, fire is smoke, and water is mist)."
353,,200,The Mighty Jumper,Marvel Primal,Transformation ,"Asgardians are far stronger than mortal men, tougher and able to exert themselves longer. Some, like Odin, are even mightier. Your strength and physical abilities are a peer with the royal line of Asgard."
354,,200,Elemental(800) ,World War Hulk,Transformation ,"You can now bend the very elements to your will. Whether it’s lighting, fire, or, wind you can wield this element as if it was a part of you. For 400cp your mastery of your element is equal to that of Storm and the Human Torch. But, for 600cp you can now match the likes of Thor in terms of power and skill. However, for 800cp you don’t just wield your element you can become it as well becoming even more powerful and impervious to physical damage.

355,,200,Shadow Monster,Thor: Love and Thunder,Transformation ,"Inky, big, scary, and full of sharp teeth. You are the spawn of All-Black. You’re a creature of darkness, easily the size of a large house. In addition to being a monster of myth easily able to contend against Asgardians, you may travel through shadows, as can all those borne of the Necrosword. As long as you are touching shadows, you may slip through and emerge at any point where darkness exists, or just hide in the void. Taking this means you have some control over your form and may design your monstrous form as you please - but it has to be set now, and you may not change it afterward. You are significantly more intelligent than your ilk, as you’ll retain your mind instead of engaging in their animalistic behavior. This also means that Gorr can’t boss you around because he holds the Necrosword."
356,,200,Dragon(Tier 4) ,Pet Avengers,Transformation ,"You are a dragon. By default this makes you one of the Flock like Lockheed; this means you can fly, breathe fire, and communicate telepathically. This will also generally increase your physical capabilities somewhat, generally speaking similar to one Tier higher, with your fire breath hitting with enough force to make you a bit more of a threat even then. Coupled with Behemoth you could be a full and credible threat to many of the human Avengers. You may choose to have another type of breath weapon than fire, such as lightning, cold, acidic gas, or a sonic scream; this cannot include esoteric effects like transforming people or manipulating time, only roughly equivalent damaging effects.

Tier 4 Behemoth: You go beyond merely some tiger or similar threat to a human. You are a creature on a scale like a dinosaur. Large enough to put down even a saber-tooth tiger easily and physically dangerous enough it counts as a superpower. Like with Apex you are stronger, tougher, and better than would normally be expected for your species.

359,,200,Changeling(200) ,Marvel 2099,Transformation ,"You possess the ability to shapeshift, taking on the forms of other entities whose genetic material you have touched. This only works on biological forms, and won’t allow you to copy techno-organics or energy beings, and can only increase or reduce your size from that of a mouse to that of an elephant; though if you’re larger or smaller than a human this will scale relative to your own size. This does not copy superpowers, even those that are genetically linked; while you might get increased strength by copying a larger form, you would not gain a mutant’s powers by touching them. Once you have copied a form you can retain it permanently."
360,,200,Asgardian(200),Avengers Vs X-Men,Transformation ,"Hailing from mighty Asgard, you are one of the Gods themselves. A very minor one perhaps but you still possess that divine spark, deep within your being. Average Asgardians like yourself are still powerful beings. You possess physical power and speed well beyond any mortal man, able to lift thirty tons and travel faster than most cars. Your lifespan reaches into the thousands of years, helped along by a fairly powerful healing factor. As an Asgardian, you are also well versed in the combat arts and have access to the Allspeak, an ability that allows for you to understand and be understood in the speech of all races of the universe.

This can be purchased three times; the first limits you to humanoid appearances, as well as mimicking clothing and voices; you can also change the shape of your limbs, turning your hand into a hammer, for example. The second allows you to shift into Earth animals, up to the size of an elephant, and even allows you to hybridize those forms. The final purchase is the most versatile, allowing you to take on any form you can imagine, with your total mass being limited to that of an elephants or your own mass, whichever is greater.

362,,200,Mutation(200),Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Transformation ,"Not necessarily as a result of being a mutant or mutate, your body has been altered significantly in some way. For 200 CP this mutation can be more substantial, with the caveat that it’s within reason and that it doesn’t overlap with the powers purchased here. Extra organs or limbs, or even removing the need for an organ (with the exception of the brain on both counts) are possible, as are having acidic spit or blood, bone claws, or a prehensile tail. "
363,,200,Homunculus,Fate/Zero,Transformation ,"You are an artificial human created by the Einzbern family, or someone who stole those techniques from them. This has imbued you with greater physical and magical power than most modern humans can even imagine. Your physical attributes are almost at the peak of human ability and your Magical Circuits number 200 in total. You also have an impressive affinity for magic in general, improving the speed with which you learn it. You may freely choose to take on an albino appearance, with very pale skin, white hair and red eyes, but you will not suffer any of the drawbacks of being albino nor the other associated penalties of being a Homunculus, such as limited lifespans."
364,,200,Swine Snout,Darkest Dungeon,Transformation ,"“Life… the greatest treasure of all.” The Warrens; a festering pit of malevolent flesh and horrific disease, overrun by the Ancestor’s attempts to beckon beings from beyond the Outer Spheres. Somehow, something from this ancient network of tunnels and aqueducts has… changed you. Not mentally, but even now your body has taken on more porcine features. A snout-like nose and anabundance of insulating, protective body fat over thickened muscles are the most obvious changes, but despite your decidedly unhealthy appearance your altered body actually has a fair bit of resistance to toxins and disease- although being bled out might be a bit easier now due to your body’s increased girth. Your weight may also make you less nimble, and the appetite of even a half-swine is far harder to sate than that of most humans- assuming that you’re pickier than they are
at mealtime.

Boosted: With Abominable Transformation you can become even more like the
denizens of the Warrens when you wish. Traits you may develop include even stronger muscles and leathery skin, tusks, and corrosive, diseased stomach acid. Or you could even have your lower body replaced with the torso of a pig, like the fabled Swinetaur. In any case the increased virility of the swine throughout your body will also amplify their sluggish gait and gluttonous stomach that you’ve inherited, not to mention their grotesqueness- but it’s a small price to pay considering the amount of raw power this will grant you in return, even if you need to eat a few more meals worth of provisions at dinner

365,,200,Pelagic Embrace,Darkest Dungeon,Transformation ,"“At last, wholesome marine life can flourish- if indeed there is such a thing.” One of the terrifying secrets of the fish folk lurking in the cove is that some of their number were not born from the ocean, nor their abyssal matriarch. No, although it is little known- or understood- some of these pelagic beings were once men; twisted in body and mind by the festering bite of one of their fellow fish men. Despite being bitten or otherwise infected in a different manner the sea’s voice does not call to you, though you’ve still started to undergo some lesser changes. Beneath your first few layers of skin is a silvery scaled membrane, which not only provides a bit of protection from blows but is also resistant to being bled. Gills have appeared somewhere on your body through which you can breathe underwater, and your fingers have contorted into talons strong enough to peel human flesh- and yet are still just human enough to clutch a weapon. However, breathing is harder on the surface than it is in water or in the damp, salty air of the Cove, making it harder to move with as much finesse and speed. This can be mitigated by carrying a supply of salt water to wet your body and gills with, but although free (aside from the cost of flasks) an extra provision may prove troublesome on longer expeditions. You are also more vulnerable to the poisons, acids, and other
blights of land due to your physiology. 

Boosted: With Abominable Transformation your metamorphosis can be completed- turning you into one of the denizens of the deep. This form, inspired by aquatic life, will still be roughly humanoid but may take inspiration from any water-dwelling fish, arthropod, or invertebrate. Piranha, octopus, crab, angler fish, slug… your abilities in this form will depend heavily on what you choose. Choosing a shark would certainly allow you to bite through flesh with ease, while lobsters would benefit from both their hard carapace and their gigantic claws. Other fish that lack such features may instead gain even greater strength and speed.

366,,200,Fungal Growth,Darkest Dungeon,Transformation ,"“There is method in the wild corruption here. It bears a form both wretched and malevolent.” A pestilence has spread throughout the nearby woods; a spreading plague of spores and mushrooms that take control of the body, turning living beings into infested ghouls that seek only to propagate the spores further. This parasitic fungal infection would normally be deadly- or would be a fate worse than death, if the poor souls are still alive despite the growths overtaking their body- but as you might expect they’ve taken on a more symbiotic bent after hosting in your flesh. Mushrooms have begun to sprout up across your body, and you’ll soon find that they lessen the effect of poison and disease drastically. Although they won’t provide much more protection than that, you will also gain the ability to unleash a cloud of spores upon your foes- blighting them with the same eldritch fungus, which will have decidedly less friendly immediate effects on their body. Poisoning is the least of what will happen as the spores cloud the air, making it harder for them to see and certainly making them vulnerable as they gasp for untainted air. However, do be careful about friendly fire- the spores you emit aren’t exactly discriminating in terms of who they will infect, and while the mushrooms aren’t immediately lethal they do tend to spread unpredictably- and having one sprout from your face isn’t at all pleasant should your allies inadvertently become infected with your spores. 

Boosted: With Abominable Transformation you can accelerate the growth of the mushrooms throughout your body, transforming your head and arms into growths made entirely out of fungus. Although this won’t give you a
mean right hook, it will drastically increase the potency of your spores- allowing you to temporarily control those you’ve infected with them until their system manages to flush them out, which usually gives you enough time to have them make at least one attack against their own allies. If you happen to have a corpse handy then you can even grow a type of necrotic fungus on it, which will regularly release spores onto your foes that will prevent them from healing damage through any manner of restoration- at least until the mushroom is destroyed. The downside is the same as they were before- the spores affect anyone hit with them, friend or foe.

367,,200,Raised Dead,Darkest Dungeon,Transformation ,"“Back across the Styx- Boatman be damned!” Intelligent undead are not unheard of; the Necromancers who haunt the Ruins are but one example. Even the skeletons have those among them who are capable of more strategic thinking. And, through some foul necromantic ritual- similar to what was done to give the Necromancers their eternal unlife- you have been raised from the dead with your intelligence intact. Though, unlike most undead you feel no enmity towards the living that you did not possess in life. More similar to a ghoul than the skeletons that wander the halls your unliving vitality nonetheless makes you far more resilient to physical damage. Bleeding and blight is still a concern, however diseases no longer affect you (though you may still carry them). And while you still require sustenance you do not need to sleep, making you an easy choice to keep watch during the night. However, the downside of being undead is that the Light has become anathema to you. Prayer, meditation, and flagellation offer no relief, and the blessings of those aligned with the Light burn your flesh rather than mend it- if you can even convince the religious to adventure alongside you. Instead you must look to more surgical or eldritch methods of healing during expeditions; thankfully, the fell energies animating you will heal most non-lethal wounds after a week. Though keep in mind that dismemberment, decapitation, organ damage, etc. still count as “deadly” for you despite your undead nature. 

Boosted: With Abominable Transformation your metamorphosis into one of the undead will be completed in one of  two ways. Should you wish to retain your flesh still, you will find your body contorting due to the fell energies infusing it- making you much taller, thinner, and yet also stronger; your fingers contorting into rending claws. Discarding your muscle and sinew on the other hand will neither make you stronger nor weaker; naturally you will no longer require food, and a creature without blood cannot bleed- though acid and poison can still damage your bones. However lacking muscle, fat, and other fleshy things will make you much lighter than you were before. Wearing heavy armor can compensate for this, but it’s likely that you’ll be far easier to toss around or move in battle even so.

A creature entirely made of a sentient corrosive liquid, that can eat and dissolve dragons in an instant, and even quickly absorb a Seija if they are weakened and distracted enough. By consuming more biomass, you can grow in size, although at any moment you can shrink down to the size and shape of a human child, regardless of how large your ‘true’ self has actually grown into. You can also store things inside of yourself and keep them safe regardless of how much your size changes.

Your shape is not limited to blob or humanoid, you can extend your tentacles for several hundred meters if you have enough mass, and even take complex shapes like a 3D map. This is also aided by the fact that you can ‘see’ from every part of your body.

Finally, as long as even a drop of your body remains, you will remain alive. Although you will need to be given some extra biomass and mana to be operational again if you are reduced to that state. Unlike the current Evil Slime, you don’t lose your ‘inconvenient’ memories after receiving a strong impact."
372,,200,Internal Crucible,Generic Alchemist,Transformation ,"You have the ability to use what you have ingested in order to perform alchemical processes within your own body, allowing you to create alchemical products using only your body as a medium. The resulting product can either be expelled from your body or used to affect yourself immediately on creation. Only materials ingested within the last 24 hours are viable for this. Additionally, your jaws, teeth, and digestive tract are more resilient, allowing you to safely consume and draw sustenance from a much wider variety of materials."
373,,200,Artificial,League of Legends,Transformation ,"As technology marches forward at a breakneck pace, the understanding of wizards, chemists, and engineers alike approaches the realm of creating life itself. You are one such creation- Either a biological experiment born in a tube, a normal creature changed by magic or medicine, or a robotic lifeform given a mind by the mysterious magic that animates you. You possess incredible strength and durability. Biological experiments will usually possess an incredible healing factor as well, while mechanical ones usually possess magical power to match their mechanical might."
374,,200,Undead,League of Legends,Transformation ,"Not alive, but not dead either, the Undead hail from the shadow isles-Although there are members of other nations capable in necromancy, the vast majority of independent undead come from the Shadow Isles. A spirit inhabiting an inanimate body, usually either a suit of armor or the corpse of their former body, the Undead come in many variations. One thing remains true for all of them, however- They need not sleep, eat, or breathe, they persist for as long as their physical body is not destroyed, and they are driven by a singular desire- Domination, vengeance, or perhaps something else entirely"
375,,200,Fae Physiology,A Throne of Glass,Transformation ,"You are Fae, with supernatural physical abilities, enhanced senses, and quickened healing. You are the greatest natural race to be found on this world. You will live for millennia and are ageless and unweakened by time for so long as you do not fade. With the ability to shapeshift into a single animal (taking all you wear with you), and a natural affinity to magic, your race is strong and feared by many humans around the world for your great strength. You receive the Magic perk for free, as Fae possess a more common, and usually deeper connection to magic than Humans."
376,,200,Demi-Fae Physiology,A Throne of Glass,Transformation ,"The half- blooded offspring of Fae and Human, Demi-Fae share in many of their Fae parent’s strengths but not all. Not all Demi-Fae share in the supernatural strength, agility, and speed of the Fae. Along with their supernatural speed of healing, and preternatural senses on par with animals. While all Demi-Fae share in some degree of long life the duration varies along with their magical power, and Demi-Fae unlike their Fae parent are not guaranteed access to the power. You also gain the ability to shapeshift into a mortal animal regardless of how much magical power you have, this mortal animal could be any warm-blooded creature from a lion to a human to a hawk. Your abilities as a Demi-Fae depend on the amount of magic you buy within this jump. Should you only have the General Magic perk you could expect to settle and live for around three centuries, with physical abilities at around 1/2 to 2/3 of a true Fae, and the ability to shapeshift into an animal. If you were to get the Touch of Hellas or any 600 cp magic perk you would have physical abilities and lifespan equivalent to that of a true Fae."
377,,200,Witch Physiology,A Throne of Glass,Transformation ,"Witches come in two varieties, Ironteeth who take more after their demonic Valg heritage, and Crochan who follow more in the mold of their Fae heritage. When you buy this perk you must choose which of the two varieties you are.

All witches are immortal, and have a clear secondary eyelid that they may close to fly at high speeds, allowing them to see with the eyelid only slightly blurring their vision. All witches are able to craft magical items with the most potent of their items taking something from them and diminishing the witch permanently. All witches as they grow to be several centuries old gain the ability to see beyond themselves. Locations near and far, the past, the present, and the future are able to be potentially pried apart by a dedicated witch. Witches use mirrors as a focus for this ability. All witches are supernaturally strong and fast with senses of sight, smell, and hearing on par with animals, they also heal supernaturally quickly. They in general can be considered to be about on par with Fae.

Ironteeth witches have natural razor sharp iron teeth and claws that can be extended to cover their teeth and fingernails at will, with their nail coverings several inches long, enough to block swords. These iron teeth and claws are naturally razor sharp along with being supernaturally strong compared to normal iron, closer to the best steel in existence. Ironteeth witches are also able to make use of one type of magic, called the Yielding, it is where the witch gives herself over to the magic and burns herself up from the inside out, exploding in a suicide bomb of extremely potent ripping magic, able to eradicate about 30 nearby people if they were locked in combat, with the range and power expanding with the witch’s power. The yielding comes in two varieties, a pitch black power for those cruel witches who embody the Darkness inside them, or a searing white power for those witches who truly try to be good people. Ironteeth come in 3 varieties, the Blueblood Clan who embody the Maiden, the Blackbeak Clan who embody the Matron, and the Yellowlegs Clan with their saffron coloured ankles who embody the Crone.

Crochan witches do not have iron teeth or claws, nor do they have the Yielding. They are naturally able to use magic limited to glamours and healing, though potent nonetheless. Crochan witches have also been shown to be able to lay curses with their dying breath, powered by their life force if they are strong enough. Normally Crochan Witches can be male or female, while Ironteeth are only female. As you are paying for this with CP you can be any gender for any kind of Witch."
378,,200,I am the Alpha,Super Dragon Sword ,Transformation ,"It’s time to show everyone what the wild can do. You are capable of transforming into a form chosen upon picking this option, one that resembles a non-magical beast. However, this form is at least 5 times larger with the power of one that you could call a “King” - often being momentously powerful in speed and strength, often capable of commanding and bestowing their lesser counterparts with a measure of their strength, and having an Element infused into their being they are capable of utilizing in their attacks and actions."
379,,200,Transformed in Soul,Super Dragon Sword ,Transformation ,"You may expend a substantial portion of mana to transform yourself, gaining the innate features of one of the Heritages from the Eidolon generation section, chosen when you take this Job Perk. This transformation lasts for a few minutes, which should be enough time to finish any fights. This transformation increases your natural chance of becoming Godwoken, which stacks with any other abilities increasing your chances of losing control."
380,,200,Transformed in Body,Super Dragon Sword ,Transformation ,"You may expend a substantial portion of mana to transform your own innate life energy, gaining one of the 400-point Powers of one of the Affinities from the Eidolon generation section, chosen when you take this Job Perk. This new form lasts for a few minutes, as staying much longer may result in becoming permanently Godwoken. This transformation increases your natural innate chance of becoming Godwoken, which stacks with any other abilities increasing your chances of losing control."
381,,200,Of the Nevernever,Dresden Files,Transformation ,"Rather similar to the Minor Power option above, but for beings of the Nevernever. You can be a Fae of very minor power, or a Demon, or some other shade of minor being from the Nevernever. You don’t have many bargains to your name, and no real Mantle, but you’re in the right place to start rising."
382,,200,Changeling(Big Trouble),The Dresden Files,Transformation ,"One of your parents was a vanilla mortal. The other one was a Faerie straight out of the Nevernever, and now you're caught between both worlds. While you might look like a normal person, if maybe a bit of an odd one, you've got access to a lot of your faerie parent's power. That power comes at a cost, though: the more you call on, the more you'll be drawn towards their nature, until the point where you take all of it and you stop being a human permanently. So, which of the myriad creatures of the Nevernever did the deed? Depends on how much you want to spend.

Well, looks like your faerie ancestor wasn't just anyone; you're related to one of the toughest and nastiest creatures in the Nevernever. Maybe the Leanansidhe dropped you off in an orphanage, maybe the Eldest Gruff had a wild night, or maybe Cait Sith... no, don't want to think about that one. These guys are the movers and shakers of the Nevernever, and have downright scary levels of power you can call on, but it's got some serious downsides. Even if you can resist the siren call of all that power, Faerie is going to take note of the fact that you exist, and odds are damn good you were sired for a reason.

Requires Changeling(Serious Business)(The Dresden Files) & Creature Features(The Dresden Files) to Purchase"
383,,200,"""Take Flight""",Dark Souls 3,Transformation ,"Not all demons are born equal. To tell the truth, demons can take on a wide variety of appearance. Some demons have gifts others do not possess, and you possess one. By purchasing this perk, you gain a small pair of functional, albeit twisted and fleshy, wings. While their small size means they can't grant you true flight, they do have curious power. No matter how heavy you become, the wings can give you at least a few seconds of lift before needing a quick rest, and can be used to safely glide all the way to the ground from high altitudes even when tired. You can also banish and summon them as you wish."
384,,200,Absolute Unit,Dark Souls 2,Transformation ,"“Giants are great and mighty, at least compared to humanity, which appears diminutive. As with other warriors however, you are a giant with extreme and powerful mass. You gain additional mass, density and power within your frame, giving you bulk befitting your strength and weight that ranges on the absurd for your size. Stone cudgels and boulders as large as yourself may be swung with the ease a man swings a stick. This purchase is more effective for giants than other races, as their stone bodies benefit far more from the density and body mass. A single stomp from their greater weight would register as more lethal than a trained knight’s swing of a sword.”"
385,,200,Blood Hound ,Bloodborne,Transformation ,"“Blood starving monsters are prowling the streets, looking for the next hunk of warm flesh with which to rip asunder, and slake that thirst. Beasts can smell a meal a mile away, and will chase it down like their lives depended on it. They will no longer be the only gifted predator. 

Without transforming or giving your inner beast quarter, you are able to borrow two of their strengths, the first being their agility. This allows you to run twice as fast as any normal human while leaping over obstacles, assuring only the most slippery can lose you in a chase. 

The other is their nose, letting you pick up and identify scents in your surroundings with such ease that you could potentially fight while blind. Beware that your abilities don’t go to your head, running headlong into death, or exposing your nose to overwhelming scents.”"
386,,200,Fire Giant,Elden Ring,Transformation ,"In ancient times, the giants were the mortal enemies of the Erdtree. Their bellowing desolated nature, triggered avalanches and whipped up storms of flame. But now their lands are no more, devastated by the Shattering and even their seemingly ever-burning, volcano-sized forge cooling to smouldering embers. And yet, all but the greatest warriors would be fools to challenge you. Slightly taller than a troll and much more muscled, you are a red- haired humanoid with wild red hair, stony grey skin-and an inherent gift for generating flame and wielding it with various magics, and the fell god from which they borrowed power that yet inhabits your kind somehow. Unusually among the races of this land your torso doubles as a second, fully functional face capable of belching the same flames that issue from your arms like a raging volcano. For all that your kind lost the war, none would doubt it was hard- fought; so tenacious and enduring are you that you can severe and cauterise limbs to empower your gifts of flame-and fight on, in the heat of battle."
387,,200,Animagus,Harry Potter,Transformation ,"You are an Animagus, allowing you to change into an animal at will. You may choose any non-magic animal as your alternate form."
388,,200,Self Transfiguration,Fantastic Beasts & Where to Find Them,Transformation ,You may not be a true animagus but you have such a foundation that you doubt it would take you long to learn. You have a particular proficiency for transfiguring your own body parts to take on the appearance and qualities of animals you’ve encountered. This discipline while dangerous and tricky in the hands of another comes to you exceptionally easy and with minimal risk.
389,,200,Moment of Craving,MtG - Ixalan,Transformation,"The blessing of the Dusk Rose, you are a Vampire. Humanoids with pale complexions and pointed ears, they are capable of seeing in the darkness, resisting disease and dark magic’s bite, as well as capable of draining the life out of others in order to maintain their own youth and restore their vitality. Their nature gives them enhanced effectiveness at the blood magic and shadow magic often used by the Dusk Legion’s priests."
390,,200,Wild Twist,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Transformation,"The Wilds’ denizens are known for their strange, powerful, and odd natural gifts. While an exhaustive list of these gifts is for another place and another time, a few stand out examples include massive man-shredding jaws that bite, curled armor-piercing claws that catch, natural toxins that can kill 3 men to a spoonful, firey breath enough to reduce a knight to ash, and wings allowing you to take to the air. 

May be purchased multiple times."
391,,200,Bonecrusher Giant,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Transformation,"Natives of Garenbrig before it was considered part of the realm, giants are incredibly large humanoids and possess magical strength that goes beyond even what their great size would suggest - some honor the realm and its search for virtue, while others deride anything beyond strength as senseless frippery."
392,,200,Faerie Vandal,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Transformation,"The faeries of Eldraine are rather diverse, but most of them can boil down to being tiny to small humanoids with or without wings (unless you have Wild Twist, assume the latter) that adore trickery, thievery, and occasionally guide humans - to their doom or salvation is based on whim."
393,,200,Vampire ,MtG - Homelands,Transformation,"Sired either by the Baron himself or one of the vampires of his bloodline, you have joined the undead ranks of the Sengir vampires. Eternal (un)life is yours, along with unnatural physical strength and the power of flight. It’s not all upsides though, as your condition has cursed you with a hungering need for blood and a sensitivity to direct sunlight.

By default you appear as human-seeming as your progenitor, with only pale skin and slightly elongated fangs giving away your condition. But if you’d prefer, you may be further removed from the baron himself, your bloodline degenerated over the centuries and generations. You would be similarly powerful, but appear a feral-seeming creature with pointed ears, long claws, visible red veins, and perhaps even bat-like wings instead of magical flight."
394,,200,Beast Walker,MtG - Homelands,Transformation,"The beast walkers are a sort of secret order, one that has existed for nearly as long as Aysen has. They hail from towns and villages all over the nation, and they are devoted to protecting their home from harm through covert means. While they are competent fighters, the true worth of these secretive men and women is shown while they roam the roads and coasts of Aysen, watching for the Barons' minions or any signs of trouble or conflict. You have all the skills necessary to keep a constant, but discrete, watch over the roads of a kingdom and communicate with your fellow beast walkers. But more than that, you’ve been taught the secret skills considered only a rumour by most people of Aysen. Using these spells, you can turn into a bear or crow with only a quick bit of magic. In times of great danger, it is these spells your fellows use to transform themselves into crows, fly to the aviary at Onella, and report to the current Falconer."
395,,200,Voldaren Decadence,MtG - Innistrad,Transformation,"Like the progenitor of the Voldaren house, Olivia, you are able to throw truly decadent parties that will be enjoyed by all those you wish to entertain... Hopefully, this will exclude the foul games that provide the entertainment at these parties. If even half the rumors are true, they are more animals than the creatures they can become – tales tell of them turning into large wolves, bats, and even rats."
396,,200,Lycanthropy,MtG - Innistrad,Transformation,"The lycanthropes, werewolves, are a cursed people. Their souls split between man and beast after the first hunt where the wild flowed in. Why would you wish this upon yourself? Werewolves transform under the moon into savage killing machines. This can be fought using Avacyn's holy magic, but even that fails at the full moon. and the werewolf must be pious and repentant. Unlike the wantons, more beast than man, embracing the wolf in all its savagery, leaving civilization and prayer to return to it again. This perk also allows you to summon wolves for one mote of green mana each. Post jump this transformation becomes optional but you will need to gain control yourself."
397,,200,RUNNING WITH THE WOLVES ,Wolfwalkers,Transformation,"A Wolfwalker is not just another wolf, but an exceptional one. You are faster, jump higher and farther and your senses are more acute. You can feel vibrations from the ground to pinpoint motion at a great distance, your hearing is sharper, your sense of smell can paint a crude portrait of shapes. If you focus on a scent, you can see it as a glowing trail in the air. Your jaws can puncture steel plate and shatter swords."
398,,200,Imuchakk,Magi: The Adventure of Sinbad,Transformation,"The Imuchakk are a tribe well suited for the frigid, hostile environments of the north. Aside from their blue hair, the most striking trait of an Imuchakk is their sheer size – even child Imuchakk stand as tall as an average man, and most adults tower well over two metres tall with enough muscle to put even the greatest of bodybuilders to shame. As such, you are stronger than even the mightiest of regular men, capable of breaking through stone walls, overpowering hulking monsters, and holding back several powerful soldiers at once with your bare hands. You also happen to be tough enough to take attacks of similar strength without falling.

It should be mentioned, though, that the Imuchakk aren’t only blessed with incredible strength. As a result of your muscles being far more efficient at storing oxygen than a normal person’s, you can hold your breath for more than an hour. Furthermore, the skin of the Imuchakk is similar in texture to that of whales and their body hair creates bubbles of air while underwater. Both of these work in tandem to reduce the effect of friction on your body while underwater, allowing you to swim with incredible speed and ease, to the point where others would describe you as invincible when fighting in water."
399,,200,Drops of Deception,Fate/Extra CCC,Transformation ,"How wretched. A horrible thing. A skinwalker even, a dangerous predator that could lurk within the face of anyone you know. You now have a particular ability, one that lets you act as someone else basically indefinitely, should you kill them and consume their data, their mind and soul. Once you do this, you’ll be able to take the shape and form of your victim, and you’ll be able to act perfectly like them. Like this, you count as whoever your victim was, for spiritual or magical purposes. You’d be completely indistinguishable, to the point not even the Moon Cell would be able to realize that you’re behind a mask. You’ll be able to imitate the abilities of your victim to some degree, too, but you won’t be able to push them further, you’ll be stuck with exactly what you obtained, and you won’t be able to replicate any abilities that would be beyond you normally. You could bide your time for as long as you wanted in an essential position, to gather information or to simply hide, although once you drop the act and shed the stolen form, you won’t be able to use it again, as your victim would be long dead already. What are you even planning to do with this?"
400,,200,Appearance Customization,Fate/Extra,Transformation ,"Personalised Avatars are all the rage these days. Well, they would be if you weren't fighting for your life at least. In any case, you've learned how to customise your appearance to an extent. You can't do drastic things like becoming a dragon, but as long as it is reasonably human-like, you could make yourself look like it. You can also apply this effect to armour, weapons or even magic, though you'll only be able to recolour them. "
401,,200,Red Rage,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Transformation ,"The classic expression of what an Oni is, power and rage and stature to crush any mortal man. Only
the great heroes could stand to these towers beasts, such as what you’ve become. Your body can
transform to an extent now, able to change into an innocent, child-like form without losing your
normal power or increasing your size and musculature to grotesque extents to gain more power, turning into a monster that grows as your magical power does. Beyond this outward expression of
power, you can tap into the same demonic fury that gives Oni like Ibaraki their names, a raging state
that greatly increases your physical power. While initially you retain control, the more you loosen
your hold, the greater the benefit you’ll gain and the more horrendous your appearance becomes."
402,,200,Shape-Changing Spirit,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Transformation ,"The form of a youkai is not a singularly defined thing, not limited to just one manifestation. Many of
these beings have the ability to adjust their form, though few can do it to the level you begin to
unlock. Innately, you are now able to morph and warp your physical form. At first, this is between
humanly possible forms and sizes, allowing you to take one on if you currently lack one. With time
and practice, you’ll be able to extend this shapeshifting to more extreme sizes, as well as to various
animal forms and even monstrous shapes. It’s easiest to grow this towards things you have an
affinity for, such as fox forms for any kitsune. Additionally, you’ll find that you have a great talent for
any kind of magic that manipulates the forms of living beings. With a small amount of work, you can
even learn to combine your new natural shapeshifting ability with magic you are able to cast, letting
you change the shape of your spells or even make the magic you cast appear as yourself, creating
easy decoys or turning touch activated spells into illusory images of yourself. "
403,,200,Age of Monsters(Deadly Creature),Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Transformation ,"In the Age of Gods, humanity is just one of many great kinds of creature. Far from the rulers of the
planet, they share with many powerful creatures. Some as intelligent as they, some relying only on
raw power and strange abilities to get by. At times, these creatures can even mate with humans to
produce half-breeds with traits of both, a not uncommon sight in ancient times. The following perk
offers several different tiers to represent different species that you may become a part of.

The tier of the Divine Beasts and similarly powerful beasts, creatures looked back on in awe by those
from the modern day. Lesser dragons like the Tarrasque which possess great strength and near
impregnable armor. Demons of the desert which even the Hassan often fear to tread near. Powerful
sphinxes who’s starry bodies can threaten entire armies of trained soldiers. Powers are potent and notable even in the Age of Gods but not without limit. Defeating you would be a feat worthy of
legend but still a possible one, albeit very difficult, for great warriors and wizards.

405,,200,Uchide no Kozuchi ,Golden Sky Stories,Transformation,"A mallet of fortune, whose original owner has been lost in the annals of folklore and mythology, this tool is believed to have once been in the hands of a fortune god. Strangely enough however, bearing it doesn’t seem to make you feel any luckier. Instead, strange size manipulating magic has been woven into the hammer, and it seems that whatever this hits may grow twice its size, or shrink by half. This effect doesn’t stack however, but you can freely shift the size within the range by tapping the target with the mallet again."

The Belt itself seems to come with the Driver On, Connect, Barrier and Chain Magic Rings. If the user has a source of Mana or usable magic, they can activate the Driver On and transform into a Kamen Rider Mage. Though not as magically or physically powerful as the unique Drivers with Enslaved Phantoms as their power source, they provide quite a bit of strength and they allow the use of Magic Rings...As a bonus, they have a built-in weapon in the form of a Scratch Nail, a sharp gauntlet that can carve through enemies like Dustards and Ghouls in a few swipes of the hand.

Your skin is now a dull shade of green, blue or red, your eyes glow a bright shade of yellow, and your physical might is a fair bit beyond olympic gold medalists. You also have a special elemental gimmick; choose between an affinity for a certain element of magic (check the notes), or forsake elemental attacks and triple the strength bonus this perk provides. Contrary to most zombie movies, the zombies of this universe don’t turn people by biting them. The process of creation is unknown, though it’s almost certain that even if they didn’t create them, the ZPCI are most certainly propagating the virus.

Even if people were usually immortal in the Silver Millennium, it only extended the lifespan. People could be killed. Thus, a replacement for the senshi was needed in case they died in their dangerous job. That job fell to their children. Chibi-Usa inherited her power from her mother. You may find that your duty can be passed down too. If you ever possess a power that must be accessed via a transformation, your kids will also have this ability to transform into a magical warrior themselves. They also possess an intuitive grasp of some mundane skills you learned, but they will need training to develop these skills and powers. Big, powerful forms are not included, if it would not be something a magical warrior could transform into, it wouldn’t be inherited.

409,,200,Most Common Superpower,DC Comics,Transformation,"Superheroes are larger than life, that’s just a statement of fact. They don’t look like the average
man or woman off the street, they’re...super. And so are you. You are quite simply attractive enough to have your visage immortalized inmyth and legend. Between a chiseled and appealing body, a winning smile, a natural charisma
and charm as well as a lovely, lovely voice and body language that radiates strength your
aesthetics are on the verge of being a bonafide low level superpower. This is the sort of beauty
that would be considered appropriate for the legendary heroes of Greek myth, the most divinely
charming of demigods or “acceptable” in Heaven. And in a rather understated example, it’s this
level of charm that makes Superman’s handsomeness so apparent that villains have been
known to yell about it while running away from him. Not only is he the gold standard to the
general public’s approval of metahumans, in some iterations of his own cousin unconsciously
recognize him as their ideal man and unsurprisingly many villainesses are unable to keep their
hands off him."

414,,200,Jump Pearl Voice ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Transformation,"Deep inside of you, there is a melody calling out in your heart, a fantastic poetry that needs you to bring it to life! ♫ There are only supposed to be seven princesses, but Jump-chan decided to make an exception. By activating your pearl with the catchphrase, “Jump Pearl Voice,” your pearl turns into a microphone and you undergo a transformation into a human, magical girl. You can maintain this form even underwater. Now your songs are truly magical – and I mean literally! Evil people and those devoted to darkness will find your songs incredibly painful, and take damage as if you were directly attacking them. The songs also have the effect of dispelling hypnotic effects on victims, creating a protective shield of sorts around the singers, and other special abilities. If enough passion and power is put into the songs, there is even enough power to summon or dispel tsunamis. However, if you take enough damage or use up enough of your energy, the transformation ceases and you return to your normal self. In addition, while you can sing songs you already know, the perk does not come with the ability to invent songs; mermaids instinctively know certain songs, but others you will have to be taught by someone. If the perk is used by a species that is not a mermaid and lacks a pearl, you manifest your microphone in some other manner, such as from a part of your body.
"
415,,200,Adult Mode ,Lyrical Nanoha,Transformation,"Power with age is problematic, especially if you’re in a much younger body than you’re used to having...or worse, stuck in a child-like form forever. Things like muscle movements, dexterity, and so on may not really follow you that well when you’re barely the height of an adult human’s waist, too. This fixes that problem. You may now spend a small amount of mana to change into an ‘adult form’, which reflects your physical body in its prime in terms of age (or the nearest ‘adult’ equivalent), which will let you use said abilities without fear of a diminutive form holding you back. Even outside of this ‘adult form’, your physical and mental abilities still function as though you were in said prime, which can create quite a shock for someone who thought arm-wrestling a child was a good idea, and lets you retain abilities that would be lost with young or old age. Note that abilities or powers that specifically grow with age don’t apply here - merely things that would be held back by a juvenile or elderly form.
"
416,,200,Animal Form ,Lyrical Nanoha,Transformation,"A shapeshifter, huh? You have the ability to change from your human form into that of a magical animal, no bigger than twice your size, no smaller than a mouse. A ferret, a dire wolf, or something a bit more fantastic...you may even be able to change into other forms aside from the one you start with, after some practice. Note that while you can change your physical traits, this usually won’t give you a magical abilities associated with that form - a big dragon would get the strength and reptilian biology, but wouldn’t breathe fire on their own, for example. Go forth, Jumper, and be the adorable ferret you want to be.
"
417,,200,Form of the Queen ,Generic MG,Transformation,"This isn’t a form, but a super mode for whatever form you currently have. You grow taller, more regal, and more commanding in presence. Your clothes follow suit. In this form your allies gain clarity of thought and strength of will from your presence. In addition, your strength increases by half again from activating this form.

You can maintain this form for a few hours at first, and will need to take a long break if you overdo it. The time you can spend in this form will extend with use.
"
418,,200,Form of the Toy ,Generic MG,Transformation,"Let’s face it, if you have to assist your magical girl while in school and you’re some small cute animal, you’re probably going to run into trouble from the rules.

This makes you smaller, cuter, and completely unremarkable. If you activate this mode while as a human, you’ll wind up as a child. If you activate it in an animal form, you’ll wind up as a smaller version or potentially looking like a plush toy.

But this mode does make you magically and physically weaker, so if you need to fight you should probably drop this.
"
419,,200,Form of the Monster ,Generic MG,Transformation,"This isn’t a form, but a super mode for whatever form you currently have. You grow bulkier, more fearsome, and possess a more intimidating presence. Your clothes follow suit. In this form your enemies lose their nerves and confidence in your presence. In addition, your strength increases by half again from activating this form.

You can maintain this form for a few hours at first, and will need to take a long break if you overdo it. The time you can spend in this form will extend with use.

"
420,,200,Work-Life Balance - High Tier,Generic MG,Transformation,"Most magical girls have no ability to mix their transformed and untransformed modes. Once they lose the frilly outfit, they are nothing more than ordinary girls.

You are different.

For 200 CP, there is no difference between your transformed and untransformed state, except for your appearance. And there is no difference between your alt-forms, except appearance.
"
421,,200,Trapped In Another's Form,Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask,Transformation,"What a terrible night for a curse! And yet, that appears to be exactly what has befallen you. Trapped inside a form that does not belong to you, cut off from all your equipment, weak, defensele - OW! Did you just shoot explosive spit at me? How did you even know you had that? Well, as you can clearly see you’re the kind to adapt easily to different shapes and skills - maybe this curse won’t be so bad after all? Being trapped in a body not your own won’t slow you down all that much, and lesser curses might bend a tad to let you get away with far more than they ought to allow.
"
422,,200,Transmutation ,TES: Magic,Transformation,"It is a commonly believed rumor that all mages are capable of
turning anything into pure gold. It's a lie, of course, but not a baseless one, as proven by
your skill. You have been trained in the art of transmutation, allowing you to change iron
into silver, silver into gold, and back again. This skill affects both the raw materials and
refined products. With a lot of training and experimentation, there is no limit to what you
might be able to transmute."
423,,200,Undead Lich ,The Elder Scrolls,Transformation,"You have followed in the footsteps of the King of Worms, and performed a necromantic ritual that transformed you into a lich. In addition to being able to 'live' indefinitely, you are immune to any damage not magical in nature, or dealt from silver or Daedric weaponry. Whether you appear as you did before the ritual, or took on a more skeletal form is up to you."
424,,200,Hircine's Ring ,The Elder Scrolls,Transformation,"A Daedric Artifact of Hircine, Daedric Prince of the Hunt, takes the form of a silver ring with a wolf's head. This grants the wearer the ability to transform into a bestial form similar to a Werebeast. Should you already be a Werebeast, then this not only allows you a greater degree of control for your transformation, it removes any drawbacks you would have as a Werebeast."
425,,200,Shadow Hawk ,The Dragon Prince,Transformation,"You’ve got mail! Six magic arrows, tie a letter to one and give it a name, then loose. The arrow will transform into a magic hawk that will home in on the intended recipient, delivering your note."
426,,200,God,MtG - Amonkhet,Transformation,"Unlike the canon Amonkhet, this version originally had a ninth god - you. Towering over mortals and practically indestructible, you are a living, animal-headed manifestation of the ley lines that cover the world. Part of the fabric of the plane itself. Unlike your siblings, you have broken free of the subtle spells that bind you to the dragon’s will. Be careful not to let Bontu the Glorified learn of this. Post-jump your divine self becomes an alt-form."
427,,200,Aven,MtG - Amonkhet,Transformation,"Unlike Aven elsewhere, the aven of Amonkhet are almost identical to humans, except for the presence of their wings and their ibis or falcon like heads. As one of these beings, you can take to their air as naturally as you can walk."
428,,200,Hybridisation,Bleach,Transformation,"Spirit particles, for all that they often seem indistinguishable from physical matter in the mortal
world, do not work on the same principles. One of the best examples of this is what happens when
two spiritual species come together as one. The result is not an infertile mutant or weakened cripple
but something quite incredible. There are many kinds of racial hybrids in this world, and many
different ways to make them. Every purchase of this option will let you pick another of the above race options for free. As to the actual races, how you combine is up to you, balancing various benefits and flaws. The most basic is to simply become a natural member of each race at once, having access to all natural
abilities and potential from the start, but with no added power from this hybridisation. Other
options can range wildly. Something like the Vizard, turning one or more of your additional races into a temporary power up, giving a large increase in power and temporary access to some racial abilities, but at the cost of no
access to such powers outside of your brief transformation. These might be unlocked in time, the
tradeoff for an initial benefit.
It’s even possible that your hybridisation might result in a new race taking aspects of both, with new
abilities made from the fusion of both. While the potential and originality can be tempting, you’d
also be left to discover your abilities from the beginning with no one to help, being the first of your
kind. Feel free to get creative but try to keep your choices balanced against these examples. If a choice
has a particular benefit, try to make for a change off elsewhere. There are no limits to how many
races you can hybridise into your mix, beyond the maximum present in the jump.

429,,300,Mutated Physiology,Akame ga Kill!,Transformation,"Around the world, there are several cases of
people being born with mutated physiologies despite having no special heritage that
could explain such a phenomenon. In many cases, these individuals with unique
mutations are considered freaks or even feared as monsters and tend to have
horrible fates, such as the Oarburgh Clan's maids that were sold by their parents to a
circus while they were still children.
In theory, as these mutations seem to spontaneously appear in a bloodline despite
we only having two known examples, they probably aren’t restricted only to humans
and can happen with Danger Beasts too. Regardless if you’re a human or a beast,
you’re one of such individuals, however, the mutation you possess depends on
which version of this perk you take. You can purchase both versions if you want to.
For 100 CP, you’ll share the same mutation possessed
by Cassandra and will have been naturally born with an
extra pair of perfectly functional arms that you can
control without any issue. Any fighting style you know
will also be perfectly adapted in order to integrate your
extra arms on them, ensuring that their effectiveness will
increase or at least remain the same as before.
Additionally, any alt-form you possess may have the
number of arms (or other equivalent appendage like
front paws) multiplied by two. For example, if you have a
Tetramand alt-form, you may have eight arms instead of
the species’ characteristic four arms. As a bonus, any
clothes you possess may be altered to fit your extra limbs.
Alternatively, for 300 CP, you’ll instead
possess the same mutation displayed by
Gilberda. While you look exactly like any
other regular human (or a regular
member of whatever species you’re a
member of), your muscular constitution is
abnormal, with your muscles being a few
times denser and more powerful that of a
regular human, giving you superhuman
levels of strength. Even now, without any
training, your strength is already above peak human levels, allowing you to
physically overpower large beasts with ease, however, this is only the beginning, as
the mutation grants you an innate potential to fully unlock your brain limiters through
regular training. This will allow you to eventually reach a level of brute strength (and
the endurance and durability needed to properly wield this level of strength) that
surpasses the physical strength possessed by the members of the Elite Seven. At
this point, you would be able to easily overpower gigantic danger beasts with your
bare fists alone and even demolish an entire building single-handed."
430,,300,Hybrid Physiology,Akame ga Kill!,Transformation,"Since your childhood, you displayed unique powers
that many mistook as blessings from God, however, the origin of your powers is due
to the fact that you’re a rare Human-Danger Beast Hybrid, with them being inherited
from your Danger Beast parent. You don’t need to worry about your mentality and
humanity being affected by your monster half and you’re mostly free to pick the
ability you received from the blood of Danger Beast running in your veins, but it
needs to stay on par with the other two known hybrids. For example, Yorihime’s
heritage grants her the unique ability to manipulate, control and create immensely
powerful fire with incredibly high heat from her own body, possibly even matching the
power of an average elemental type Teigu if mastered, while the Lord of the Path of
Peace possess the ability to heal others, which possibly isn’t too powerful/useful, as
well as the ability to have prophetic visions of future events.
A possibility of abilities you can choose is a basic tier of regeneration and biological
immortality or you could have a more powerful form of regeneration but, in
exchange, you’d still age instead. Optionally, you might have some cosmetic, simple
sign of your Danger Beast heritage, such as a mark in one of your eyes for example."
431,,300,Genetic Library,Generic Superpower Supplement,Transformation,"If you come into skin contact with a member of another species, you may add it's genetic code to your library, which you can freely replicate/transform into at will (note, this only works with purely biological functions. While you might be able to replicate kryptonian physiology, you would be unable to replicate any supernatural features of a species). Additionally, this Genetic Library can randomly generate viable gene sequences that, if synthesised, would allow you to create a diverse but compatible sustainable community of your selected race."
432,,300,Multitude of Faces,Rapturous Rhapsody Jump,Transformation,"There are a few different mutants capable of altering their appearance. The most skilled
amongst them however is Mystique without a doubt. Her shapeshifting allows her to
freely transform into any human, humanoid, and semi-humanoid being. She is able to
shift into other sexes, create appendages, and any type of clothing. It is practically
impossible to tell her apart from anyone she’s mimicking. Somehow though you seem to
share her abilities. Perhaps you are related to Mystique or maybe it's just a coincidence.
With this ability you have the potential to become a terrifying infiltrator."
433,,300,Dragon Communion,Rapturous Rhapsody Jump,Transformation,"The dragons developed an art known as Dragon Communion that would allow others to
gain their power by devouring their hearts. You have undergone this communion on a
scale rivaled only by Mikael, having devoured the hearts of over thirty dragons. This
greatly strengthens you, gives you knowledge of their spells, the ability to turn into an
Archdragon, and a few other miscellaneous abilities."
434,,300,Fat Marker,Medaka Box Abnormal Jumpchain,Transformation,"Fatsy, fatso and lardass- the three verbal siblings you became used to hearing in your younger days. Trying out some loud protests of being big boned only made the jeers louder. Trying out crushing their bones under morbid amounts of fat that suddenly appeared from within them? That worked
wonders. You gained the power to manipulate the levels of fat within people, increasing or
decreasing anything that is seen as fat. You could remove almost all the fat from someone’s body
and leave them as nothing but bulky or lean muscle and bone. Or you could crush someone’s bones
and organs under the weight of their new fat assed form. Or you could just have some fun and
fatten up the parts of people that you like to be thick and full. Just don’t go too overboard on
yourself or you might have trouble finding shirts that fit."
435,,300,Remodelling,Medaka Box Abnormal Jumpchain,Transformation,"Why be satisfied with just what you were born with when you can make improvements? Through a
variety of methods of experimentation, you are able to directly improve the power and efficiency of
living beings or inanimate objects by remodelling them. This can be as simple as making an animal
not afraid of powerful people or as complex as turning someone into a powerful cyborg or bringing
out latent Abnormal or Minus powers within your own brain, given you can use Remodelling on
yourself just as easily. There’s not much of a limit on how much you can improve someone but it will
take more and more resources the crazier and stronger the changes you are making are."
436,,300,Shikotsumyaku,Naruto,Transformation,"Descended somehow from Kaguya Ōtsutsuki, this bloodline grants the user the ability to control their osteoblasts (cells responsible for bone production) and osteoclasts (cells responsible for breaking down bones), and the ability to regulate the bones’ calcium density. The user can grow as many bones as they desire and with alterations they wish e.g. they can extract an arm bone from their body and alter it to be as sharp as a blade. The user can also create entirely new and original bones, such as manipulating their bones to create a bone drill. Due to the calcium control, the user can make their bones denser, increasing their power and toughness, strengthening their bones to render themselves highly resistant to damage, and withstand pressures greater than those found in the Mariana Trench.

The user can manipulate their bones after or as they are being formed, causing them to break through the skin. The user can choose to keep them attached to their body or pull them out. Bones can also be forcefully ejected similar to bullets."
437,,300,Nafn,Germanic/Norse Mythology Jump,Transformation,"What is in a name holds many secrets. Firstly, you in all your forms are protected and secure within the power of your own true name, which can no longer be used against you.  Choose a lesser being or race to your own and gain that form; it shall receive its own separate true name. You may take this form at will. No matter how familiar this form is to your other forms they will never be mistaken for each other, believed wholeheartedly to be separate beings and nothing can pierce this perception unless you are observed taking on or dropping this form. Once per jump or every nine years, whichever comes first, this perk will act as a 1-up for any permanent death, mental entrapment, or imprisonment you wish; you safely appearing within a location of optimal choosing, locking you out of your main or lesser form as appropriate with only that ""identity"" dying. In future jumps each of your forms is separately provided all the real documentations, backgrounds, events, friends and families as needed to be within that world and prove your skills granting you spare identities and lives to slip into as needed with aspects shifting to accommodate these lives continuing as needed for your convenience. This will not let you be in two places at once but there will always be alibis for these other lives, friends having pictures and memories somehow, but anything notorious you do in one form will be retained. I.e., if you rob a bank in one form and it makes national news this won't provide that form with an alibi.

438,,300,Fiend,The Witcher Novels,Transformation,"From the dark dwelling of the forest comes a beast whose size belies its speed, but promises might. As large as an elephant, and much stronger, these creatures rove from the depths of their abodes to snatch lone humans off their travels, and, if they are hungry enough, raze houses for the sleeping meal inside. Despite their exceptional power, their greatest weapon is the third eye embedded in their forehead. Should you gaze upon it, you would quickly find yourself surrounded by void, your focus captivated by the hidden whorls inside, hypnotized and unable to fight back. But this form doesn't come without weakness: silver is debiliting, as it is for all monsters, and a loud enough noise disrupts your sensitive hearing and inspires fear. That may be overcome with time and fortitude, however."
439,,300,Leshen,The Witcher Novels,Transformation,"You have become a spirit of the forest, shedding bone and flesh for sturdy but cumbersome wood. Nature calls to you, and, should you respond, you'd find animals and insects eager to obey. Allow your roots to seed themselves in the earth, and you'll find them rushing to erupt and seize your enemies. There's no life in nature, even lesser monsters, that can escape your influence, and like the trees you embody, you find yourself growing in power as you age, eventually able to supplant the mind and body of an animal should you die. This transformation doesn't come without responsibility, however, as you'll find yourself compelled to curate the woods you inhabit, using your powers to heal animals and the ever-waning regions of forest. "
440,,300,Cat Spirit (Full),Bleach,Transformation,"Some people believe that they have the soul of an animal, trapped in human form. For some, it can
even be true. As a spiritual quirk, you’re able to take on the form of a single mundane animal found
on Earth. From a slinking housecat or cheerful dog to a trumpeting elephant or soaring albatross. The transformation is quick and effortless, though you’ll slip out of any clothes in the process. You
retain your ability to speak as a human, as well as your full spiritual strength, but your biologically
sourced physical abilities will be limited to that of a normal member of your chosen animal. If
desired, you might naturally take on some shared traits even in human form, like feline eyes and
possibly even ears too. By paying 300 instead of 50, you can increase the benefits involved. While you still choose a single
animal as normal, you’ll find it quite easy to make improvements in your abilities and skills that
relate strongly to that animal. One with the soul of a cat will find themselves gifted in stealth and
hunting, more agile than their peers and with excellent night vision too. An elephant man would
receive greater benefits from training his strength, make easy improvements with sound magic and
so on. The benefits are significant, not quite the level of a true prodigy but noticeable improvements. The most valuable gain is that you are able to unlock animal-themed transformations and stages of power in relation to your favoured abilities. Progressing a lightning Shunko into an unpredictable cat
form, with constantly changing Reiatsu and greatly increased agility, is an example. A Bankai that
transforms the user into a giant could make one an even larger titan by drawing on your elephantine
spirit. These states are difficult to unlock and tend to greatly increase the effect of the animal on
your mind but well worth it with their power. "
441,,300,The Calm Of The Spectre,Slay the Princess,Transformation,"You are aware that letting a Princess who is also a terrible spirit-creature who will destroy us all be the model you wish to imitate is a terrible idea in every sense of the term, correct? (I don't intend to ‘destroy’ anyone, I'm just trying to get home!) Well, you will, it's only a matter of time (Says the creepy manipulative voice with an agenda to push). And nevertheless, all of that is secondary to what your ability grants him - namely, making him a...ghost, for lack of a better term. 

Outside of lacking a body to directly harm people (for the most part), you can move through most material objects, you're immune to almost all conventional harm, and you can possess bodies to inhabit them (painfully and unpleasantly, might I add), with some degree of control over their actions - though mercifully, it is possible for those you possess to resist the effect.

Likewise, it is at this point when you are most vulnerable, when you can be killed so long as your host is willing to give themselves up to do it. Unfortunately, you can also briefly manifest yourself directly to simply put, phase a limb through a person and remove a vital organ - typically something like a lung or a heart or what have you."
442,,300,Cruelty Of The Razor,Slay the Princess,Transformation,"Cutting and stabbing and tearing brings such a delightful thrill to your empty awful heart, especially when you draw out someone's anguish over minutes of excruciating carnage and bloodshed. There is a sort of joy in it, both when you reveal yourself to have blades tucked into all of your “secret zones” - flesh giving way to sharpened metal and blades of death that make up your entire skeleton - and in their faces as they realize they are about to die. Your body moves as precise as a knife seeking purchase in warm flesh, and you croon in amusement as they struggle and try to pull away against your blades, only slinking further and further along them and turning them crimson with such wonderful hues. The keening cry your metallic body makes every time they try to hurt you is just as funny, if not more. The simplicity of it all makes your disconnected heart beat all too gently."
443,,300,The Head’s Definition(Tier 2)        ,Library of Ruina: HamHamPangPang,Transformation,"The City is host to tons of things that don’t look or even act human by most definitions, the tailors of the Carnival are humanoid externally but under their robes and masks they are closer to silkworms than anything, full-body prosthetics are a common sight among those who use them as an upgrade for whatever their job may be or after selling their natural body for some quick money, even the Bloodfiends who are vampires in all but name count as human. Most notably there are the Sweepers, liquified people within special suits who use heated hooks to kill and absorb their victims into tanks of flesh on their backs which they use as fuel, hard to kill but normally seen as nuisances to Fixers and Syndicates, but to anyone else in the Backstreets, they are effectively a curfew since Sweepers do what they are named for every night during what is effectively a nightly martial law. But the Head still says they’re human so at least you’re not getting declared an Impurity?

Pay 300 CP for any stronger distortion, Mother Sweepers, Bloodfiends, or humans with full-body replacements(Gloria or the Brotherhood of Iron for example), this costs 200 CP instead if you pick the Distortion origin."
444,,300,Half-Spirit,Kurohime,Transformation,"You are a spirit, but were born to a human mother, turning you into a half-human. Your normal appearance is that of a human being, but you can also assume a more powerful form, tossing aside some of your humanity to take on a form some might call demonic (especially since the God Clan started calling you “demons” after imprisoning the Spirit Kings). The specifics of your form are quite varied; Asura, for instance, had extra arms that emerged from her aura of flames.

Choose an element; while in your human form you gain some power to manipulate the element, such as keeping you warm on a freezing mountain if you’re a spirit of fire, but when you transform your power as a spirit is greatly enhanced, allowing you to pull off mighty feats of elemental control and creation."
445,,300,Angel,Kurohime,Transformation,"You are an angel, a being of divine origin, but distinctly less than a god. Your kind was created to be the servants of the gods, and to accomplish this task you have been made stronger, faster, and more magically potent than a normal human. You don’t require incantations, magic circles, or specially-prepared bullets to perform magic; all you need is the desire to do something and the expenditure of power to do it. You can interact with free-floating souls as if they were physical, and can guide them to the afterlife or fully destroy them, as you prefer. You are capable of shapeshifting into a specific kind of weapon which can be wielded by other people; as a weapon, you are incredibly sharp and hard, to the point that you could pierce even the bodies of gods."

If you’ve taken a similar Perk to this before in another Fate-related Jump...it’s up to you whether that Capstone Boosting counts for here, whether you need to buy it again for this set of Capstone Boosts, and whether or not you can get more SP to use via this option.

451,,300,Pure Blood Devil,HighSchool DxD,Transformation,"Devils are beings from the Underworld created by the Original Lucifer using the body of his wife Lilith in order to create a military force consisting of the 72 Pillars of High-Class Devil noble families, the Extra Demons, and the countless armies of Devil soldiers under them. Almost no one from those remains. Despite their long lifespan, their low fertility and multiple wars have waned their population something fierce, and the number of pure- blooded devils is all-time low. Despite this, they are a powerful race with many natural advantages, an exclusive magic system based on imagination and inherited bloodline powers for every clan. They even have a passive ability called ‘language’, which allows others to hear their words in the idiom they're most familiar with and vice versa. You’re a perfect example of this, even of the weakness to light-based powers. As a pure-blood devil you can choose a canon house to be part of and share their characteristic bloodline power or make a new one on the level as them."
452,,300,Titan,God of War,Transformation,"Whereas you would have been a towering figure over humanity, now it would be more accurate to compare you to a living mountain. You possess three godly domains which you rule over, but that is not all. Your physical strength far outclasses any others, and trying to hurt you would be comparable to attacking a mountain, one that can heal from most wounds within moments. Surprisingly, your mountainous size does not hinder your speed at all, leaving you just as swift as any other godly being."

You can also go to the Astral Plane and seek the help of the Astral Beast if you’re trapped but will have to dance to seek it’s favour."

And you do you want to aid your partner after all don’t you? Complain about it being ‘No Fair’ all you want you definitely will be a Tool worthy of your partner. In your Volund Form you may change your form at will or at the will of your partner. Be it an Armor, a Spear, a Halberd, a Crossbow or a Sword you may take its form. And that is just what you get here. Who knows into what weapons you could change as well in time.

456,,300,No.00000000001 ,Records of Ragnarok Gauntlet (Humans),Transformation,"It was man that were made in Gods image. It was man that were crowned to rule the land and its animals. And it was the first man Adam who embraced their exile from Heaven when his wife was tricked and threatened by Gods not worthy worship. You now possess the power of the First Man. The Eyes of the Lord. A terrific power that would allow you to perfectly replicate any move and technique you lay your eyes upon, including the ones used by divine beings. Regardless of its speed or power, you can evade any attack whilst simultaneously countering the attacker with their own move. Even something as powerful and fast as a time-surpassing punch can be replicated and dodged. You can even allow your body to morph in order to execute an attack you copied. However, despite their seemingly unbeatable nature, the Eyes of The Lord do have limits. Using them puts a strain on your nervous system and if pushing the eyes to their limits you will start overheating. Continuing in that state will run the risk of blinding you and making it impossible to use the Eyes. You may yet fall if forced into a war of attrition."
457,,300,Star Spawn,Elden Ring - Liurnia of the Lakes,Transformation,"You do not belong in this world in any sense of the word, having fallen from the heavens. You are a malformed star similar in nature to the being known as Astel, who destroyed an Eternal City and took away their sky. You bear great control over gravity and the primeval current, capable of all manner of impressive sorcery as natural to you as breathing. Whether you share in their unsettling appearance or are more tasteful to gaze upon is up to you."
458,,300,Dragon,Elden Ring - Liurnia of the Lakes,Transformation,"You are counted amongst the most ancient and powerful of all races to have graced the Lands Between, immune to the ravages of time and only capable of being killed through violence. As a dragon, you possess sturdy scales and wings that carry you into the sky. If you are one of Greyoll’s progeny, then you possess an elemental breath weapon. If you are an ancient dragon like Lansseax, then you can conjure bolts of red lightning to aid you in battle."
459,,300,Inheritors of a Ruined Heaven(Made God)       ,Godbound,Transformation,"Heaven is a broken house, torn apart from the violence of the Made Gods and the damage done to its celestial engines. Whether you shake in rage for what was done to it, creak wearily when your joints are not serviced properly or shiver for the next iota of faith you are an immortal, mighty threat to an entire pantheon of novice Godbound. Yet that is cold comfort when everything you once valued lies in rubble. You may have been cast down by force or cling to an uncertain existence, but your wrath is still great enough to punish those who would take what little you have left.

Whatever your nature, your very being is endowed with a divine force that can threaten an entire pantheon of the Godbound shared only by the most powerful of Eldritches and Uncreated. Short of the most dramatically focused and powerful forms of mundane damage, generally only supernatural forces have a hope of harming you. Spells, Gifts and magic swords would qualify. Like Eldritches and Uncreated, the lesser specimens among you can be harmed by open flame too; you are not especially vulnerable to them and likely can easily nullify flame as a threat with even passive Gifts or casual miracles, but unlike bullets and avalanches it can actually hurt you. Even Eldritches, generally the least resilient of such beings, would take something like sticking their heads in the muzzle of a magnetic cannon to receive harm from the mundane. In turn, all your attacks always count as magical weapons for the purpose of overcoming similar defences like the resilience of the Godbound-and whether with stronger spells or unnatural might, strike with more damage than mundane adversaries. Like the Godbound, your divine constitution also lets you shrug off certain supernatural effects as a “saving throw”.

Perhaps you are one of the last Made Gods in existence? It shall cost you 300 CP to be one of the ruiners of Heaven. Whether you were built of living humans or cold theurgic components, yours is an air of artificial perfection that speaks more of divine law than human flaws. Beyond that your constructed form is largely up to you: Made Gods have been built with golem-like bodies, animal parts, excessive eyes or limbs, and flesh fashioned of some living elemental force. Your miscellaneous powers are great shows of force representing the ideology you were built in the image of. Your mere presences cows most lesser beings into obedience, unless another divine being such as another Made God or defiant Godbound challenges you in your presence. Made in the ideals of your creators, you have three Words of Creation bound to your name representing the values of the culture that built you, and much greater experience at wielding them than any living Godbound.

You also possess some sort of powerful divine blast attack that may represent a hideous curse, the creation of permanent magical monuments or warp natural laws instead. Those who know of your kind are wary of slaying you in close quarters, if killed your form detonates in a far greater version of that blast for ten miles. So swift are you that despite often being twice the size of a man or more, you move and strike faster than many can react even in your damaged but still deadly state...at least, so it’s assumed.

Last but not least the sublimed miraculous power system of your construction grant you virtually inexhaustible divine energy. Though even your overall power is finite, when it comes to supplying energy for your supernatural abilities you need never fear running out of divine energy-and such your resilience to most malign effects is immense . Such power comes at a cost though: You require the assistance of a theotechnical cult for maintenance and spiritual upkeep, without which you are prone to decay and malfunction. Furthermore Made Gods can only dispel other supernatural effects defensively-that is, render themselves inviolate instead of suppressing the source’s use of it outright. Even without such maintenance you are one of the most powerful beings in this world-and with it, almost none in this world can overcome you without careful preparation."
460,,300,Spirit Form,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Transformation,"You have gained the ability to temporarily turn yourself into a Spirit. As a Spirit, you have no physical form, and cannot deal or receive physical damage. You are still vulnerable to magical, spiritual, supernatural, or energy-based attacks. Spirit forms granted by this perk will never be “enhanceable” (see On Enhanceable Spirits in the Notes section for details).

As a Spirit, you may link up with a willing or “empty” body, giving you some measure of control over it, making it more powerful than it would otherwise be, and giving it up to 3 minor abilities the body did not have, but you do.

For bodies that are willingly ceding some control to you, this is a negotiation. You may not have full control over the body, or may only have control over it under certain circumstances (such as in battle). If you wish, you may always just give out power, and not take any control. For “empty” bodies, including Puppet Fighters, you always have full control.

Your power as a Spirit, unlike how it usually works, is directly related to how powerful you are in your normal form. The more powerful you are, the more power you can offer the host body.

For an additional 100cp (undiscounted), you can grant the base part of this perk to any willing target, allowing you to further capitalise on the advantages the Spirit form can provide."
461,,300,Pokémon,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Transformation,"Choose any officially recognized Pokémon species; you are now that species. Choose up to four Moves which can be learned by your species of Pokémon (whether this would be via breeding, tutoring, TMs, or natural learning does not matter). You gain Super Smash Bros.-style versions of these Moves.

Should you choose a species more powerful than the Smash version of Mewtwo, you are capped at the level of Fighter Mewtwo. Any moves you have chosen are capped at the level of an average Fighter’s special."

If you are an ancient dragon like Lansseax, then you can conjure bolts of red lightning to aid you in battle."
464,,300,Martian Man,Invincible,Transformation,"You have gained the ability to shapeshift in a huge way: you can alter your appearance as well as mold your body into new and fantastic forms. You can alter the shape of your body in any way and into pretty much any organic substance, allowing you to do things like grow gills to breathe underwater or grow wings and alter yourself to fly. This power comes with a pocket dimension full of mass that you can add or subtract from in order to aid you in your shapeshifting. There are a few thousand pounds here that you can put to use or that you can feed any amount desired into. Any mass that gets destroyed from this dimension regenerates in 24 hrs. These shapeshifting skills allow you to change yourself into other matter and colours allowing you to disguise yourself as a vacuum cleaner or similar if you so desire."
465,,300,Beast-like,Beauty and the Beast,Transformation,"Perhaps as the result of a magic spell, you have become a strange, monstrous creature.

You are noticeably taller than humans, making you as much as ten feet tall. Your body is covered in fur, and seems to have drawn inspiration from various kinds of animals. Your head is buffalo-like in in shape with buffalo horns, a lion-like mane (optional), boar-like tusks, and gorilla-like eyebrows. Your teeth, tail, and legs resemble that of a wolf, and you have strong bear-like arms.

Your form affords various advantages, including great strength and speed, sharp claws, and a powerfully loud shout. You also do not physically age. While you are far from invincible, feats like fighting off packs of wolves whilst unarmed with only light injuries is entirely possible for you. Your unusual appearance is likely to frighten most humans in this world, which can be both a blessing and a curse, depending on the situation."
466,,300,Cecaelia,Disney’s The Little Mermaid,Transformation,"You are a strange creature that is half human, half octopus or squid. Your upper body is mostly human, though it is likely an unusual colouration such as purple or green. Your lower body is a mass of six or eight black tentacles. You have a great deal of control over these tentacles, allowing you to use them as additional limbs or hands. You are a swift swimmer, far beyond ordinary humans. By spinning in place whilst underwater, you can even get a short burst of speed beyond this. You can release a black ink from your body, which is mildly poisonous (you are immune to this poison). You are able to talk to humans, but also sea creatures (including fish and crabs) and some water-adjacent birds (including seagulls and penguins). You can breathe both underwater and on land, but your lower body makes actually living on land impractical at best and impossible at worst."
467,,300,Tree Spirit,Pocahontas,Transformation,"You are a living tree, equivalent in size to Grandmother Willow. By default, you are a willow tree, but may alternatively choose to be a different kind of tree, so long as it does not provide additional advantages not described here.

You have a great deal of control over your form, allowing you to snap your vines at enemies, or pull up your roots somewhat in order to trip them. However, completely uprooting yourself and changing location whilst in this form is not possible. Changing shape or alt-form switching allows you to safely extract yourself from the ground (no need to worry about human legs suddenly stuck in the earth). Likewise, assuming this alt-form will allow you the opportunity to safely root yourself into the ground, provided you are on a surface that would accommodate such a thing.

Your face appears in the side of the tree. Although it too is made from wood, you’ll have the same level of control over its expression as you are used to. You can see and speak from this face, though those who are not quite in tune with nature may not hear you or recognise your face right away.

You are effectively ageless, and your body is quite sturdy compared to that of a human’s. Nonetheless, you can still be killed in the various ways a tree could, as well as by having your “face” severely destroyed."
468,,300,Kumiho ,Dial,Transformation,"The Kumiho, a mythical creature from East Asian folklore, is a supernatural being that takes the form of a fox. Possessing cunning intelligence and otherworldly beauty, the Kumiho is known for its shape-shifting abilities and its insatiable hunger for human essence. With a sleek and agile physique, it effortlessly navigates the realms of mortals and spirits. The Kumiho is often depicted with mesmerizing, jewel-like eyes that radiate an alluring charm. Its fur can vary in color, ranging from pure white to vibrant shades of red or gold, reflecting its magical nature. Despite its enchanting appearance, the

Kumiho harbors a dark secret—it consumes the livers or hearts of humans to sustain its immortality or gain immense power. Legends surrounding the Kumiho highlight its skill in illusion and seduction. It can assume the guise of a captivating maiden to lure unsuspecting victims, preying on their life force. Its transformative abilities extend beyond mere appearance, allowing it to mimic human voices and deceive with clever illusions. Though the Kumiho is often associated with malevolence, there are tales that speak of individuals who display compassion and seek to break free from their cursed existence. Although the Kumiho are normally female you may become a male Kumiho if you wish."
469,,300,Pelt of Fenris,Marvel Cinematic Universe - Volume 2,Transformation,"Said to be a child of Loki and the giant Angerboda, the Fenris Wolf is a creature of primal might and fury. While it is only during the time of Ragnarok that it would break its fetters and devour the king of Asgard, a piece of its power is granted in this pelt cape of unnatural floofiness. Upon command, its wearer can become a large wolf the size of a semi-truck with strength to push aside said trucks in order to do battle. The wearer can also summon and empower a pack of hounds to work alongside them, their thoughts synced with the wearer’s to ensure teamwork and group tactics for a bloody victory."
470,,300,Gloves of Union,Marvel Cinematic Universe - Volume 2,Transformation,"There is power to be found in inner strength and the determination of individuals. Power which can see the exceptional few rise up above the teeming masses. But power can not only be gained and spent; it can be shared. Gloves that pulse with an unnatural blackness at their center, willing individuals who don a glove each can be merged into a composite being that shares their strengths and power as one unified being of might. Thoughts will be shared and mingled as the new amalgamation will act and speak with a single personality that best characterizes the sum of its parts, with this bond ending upon removal of the gloves. Be careful however, for it might be an experience that some are not able to fully handle."
471,,300,Spirit of Vengeance,Marvel Cinematic Universe - Volume 2,Transformation,"They say that the devil isn't real. That such superstitions are meant to scare the ignorant. Alas, the devil is real, and thanks to an incident which has left you empowered there will be Hell to pay. You have been imbued with a Spirit of Vengeance, and can transform into a hellish agent that punishes the wicked. You will possess great strength and durability, conjuration of powerful hellfire and the imbuing of that fire in objects to enhance them, and even the power to uncover someone's sins should you stare into a person's eyes. This incarnation of the Spirit does not possess the Penance Stare of its predecessor, but in exchange you will find you can affect and force intangible opponents to assume a corporeal form so that fire can cleanse the world of them. There is nowhere you can hide from Justice."
472,,300,Asgardian,She-Hulk & Ms. Marvel,Transformation,"You're no God of Thunder, but you're still quite a specimen. Whether you're a survivor of Ragnarok or part of the next generation of Asgardians, you can bend steel with your bare hands and could live to be 4000 years old before you start showing your age. With powerful durability and a moderate healing factor, you could walk off a brawl with the Hulk like a bad hangover. As is tradition, you have received some basic combat training, but if you want to match blades with Heimdall or even Thor, you'll need to put in the practice and find some worthy opponents."
473,,300,Daywalker(300),Marvel Midnight Suns,Transformation,"You were born a partial vampire giving you a dhampir physiology similar to Eric Brooks. Just like Blade you are a vampire human hybrid that is immune to the monster's bite while having similar powers.

474,,300,Frost Giant,Marvel: What If...?,Transformation,"Everyone knows when the Jotunn show up! With their sharp blue skin and 30ft-40ft height, the Frost Giants are some of the most visually distinct species you’ll encounter. They can not only manipulate ice as if it’s an extension of themselves, but have the strength to match a Royal Asgardian for a time."
475,,300,Husk,Marvel’s Kid Heroes,Transformation,"You can turn your base body into just about anything. Sand, magma, steel, diamond. You just have to shed your skin. And when you’re done, the skin of your new form peels off revealing you beneath. You can dispense with minor, surface injuries by shedding your skin, along with dirt and sweat and so on."
476,,300,Halloween,Marvel 2099,Transformation,"Like some imitation Loki, you are a consummate shapeshifter, able to take on nearly any animal form, at least from the size of a small mammal to an elephant, as well as to take on various human forms just by observing them. While you are unable to copy superpowers in this manner, even biologically derived ones, you can create new forms by mixing elements of different animals or humans, and express various animal biological abilities in a mixed form. This ability to mix forms also means that you can use this ability to mix and match elements of your own alt-forms, and while you cannot copy the powers of others, you can blend or use the powers of your own alt-forms while doing so."
477,,300,Daemonic Pact,Amalgam Comics,Transformation,"Away, Away, form of Man! You have bound your soul to a demon, and transform into it with a short chant.

479,,300,Eldritch Flesh,Darkest Dungeon,Transformation,"“The flesh is fluid! It can be changed, reshaped, remade!” For the cultists who flock to the manor there can be no higher honor than this- to be taken into the warm, tenebrous depths of the earth to emerge changed- and made part of the whole once more. Remade in the Thing’s image, they consider their hideously mutated bodies a blessing- a reminder that madness takes many forms, just as they do. Tumorous pink flesh, tentacles, beady black eyes, protrusions of teeth and bone, and other eldritch additions can be found on their form. And, like them, you have taken up some of these traits yourself. Although still recognizably human overall, you may have teeth-lined tentacles in place of arms, or a mass of them for legs; you may have gained something similar to a scorpion’s tail, injecting the foulest of acids into your prey or possibly launching shards of bone like an organic crossbow. The downsides are few- for you, at least- and in fact, your mind has been hardened greatly. But the sight of your body is so horrific that few townspeople will tolerate your presence- and even those brave enough to accompany you may lose their nerves when they see you fight.

Boosted: With Abominable Transformation you may achieve the height of reconstruction; evolving into something never before seen on this earth. A mass of tentacles, like an octopus on land; a cyclopean beast, eye stalks beholding all around it as it gnashes with a toothy maw. Split yourself down the middle and turn yourself into a giant, threshing mouth, if that’s what pleases you. Your form is terrible and even more sanity distorting than it was before, and is limited only by your own twisted designs- as well as the dreams of that which lies sleeping beneath the carved stone and beating flesh… of the Darkest Dungeon.

480,,300,Refracted Husk ,Darkest Dungeon,Transformation,"“No rest, no peace for this wretched soul.” After the Comet arrived those unfortunate enough to be bathed in its cosmic colors found themselves shattered, and refracted across time and space- made a slave to the Comet’s will, and forced to serve it for all eternity. These unfortunate souls, now only husks of their former selves, have become vessels for the Comet’s power. Even the heroes sent to stem the tide are not safe; those that succumb to madness or death there often return to the Hamlet, gibbering nonsense about cosmic lights and the hateful hues found therein. But as overwhelming as the Comet’s influence may be, there are still some who find the strength to fight its influence- even in the utter depths of its embrace. Consider the poor miller himself; a slave he may be in his twisted unlife, but even he can still recognize the face of his beloved. And Mildred, the woman in question, seems to have retained enough of her sanity to avoid attacking people entirely. And like those two, you have resisted the worst of the Comet’s influence. Caught between life and death, the lights you have seen have revealed many truths to you both great and terrible. As a result, while your mind may be more susceptible to trauma you’ll find that enemies will always fail to escape your notice- no matter how well they hide, so long as they’re close enough to be a threat you will see them. Additionally your encounters with otherworldly energy has made it easier for you to bleed and poison your enemies. Your innards have started to harden, granting you protection from attack but also slowing your movements considerably; your eyes glow with blue, eldritch light thanks to the crystal shards gestating inside of you, though they don’t illuminate much.

Boosted: With Abominable Transformation you can further your transformation. Your skin will form a rocky hide, blue light emerging from cracks in your cosmic armor. Your limbs may detach from your body, connected by tendrils of otherworldly light. Not only will this further increase your defenses, but the light you emit can be used offensively, altered to take on hues both splendorous and haunting and almost anything in between. Bathed in the ethereal glow your allies may find themselves more inclined towards heroism, their stress melting away as their body strengthens; or the light may reveal a previously unseen weakness in the enemy, possibly even causing them to go mad- if they are even susceptible to such a thing.

481,,300,Crimson Curse,Darkest Dungeon,Transformation,"“There is power in the Blood, for those with the fortitude to pay the price.” In the Ancestor’s younger years- before he was committed so earnestly to the excavation of what lay beneath his estate- he threw lavish and decadent parties hosted in the vast expanse of gardens and stone terraces that were so lovingly attended to by his servants. But after a bewitching encounter with a pale beauty the courtyard became host to a different celebration; a wild feast and orgy of blood. Like the nobles he once called his peers, you have contracted the Crimson Curse- a sickness that pulses through your veins, weakening the humors and making it slightly easier to bleed in exchange for advanced speed and a thirst for blood- and particular, the vintage brewed from the progenitor of this plague. Starving yourself of blood will make you waste away and die, but when your cravings are sated you will enter a zealous frenzy, attacking with inhuman strength and speed and resistance to poison and stunning effects as befitting your changed nature. Thankfully, even if your self-control matches that of the Viscount your actions will remain your own.

Boosted: With Abominable Transformation you will find yourself rapidly advancing through the stages of the curse while somehow still retaining your sanity and free will. Your skin will pale, and you may begin to develop certain insectile traits- a proboscis may replace your mouth for example, or you may develop skewering blades on your arms, among other traits. This is when you are “human”. Drinking blood- which now promotes powerful regeneration through your body for a short time- will cause you to shed your human veneer, turning you into a half-insect, half-human beast reminiscent of a mosquito, leech, tick, or some other bloodsucker with greater strength and new methods of attack befitting your form.

Like the Abomination the decision to transform is yours- barring the onset of madness- but although the act itself will actually heal minor wounds, the transformation may incur stress not only on yourself but on any compatriots who witness the monstrous shifting of flesh and muscle. Luckily, you may also partially transform while retaining your mostly human body in order to defend yourself, which is far less taxing. The form you take on when fully transformed will be similar to that of the Abomination, featuring rending claws, teeth and inhuman strength, as well as caustic bile-the differences, if any, being limited to cosmetics. If you purchase one of the seven “disease” perks below you will have the opportunity to design an entirely new form, with its own set of benefits and demerits. Just be aware that, regardless of form, the superstitious souls of the Hamlet may not be too happy about your presence here- and those of a religious sort may even refuse to adventure alongside you entirely. Should you wish, you may also choose to make your “transformed” state permanent instead- this will eliminate the penalties related to transforming, but you will lose the ability to take on a different form for the duration of the Jump. Needless to say that being stuck as a monster will do little to endear you to those who distrust or hate your kind, too."

Using this process, you are able to use this meditation to improve on any facet of your physical, mental, or spiritual nature in some way, up to the limits of your physique, both physical and metaphysical. You can also use this as a method to remove impurities in your body, mind, or soul, removing corrupting influences, diseases, poisons, or imperfections that limit your growth and progress to a degree."

Their skin hardens like iron, their size increases dramatically, and with every step they take, they leave a Path of Iron behind them that grants their allies faster movement. The flask refills itself after seven days. Tastes like drinking liquid steel."

While you aren't something quite so grandiose, you are an immortal, needless creature who is bound to protecting a certain area, an aspect of nature, or even devoted to upholding a concept such as bravery or balance. Your form is determined by you alone, and you have a great affinity for magic-Both using it to destroy your foes, and resisting the influence of hostile magic."
487,,300,Half-Dragon,League of Legends,Transformation,"The offspring of a human and a dragon, half-dragons are an incredibly rare sight. Dragons usually look down upon humans and consider the blood of a dragon to be sacrosanct, so to create a child with a human is unusual indeed. Despite this, Half-dragons often possess the full power of their draconic parent, inheriting the elemental affinity of their parent, cabable of intuitively breathing and manipulating gouts of fire, blasts of wind, pressurized water, or scouring sand. They are covered in durable scales and have great physical strength. When enraged, a Half-Dragon can even transform into a dragon themselves, granting incredible strength, durability, and even greater control over their element."

We're not talking Larry Talbot, either; think sharp claws, nasty teeth, and inhuman power. There's some nasty downsides, though. The Hexenwolf belt may bear the brunt of the spirit's rage, but your id will be running the show while you're wearing it. It's also an extremely addicting rush of power, and repeated use will start to wear your mind down, making you end up getting more wolf-like as time goes on. The stronger your will is, the longer you'll hold out, but it's good to keep for a rainy day."

Whether by the experiments of some mad scholar or some unholy union between two races, you now possess a drop of something else in your blood. What exactly this perk gives you will depend on your choice, though in most cases this will result in a change in size, physical traits related to your chosen race, and perhaps a small affinity for a certain type of magic. Choosing to have the blood of a god might give you a foot or two of height, a more beautiful or handsome appearance, and stronger miracles. A pygmy might lose height and gain a better grasp over hexes, perhaps also looking more corpse-like. Dragon blood may give you scales on certain parts of your body and strengthen your sorceries if you owe your existence to the Paledrake, while demons can expect horns, patches of stony skin, and increased pyromancies. Races without an affinity for a magic may give you more of their physical traits or strength instead, though in any case you’ll be far from them in terms of power in most cases. You will have great potential, but may also be an outcast wherever you go. This world is not meant for such abominations as yourself, and oftentimes those caught between two races are unwanted by both. A cruel reality, but one that belongs to you and the few hybrids like you.

490,,300,"""Rare Vitality""",Dark Souls 3,Transformation,"Monsters, the undead and the dying are by far the more common residents in these lands. You're different though, your strangle hold on life hasn't been released quite yet. You possess a rare vitality for these lands, not tiring easily from extended combat or adventure, being able to survive even after sustaining grievous wounds as long as you treat them in a timely manner. In addition, your body gains a few unique properties that also aid survival. Your body structure is odd, more insulated, allowing you to shrug off the cold or electricity based attacks or hazards more easily. Your blood also clots quicker, making it harder for enemies to bleed you out."
491,,300,Beast ,Dark Souls 2,Transformation,"“A strange form that looks at odds with the ruins of man. Be you a member of the Lion Clan? One of Velka’s strange followers? Or perhaps you were once a man or woman taken in the night by a scholar with fewer morals than scruples. Whatever the case may be, you vaguely resemble a human with otherwise bestial traits. Half-lion, half-raven, half-scorpion, something else entirely? That’s for you to decide. Pick any mundane animal, any mundane animal you wish, and your form is partially man and partially that. You are faster, stronger and more resilient than an ordinary human but not by much by the free merits of this perk. You do however possess one or more interesting natural abilities like claws adept at burrowing, or powerful fangs that could gnash through bone. Other origins may buy in for 100CP. For an additional 200CP you may upgrade the body given to you, becoming something much stronger than an ordinary human. With this purchase you may become larger and more bestial, or have the human aspects of your body attached to a more bestial whole like Scorpioness Najka.”"
492,,300,Wyrm Knight ,Elden Ring,Transformation,"The great dragon Gransax brought a revelation to the Erdtree sentinels. To protect the Erdtree, they had to become dragons themselves. You have followed that path to its logical conclusion, leaving left humanity behind to become a grotesque, winged yet flightless reptilian beast resembling the ancient dragons as the pug resembles a wolf: A Magma Wyrm. Though said to dwell beneath the earth in their wretchedness and unrecognisable from the natural majesty of a trueborn dragon, such creatures are still strong enough to tear stone apart and belch a short-ranged breath of lava. Most curiously, you yet retain opposable thumbs and the ability to walk on two legs-allowing you to forge mighty weapons coated in your scales and imbued with a measure of your fiery breath’s power. Whether or not it is possible to transcend this debased state to become a true dragon is unclear-though given the decline of their race and the abundance of wretched wyrms, unlikely.

You are of course well-versed in the ways of Dragon Communion to have come this far, though the perk of the same name far exceeds you in breadth of draconic aspects compared to what you have from this in depth to pursue your transformation. However, this perk does come with one further advantage: Unlike most Magma Wyrms you have fully retained your sanity, due in part to a far greater magical control over forces that would change your form, mind or spirit in the process of granting you power. Such is your control that you can even seal aspects of it into a weapon, diminishing both the curse’s hold on you as well as the power you obtain from it. As Morgott recanted his accursed blood into a blade you could banish your fiery breath into your sword. Significant damage to you in battle will free the power though-and as if bottled up, it will release a cataclysmic storm of the force it embodies as well as be briefly empowered."
493,,300,Spawn of the Stars(300),Elden Ring,Transformation,"There is a form of life unlike any found in the Lands Between, unrestricted by the conditions imposed by the Erdtree’s order, contained in trickles of glintstone that descend from the cosmos above. There, strange forms of life with mysterious powers emerge from the very substances of the heavens. Would you care to be one of them? 

On the other hand, for 300 CP you may instead be a true, living star such as Astel, Naturalborn of the Void. While Astel itself resembles a horrific dragonfly with a hauntingly humanoid skull, six scuttling limbs, iridescent insectile wings and a body of crudely connected space debris wound with rings of light it is up to you whether you are a malformed star such as himself-or have a more pleasing, yet equally alien, form. Though you likely have formidable natural weapons and some form of flight, your true power is your mystical might. Astel levelled the Eternal City with his meteors and gravity powers, opens and shuts portals at will, and projects the image of celestial objects throughout a seemingly ordinary lair. And while it appears that for one reason or another Radahn’s grip on the stars’ movements does not restrict yours, you may yet retain the power to guide the fates of mortals-though precisely what this entails and how much control you have over the process remains little understood by the denizens of the Lands Between."
494,,300,Dragon,Elden Ring,Transformation,"Grey-scaled, feathered and winged reptilian creatures with powerful elemental breaths and size enough to topple trees by brushing up against them, dragons are one of the most powerful races in this world even following their decline. Though the god their Elden Lord Placidusax once served has long left, unlike the giants the dragons were not truly defeated in battle-albeit mainly because after felling the mighty dragon Fortissax in battle, Godwyn convinced his mother Marika that the dragons were better as allies than enemies-earning his eternal friendship. Indeed, if an elemental breath powerful enough to rout armies and the gift of flight were not great enough threats your kind is also known for incredible prowess over magic; Lansseax, his sister, could even take on human form to moonlight as a priestess of the ancient dragon cult. As a final note, while the incantation red lightning was the signature weapon of all dragons many develop unique breath weapons somewhat related to their most frequented environment. From breaths of frost to blasts tainted by the Scarlet Rot or the classic fiery breath, any dragon is capable of unleashing an elemental torrent no band of men would want to face head on."
495,,300,Church of Avacyn ,MtG - Innistrad,Transformation,"You may choose to be a simple member of the Church, humanity's last bastion. Be it as a simple clergyman, or as a cathar fighting back the evils of the world. Or for 300 of those points your friend gave you, you can be one of the many angels that watch over humanity, providing both guidance and protection. The angels protect us, stronger, wiser, and older, but also more compassionate than man. The angels are divided into three flights, serving under the sisters Bruna, Sigarda, and Gisela, who in turn serve Avacyn.

The Flight of Alabaster, under Bruna, representing the blessed sleep. Protect us in death, the rest earned after life, ensuring our bodies are not disturbed.

The Flight of Herons, under Sigarda, representing the new moon. Protect us in life, warding against harm to the living and keeping the dark at bay.

The Flight of Goldnight, under Gisela, representing the sun. Fight back the many beasts and horrors of the world, and preside over the Feast of Goldnight.

Holy Avacyn herself is represented by the moon. Her moonsilver grants the people of Innistrad a way to fight back, but more importantly than that, it provides the protection needed to live safely. Angels cannot take madman perks, but may change their gender to female for free."
496,,300,Children of the Spider,Skulduggery Pleasant,Transformation,"Controlling spiders, turning into a giant spider the size of a car, and summoning swarms of spiders...by vomiting them up. Your wounds also bleed spiders instead of blood, giving you more ammunition the more injured you become. People generally don’t like or trust them, usually with good reason.

Boosted: The Terror: The Capstone Booster has increased what you are now capable of, far surpassing what normal practitioners can do. Where before you could control spiders in a few metres you can now do so for a few miles linking up to every arachnid within your range knowing their species, their location everything. Your transformation was not left untouched, with its size and power increased to even tower over small buildings (at your peak) with all the boosts to your physical might such size entails. While transformed, you could easily fend off beings on par with the half-god Grotesquery.

Boost Requires Second Coming(Skulduggery Pleasant) to Activate"
497,,300,Remnant ,Skulduggery Pleasant,Transformation,"What a curious ability you’ve acquired, Jumper. You now have the power to turn into a Remnant, a small, shadowy spirit with narrow white eyes. While in this form, you can possess others by crawling down their throats. While possessing someone’s body, you can access their powers and memories as though they were your own. Your possession will have the same tell-tale signs of being possessed by a Remnant (black lips and veins under their skin), and the same methods of expelling you from your host will work, such as specific sigils and magic that manipulates or destroys souls. Unlike a normal Remnant, you will not become fused with your host after four continuous days of possession, allowing you to leave whenever you want."
498,,300,Beautiful Sorrows ,Skulduggery Pleasant,Transformation,"The magic flowing through your body has made you very pretty, Jumper. So pretty, in fact, that one glimpse of you can literally enthrall the average person, regardless of sexual orientation or current relationship status. In fact, most people would be more than willing to give you everything they own and devote the rest of their life to serving you. The strong-willed and magically-resistant can resist this enthrallment, and those who are aware of the magical nature of your beauty can build up a tolerance over time, though even these people will still acknowledge your beauty. However, this comes with no ability to tone down your beauty, and any attempts to hide it will only ever be partially effective, so good luck going incognito when eyes are literally drawn to you, or having a meaningful conversation while people are drooling over you. After this Jump ends, you'll have control over this effect, and can even switch it off, if you want. You'll still be whiplash inducingly hot though."
499,,300,Scarab King ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Transformation,"A curse that you turned to your advantage and control. Long ago, you were cursed by the Gods of the desert, transforming yourself into a living mass of scarabs. You learnt to control this though, learning how to switch between it and your original form at will. No doubt the Gods are unhappy given you spat in their eye but with how lethal this form has made you, you may find it difficult to care. You may take on the form of a swarm of scarabs, several times your own body mass in the amount of them are created. Not only do you have full control over each and every scarab, you will survive so long as even one of them remains. However, these scarabs cannot go more than a few dozen meters from the majority of scarabs, simply fading away if they go too far. The Scarabs also eat at the spirit of whoever they attack at the same time as they eat at the flesh, eventually spreading the remaining shreds of the soul into the air."
500,,300,Trump Card ​,Yuki Yuna is a Hero,Transformation,"Your node carried with it an artifact from the old Hero system used 300 years ago, at the beginning of the Divine Era. Somehow the Taisha did not completely wipe this node for whatever reason, perhaps due to an oversight. Before Mankai was implemented in the system, a Hero would instead draw on Shinju-Sama’s collective memory from all mythological figures that had walked the Earth. They would gain the part of the power of a mythological figure, potentially anytime they needed to. Their outfit would change, and their weapon would change, just like with Mankai. They could also call upon it at will once they have unlocked their ability.

This can grant many powerful abilities, ranging from the ability to split yourself into seven clones, all needing to be simultaneously killed in order to kill them permanently, to make an enlarged yo-yo spin in the air and ride on it, or to carry a force of a nuclear bomb in one’s fists. But like Mankai, this also came with a cost. The Trump Card would give great physical damage to the Hero using it depending on the strength borrowed. They would be hospitalized for days in extreme cases. And excessive and extended use over a short period of time would deteriorate someone’s mental health, the severity of it also based on the power of the borrowed historical figure.

Your Trump Card cannot carry with it any divine magical beings associated with the sky, such as Zeus or Apollo. As Shinju-Sama’s collective memory includes those who walked the land and is made up of the gods of land, it does not include divine beings for that reason. Underworld figures, like Hades or Cerebus, are acceptable choices to make for your Trump card, but it is not limited to those.

You get one to start out with, and over time you may unlock more with training.
"
501,,300,Blessing to the Deep* ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Transformation,"With so little of the kingdom left, you have to find alternate means for acquiring servants and the like. In exchange for its loyalty to you, you can bless any aquatic animal (as long as it is the size of a dolphin or smaller) with magic. Through this gift, they gain a humanoid form akin to that of the Sea Creature background, and generally some unique magical ability. However, this boon is a gift from you, and can be withdrawn. Either by your own will, by the servants voluntarily giving their life energy to you to restore your strength, or by having your powers sealed, the blessing can be retracted, causing the beings to return to their mundane forms. Generally, with a moderate capacity for magic, you can bless 3 to 7 water creatures at a time. In time, you may be able to find ways past these limitations. As most sea life in this world is already intelligent, you do not need to worry about boosting their intellect, but in worlds where the sea creatures lack sentience, you will need to put a little extra oomph into your boons; however, the intelligence boost remains permanent even if the rest of the blessing vanishes."
502,,300,Perfect Human Body ,Senki Zesshou Symphogear,Transformation,"A sheaf of papers, with a single lily lying on top. Reading through the complicated – and occasionally mad – alchemical scribblings, you eventually realize that this lily is the secret to achieving a ‘perfect’ form, as identified by Saint Germain through her research, which is contained within the sheaf of papers before you. When consumed by a person, the lily causes one to transform into a ‘perfected’ human, a Progenitor of sorts through advanced Alchemy.

Perfect humans are incredibly intelligent, able to pick up the vast complications of Alchemy with about as much difficulty as a regular human studying mundane sciences, and have enough physical power and stamina to be on par with a Symphogear user. They are also... well, female. Yes, Saint Germain deduced through her research that the perfect human form is female, backing up her claims through the restrictions of a Philosopher Stone. You may not like it, but this is what peak performance looks like.
"
503,,300,Miracle Mallet ,Touhou Project: Parasol Paradise,Transformation,"A legendary artifact from the tale of Issun-boushi, the Miracle Mallet is a small hammer with the power to change an object's size. The original mallet can only be used by Inchlings, but this particular copy has no such restrictions. Though this version lacks the ability to grant wishes, it lacks the powerful corrupting influence of the original also.
"
504,,300,Dragon Key ,Peter Pan,Transformation,"A large stone key that, when thrust straight into the heart of a dragon, will turn it to stone indefinitely; however, if the key is removed from the rock, the dragon will come back to life. While you can use the key with no trouble, the key can otherwise only be wielded by someone with considerable patience.
"
505,,300,Transmutation ,Cultist Simulator,Transformation,"Your affinity with the Forge has given you the exceptional ability to transmute objects and even living things, provided the correct price is paid. Magic begets magic, souls begets souls, and divinity begets divinity.
"
506,,300,Size Change ,Wonderland No More,Transformation,"You can change between normal, small, and giant versions of your current form, though you can also use this power multiple times to stack up your growth/shrinking accordingly. To grow, you must make growing motions with your hands (or other appendages), and to shrink, you must berate yourself for being naughty until you literally shrink under the pressure. The small and giant forms are essentially a quarter and four times your standard form. The size changes are based on the normal size of your form, so preexisting size changes to your form will not affect the parameters of your size change with the perk. While the normal size changes maintain your proper proportions, by selectively choosing to do so (or fumbling when using this power, you can instead make different parts of the body grow at different rates, such that you could end up with an elongated neck or just a waddling head and feet like happened with Alice In addition, this perk lets you force equivalent size changes on other targets, though they can resist through spirit/willpower if they don’t want to change size. You can combine  this perk with Shape Change to make yourself (or others) change both size and shape all at once.
"
507,,300,Item Spirit ,Hyrule Warriors,Transformation,"Wizzro, the evil sorcerer of Cia’s dark armies. Fi, the spirit of the Master Sword from ages past. Ghirahim, an ancient demon general. These are people, yes, but the form you see them speaking in, fighting in, acting in, that is not their true form. 

On purchase, you may select a type of item of your choice, a sword, a ring, a harp, a bottle, nothing too complex. This object is in reality, your true form. You are the spirit of a magical object. 

Depending on the origin you picked, this object is either heavily empowered by light, pure magic, or darkness, with this nature spreading to the form you use to interact with the world. 

That other form resembles the race you selected, with an aesthetic influenced by the energy that empowers your true form. It is empowered as well, but less so. You are freely able to swap between these two forms, though not if your racial choice was taken as a drawback. 

Your true form is more than just a magically empowered object though. It has an ability relating to its form, like a sword being extra great at cutting, or a bottle being exceptional at sucking up and containing things. You are also able to manipulate in this form, though it’s not as comfortable as your normal form.
 
"
508,,300,Terminian Mask Collection ,Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask,Transformation,"Temina is a land that may or may not be obsessed with Masks. They certainly have enough of them. Well, anyways, if you desire a mask of your own, then look no further. Or I suppose I should say, if you desire several masks of your own. You see, you may use this option to acquire any and all of the masks that appear in Termina. However, you will not be receiving the ones that have previously appeared in Hyrule. Beyond that, some of these don’t actually do anything, you know? But, with that restriction you are allowed access to any masks you desire. The massively powerful Giant’s Mask, the explosive Blast Mask, the undead charisma of the Gibdo Mask and Captain’s Hat, the fairy calling Great Fairy’s Mask. Er, well, not quite. There are two other masks you cannot grab. Majora’s Mask and the Fierce Deity's Mask. Those are special. And already on offer.

510,,300,Ravio's Bracelet ,Legend of Zelda: Hero of Worlds,Transformation,"A golden bracelet with an enchanted purple jewel laid in it. The magic within allows you to transform into a painted form, becoming two-dimensional and capable of travelling along any solid surface large enough to hold your shape. This can be useful for sneaking, dodging attacks, and more."
511,,400,The Crow,Anima Beyond Fantasy,Transformation,"A psychic crystal in your brain combined with a minor replacement of
your blood with a strange black fluid has given you increased strength, speed, and a talent for
psychic abilities, making them easier to advance, and increasing them all to a half more than
they would have otherwise been. Why Wissenschaft has not found you and called you back into
it’s fold, I dare not guess, nor how you can survive without black fluid or how your lifespan
remains the same."
512,,400,Body of a Demon,Akame ga Kill!,Transformation,"During your training, you’ve consumed the broth of a
type of Danger Beast known as a Lake Kraken and thus you gained the superhuman
ability to manipulate every part of your body. By manipulating your flesh, bones,
organs and other parts, you’re capable of feats such as stretching and elongating
your limbs, extending and sharpening your nails and hair to pierce enemies, bending
your body to avoid attacks, moving your organs to prevent them from being wounded
by some attack or even flatten and contort your body to fit inside a small vase for
example. Additionally, you can also use this to slightly alter your physiology, in order
to do such things as produce oil-like sweat from your body at will, focus your vision
on things well beyond your typical range or greatly raise your body’s temperature."
513,,400,Hybrid,A Mage of Sorothustra,Transformation,"You are a rather potent example of a hybrid, taking the best traits from your
Sorothustran parentage and your other parentage. If you purchase this trait then you may select
any traditional or modern fantasy race and gain some benefits from having either a parent or a
grandparent who is a member of that species. This can include a non-ascendant divinity if you
want to be a demigod Sorothustran or have some trace measure of divinity in your ancestry.
This does not confer as huge an advantage as you may think, since most beings are
considerably less potent than a Sorothurstan is, even some minor divinities are not on par with a
Sorothustran. Nonetheless, this can be a handy way to grab something like minor, themed
wishmagic (if you are the child of a Cosmic Djinn and a Sorosthurstan), a mist form (if you are
the children of a vampire and a Sorosthurstan), or the ability to hear prayers (both directed
towards you or undirected). This does not weaken your Sorothustran traits, nor do non-hybrid
Sorothustrans view you any differently, and in future jumps you count as both a hybrid and
non-hybrid whenever either status would benefit you (even counting as both to different people
in the same conversation, depending on their attitudes). Additionally, in future jumps you can
choose to be the hybridized offspring of two different kinds of beings, so long as it makes sense
in the jump in question (and does not confer any sort of unique CP boosts or discounts) and no
one will judge you purely on the basis of your heritage.

Requires The Sorothustran Set-Up to purchase."
514,,400,Sanguinare Vampiris,TES V - Skyrim,Transformation,"You are now a Pure-blood, someone who has been given their vampiric
powers directly from the source, the Daedric Prince Molag Bal. The result of this is that your
vampiric abilities are far stronger than most Vampires. You might have even been given the
monstrous form and status of a Vampire Lord by Molag Bal. Only mortals strong enough to
resist your blood can be infected with your bloodline, but you will be able to create quite the
powerful clan of vampires if you bother creating a few scions. Another benefit is that you no
longer possess a weakness to the sun, although you are still vulnerable to fire. Instead, your
powers strengthen during the night, and you are at your peak when you have recently fed, unlike
most vampires, a trait possessed only by the bloodline of Noxiphilic Sanguivoria, and now you."
515,,400,The Seven Deadly Sins,Rapturous Rhapsody Jump,Transformation,"The Seven Deadly Sins are the most powerful members of Trigon’s children. Each of
them possess control over a particular sin. For example, Sloth emits an aura that
induces lethargy and apathy in those nearby. This effect made Nightwing drop a victim
in the middle of a fire before he passed out. Envy allows you to transform into others,
taking on their appearance and powers, as Envy did with Superman and Flash. Lust
grants you the ability to control anyone who finds you attractive, a power made more
potent by your supernatural beauty. Each time you purchase this ability you may gain
dominion over a sin of your choice. Your choices include Envy, Wrath, Lust, Gluttony,
Greed, Sloth, and of course Pride. Gaining red skin and four demonic eyes is optional
though. If you want to be related to Trigon or Raven go ahead, but it's not mandatory."
516,,400,Metamor Stair,Medaka Box Abnormal Jumpchain,Transformation,"Evolution is a wonderful process. It made these humans that are so fun to mess with, didn't it? But
sometimes you can't be bothered waiting a few millions years for something to happen and just
want it now. Now you can with just a touch, force anything, be it a person or an object, to evolve to
a new and better stage up to twice. A monkey could be made to become a man and then into an
evolved form of man. A blade could be turned into a chain sword and then into an energy sword."
517,,400,Konungur Konunganna,Germanic/Norse Mythology Jump,Transformation,"You are now as Freya or Frigg, beyond a minor deity, a full-on god(dess) by your own rights. You are the most beautiful person who has ever lived, able to strike gods dumb by revealing your full glory. Your power and skills are equally enhanced and you have become a lesser personification of freedom and hope. Your magic wielding is now on par with the greatest gods of magic.  You can heal and cure anything natural or otherwise given enough time and raising the dead is as easy as breathing. But more importantly you are now a chooser in your own right, no longer simply able to choose the worthy dead for Valhalla you can choose for any realm. You gain an innate understanding of any being, their sins, their hopes, their desires, and their worthiness. You now hold first pick and claim among the dead. Like Freyja and her hall Sessrúmnir in Fólkvangr,  you gain your own afterlife within the realms to hold your dead. Like Odin, you may elevate beings to a status similar to the valkyries, granting fragments and aspects of power dependent on your own and theirs.  In worlds with afterlives of their own, psychopomps will automatically consider yours valid, and any gods that rule over the dead will accept you as a peer.

Requires Valkyrja to purchase."
518,,400,Demon Flavour,Demon Slayer,Transformation,"You know what they say: if you can't beat them, eat them. Or, at least, that's
what you say. By devouring the severed parts of a demon, you can temporarily take on their form, gaining
strength, speed, and wound regeneration on the level of the demon whose flesh you ate and access to any
Demon Blood Arts they may possess while taking on their weaknesses. How long these boosts last depend
on the amount of flesh you eat a pound will last you roughly fifteen minutes, while an entire human-sized
demon is a day's worth and you can store this time for later use by eating the flesh without activating its
power. Last, but not least, not only does demon flesh have an appealing taste to you, but your normal bite
can tear it straight off a demon and be used as a natural weapon against them. This perk works on creatures similar to demons in future jumps."
519,,400,Golden Age Kryptonian,DC Comics,Transformation,"Faster than a speeding bullet! More powerful than a locomotive-that is
to say, able to stop it with your bare hands! Able to jump tall buildings in a single bound-and fly
while carrying a submarine! With the race’s main representative being Superman and feats such
as lightspeed travel and lifting cities being infrequent, it’s safe to say that while Kryptonians of
this era could defy the laws of physics they were relatively restrained in terms of potential
development."
520,,400,Jūgo’s Clan,Naruto,Transformation,"This unique biological trait allows the user to passively absorb natural energy from their surroundings and actively utilise that energy without prior training. The user is able to transform either part or all of their body by exposing their fluids to natural energy. The exact aesthetic of these transformations is up to you, but what remains consistent is that the user gains enhanced physical abilities, boosting strength, speed, stamina, reflexes, durability, and perception on the cusp of S-rank ninja. This transformation also boosts the power of the user’s techniques. The user can also create weapon-like appendages from their own body which possess numerous possible functions. You can create wings to fly, grow gills to breathe underwater, or create cannons to fire chakra blasts. Because you are paying CP, you will not have personality problems or lose control, and you can turn this ability on and off as you choose."
521,,400,Sakon & Ukon,Naruto,Transformation,"This bloodline allows the user to break their body on a molecular level and then merge with the bodies of others. Once merged, the user can begin to reform themselves within the target's body and gradually corrode the parts they haven’t entered yet. However, if the host body is damaged the user will be likewise injured. If you have the perks Master of Biology and Sage Mode, you can use this to copy the abilities of others by injecting yourself with their DNA. This will manifest as a clone of the person’s upper body growing from somewhere on your body, usually the navel, and performing their techniques independently of your own body’s movements. The clone is mindless and will only act when you will it to do so. 
"
522,,400,Ketsuryūgan,Naruto,Transformation,"This dojutsu allows the user to cast powerful genjutsu to the level of the Eternal Mangekyou Sharingan itself through either physical contact or via gaze. Upon ensnaring the victim, they can hypnotize them or even enter their mind to access their knowledge and memories. These eyes’ final power is the ability to manipulate iron and iron-rich liquids. This includes blood, whether outside or inside a body, including the wielder’s own blood.

Some examples of these eyes’ techniques include the Blood Transformation Technique. This is when using the Ketsuryūgan's abilities the user manipulates a target's blood by expanding it within the target's body. Doing this causes the body to morph into a larger version, effectively causing the target to become indistinguishable from their original appearance. It is only by expelling the extra blood will the target return to their original form/state.

The second known technique is the Exploding Human Technique where upon making skin contact, the user can infuse some of their chakra into the target. This chakra becomes poisonous, making the target’s body unstable. The chakra is activated only when the target starts bleeding, which causes the target's body to become consumed in a black substance. They then inflate until they explode on a very destructive scale. This can only be nullified by blocking the target’s chakra flow, and with medical aid, the user's chakra can be extracted saving the victim.

As this dojutsu grants advanced illusion abilities, it comes with a free purchase of Specialist: Genjutsu.
"
523,,400,Iburi Clan,Naruto,Transformation,"This bloodline allows members of the Iburi Clan to turn their bodies into smoke, either partially or fully. While in this form, no physical weapon can touch them and it can allow the user to enter others’ bodies and completely control them from within, effectively possessing them. While possessing another’s body, the user can control the possessed individual’s physical actions and feel everything they feel. This aspect can also be used offensively, letting the user attack the possessed from within. However, as the user is composed of smoke, they can be dispersed by powerful winds, and unless they can regenerate parts of their body, this can prove lethal. While born members of the Iburi clan suffer from a lack of control of this technique, you seem to have no issue with it. Strange."
524,,400,Sage Mode,Naruto,Transformation,"Many view Sages as just another type of ninja, another kind of killer, but we both know that’s not true, don't we? A Sage is something more, a being who doesn’t just use the chakra of the world but becomes one with the world. Sages utilise a specialised form of jutsu called Senjutsu that involves drawing natural energy from the world itself into their bodies and merging with their own chakra to create Senjutsu chakra. Now, this seems easy but in order to do so the nature chakra must be gathered and then balanced with the body's physical and spiritual energies. Upon doing so, the Sage’s strength, speed, stamina, reflexes, perception and durability are enhanced. By utilising Senjutsu chakra, the Sage can cause their ninjutsu, genjutsu, and taijutsu to become even more powerful. The Sage can sense chakra around them and can sense attacks without the need to view them and if you can already do that then the talent is enhanced. While in Sage Mode, this increases the amount of chakra the user has available and by imbuing Senjutsu chakra into ninjutsu the user can augment the techniques and gain access to special senjutsu techniques. As you are paying CP, you can choose to gain the powers of either the Toad Sages or the Snake Sages. The Toad Sages possess the Frog Kata ability, allowing the user to harness natural energy to extend the reach of their attacks, as well as special taijutsu techniques. The Snake Sages possess the Inorganic Reincarnation technique, allowing the user to animate and control the environment around them, as well as using the White Rage technique, a powerful explosion of light and sound. You may instead gain a custom set of unique abilities of a similar power level, based on where and how you learned Sage Mode. If you wish to have access to additional versions, you can pay 50 CP extra for each.

However, this comes with a downside: if too much natural energy is taken in it can lead to the Sage being turned into stone. Another downside is that the natural energy can only be taken in and mixed only when standing completely and utterly still so in a fight if you cannot stay utterly still then your reserve of Senjutsu chakra will diminish as the battle goes on. By paying for it here, you find that the first drawback of turning to stone will never occur and you will never make any mistake in the blending of the chakra even in a life and death battle the process will always go correctly. Also, normally you would require large chakra reserves but you have found a way around that and another thing to remember if you continually practise the use of Senjutsu the time needed to refill your Senjutsu reserves will decrease."

With this perk, your Hybrid trigger (if you aren’t a Hybrid then you gain one) gains an additional, highly potent function. When you pull it, you switch between a suppressed state and a full-powered state. In your suppressed state you are absolutely indistinguishable from a base human (or equivalent standard race chosen at the start of Jump) within the setting. Your powers, parameters, and energy are limited to the level of a normal human and things like charisma, attractiveness, and skill are limited at just barely superhuman levels. Your intelligence and knowledge are unaffected. Regardless of how powerful and great you are, living in your suppressed state will ensure that you remain grounded and enjoy the little things you might not have been able to. Even in your suppressed state you will never feel weak, helpless, or limited more so than before. You also gain an acute danger sense when you are suppressed that utilizes all of your sealed senses. A final failsafe ensures that if you are put in jeopardy or die you will instantly regenerate to peak condition and automatically release your trigger. All of your sealed energy and power is contained within an infinite ‘theoretical storage’ at the rate you would regenerate it, as are the limited uses of any abilities (daily abilities, etc.). When your trigger is released you gain access to your full power and the ability to draw from that stockpiled energy for use, as well as a permanent bonus that covers any training or other cumulative power gain you would have missed. Any mental effect that would occur due to you unleashing your full power is increased, so expect people to be feeling either great awe or dread when you mask off. Your presence perks are boosted for a short time afterward, just to rub it in. There is no limit to time spent unsealed and the trigger merely serves as a toggle.

You appear in the style of a Game & Watch game character. Your movement appears somewhat ‘janky’ to others, as if you were a series of sequential images instead of a moving body. This does not actually affect your movements, but it does make it harder for others to read them.  Additionally, you can become completely flat at will, allowing you to easily dodge attacks and fit through small cracks. You may apply these effects to any equipment you are using if you like, but only whilst you are using it.

Additionally, you are capable of a special transformation. Using this transformation, you will become a giant Octopus. You hover slightly off the ground, but do in fact need ground underneath you or you will fall. You will become quite powerful, and can also extend your eight tentacles a fair distance to attack your foes. As a trade-off for this power, this form is relatively slow. This transformation will last around 17 seconds before you are forced to leave it. Entering it is very taxing, making it unlikely you will be able to do so more than once during a fight.

There are some downsides to this modifier. You are far lighter than you would be without this modifier, meaning launching you a great distance is now easier for your opponents than it otherwise would have been. This effect is made even greater when you make yourself flat. You are also incapable of speech, only able to produce the sounds of beeps, bells, and whistles, but are still able to convey your general emotions well enough to others. As a member of this species, you may become a target of the Subspace Army, who has learned how to extract Shadow Bugs from your kind.

551,,400,Cursed Corpse,Jujutsu Kaisen,Transformation,"Cursed corpses are inanimate objects possessed by a cursed spirit or imbued with cursed energy, granting the object a degree of autonomy. While this can occur naturally, such as when a curse inhabits an object such as a mannequin, cursed corpses can also be created artificially by sorcerers. Those created in this way are not true life – they are simply automata following preset commands given by their creator, losing power once they run out of cursed energy. Yet in recent times, Masamichi Yaga, the principal of Tokyo Jujutsu High, has made a breakthrough many consider taboo – the creation of Panda, a cursed corpse that is not only truly sapient, but capable of generating its own cursed energy.

Whether created by Yaga or not, like Panda you too are an abrupt-mutated cursed corpse, a state of being that has a number of benefits. Firstly, and most notably, is that you have three cores within your body, each about the size of a small fist: these are your ‘hearts’ so to speak, and serve as the source of your cursed energy. Even if the rest of your body was destroyed, you will survive so long as at least one of these cores remain. Any destroyed body parts or cores will slowly be recovered over time. By default, one of these cores is your default, the other two essentially being backups. 

However, these other two cores have unique traits associated with them, and with a thought you can draw upon these, switching to it and gaining some notable benefits in the process. Perhaps one of your cores increases your physical abilities significantly at the cost of consuming a lot of cursed energy, while the other one makes you much faster in exchange for being less durable. These forms also come with some physical changes: the first example given, for instance, might make you larger in size and cause you to take on a more monstrous appearances, while the second might make you a bit smaller and leaner. The details are yours to decide, though each benefit compared to your default must come with some sort of trade-off. Importantly, however, if one of your cores has been destroyed or damaged, you can’t access its associated form until it has healed.

So long as it’s roughly humanoid and human-sized, you may freely decide the exact nature of the form you were created in. Perhaps your body is that of a mechanical, metallic lifeform, or perhaps you look like a panda or some other animal, or something weirder besides."
552,,400,BIRTH,Final Fantasy VII,Transformation,"Not human. Not human. Not anything near human. You are just like that monster from long, long ago: A Crisis from the Void. Whether you are another iteration of Jenova or something else entirely, you have gone from minor mutations to something...horrifying. You have total control of your biology down to the last cell, able to shapeshift into different forms at will and generate new limbs, organs, and senses for yourself at will. Should you possess abilities that can mutate or change others, you may give or remove them to yourself at will, as well as remove the negative effects of any biological changes to your body with an act of will. If a disease would kill or weaken you, you can simply order it to die and your body will comply. You can also sprout tentacles from your body to use as a weapon regardless of your form, strong enough to tear off metal from tanks. However, this control only applies to living cells still attached to your primary body...removed limbs can be re-attached with some effort, but otherwise you have no control on bits of you that have been removed or put into somebody else..."
553,,400,Ursine Might,Legends of Runeterra,Transformation,"The Ursine are worshippers of the Volibear, and they can channel the power of the God of Storms. Now you too can call lightning on your enemies and assume the form of a powerful hybrid form between human and bear. Usually this kind of transformation is irreversible and brings a lot of problems, like berserker rage and similar, but since you paid CP for this, you will always be able to switch between the forms at will and with no side effects."
554,,400,Monster,Legends of Runeterra,Transformation,"The anything goes option. Want to be a Voidling or a Baccai from the sands of Shurima? An intelligent sea monster from the depths? A mutant or cyborg from Zaun? Something stranger? This is what Monster is there for. The price is relative to how powerful you actually are. You can gain 100 CP and be some kind of intelligent, but relatively weak monster, like an intelligent cat. For free, you’ve about as powerful as a human or a middle sized animal like a wolf. 100 CP grants either powerful forms or limited magic, like the savage Yeti, while 200 CP grant both. For 400 CP, you’re a monster equal to the mightiest dragons of Runeterra, or possess magical powers equal to the greatest mages, or a mix of both."
555,,400,Ascended,Legends of Runeterra,Transformation,"Ascended is a term used to indicate mortals who have been infused by Celestial magic. Ascended vary in shape, since Darkin, the God-Warrior of Shurima and the various Aspect-Hosts are all Ascended. In all cases, you cannot die of old age, your body is immune from illness on top of being greatly improved, and you have the ability to heal from any kind of injury or crippling condition given time. Furthermore, you have access to the power of the cosmos and so powerful and unique magic. This magic is way stronger than most images on Runeterra can use, even for the more martially inclined Ascended."
556,,400,Dragon/Half-Dragon,Legends of Runeterra,Transformation,"Dragons are distributed pretty much anywhere on Runeterra, but the most common species comes from Demacia or Mount Targon. They’re big, powerful reptile creatures with powerful innate magical abilities. Demacian dragons are usually quadrupedal with a pair of wings and have powerful elemental powers, usually fire. Targonian Dragons look similar to their Demacian cousins but lack wings, flying only through their power, which are more cosmic in nature, like fire becoming starfire. For the same price, you can be a Half-Dragon instead, having an humanoid form but with the ability to turn into a dragon at will. You gain the Fury Keyword for free."
557,,400,Spirit ,Legends of Runeterra,Transformation,"Spirit is a catch-all term to indicate a series of entities that have very little in common. Ionia’s spirits are usually found in the Spirit World and can be both benign or malevolent. Shadow Isles spirits are usually psychopomps, spirits that guide the souls in the afterlife, while Freljord spirits are animalistic representations of nature, the most famous being the Frejlord gods. Aside from these, the more common spirits are actually the demons of Runeterra, supernatural predators that feed on particular emotions. Spirits have the same basic abilities of the Undead, but possess powerful magical abilities to boot."
558,,400,Dragon!,God Of War (2018),Transformation,"You can now take on the form of a dragon, a dangerous foe that is able to breath fire and summon lightning on top of its devastating physical strength, durable scales, and their ability to see through glamours and illusions. This form is always at least a magnitude greater than your base form. For example if you were a Dwarf, base Outsider, or base Jotunn you would have power equal to a demi-god. If you were a greater Jotunn or basic Vanir you would be equal to one of the greater Aesir, and if you were a greater Aesir or a monstrous Jotunn? You could be the bane of the gods."
559,,400,Ogre Might ,Thailand Mythology and Folklore,Transformation,"Some spirits are a lot stronger than most men. There are those giants taller than most houses and with might comparable to siege engines. Now, you are one of those. Standing about a dozen meters tall, you are strong enough to topple a seafaring vessel with the same ease a map flips a table, and your endurance certainly matches your size. Your agility is unfortunately not particularly impressive, but who needs precise maneuvers when you’re strong enough to simply bust through thick stone walls and smash nearly any mortal construction that can be found? You’d certainly be a force to be reckoned with in the battlefield, but do take care, those on your level are not uncommon and there are ways for powerful warriors to punch above their weight class. Still, even without training you’d be incredibly dangerous in combat even to the well-trained. Will you show off or retire in some remote cave to not be bothered?"
560,,400,Regression to the Age of Gods,Witch on the Holy Night,Transformation,"Among the Phantasmal Beasts, there are those that are special even among them. We speak of the Elementals: Spirits that are the planet’s sense of touch. You can freely shapeshift, becoming a giant monkey, a fair young child or a golden wolf-all of which are capable of shrugging off bullets and rockets like water merely with their hair, and even though sufficient raw magical energy can affect you where complex magecraft alone collapses withstanding a fifty-ton magical impact is well within your capabilities. Gender is basically aesthetic for you. And even if you could not, you could regenerate from your own heart. But your greatest ability are the unique Magic Circuits known as Regression of the Age of the Gods-gifted with the unique power to recreate Mysteries predating even True Magic itself. Your combined abilities let you engage some of the oldest monsters still walking this planet that can decide the fate of countries. Your status as a being superior to mere mortals is no idle boast-it is a simple, quantifiable fact."
561,,400,Bloodfiend,Library of Ruina,Transformation,"The legend of the Vampire precedes even the oldest ruins and board rooms of the city, blood sucking horrors acting as a predator to mankind. With such a long history, is it any surprise that they’re one of the few forms of “natural” distortion, pre-dating White Nights and Dark Days, and perhaps even being the root of the former L-Corps singularity? You find yourself as a Bloodfiend, a creature of literal bloodlust which remains the most common form of distortion, even while new ones have begun to form almost daily (before being snuffed out about as quickly). You may, of course, drink blood to heal yourself, or devour the flesh of others for even greater recovery. However, their true power is reshaping others. This can be in body, creating horrific yet potent abominations of combined flesh, or mind, or mentally, allowing for feats such as the manipulation of memories, with you having some degree of minor skill in both. Unfortunately, at least for the duration of your stay in the City you’ll find yourself burnt by running water, and needing to consume human blood and flesh. Nothing’s free here, is it?"
562,,400,Devil ,The Voynich Hotel,Transformation,"As it turns out, Hell is very much a real place in this world and devils do make their way “upstairs” from time to time. Mainly to tempt mortals into selling their souls by catering to their deepest desires, but sometimes just to get away from Hell. Thankfully the big man doesn’t take too much of an interest in what his minions get up to. So if you want to slack off eating donuts nobody is going to get on your case for it.

While Devils are all unique individuals, they have a number of common physical traits. Each one has a pair of horns atop their head, though the exact style of them varies widely, as well as a long, thin tail with an arrow point at its end. At a whim they can cause their fingers to grow long claws of terrifying sharpness and even a casual use of their superhuman strength would be enough to crush a lucador’s hand. Most have two eyes like normal people, a number of them have one large eye in the middle of their face instead. They also have all the beauty one would expect from a fallen angel. Oh, and don’t worry about mortals figuring out what you are unless you want them to see. They would have to have magical talent to see through the passive glamor that makes you look normal enough."
563,,400,Innocent Kaiju EX,Fate/Csjete Halloween Trilogy,Transformation,"Godzillaaaaa!!! For the lovers of giant monster movies, this lets you turn yourself into a massive giant. How big you may ask, well A Medieval Castle, Egyptian Pyramid, and Japanese Manor could all be stacked on top of each other and only reach your shoulder height so pretty damn big."
564,,400,Partswap,Adventure Time,Transformation,You have the strange ability to swap parts of your body out for those stolen from other people/ creatures. Magical parts may act erratically.
565,,400,Heart Of A Dragon,Fate/Apocrypha,Transformation,"Dragons are immensely powerful creatures. Not just physically, but magically as well. This magical might has resulted in some strange things, such as granting a hero who bathed in the blood of a dragon near-invulnerability. And what happens when the very heart of a dragon is inserted in one’s chest? Well, you’re certainly able to figure it out now. In other words, your heart is that of a dragon, pumping draconic blood throughout your body. The most evident effects of this is a significant increase in your physical abilities. It’s nowhere near the level of a Servant, but even if you were born with immense physical infirmity, you’d be as fit as someone can be without needing to work out your body. Additionally, you have a decent amount of resistance to magecraft and magical effects in general, although this isn’t insurmountable to modern Magi. It also allows you a powerful but slow regeneration should you have magical energy to infuse into your body, letting you heal even from getting shot in the heart repeatedly. 

The biggest change, of course, is something else. As you come to fight and wield magecraft and generally exercise your power, you’ll find black spots growing on your body. Eventually, these will become entire patches of blackened skin, and you’ll feel hints of what seem to be scales growing on them. Should you continue using magical energy and exerting yourself, you’ll find your body slowly morphing into a more draconic form. The end of this transformation will turn you into a powerful dragon, on par with Fafnir himself. This of course comes with many powers, such as the draconic breath so iconic to dragons, and the incredible generation of magical energy within your heart, not to mention the physical might of one of the strongest living creatures on the Planet. Of course, you should be careful at this point, as beings of fantasy generally aren’t welcome in the world of man. In future jumps you can switch to and from this draconic form whenever you wish, and will retain any benefits from it, like the dragon’s breath, even outside of that form."
566,,400,Multiple Forms,Lobotomy Corporation,Transformation,"You have multiple forms. Any and all can be human or monstrous. At first what forms you take are tied to your emotional state, but given enough practice, you can adapt to change forms willingly with little effort."
567,,400,Poseidon’s Blessing ,Hades,Transformation,"Poseidon is more relaxed than many of his fellow divinities, but even he will not be pleased at being bothered too often or for trivial reasons.However, calling him when you need a little extra wind in your sails, or when your fortunes are turning sour, is sure to grant you his blessing. You will find yourself transformed into a wave, twelve feet tall and as furious as the greatest of tidal waves. In this form others will be hard pressed to harm you, but your slightest touch will send them flying and batter them severely. For a time you will be Poseidon’s fury given form.

Like the mighty whirlpool, cause of so many sailor’s deaths, your watery form now pulls in nearby enemies and keeps them trapped within your tempestuous waters. With predictable results."
568,,400,Ares’ Favor,Hades,Transformation,"The God of War is happy to answer the call and give his blessing to those who know the appropriate time and place to request it. His lust of violence turns those he favors into a whirling tornado of weapons capable of cutting wide swaths through entire armies while also rendering them immune to the weapons of mere mortals. The transformation only lasts for a short time, but oh how much blood can be spilled by then.

Your desire for carnage knows no bounds and Ares is happy to respond in kind. Your transformed form gains a gravity that even the largest of foes would be hard pressed to ignore, pulling them into the dervish of chaos and death that you have become."
569,,400,Living Legend(Tier 2)        ,Fate/Strange Fake,Transformation,"You are Ghost Liner, also known as Servants under the Holy Grail War system. You are the manifestation of one of the Heroic Spirits engraved in human history. Even at your weakest, you are many more times more resistant, faster and stronger than any human not reinforced by magical energy, and find that any physical phenomena not coated with magical energy or mystery will not be able to hurt you, and even then, weak spellcasters of this era find it hard to affect you with magecraft. You are capable of entering a spiritual form in which your body becomes completely unable to affect or be affected by the physical world.

You may choose a legend, be it an actual historical figure or a more mythological one, even fairy tales, to incarnate in a class of your choosing. Each class has different strengths and weaknesses, as well as a few base ‘Skills’. See the Notes section for more information. You may choose any existing Servant that fits your tier, or create a new one that would fit the rules of summoning in this world. While you may choose demigods, those who called themselves gods while being mortal and avatars of gods who were human, you may not choose a full divinity with just this option alone. The potency of your legend and the power of your servant container is initially dependent on how much you decide to invest in this option.

For 400 CP, you instead are on the level of a greatly powerful Heroic Spirit, easily making it as a top B Rank or even an A Rank Servant. Your stats are quite decent, and you have something that sets you apart from the rest. Perhaps quite a powerful combination of abilities, such as a godly speed and the ability to call an instant imitation of the release of the Sword of Promised Victory even while using a wooden stick as a channeler or the ability to multiply into many bodies, and turn each of them into a fearsome demonic creature. Or perhaps it is variety which gives you an edge, even if those abilities aren't especially powerful, such as having imitations of almost all the supernatural assassination techniques of an order of assassins powerful enough for each to become the Noble Phantasm of a Servant.

However, the fact that you are now a Ghost Liner, a manifested record from the greatest that mankind has seen, comes with some downsides as well. First and foremost, you require a link with a Master who supplies you with magical energy to exist, and also to draw the full use of your power. If you lose your Master, you will need to quickly find another Master, or a powerful source of mana to maintain your existence. How quickly depends on your own Skills and energy reserves when summoned, as Archers may remain for longer due to their Independent Action Skill, and Casters may also prolong their fading using some trick. Otherwise, you may need to resort to eating the souls of humans to maintain your form. Those of the 800 CP option may have some ways to remain existing even without this due to either a powerful Skill or Noble Phantasm, and other Servants such as experienced Casters may pull out something on the same effect, but without a Master or some other source of magical energy you will not be able to draw your full strength during this jump, unless you somehow manage to incarnate. After the end of this jump, you will be considered as having been incarnated and will not necessitate a Master or external supply to go all out and maintain your existence.

Additionally, Heroic Spirits have weaknesses related to their legends: if a specific tool was used to kill them, they will become extremely weak to them. This requires it to be something truly specific, like Heracles falling to the Hydra Venom, or the specific weapon that was used to befell you, such as Mordred dying to Rhongomyniad. But things like recreating the situation of one’s death may also prove to have a much greater effect on the Heroic Spirit, and if you were to cross paths with those that had already defeated you in your legend, or even killed you, it would take a lot to overcome that burden.

For 800 CP, you are one of the top legends, a Great Hero from the Age of Gods. Between your origins, you could be a powerful Demigod whose body and magical energy rivals that of the gods themselves, or perhaps something even stranger but equally powerful, such as a living Noble Phantasm of the gods themselves. Not only are your stats out of this world, with even your unarmed form being something that could end most Servants, but you also possess a vast array of powerful abilities, along with an even more powerful trump card. You could be like the King Heroes, who possess all the prototypes of the Noble Phantasms wielded by Heroic Spirits, and all the inventions derived from the Wisdom of Humanity, a mentality that grants him an extremely powerful Clairvoyance, as well as a 'sword' that is derived from the Authority that splitted the heavens and Earth and is older than the planet itself. Maybe you are a being shaped from Divine Clay, molded by the gods themselves to bind the mightiest of demigods and any other divinity, with the ability to endlessly regenerate as long as you can extract mana from the ground, to turn the ground around you into noble phantasmal versions of the weapons of humanity, and to even call the Counter Forces to empower you when you aim to defend the world (and thus yourself as well) from threats that would damage. Or perhaps you take from the twisted version of the most famous heroes, such as a corrupted Heracles that casted away his divinity in order to embrace his human side, gaining a powerful set of abilities. Even darker still, you may be a Phantasmal Beast that approaches or exists in the Divine Beast rank, even embodying a concept such as Calamity.

571,,400,Lesser Grail Vessel ,Fate/Strange Fake,Transformation,"You are an Homunculus, an artificial human. Or at least, the vessel or body you inhabit is, for some of the most esoteric beings here. And not any kind of homunculus, but one of the best works of the Einzbern clan: an Justeaze-type Homunculus with the capacity of acting as a Lesser Grail.

Just for starters, this grants you many major benefits: as an homunculus, your magical circuits are of an extreme quality, enough that most modern magi would find themselves hard pressed to fight you in a battle of raw magical power. You also don’t require food or sleep, as long as you have magical energy to keep yourself going. Keeping on the magical side, you have been embedded with a special reverse-type Magic Crest that provides you with advanced knowledge of the Alchemy branded by the Einzbern, albeit not all of their most closed secrets, such as the creation of homunculi of your quality.

But your most important function is being able to act as a Lesser Grail: a container for the souls of Heroic Spirits fallen in the Holy Grail War. When a Servant dies, instead of returning to the Throne of Heroes, their soul gets trapped inside of your body. When enough accumulation occurs, usually around six souls of standard servants. This allows you to perform a Wish, a process in which the Servant souls are used as pure magical energy to skip any process of magecraft and use the raw magical energy to achieve a desired effect. With six servant souls, the effects could be enough that even Lords of the Clock Tower may seek to use you, but with seven it could be enough to make changes even in the timeline or affect the whole world. Of course, the Third True Magic is outside of your realm of possibility, as well as reaching the Origin, at least without the framework of the actual Fuyuki Greater Holy Grail.

As a final benefit, it seemed that the Einzbern weren’t totally interested in this imitation of the Holy Grail besides seeing it as a curiosity. As such, you have been granted the ability to shut down your Lesser Grail function, and to activate it again when you deem it necessary. It may be possible to tune it to receive the souls of other summons within systems different from the Holy Grail War, with enough study. This may also prove useful if your soul is not on the rank that could withstand holding the souls of several servants before being overwritten and turned into a mere object."
572,,400,Vampirism,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Transformation,"Bodies are fleeting things, kept alive in part by the souls that they house. There is a branch of witchcraft that can reinforce the body to make it weather time indefinitely, this branch is called Vampirism. Essentially, the practice involves consuming a still living soul by sucking it out of a body. Doing so will revitalize the practitioner, restoring their youth as well as granting short term regeneration that can even restore limbs. This regeneration may not be fast enough to help much in combat, but an indefinite lifespan to practice and refine one's skills is nothing to scoff at.

Unlike the other branches of Witchcraft, there isn't a benign application of the magic, so beware letting others know of your particular palate."
573,,400,Spirit(400),Fate/Legends - Baba Yaga,Transformation,"The World is not just inhabited by mankind. Taking this option puts you on a path that is more mysterious and esoteric. You become a Spirit but what kind of Spirit depends on how much you are willing to pay.

For 400 CP you become a Nature Spirit, created from elements of nature or natural phenomena. One of particular note and infamy would be born from the Tunguska Explosion. Depending on what you are the Spirit of you gain some powers connected to it but no more than three. A Spirit born from animals crying out in anger at humanity for believing they killed them with weapons, would gain an affinity for weapons for example, as well as the ability to absorb animal DNA into itself to gain more power and spawn them from their body."
574,,400,Adaptation Beyond Natural Law,Godbound,Transformation,"For ten centuries, a combination of heretical sorcery, dark artifice or the misfortunate of some cursed birthplace has given rise to anomalous lifeforms called the Misbegotten. Vile, twisted chimeras made of humans and beasts or humans and animals warped into monstrous shapes until they are loosely tethered to natural law, the infamous bloodlust of such creatures has made all right thinking men wary of them. It seems that whatever tampering of your form and body has made you a superlative specimen of such beings. You may be some sort of huge beast, or simply a vast humanoid in the make of ogres or giants. Your savagery, might and agility can threaten a number of novice Godbound, and your tainted existence offers a few Gifts belonging to one Word in addition to your twisted might."
575,,400,Inheritors of a Ruined Heaven(Angel),Godbound,Transformation,"Heaven is a broken house, torn apart from the violence of the Made Gods and the damage done to its celestial engines. Whether you shake in rage for what was done to it, creak wearily when your joints are not serviced properly or shiver for the next iota of faith you are an immortal, mighty threat to an entire pantheon of novice Godbound. Yet that is cold comfort when everything you once valued lies in rubble. You may have been cast down by force or cling to an uncertain existence, but your wrath is still great enough to punish those who would take what little you have left.

Whatever your nature, your very being is endowed with a divine force that can threaten an entire pantheon of the Godbound shared only by the most powerful of Eldritches and Uncreated. Short of the most dramatically focused and powerful forms of mundane damage, generally only supernatural forces have a hope of harming you. Spells, Gifts and magic swords would qualify. Like Eldritches and Uncreated, the lesser specimens among you can be harmed by open flame too; you are not especially vulnerable to them and likely can easily nullify flame as a threat with even passive Gifts or casual miracles, but unlike bullets and avalanches it can actually hurt you. Even Eldritches, generally the least resilient of such beings, would take something like sticking their heads in the muzzle of a magnetic cannon to receive harm from the mundane. In turn, all your attacks always count as magical weapons for the purpose of overcoming similar defences like the resilience of the Godbound-and whether with stronger spells or unnatural might, strike with more damage than mundane adversaries. Like the Godbound, your divine constitution also lets you shrug off certain supernatural effects as a “saving throw”.

Last but not least, for 400 CP you may be an Angel. First-formed children of the One, your kind maintained the order of creation, sustained the celestial engines, guarded the gates of Hell and stoked the flames or purification that burned sinful souls clean for uncounted ages. You may pass between Heaven, Hell and the world freely as an inherent power, though after the breaking of the world it has proven increasingly difficult to do so safely. You know much more about the One, how to repair, maintain or disable the Celestial Engines and the concepts they sustain and the creation of this world than any other order of being. Though some were discontent with servitude, all were satisfied. Most now consider that if humanity is determined to destroy all creation with their hateful meddling, it is only proper that every soul be safely and eternally chained in the fires of Hell.

Though all angels can shapeshift into different forms related to their purpose, including a human guise in some cases most resemble gigantic winged humanoids twice as tall as a man who burn with the inner light of their natures-and all move swifter than most can react. All such forms save their human guise have a handful of miscellaneous lesser powers related to their purpose. Some sort of mobility such as flight, teleportation and both are common, but the power to belch molten gold from your mouth, conjuring a flaming sword to smite those around you and energy bolts have all been observed. That which you strike in anger is Unmade, rent asunder by disproportionate effort for all wrathful angels are engines of supernal destruction. You yourself are Unfettered, granted an invincible defence against all effects from this world that would read or affect your mind and emotions-and even able to give false readings to any effects that would pry into your thoughts or true nature. Last but not least, as an Unborn creation empowered to maintain an aspect of natural law, you have powers commensurate to being bound to one Word of Creation symbolising your duty. Even as one of the least of the angels with a straightforward duty such as being one of Heaven’s frontline warriors, you are a threat to an entire pantheon of novice Godbound...and Heaven help your foes should you turn out to be an even greater being."
576,,400,ARMS Ability,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Transformation,"You possess the ARMS ability, which you can toggle between active and inactive at will. You do not need a regulator mask to control this power.

When active, your arms become coiled and are able to be extended like springs, providing you with considerable reach. They can also be used as springs to launch yourself high into the air, serving as an escape option for you when you are in danger. In this state your extendable limbs are referred to as ARMS (not to be confused with the equipment of the same name). As a side effect of this change, your eyes take on a spiral pattern when the ability is active. Your ARMS themselves may also take on an aesthetic effect of your choosing, decided upon purchase of this perk. For example, they may appear to be made of noodles, look like metallic springs or large silver chains. This aesthetic effect offers no mechanical benefit."
577,,400,Devil Gene,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Transformation,"You possess some kind of unusual heritage, giving you a strange demonic power that you can tap into.

When not actively being drawn upon, this power has little influence over your physical appearance, though it may occasionally cause an eye to glow red. When utilised however, you will undergo a dramatic transformation. Unless already applicable, your skin will take on a purple colour, your ears will become pointed (provided your base form has ears to begin with), you will grow out a pair of horns, bat-like wings, and a “third eye” positioned vertically on your forehead (or equivalent).

Aside from a change in look, your devil transformation affords a number of advantages. Your wings enable flight. You can fire lasers out from your “third eye”, providing you with some ranged combat options, and you are somewhat physically stronger whilst in this state. Unfortunately, this transformation requires a great deal of effort to maintain, and is thus best used in short bursts. Fortunately, entering and leaving this state is near-instant, enabling such behaviour.

You can tap even further into your Devil Gene. When doing so, spikes and armour-like portions grow from your body, and any hair you possess disappears, becoming part of your form. You also grow a tail, if you did not previously possess one. Most notably, additional “eyes” appear on your wings, as well as one on your chest. Like the eye granted by normal use of your Devil Gene, these can fire lasers. However, by using them in combination, you will be able to perform an extremely powerful laser attack.

Tapping into your Devil Gene in the manner described above is extremely exhausting, and as such it is unlikely that you will be able to do it more than once in a given battle.

Post jump, your base species and this modifier are considered separate alt-forms, though the alt-form based on this modifier will only feature the occasional glowing red eye that appeared in your base state; your Devil Gene powers will instead become a transformation that you can utilise in any of your forms, though this transformation will not become any easier to maintain due to this change."
578,,400,Part-Giant ,Wizarding World,Transformation,"Given how even a sixteen-foot giant is considered small by the standards of their kind, it would do you well not to think of the implications of a human and giant coupling. At bare minimum, you stand at eight and half feet tall when fully grown, although, it would not be a surprise to see you stand at twice at the height of an ordinary man and possessing thrice their width. And such prodigious size comes with equally impressive strength and durability.

Without even using magic, you are already strong enough to bend steel with ease, send people flying with your fists, or casually lift trees even wider and taller than you are. Some might even say you could wrestle with mountain trolls and come out victorious. And you can certainly take quite a beating, receiving blows from giants that would kill ordinary witches and wizards. You could even take a dozen spells and curses with nary a scratch, a notably impressive feat given that a single stunning spell is often enough to stop a wizard in their tracks and knock them out.

Just watch out for others alright. Not everyone can boast your impressive physicality."
579,,400,Part-Elf,Wizarding World,Transformation,"Despite their rather inhuman appearances, there are a few wizards out there willing to become rather... intimate and consummate with house-elves. You are one of the descendants of such a coupling, one that was somehow fortunate enough to avoid the physical shortcomings of such a thing and yet keep the advantages. More specifically, you find yourself possessing an affinity for simple wandless magic. Spells such as Hover Charms and those that push back your foes can be done and you’ll find such things to be stronger than before, with or without a wand. Finally, should you learn Apparition, you’ll find that your strange nature allows you to bypass defenses and spells that would block out even the greatest of wizards and witches."
580,,400,Hardened Scales,Elden Ring - Limgrave,Transformation,"The mighty dragons one typically finds within the Lands Between have few weapons deadlier than their elemental breath, one that you will inevitably have to face. Such a threat is now more of a nuisance to you, as your skin has become more scaly, which will offer you an incredible amount of elemental resistance. Fire, frost, lightning, all of it is no more a danger to you than particularly harsh rain, and will allow you to get in close to your quarry."
581,,400,Changing Hat,Gummi Bears,Transformation,"A magic hat that changes the wearer into the same person mentioned by the wearer complete with clothing. The hat can change your species into other ones. This does not do voices very well and it unfortunately triggers on any name you say, removal of the hat ends the effect."
582,,400,Dragon,Gummi Bears,Transformation,"Dragons here are 30 feet long, talking, flying and fire breathing cave dwellers who tend to sleep for decades. Both western style and Eastern style dragons exist along with various subspecies. Dragons live for thousands of years."
583,,400,Blue Moon Mage,Wizard 101,Transformation,"The Moon is ever-changing, and the practitioners of its arts are more comfortable than most with shedding their forms for another’s. With this power you can now, with study and effort, create new Lunar transformation spells based on monsters and supernatural creatures you encounter. Effort must be spent to know and understand the creature’s inner workings, strengths, weaknesses, and so on, before a transformation can be made."
584,,400,Grand Library,Beauty and the Beast,Transformation,"This room, which may be added to a property you own, or attached to your Warehouse by a special gateway, is a large library filled with books. A perfect gift for the voracious reader.

To begin with, the library is equal to the one found in Beast’s Castle. However, at the start of each new jump after this one, an equivalent number of books will be added, derived from the books that may be found in the world you have arrived in. Rare books may be included, but only if they are mundane in nature. If supernatural or magical books are commonplace in the world you have arrived in, then some of your new books may be the more common varieties of these kinds of books.

Your library will always be able to hold any number of books inside, regardless of whether they were provided by this item’s own effect, or introduced by you manually. In order to accomplish this, the library will expand internally in order to accommodate them. No matter how large it gets, it will not get larger on the outside, and you will somehow find it easy to navigate to specific books you are looking for.

In each future jump, you may choose to move this room to your Warehouse (if not already there), or to an appropriate property you possess. Post-chain, you will be able to do this once every ten years. Should the room be destroyed, a replacement will appear in the same location after 24 hours. If it was placed out in the world, and that location is no longer viable, it will instead become attached to your Warehouse. If a book provided by this item is lost or destroyed, a replacement will appear in the room after 24 hours (if the room has also been destroyed and has not yet been replaced, this effect will delay to the same time as the room replacement)."
585,,400,Path of the Dragon,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Transformation,"Though they were defeated in that most ancient of battles, people of all stripes have dreamed of transforming into a dragon themselves, to wield the power of those stone scaled entities that predated even the gods. But these would typically be just that, dreams. Under you, though, such dreams can be made a reality. You know how to initiate a process in others that will transform them into true dragons, though their strength, as well as the speed of the transformation itself depends entirely on how much power you use to kick start this process."
586,,400,Grafted Structure,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Transformation,"The dead are often hauled away to specified areas, the living uncomfortable with the idea that their time of ending is slowly growing ever closer, with perhaps the most disrespectful being those mass graves, where corpses are thrown haphazardly. You may have originated from one such grave, for how else could you explain your newfound power? You can now modify yourself by adding more skeletons to yourself, applying their natural abilities to yourself. Adding a dragon head to your arm would grant you the ability to spew fire from its maw, for example."
587,,400,Touch The Sky,Dark Souls: Covenants,Transformation,"Long has mankind looked to the birds in the sky with envy, longing for the ability to take to the air themselves. Sprouting from your back is a third pair of limbs that shall make such a dream a reality, which can be folded up or fade away when not in use. Should you already be capable of flight, then these shall increase both your speed and control while in the air."
588,,400,The Kiss of True Love        ,Disney’s The Little Mermaid,Transformation,"When you are kissed by someone who deeply loves you, you can elect to make any physical transformation magically imposed on you permanent. Likewise, if you deeply love someone, and you know they have a physical transformation magically imposed on them, you can make that transformation permanent by kissing them.

This perk only applies to changes to the physical form – mental or spiritual changes cannot be made permanent. Enhancements to physical characteristics outside the form itself (such as magical buffs or enchantments) cannot be made permanent either.

Additionally, when you kiss someone you deeply love, or when you are kissed by someone who deeply loves you, you can choose for that kiss to be treated as “The Kiss of True Love” for the purpose of magical or supernatural effects that require or benefit from such a thing."
589,,400,True Vampire(400),Hellsing Ultimate Abridged,Transformation,"No more kidding around, you’re a real fuckmothering vampire. Like Seras and Alucard, you have been blessed, or perhaps cursed...you know what, you’re blursed with True Vampirism and all the strings that come with it. You begin your journey on par with Seras before her transformation, or perhaps an exceptionally young True Vampire. Even still, you’re a force to behold. You have enough strength in a finger flick to knock a grown man off his feet, and would have no trouble completely overpowering an artificial vampire with the right armlock. Your speed and reflexes are equally unreal, letting you casually dodge volleys of bullets and outpace all but the greatest of supernatural threats in a fight. And while your regenerative abilities pale in comparison to Alucard’s, you could still walk away from seemingly-lethal impalement by multiple holy blades with just a few minutes rest. You also gain a few more esoteric abilities, like supernatural perceptiveness of your surroundings and the ability to see through illusions, though most of your stranger powers will take much more time to develop. You’ve still got to contend with the traditional weaknesses of vampirism, like direct sunlight and (to a lesser extent) holy weapons, and you must regularly quench your bloodthirst, but these are small prices to pay to become an apex predator in the supernatural world. "
590,,400,True Vampire(800),Hellsing Ultimate Abridged,Transformation,"For twice the points, you’ll be running with the big dog himself. Like Alucard, you’ll be strong enough to casually skewer bodies on 30ft flagpoles, or to do a decent Superman impression by leaping with a running start. You’re also faster than the human eye can track, with reflexes that will let you catch bullets with your teeth and fly a Blackbird through a curtain of flak at Mach 3. You’re also durable enough to be thrown through skyscrapers and can near-instantly regenerate from everything; from complete dismemberment to the combined gunfire of two separate armies. But all of this pales in comparison to your greater power over the souls of your prey. By drinking the blood of your victims, you consume not just their nutrients, but their very soul. This appears as a red-black mist and adds to your collective power. Your true being is composed of this dark material, letting you manipulate your shape to form appendages, weapons, reanimated minions, and even cute moė bodies to taunt your friends with. You can also infuse these shadows into inanimate materials, reinforcing them and granting you a limited form of telekinesis over them.

Then there are the other perks; hypnosis, limited telepathy, the ability to ignore conventional weaknesses like sunlight and holy weapons. Basically, the more blood you drink and the more souls you collect, the more bullshit your powers will become. See the Notes section for additional clarification. Lord knows you’ll need it.

Here’s the full list of True Vampire powers, since it’s kind of bananas:
● Superhuman Strength, Speed, and Reflexes: Vampires can tear through mortals like paper and keep pace with bullets, rocketplanes, and other supernatural monsters.
● Soul Collection: Vampires collect souls by drinking blood, building their internal power and fueling the rest of their abilities. This also can let them absorb the memories of the deceased. If the soul consents, the consumed person retains their personality and autonomy instead of becoming a mindless fuel source.
● Supernatural Endurance and Regeneration: Vampires are extremely difficult to kill, proportional to the number of souls they’ve collected. When a vampire takes mortal damage (already a tall order), they can expend a soul to survive.
● Shapeshifting: Vampires can alter their appearance or form useful appendages/weapons by manifesting their Soul Collection and changing its shape. An average Vampire might form a spectral arm or a disguise to wear, while Alucard could change into a swarm of bats or insects. The greater your reserve and experience, the more freedom you have.
● Hypnosis, Telepathy, and Underling Authority: Vampires can (apparently) hypnotize the weak willed into following their orders or believing certain ideas. Vampires have greater control over other vampires/ghouls they create themselves, commanding them like a master commands their servants.
● Levitation and Wallwalking: Even young or Artificial Vampires can seemingly adjust their personal gravity, letting them gently float in the air or run up vertical surfaces. This power alone does not allow flight, as seen when Alucard was stranded in the ocean.
● Telekinesis: An odd power, Vampires appear to be able to manipulate objects that they infuse with their Soul Collection. Obviously, the more souls you have, the greater the mass that you can move.

591,,400,Werekin(400)        ,Hellsing Ultimate Abridged,Transformation,"You’ve got a beast inside, and it’s time to let it out! A far rarer and simpler kind of monstrosity than vampires, what werekin lack in strange abilities they make up for in raw physical performance. You have a body as durable as steel, with strength, speed, and reflexes that let you squash those wannabe artificial vampires like insects. You could even keep up with True Vampires, so long as they were young ones. As a pureblooded lycanthrope, you can shift between a human form, a hybrid form, and a monstrous full wolf form at will, gaining more power as you surrender more of your humanity. Your wounds heal unbelievably quickly, and even if you are killed, you will turn into mist and reform. Only a decisively lethal blow made by a silver weapon can kill a lycanthrope for good. As an added bit of freedom, you needn’t commit to the classic “wolf” theme. You could be a were-lion, a were-bear, hell, be a were-shark. Go fucking nuts."
592,,400,Werekin(800)        ,Hellsing Ultimate Abridged,Transformation,"For twice the original price, your abilities have grown explosively in power. Whether through
ancient magics, nazi technology, or simply centuries of experience, you have matched the
power of the Captain himself. Physically, you are far and away the strongest monster present in
this world. Your regeneration and reformation from mist now happens in an eyeblink, though
your vulnerability to silver remains. In a straight-up fight, even Alucard would have to get
creative to defeat you. Such power weighs heavily on the soul, however, as shown by the
Captain’s disposition. Will you revel in unbridled power, or will you too seek a worthy enemy to
end your existence?

Requires Werekin(400) to Purchase"
593,,400,Vampire Serum,Hellsing,Transformation,"The Doktor’s prize work, in replicable form. A special serum that creates the artificial vampires that make up the thousand strong Letz Battalion. A single injection, and a few nights of transformation, is all that’s required to gain immortality and great power. A necessary injection as well, given the inability of these artificial creations to reproduce their own kind. You have ten vials available here, each refilling a month after their initial use. Likely a greater rate than the Doktor himself could accomplish, at least not without significantly greater resources. 

Alternatively, you can instead have this purchase represent the FREAK Chips that existed in a different continuity of this story. Working in a similar way, they turn the recipients into vampires. However, multiple chips can be placed on a single person to increase their power as a vampire further, albeit at growing instability."
594,,400,"Vampire, Artificial",Hellsing,Transformation,"A first step into the night. Products of either occult Nazi science or, in another chronicle, the FREAK Chips of the Incognito order, you have taken form as an artificially created Vampire. Immortal and unaging, these vampires possess many of the traditional traits of the unholy species. Enough strength to rip mortal men to pieces and the speed to dodge gunfire with ease, each vampire is a potent warrior. Tireless and requiring only the blood of the living as food, they make for the perfect soldier. They have the senses to match most hunting animals in sight, hearing or smell and heal from most wounds in seconds. A gunshot to the head won’t hinder a vampire and it disappears in moments. As with all beings that walk the night, they have a loosened relationship with physical laws, allowing minor feats like walking up walls or standing on the ceiling. 

But Artificial Vampires, despite their power, are lesser than the true breed. Many of their abilities are weaker than that of a True Vampire or even missing entirely, such as the natural aptitude for hypnosis. A Vampire of this lesser type cannot even create more of themselves. Sucking the blood of another being will only ever create ghouls, mindless undead bound to the will of the Vampire in question. Additionally, they possess most of the well known weaknesses of this kind. Silver or blessed weapons can seriously harm vampires and damage to the heart or head often results in destruction outright if severe, despite their healing powers. The light of the daytime sun irritates and weakens vampires, while their forms cannot cross open bodies of water without external assistance. Garlic, holy water and even wooden stakes are all potent weapons against vampires and unlike the true breed, the artificial species is unable to lessen these weaknesses through age."
595,,400,Dipping Down,Star vs the Forces of Evil,Transformation,"You don’t need a wand to cast the local magic anymore (but it still helps with casting), and your magical skills just grew by about the amount the average Mewnian Monarch had; this perk adds some decent control to your magical abilities. If you want it to, it comes free with a transformation into a multi-armed, butterfly-winged entity."
596,,400,Vampirism,Wizards of Waverly Place,Transformation,"You are a Level Six Monster, a Vampire to be precise. Similar to Julliet, you were born with a soul, and possess all the powers of a Vampire from the world of the Wizard of Waverly Place. However, since you are paying with CP, you do not suffer from their weakness to Pumpkin or to the Sunlight.

Cannot Be Taken With Purebred"
597,,400,Cy-Bug Cyborg,WRECK-IT RALPH,Transformation,"You’ve been infused with some Cy-Bug code, but somehow your personality has come out on top. Your appearance is mostly the same, at least at first, though you might have a few cosmetic insectoid features if you so desire. The true benefit of this power is that you can now gain traits of things that you consume. This can either be a literal consumption, or you can switch to a different form of assimilation, such as grabbing things in your hands and having them dissolve away into code you absorb. Either way, once you’ve consumed something, your body will alter to integrate the abilities. Just be aware, if you consume something with an ego and will of its own, you’ll have to deal with those thoughts and mentalities integrating and competing with your own."
598,,400,Big Jumper ,Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,Transformation,"Jack has a number of imposing traits, but one of the simplest is his sheer size. Jack Horner is an incredibly large individual. Papa Bear is the only individual who is physically bigger than him and he is nearly twice as large as his wife Mama Bear. Like Mr. Horner you are an incredibly imposing figure towering over those around you. This perk is also capable of effecting any alt form you possess as well. If you need a solid number then you are approximately three times as large as other members of your species. Keep in mind this includes factors such as your strength as well. While Horner was much taller he also possessed the appropriate amount of muscle with his size meaning that he was likely far stronger than any other human in the setting."
599,,400,Giant,Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,Transformation,"The Giants are a race of giant beings as their name implies. The exact height of these beings varies, but they tend to be approximately one hundred feet tall on average. Going along with this size they also possess incredible physical prowess far beyond any other being in the setting. For example, the Sleeping Giant of Del Mar was easily capable of tearing apart large buildings and destroying a whole town in minutes. You may become one of these giants by purchasing this option. Lastly, there are a wide variety of giants which you can become. Many of them resemble elemental beings, but some of them simply are gigantic humanoids. You may freely choose what type of giant you are as long as it doesn’t make you overwhelmingly strong compared to the rest of your species."
600,,400,Environmental Adaptation,Atlantis - The Lost Empire,Transformation,"If the Atlanteans can survive in a cavern beneath the earth for thousands of years, is it really that much of a surprise that you could survive in ice- or even molten magma? Yes, with this perk you’re more than capable of surviving in any one environment on earth, no matter how inhospitable it is to ordinary life. You could swim through molten rock as if it was water, your body nigh-instantly cooling itself down the second you step from the molten pools; or to give a less extreme example you could survive in the desert or arctic with little issue, subsisting for months or even years off what little sustenance you can find and being entirely unphased by the harsh sunlight or the sub-zero temperatures. 

+ Elemental: Of course, there’s no reason why you can’t take a things a step further and into the realm of the outright supernatural. No longer content to be limited by mere biology, you have become a creature of the elements themselves. You could have a body of liquid fire and molten rock, hot enough to melt snow and ice in a large radius around you and scorch stone with your presence- or, you could be a creature of snow and ice, cold enough to freeze anyone unfortunate enough to stand before you with a blast of your arctic breath. Whatever you pick, it will come with the natural weaknesses of whatever you are made of- water will smother fire, just as fire would burn a creature of wood like kindling. In addition, you will be capable of healing yourself by absorbing more of your element- for instance, if you are made of lava and have an arm turn to stone thanks to a sudden flood of water, you could break it off and take a dip in a volcano to heal."
601,,400,A Lesson Ignored,Brave,Transformation,"Stop me if you’ve heard this before: a power-hungry fool is given a powerful new form, and loses themselves in the process. Fortunately, you’ve been protected against such a fate.

You now have the ability to ignore instincts or imprinted behaviour that are derived from your
current form. Ignoring these takes no effort on your part, and you can still choose to indulge in these behaviours if you wish. This does not remove any requirements of your physical form these instincts might be pushing you to address.

Additionally, while you may still be transformed physically, these physical changes are not accompanied by associated mental ones. For example, if you were transformed into a bear, you would not adopt the mindset and lesser intelligence a bear would have. This protection does not extend to effects that target your mind without also targeting your body."
602,,400,Shell of Gold,Moana,Transformation,"As a Living Legend, you may take a form that fits your legend. It can be anything that might exist in this world. You could be a giant volcanic is- land, or a super-sized monstrous version of some natural creature (Tamatoa is a Coconut Crab the size of a large house), or you could be a living elemental, like the Ocean or a living storm front. Regardless, you are timeless and all but immortal... but also instantly recognizable in your true form as being who and what you are. Even someone who has never met you will know who you are. Your name will be whispered across the various cultures you encounter, even before you meet any of their people."
603,,400,Cher-hooo,Moana,Transformation,"Would you look at that? You can shapeshift into any natural animal you‟ve ever seen. And you can do so incredibly rapidly. It takes less than 1 second for you to shift from a tiny bug to a giant whale. You can even transform in mid-flight and back, or partly shapeshift at will. This is powered by your confidence and sense of self-worth. Anything you‟re wearing shifts with you, but not things you‟re carrying."
604,,400,God,Disney’s Hercules,Transformation,"You’re the real deal now, man! You’re a god, a full-fledged, proper god, will everything that entails! By default this makes you a Greek god, but you can be of some other pantheon if you so wish. No matter what, you’re ageless and immortal, and do not require any sleep, food or any other sustenance. No mundane weapons, poisons or diseases can affect you more than momentarily, and even supernatural ones have their work cut out."
605,,400,Freed Genie,Aladdin,Transformation,"You are a freed genie. That means that you do not get the Unlimited Cosmic Power of your bound cousins. As such you have a much larger mana reserve than normal, vast magical knowledge, gain the power of flight and even the power to change your form at will. You also no longer need such things as foci or incantations to cast your spells.

Just like in the animated series, your magic can be blocked or negated by the proper forces. And you count as magic for anything that targets it. So stay away from magic eating monsters and anti-magic zones if you know what is good for you. But know that you are still on par with the powerful sorcerers of this world. Unlike Genie from the franchise, your power will not grow back to the Unlimited Cosmic Power levels over your time in this world on its own. This limit can be removed post jump if you can find a proper way."
606,,400,Elven Tribe,Black Clover,Transformation,​The race once beloved by mana and possessing powerful magical ability. This race was slaughtered by ancient humans down to the last child. The reason being the advantages you now hold as a member of the Elven Race you now possess immense stores of mana with the weakest Elf being equal to the standard Magic Knight. Elves are apparently blessed by the mana allowing them to learn in far shorter times than is possible for humans. Now seeing as the whole tribe was massacred how you exist is bewildering at best whether there were survivors of the masacre and you are merely the last of your lineage or whatever else.
607,,400,Gogmazios ,Dial,Transformation,"Gogmazios, a colossal elder dragon, dominates the skies with its massive size, stretching an impressive length of approximately one hundred and sixty feet long. Its rugged, stone-like exterior is adorned with thick, protective scales, lending it an aura of invincibility. Equipped with powerful jaws, razor-sharp teeth, and bat-like wings, Gogmazios possesses both devastating biting strength and exceptional aerial prowess.

This formidable creature boasts a unique ability to generate and manipulate tar. Its arsenal includes the ability to ensnare and immobilize prey by expelling streams of tar, as well as the creation of explosive projectiles using this viscous substance. Gogmazios is renowned for its enduring nature, displaying unparalleled resilience in the face of adversity. Its long existence has allowed it to develop an intimate understanding of its surroundings and master the art of survival."
608,,400,Wendigo,Dial,Transformation,"Embrace the fearsome power of the Wendigo and unleash your enhanced physical prowess upon the world. As a Wendigo, you possess incredible strength that surpasses most beings, allowing you to overpower opponents effortlessly. Your unmatched agility and speed grant you exceptional maneuverability and lightning-fast reflexes, ensuring you can swiftly evade attacks and strike with precision. Your heightened senses enable you to track prey and detect hidden dangers with unwavering accuracy. But the power of the Wendigo offers more than just physical might. Your regenerative abilities are unparalleled, mending even the most grievous wounds in moments. Broken bones mend swiftly, and injuries become a fleeting inconvenience as you rapidly recover. This exceptional regenerative power bestows upon you remarkable endurance, enabling you to endure and continue fighting even in the direst of circumstances.

Harnessing the insatiable hunger within, you can tap into an extraordinary well of power. By consuming the flesh of your foes, you temporarily augment your physical attributes, magnifying your strength and resilience. The more you feed, the more formidable you become, transforming into an unstoppable force that strikes fear into the hearts of your enemies. It’s worth noting that, unlike the traditional curse of the Wendigo, you will be unaffected by its detrimental effects. Purchasing this transformation with CP grants you immunity to the curse, allowing you to maintain control over your actions and preserve your humanity while unleashing the full potential of the Wendigo’s power."
609,,400,Binding Ritual        ,Ghost Rider,Transformation,"You’ve discovered a way to bind spiritual entities to mortal hosts. Doing so will grant the host a hybrid form of whatever being you stuck in them, while also allowing them to use that being’s abilities, but the process is not without risk. The spirit can attempt to fight its host for control over the body, taking over if the host is too weak or too weak willed, and the spirit will be able to influence or even speak to its host even when not transformed. You are also capable of undoing this process."
610,,400,Asgardian,Thor: Love and Thunder,Transformation,"An Asgardian. This option makes you one, but if you really want to be like Thor, you’ll need to take the below selection as well. You are of the Aesir, the heroic warrior race that once protected the nine realms for the good of all. The Asgardians were and still are, one of the mightiest races in the multiverse, and you are no exception. Firstly, your physical abilities are great. Asgardians can bend industrial steel like taffy, throw cars around with ease, leap almost a hundred feet in the air, and lift just over ten tons. And that’s just the average Asgardian - their warriors can get up to forty or fifty. They boast the durability to take punishment of the same scale and are fast, agile, and coordinated enough to outrun racehorses and muscle cars. The Aesir are well known for their great endurance, able to fight for days on end without tiring. Incidentally, this means that they have an incredible amount of drinking tolerance. If an Asgardian does meet an adversary great enough to wound them, they have an accelerated healing factor that lets them recover from injuries that would take months in minutes, though they can’t heal from injuries normal humans can’t heal from, like severed limbs. This is tied to their lifespan - Asgardians age normally until they reach their physical prime and can live for around five millennia before fading into their twilight years. You may optionally eschew Asgardian heritage in favor of being a member of the Vanir or an Olympian. There’s not much difference."
611,,400,Dragon(Tier 1) ,Pet Avengers,Transformation,"You are a dragon. By default this makes you one of the Flock like Lockheed; this means you can fly, breathe fire, and communicate telepathically. This will also generally increase your physical capabilities somewhat, generally speaking similar to one Tier higher, with your fire breath hitting with enough force to make you a bit more of a threat even then. Coupled with Behemoth you could be a full and credible threat to many of the human Avengers. You may choose to have another type of breath weapon than fire, such as lightning, cold, acidic gas, or a sonic scream; this cannot include esoteric effects like transforming people or manipulating time, only roughly equivalent damaging effects.

Tier 1 House Pet: Your species is approximately equal to a house cat or small dog. Potentially a threat to children but unlikely to cause serious harm to an adult and with some minor animal utility but nothing like flight, being amphibious, or particularly small."
612,,400,Living Hive,Marvel Noir,Transformation,"Through the combination of science and the occult you have obtained a great power in the form of mastery of bees. You are able to control and conduct the actions of nearby bees, gathering entire hives into massive murderous swarms. You can simply command these bees, or you can gather them around you, forming an expanded ‘body’ for yourself made from the swarm of bees. In the latter case they become almost a part of your body, and as long as they remain part of it count as a part of you for your powers, perks, and abilities; you could potentially become a flying giant made of angry bees with claws stretching tens of feet away from yourself, possibly becoming far larger if there were enough bees in your surroundings. Either way these bees under your control seem to have increased strength and speed, able to shred through Spider-Man’s web, or human flesh, like shrapnel.

You also gain the ability to transform yourself into a semi-insectoid alt form. In this form your proportions and features are more wasp-like with an inhumanly narrowed waist and an angular face, your fingernails and toenails extend and sharpen into small claws, your eyes become insectoid compound eyes, and you grow wings. These wings are capable of allowing you to fly either alone or with your swarm, and presumably your insectoid eyes give you enhanced bee-like vision, making it easier to see swiftly moving objects, process colors (other than red), and see into the near ultraviolet. You will also find that in this form your strength is increased to superhuman levels although not to the extent of Spider-Man’s; entering this form will not increase the strength of your bee-body, as it is already included even when outside of it.

And so that this isn’t worthless without bees around, when you enter this alt-form you will always be able to summon a small swarm of bees. While not large enough to form a giant cloud with arms stretching tens of feet from you, you could cover yourself completely in these bees either as ablative armor or send them out towards enemies. If part or all of this personal swarm is killed they will regenerate based on your own natural healing rate, though even as an ordinary human they will recover with time."
613,,400,Blessing of the Spider God,Marvel Noir,Transformation,"You have received the blessing of the Spider God, possibly from an obscure tribal totem. This blessing bestows upon you the proportionate strength, and agility of a spider, as well as the ability to cling to walls like a spider, improved recuperation and constitution, and to fire masses of black webs out of your wrists. These webs are strong enough to bind even someone who possesses similar super strength to what this gives you, but will eventually dissolve with time. In addition to these spider-themed powers, you possess a spider-sense, a mystical 6th sense which can warn you of danger, presenting as a buzzing in your head growing in intensity with the danger that’s presented to you; this spider-sense can even work for dangers such as warning you not to tell a disguised enemy that you possess damning evidence against their boss, though it’s not precise enough to guide your exact words and it works on dangers to your life so won’t help you keep from saying the wrong thing to your spouse or love interest. Coupled with the speed and reflexes that come as part of spider agility, you could dodge bullets with relative ease, at least as long as you don’t bottleneck yourself jumping through a window."
614,,400,Flame On! ,Marvel Civil War,Transformation,"Your external surface, including skin, hair, and eyes are covered with a microscopic layer of transparent fireproofing plates, making you fully immune to fire damage. Your cells generate plasma jets through clean nuclear fusion, allowing you to emit flame from part or all of your skin, and even to fly."
615,,400,Asgardian(400),Avengers-Thunderbolts,Transformation,"You are one of the denizens of Asgard, or perhaps another godly realm. Whatever realm you come from, your powers are approximately the same. Your physical capabilities are significantly superhuman, at their base putting you equal or above many super powered individuals, with strength at the 30 tons level (or 50 tons with Fighting Fit), similarly heightened durability, and stamina, as well as reflexes and speed surpassing even peak human capabilities.

Beyond superhuman strength, stamina, reflexes and speed, the Asgardians - or other gods - possess many advantages. They are immune to all known earthly diseases, age so slowly as to seem to be immortal, and heal substantially faster than an ordinary mortal. An Asgardian’s soul burns brighter than a human’s as well, granting them certain esoteric resistances making them somewhat harder to affect with magic or psychic assaults, though this is a minor defense for most Asgardians. As an Asgardian you also possess a natural affinity for mystical energies, a greater natural reservoir of magical energy, and greater ease at channeling energies.

Finally you now are capable of speaking Allspeak, the mystical language of the gods which allow you to communicate with any species and be understood and understand them."
616,,400,Dragon ,Amalgam Comics,Transformation,"Always be yourself, unless you can be a dragon. Then always be a dragon. You may be a mystic dragon like Karfang, an alien dragon like Fin Fang Flame. Whatever the case, you are a very large, flying, fire-breathing reptile and it is only with very recent technology and super-champions that this world holds any real threats for you."
617,,400,Asgardian(600),Avengers Vs X-Men,Transformation,"Hailing from mighty Asgard, you are one of the Gods themselves. A very minor one perhaps but you still possess that divine spark, deep within your being. Average Asgardians like yourself are still powerful beings. You possess physical power and speed well beyond any mortal man, able to lift thirty tons and travel faster than most cars. Your lifespan reaches into the thousands of years, helped along by a fairly powerful healing factor. As an Asgardian, you are also well versed in the combat arts and have access to the Allspeak, an ability that allows for you to understand and be understood in the speech of all races of the universe. 

For an extra cost, you can be a lot more than an average Asgardian. By taking the 600CP version of this race, you will be standing beside Thor himself in your power and potential. You are a mighty god, perhaps even a direct child of Odin himself, and have vast physical and magical power to go along with it. Along with your innate abilities, you also have access to a powerful domain over which you have godly powers. Thor has his control over the power of the weather as the God of Thunder, you too have control over an aspect of reality, though the broader you get from Thor’s example, the less power you will have over your chosen concept.

618,,400,Spectrum,Marvel Cosmic,Transformation,"After being bombarded by an exotic energy of extra dimensional particles, you gained the ability to turn yourself into any form of energy within the electromagnetic spectrum. You gain all properties of an energy form you are transformed into but can only transform into one energy form at a time. It only takes you a fraction of a second to switch between different forms. You have the general suite of super strength, flight, and super speed. You can go intangible or invisible depending on the type of energy you are currently transformed into. You can absorb and redirect energy as long as it is the right type and new energy forms can be unlocked after study and analysis."
619,,400,Vampire Queen,Spider-Man the Animated Series,Transformation,"You are one of the creatures of the night, the bloodsucking vampires. You can fly with a thought, have superhuman strength, and can hypnotize others with your gaze. By biting victims, you can transfer your inhuman state to them. Most impressively, you are a lord among your kind, able to telepathically communicate with and dominate other blood drinkers, whether they be real vampires such as yourself or mutated bat men. Unfortunately, you have a weakness to garlic, the sun will kill you, and a stake through your heart will penetrate your defenses. After the jump, this becomes an alt form."
620,,400,Dark Spirit,Avatar: Beginnings,Transformation,"Just about every spirit has a dark side to them, arguably even Raava (though that would be Vaatu? It’s complicated). At will you can assume a dark form that is far more imposing and powerful, at least in matters of violence and brute force."
621,,400,Creationist's Hands,Bayonetta,Transformation,"Is it not right to seek the means to handle creation? Is it not fair for you to embrace your birthright, to grasp this power with your bare hands? By selecting this perk, you may indeed grasp that power... with many hands. You can spend your magical energy to conjure energy arms, eventually being able to form up to six additional arms that you may extend and use as effectively as your actual hands. These cost energy to maintain, and if you wish for them to be stronger you must pump more and more magic into them to temporarily improve them, but it should hardly be unfair to ask you to pour yourself into your creation, after all."
622,,400,The Perfect Disguise,Ragna Crimson,Transformation,"Normally, one’s clothing, hairstyle and make-up is the limit of what one can change to hide oneself. Not for you, though. You are capable of shapeshifting to change basically all of your bodily traits, and even can shift from one gender to the other in a moment's notice.

Not only that, your mastery over your own form also allows you to selectively seal your own powers, letting go of your inhuman nature into a regular human form, but at the same time losing all the weaknesses of your species and even tricking supernatural senses, to a certain degree, of your true nature."
623,,400,Seija,Ragna Crimson,Transformation,"Contrary to popular belief, the high-tier dragons, known as the Seija, aren’t actually evolved dragons. Quite the opposite, the low and mid-tier dragons are born from the blood of the Seija. Now you are one of these beings, ranked around the 10ths in your bloodline, at least without any other perks or powers.

Powerful beyond human belief, the Seija are former humans who were turned into dragons by one of the six Kings of the brethren families, gaining through them the blood of ‘god’. Capable of a regeneration that will let them survive even if only a part of their head remains and allowing them to walk during the sunlight without any problem, resistant to all but the most powerful silver auras, these beings are the peak of power in this world. They can kill even the strongest humans with their bare hands without too much effort, at least without accounting for other special powers and magics, and their blood is so rich in mana that they can cast their magics just by imagining the effects without the use of any incantations or hand-gestures. A single Seija would be capable of destroying an entire city on their own and take on hordes of dragon hunters without a problem. And that’s only while they are in their ‘humanoid’ form, as they can transform into large dragons at will just as well, gaining at least a five times increase from their previous humanoid physical and magical power.

Be warned that silver disrupts the magical power that flows through the Seijas’s blood. Should some silver weaponry disrupt the blood flow, such as managing to penetrate your impossibly hard skin through enough force or quality of the weapon and destroying your heart with the same weapon, it would cut your regeneration factor and prevent you from casting magic unless you manage to remove it and the frozen parts.

The transformation from human to Seija also adds a curious side-effect: all previous hatred towards dragons is eliminated, and at least a small amount of loyalty towards their King is gained. It is possible to regain or gain a new hatred for dragons, however, and you may even defect your king if you are displeased with their way of acting."
624,,400,Rage Gene,League of Legends,Transformation,"You possess an ancient, genetic ability that was long ago lost to the sands of time - The Rage Gene, an ability that transforms you into an enormous, hulking brute when you are enraged. Though you have no control over this transformation, it grants you massively increased size, strength, and durability - letting you toss around people like mere ragdolls, dig up boulders and launch them at your foes, and smash the ground with enough force to knock people off their footing. Your increased size also comes with diminished speed, reflexes, and intelligence, but as soon as your heart calms you will return to your normal form."
625,,400,Shapeshifter,League of Legends,Transformation,"You're in touch with your wild side. You possess the ability to transform into a single animal of your choosing, at will. Your animal form is roughly the same size as your humanoid form. You can choose to morph into anything from a giant spider to a jungle panther to a killer crocodile. You also gain a slight tell in your human form as to your nature, and you gain magical powers based upon the animal you transform into- For example, a spider form grants you to cover your foes in webbing and venom, even in humanoid form."
626,,400,Half-Blood ,King Arthur ,Transformation,"King Arthur with the soul of a dragon, Merlin the son of a demon, Cu Chulainn a Demi-god the list goes on.

Myth and legend are filled with stories about humanity's most noble goal and you are an example. Either the reincarnation of a mythical being or one's offspring you inherit traits of the original and perhaps a bonus of a special ability related to it. Maybe you can spit fire or can sprout wings, just remember not all gifts are pleasant don't want to end up with the tendency to transform into a hideous, bloodthirsty abomination unable to distinguish friend from foe do you?"
627,,400,Dragon,Dresden Files,Transformation,"You’re a True Dragon, a former pillar of Existence, responsible for the functioning of at least some part of reality... well your kind used to be that. While the powers and abilities of Dragons in this world aren’t known in any kind of detail, one would imagine that the usual abilities like fire-breathing, resistance to magic and a form of a giant, flying reptile would be part of it. All the same, you have those abilities, whatever they are.

One known ability they, and you, have is the ability to create servitors, which are basically the dragons most people have heard of. While you’re the same Species and have the potential to match or even exceed him, right now you’re significantly younger and weaker than Ferrovax, so don’t go taking estimates of his power as things you can deal with."
628,,400,"""Royalty""",Dark Souls 3,Transformation,"Knights, often minor noblemen themselves, are sometimes much greater than they first appear. Like Lorian you are a knight- and also like Lorian, you are Lothric royalty, a child of Oceiros. The royal bloodline of the Consumed King runs through your veins, and with it comes a number of blessings. In appearance you stand taller than other men by a foot or two, and more attractive as well. Your ability to use miracles and sorceries is also much greater due to being tutored by scholars and the High Priestess all your life. Being born and bred to royalty has made your speech and etiquette more refined, and you have the skills required of a king to lead your people. Essentially, you are what Prince Lothric would have been, were he not born a cripple. When purchased with “Ancient Bloodline” the power of your blood is strengthened, radically changing your form in accordance so that you are closer to being a hybrid of man and whatever other race contributed to your birth. If it was a god you will find yourself standing at a height similar to your brother Prince Lorian, at over three times the height of a normal man, with even greater ability to use miracles thanks to being the child of the Princess of Sunlight herself. If it was a dragon you may have a twisted appearance similar to King Oceiros’s current form, with the ability to breath fire or even crystal-generating mist, or perhaps your appearance is more akin to another hybrid of god and dragon from long ago. Any other race is probably not a true son or daughter of Oceiros; more likely to be an experiment he conducted in imitation of Seathe the Paledrake, though you may determine whether you are still recognized as one of his heirs. Still, the impropriety of royals is not something to be underestimated, especially one as mad as the Consumed King."
629,,400,Detachment from Earthly Form,Dark Souls 2,Transformation,"“Perhaps the spirit is willing, but the body is weak? Your hibernation not being your first choice despite loyalties keeping you bound here? Well, I have the solution for that. You have the ability to astral project yourself as an incorporeal ghost that can nonetheless be seen and interact with others as normal. While sounding fearsome, due to the inability for enemies to retaliate, there are a few caveats, well one. While your spirit is projected from your body, said body becomes dormant and vulnerable. Additionally, the range is fairly short, no more than twenty yards may you travel from your slumbering form. Hide it well, allowing yourself to physically rest in peace, and you become most tedious.”"
630,,400,Emulation of Ancients ,Dark Souls 2,Transformation,"“Aldia, brother of King Vendrick, was a depraved man. Within his keep, alongside assistants, he committed depraved and inhumane acts in search of an end to the curse. Along the way, a fascination with ancient, eternal dragons of legend grew within him. You are a prototype experiment before Aldia recreated drakes, as well as something grander than that. As such, your already warped form is warped further. You may select two of the following dragon-like traits, each powerful and notable in their own right. Breath of fire, hot and malicious. Powerful, leathery wings capable of bestowing flight. A muscular tail, barbed and flexible. Great fangs and talons, both sharp and able to shear through stone. Scaled hide difficult for iron to cut through. Incredible eyesight beyond an eagle. Extremely resilient curled horns. Whichever two you choose will be integrated into the form you previously created, behaving as if they were natural to your form. No matter which you choose, know that your general vitality has also improved somewhat.”"
631,,400,“Legendary Blades”,Dark Souls 1,Transformation,"Well. . .I am at a loss for words, for this is a strange ability indeed. Although it seems to be linked to the practice of some individuals transforming the scavenged parts of dragons into weapons, for you that process seems to cut corners? Upon purchase of this perk, your severed limbs and body parts possess a bizarre quality. If you so wish it, those lost pieces of yourself will transform into masterwork forged blades with magical qualities reflecting your biology and just how much of your body was transformed into the weapon. Fingers turned into knives, arms into swords, legs into axes, how peculiar. When purchased with Aloft, such weapons will be strangely light even at great size. With Dragon’s Breath, they gain a tendency for elemental alignment with your breath."
632,,400,“Nature of the Firesage”,Dark Souls 1,Transformation,"While some demons have bodies of warped flesh or stone bodies, the strongest and most terrifying burn with otherworldly heat, toting molten forms. You, a great demon yourself, also have this kind of burning form. Your biology is intricately linked to lava and fire. Your blood like molten rock, breath like flame, but all of it contained and firm to move without deforming. As such you are incredibly dangerous in close proximity and are by and large immune to mundane lava and flames, resistant to the magical kinds. With some workable knowledge on pyromancy, you could likely learn to emphasize your natural infernal form or incendiary breath with your spells or vice versa given time and tinkering. Pyromancy Flames should be easier to foster with your biology. Purchased alongside Strength of Taurus, you may quickly and easily cool your body to safe levels for others or rapidly heat it back into a semi-molten state."
633,,400,“Gut Instinct”,Dark Souls 1,Transformation,"Many of the Eternal Dragons supposedly slain during the great war can still be fought around Lordran. The zombified upper halves are all over the place, the active lower halves now demons in Izalith, acting independently from one another even on the edge of destruction. Your various body parts have the same capacity, though where you picked that up is anyone’s guess. Each of your independent body parts has the capacity for thought and independent movement, it’s just that while attached they usually defer to whatever your brain says. When severed, detached or pulled out, they truly do get a mind of their own though. Your parts gain muted senses besides touch due to the lack of their own sensory organs, the ability to animate and writhe or hop about, and a keen sense of balance for standing. Your limbs and other body parts removed from you count as “dragon related objects” for the sake of the vision granted by Dragon Eyes, allowing you to find them if they get lost. They also become capable of sight themselves."
634,,400,“The Rock”,Dark Souls 1,Transformation,"Words, strategy, preparation, these things are important for pushing on, but sometimes you just need to take the hit, physical or mental. At such times, it won’t do to be made of glass, you need a mind and body of stone. On purchase, you become hard, or at least harder. Your body is more resistant to damage, your mind is more resistant to damage and your will is harder. Hell, even your equipment will be harder to damage and less prone to losing its edge."
635,,400,Ego Beast,Bloodborne,Transformation,"“It can be said that the inner beast is not solely the product of the old blood’s corruption. In fact, it could be that such a thing sleeps within all humanity, waiting to be awoken. What does that say about you, who finds themselves so much more in touch with that beast, and its color?

While ordinarily the form of one’s bestial transformation is influenced by a number of factors, for you it’s mostly mental. By taking time out of your day to stop, focus, you can bring to mind an image of your inner beast, or other transformative forms of corruption, and slowly distort it with your will.

It’s not a simple or seamless power, but you can influence a number of physical qualities from size, to proportions, to deformities, to natural weapon growth. In time, the power of your inner beast could even rival that of the soon to be turned vicar. Just care you don’t give it too much influence.”"
636,,400,Draconifors,Tri-Wizard Gauntlet,Transformation,"You have mastered the root power of the Draconifors Spell which allows you to transform
anything, including a person, into a dragon. This mastery goes so far as to even allow you to cast
a partial transfiguration to grant a target dragon features such as giving them wings or a
dragon's head. However the transfigured dragon will be around the same size as the original
target, limiting its power and fire projection. You can also telepathically communicate with your
created dragons from any distance."
637,,400,Veela Blood,Harry Potter,Transformation,You have a Veela grandparent. You are exceptionally attractive and may occasionally charm members of the opposite gender who will find themselves desperate to impress you. Can be taken with Giant Blood.
638,,400,Giant Blood,Harry Potter,Transformation,You have some Giant blood in you. You are half again as tall as you should be and proportionally broad. You are significantly stronger than a normal human and have tough skin which protects against minor physical and magical attacks.

640,,400,Form of the Dinosaur,MtG - Ixalan,Transformation,"There is a curious phenomena in Ixalan, where the favored form of the entities from beyond the physical plane appear to favor the forms of dinosaurs when they incarnate. This quirk of the land is now something extended to you, as your body seems to have picked up an adaptation: by devouring the heart of and sucking the marrow from a dinosaur’s bones, you gain the ability to transform into that dinosaur. You are capable of using this transformation as a partial one, and even mixing and matching the features of various different dinosaurs as you extend your repretoire."
641,,400,Angel ,MtG - Amonkhet,Transformation,"Amonkhet is one of very few planes with male angels. It is equally abnormal that these angels be the enforcers of a malevolent conspiracy to control and oppress the plane’s people as part of a institutional act of mass murder and necromancy, but that’s just what happens when an evil elder dragon takes over your plane. As a manifestation of white mana, you are equipped with wings, immortality, and greater physical and magical power than mortals. Unlike the other angels, you are not bound to the will of Nicol Bolas. If you pick this option, you may change your sex to male for free, but if you chose to be female then none shall notice that “oddity.” Unlike all other species( save the gods) angels are not expected to enter the Trials."
642,,400,Tall As A Beanstalk,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Transformation,"Garenbrig’s knights pride themselves on their bodies, and you are certainly someone who can hold themselves with pride - you’re much larger than any normal human. While Giants can easily be merely a few heads taller than your average Knight, as a human, humanoid fae or a Giant you’re roughly the size of a barge - burly enough to easily wrestle dragons and even make Yorvo raise his eyebrow in surprise.

Boosted: Tall as a Beanstalk - > Rampart Smasher
If your strength was prodigious before, it’s outright inane now. As a human, you’re large enough to hold a horse beneath each arm, as well as capable of wielding ballista as a handheld weapon, shoulder tackling through solid stone walls, and breaking the necks of castle-destroying dragons with a twist of your wrist.

Boost Requires Adamant(MtG - Throne of Eldraine)"
643,,400,Baron Jumper ,MtG - Homelands,Transformation,"In the Homelands, the name of Baron Sengir is synonymous with the Dark Barony. He has ruled for a thousand years here, and expects to rule a thousand more. Yet the Sengir vampire bloodline is feared and reviled across much of the wider multiverse. The Baron himself is the sire of the most numerous line of vampires across the planes, the creator of countless nightmares, the pinnacle of a vast and ever-growing pyramid scheme of death. So too, will you become a progenitor of your own bloodline of vampires. Your natural vampiric strength is increased to stand equal to the Baron himself, though you still lack his centuries of experience. More importantly, you gain the ability to combine and mix strains of vampirism you may have acquired here or in other places together to create new bloodlines of your own. In this way, you can decide which powers, weaknesses, and other traits you pass on whenever you sire a new vampire, and which you do not. The magical flight of a Sengir vampire, combined with some bloodline that does not have to fear sunlight, perhaps? Even the means of siring these new vampires can be set to that of any strain you might have access to, from the classic bite to more involved rituals and magic. Including whether the bloodline weakens over the generations, stays at the same strength, or even mutates slowly into monstrosity like the Sengir bloodline itself.

Purchase Requires Vampire(MtG - Homelands)"
644,,400,Colour-Coded Cleaver,Skulduggery Pleasant,Transformation,"The White Cleaver, and later the Black Cleaver, were subjected to an advanced experimental form of Necromancy, transforming his body into a high-quality zombie possessing dramatic regenerative capabilities, to the point it was able to survive being ripped to pieces. It seems that you have endured a similar process, turning you into a zombie of equal caliber. Your strength and durability exceed those of normal Cleavers, such that you can hold off a squad of ordinary Cleavers by your lonesome. If taken with Cleaver Jumper, the boosts to your strength, durability, and stamina are increased by a factor of 50%, and you can change your background to include a history of service as a Cleaver if you so desire."
645,,400,Fanalis,Magi: The Adventure of Sinbad,Transformation,"The mighty Fanalis, recognisable by their distinctive red hair and golden irises, are physically the strongest race in the world bar none. Because of this, however, they are regularly targeted by slavers, who use powerful poisons to sedate and capture them. As such, they have earned a reputation as a ‘slave race’, and there are very few Fanalis left who aren’t slaves. Fortunately for you, you are one of those rare free Fanalis.

To say the Fanalis are strong is an understatement. To begin with, a Fanalis child could fight on equal terms with one of the strongest adult Imuchakk, and their abilities only grow as they approach adulthood. You could carry a dozen people at once without breaking a sweat, send giant monsters or whole groups of people flying with a single kick, jump several stories into the air, and shatter whole cliffsides of solid rock with your bare hands. Of course, you also gain the durability to tank these feats of strength.

Furthermore, you’re also superhumanly fast. At your full speed, a master assassin would be unable to react to your movements, and you would create shockwaves strong enough to create deep cuts on anyone close enough. Your reactions are similarly superb, evading all but the fastest attacks with ease, and with training you could react fast enough to dodge magical lightning bolts.

But speed and strength aren’t the only exceptional attributes a Fanalis possesses. For one, all of your senses are far sharper than the average human’s, in particular your incredible sense of smell, which is strong enough for you to track people and detect traps by scent alone. Secondly, you can shout incredibly loudly. This may not sound too useful, but the sheer volume of your yells can stun or scare off other creatures, especially those with sensitive hearing. Combined with your superhuman senses, you can even use this as a form of echolocation.

If the Fanalis have one weakness, it’s that they typically have low quantities of Magoi due to their incredible physical abilities, and as such cannot use magical abilities for long before tiring. However, since you are buying this option with CP, you will not suffer from this.

646,,400,Constitution That Accepts Every Desire,Fate/Legends - Nirvana Yuga,Transformation ,"If there are an infinite number of desires in the world, there must also be an infinite number of
pleasures to answer each and every desire. Is it not a kindness to mankind that you take on that role
for them? To take form as their deepest loves and lusts to satisfy the wishes of their hearts? But it is
a truth that you can take on new forms to suit desires. At it’s most basic form, this is merely to
change your physical form into the appearance most desired by one of the desire-feeling beings you
can feel at that moment. Not gaining new magic because of it but otherwise taking on new physical
traits out of that desire onto your normal form or taking a new appearance entirely as appropriate. 

The power is that for each being you perceive that feels a desire, you can create a new form entirely. An extension of your original body under your control that expands your awareness into it, like a
sixth finger that is no more complicated to move than your own body. Each new body will begin
weak but quickly grow until it matches your original form identically, with no limit on how many
expressions of yourself you can create beyond needing to remain able to perceive those beings
whose desires you draw on. If you are the representation of all desires of man, then every desire is
just another way for you to manifest. Your original body is still vulnerable but these external copies
of yourself give no cost to you to make or to have killed. Become an ever expanding core from which
all the wishes of Mankind are fulfilled. "
647,,400,Fluid Form,Sinbad Legend of the Seven Seas,Transformation ,States of matter are such a mortal limitation wouldn’t you say? A limitation that should hold little sway over a being such as yourself. Your form can change as you will it from liquid water to flesh and blood.
648,,400,Ogre Transformation,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Transformation ,"An inhuman bloodline rumbles softly in your body, sleeping until use of the red rage it provides is
needed. An ancestor of yours was a mighty ogre, not that any would guess it until they saw you in
combat. Your physical abilities are outrageous for a normally stealthy ninja, with physical strength
more than enough to seriously harm great armoured heroes and tear giant rends through the eart, potentially even smashing down whole fortresses. That physical strength accelerates your
movement speed to even greater heights, making the combination of assassination arts and violent
speed even more lethal than ever before. But even with this power, you might look like an
unassuming young man. When you call on your true potential, your body beginning to strain and
bulge with power, your body and even brain will be pushed to the very limits. A massive
amplification of your natural abilities result, enough to make you a danger to even weaker divine
beings, and your body continually restores it’s energy as you fight. 

The unfortunate side of this is that it is done through eating away at your internal material, causing
steady and serious damage to your body to supply this massive boost in power, speed, reactions and
stamina. How this state takes form can vary from person to person, sometimes being obvious strain
markings across the skin but also at times appearing as your entire body turning crimson red like the
ogres you came from. "
649,,400,Popularity Redesign,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Transformation ,"Changing shape is one thing but sometimes you need to get a lot deeper, like when a crazed vulpine
maniac is making death threats against you in private messaging, saying that only one fox can live. When situations like those occur, a Youkai can make a change to their being on a much deeper level. A re-do of their theme, a fixer upper on their selling points. While it’s tiring to do and can’t be done
more than around once a year, enough time for a new event to come around, you are able to change
‘themes’ about yourself around. A fox theme, like what one would have as a kitsune, might be
changed to being a bat theme. This has a variety of effects, such as altering your species into that of
a bat-related youkai and changing the fox powers and fox-related magic you have into bat
equivalents. While cosmetic changes are most obvious, it can certainly result in many functional
changes as well, though the overall level of power and ability balances out. A versatile earth mage
could switch up their style to ride the lightning, taking on a lot more offensive power but losing
much of their breadth of ability. A bat youkai won’t have the illusions and fox fire of a kitsune but
may find magical powers relating to sound and darkness appearing in their mind’s eye. Perhaps even
a goddess could change what they rule over this way. "
650,,400,Riastrad,Fate/Legends - Land of Shadows,Transformation ,"A legendary fury that only the greatest and most naturally inclined warriors can enter. The Riastrad, known as the Warp Spasm, is a transformative state that you have now discovered the ability to
trigger within yourself. Trigger it and your body will begin to change. Your muscles will bulge and
your stature grow far beyond any mans. Your bones will twist and warp, yet not hinder you at all. Even your hair will become a deadly weapon, turned into sharp spikes that stand on end. In every
way, you will become an ungodly beast. Yet this hideous form comes with immense power, greatly
magnifying your physical abilities. Few warriors could resist your blows in this form or keep up with
the speed of your mad charges, even should you be a mediocre warrior in your own right. The
transformation may grant you tens as times as much power as before but it drives you into a near
mindless frenzy, robbing you of the use of much of your skill in combat and other intelligence, though you can still distinguish friend from foe in a vague sense. You are also able to reform from
this transformation at will."
651,,400,"I, Ripper",Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Transformation ,"So many interpretations, so many ‘true identities’, who could ever stick to just one? Rather than
becoming one part of the Ripper Mythos, you are the very mythology of Jack itself. Your form
becomes that of an insubstantial and invisible spirit at it’s normal level, albeit still able to return to
your original state. While in this spiritual form, you can instantly take on the form of anything that
has been believed to be Jack the Ripper’s identity before. Specific humans, nameless men filling the
occupations of Scotland Yard detectives or London doctors, wild animals, even inanimate objects
have at times fulfilled the role. It is even possible for some forms to update to your current time and
place. Jack the Ripper has been believed to be part of the police force more than once, without
further specification, and that can manifest as an officer of his times from London or one from your
current city and year.

Whatever traits your decided form has, you also copy to yourself, albeit at a noticeably reduced level
of power. However, while the level of ability is not the same, you are able to flawlessly act out your
chosen identity and role. It is even possible to create the tools and items connected to the identity, such as a uniform and any needed weaponry. A specific identity is also worth mentioning, given it’s
unique functions, which is the belief that Jack the Ripper was no being but a madness instead. Taking
on the form of a mental illness allows you to corrupt and even possess living things through your
spiritual form."
652,,400,From Hell,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Transformation ,"A demon? Certainly, it’s been thrown around as a theory by those inclined to believe in the
supernatural. It never got much credit in the age of reason, the idea that Jack the Ripper was so evil
that he could not even be human. But sometimes people don’t want to believe that humans can be
so foul and in doing so, their belief only gives power to the monster they make in their mind. Through the minds of others, you can take on the form of a unique kind of phantasmal beast. This
demonic form may vary according to your particular style of horror, as will the way your
surroundings changed. The classic interpretation of Jack as a demon was that of a enormous blue- purple beast, whose presence filled the air with foul mist, the land with pockets of magma and
transformed plants and animals into hellish imps or devils. 

The power of this form is at it’s best when in Jack’s natural territory, densely populated cities. The
more people present within a five kilometer radius of you, the stronger the transformation becomes.
In total isolation of others, your demonic form is only as deadly as a tiger or other large predator
beast. In the middle of a city, you’d have enough power to contend with Heroic Spirits of the Knight
classes, with strength to tear through buildings with ease. Because it is the beliefs and fears of
humans that empower you in this demonic form, your own attacks and powers become more potent
as this form’s strength increases when used against humans."
653,,400,Fairy,Fate/Legends - Garden of Avalon,Transformation ,"Despite having human parents, you are a long way from being human yourself. An ancient, long
buried heritage in your ancestry has awakened and you were born as a Fairy. A Fairy is an extension
of Gaia, similar to how the hairs or fingers on your body are an extension of you. Despite this, you
retain your free will completely, thus allowing you to benefit quite significantly from being
considered a natural part of the world, especially when it comes to your magecraft being accepted
as entirely natural. You are also able to become invisible to the senses of any being without magic. Beyond this, you have amazing talent in creating magic items and while you are right now a long way
from crafting something like Excalibur or Arondight, you are still several times as skilled, fast and
efficient in the creation of magical items as normal. Lastly, you have the potential, with enough
power and/or age, to evolve into a full fledged Elemental, granting you greater authority and
importance to the world, along with a not insignificant boost in power. In future worlds, you may
choose to have a similar connection to the world you begin on as you do with Gaia here."
654,,400,Familiar Belt ,Kamen Rider Neo-Heisei Part 2,Transformation,"This is a BIT of a transitional device. After all, your studies will eventually allow you to utilize much stronger and more effective ways of transformation. However, it’ll do for now. This belt is ‘empty’, but can capture and contain a single Phantom with much the same rules as the Faust Driver. However, instead of turning the Phantom into a summon, it simply devours it and uses its body as the ‘transformation.’ In effect, it allows you to eat Phantoms for a stronger form. However, you may only have one “Familiar” form at a time, so the best bet is to find a form that suits your needs, and stick to it. Don’t worry, better times will come soon, as long as you work for them.
"
655,,400,Changeling ,Cultist Simulator,Transformation,"Flesh is but a carapace to you, and in the dances that will follow you’ll come to understand how useful it can be to shed your skin. Through this power, you may reshape your flesh and those of others in any matter of your choosing, provided you are familiar with the final form that it will undertake. You could change age and gender. You could grow wings, horns or additional limbs. You could even use it to turn into someone or something else entirely. The more familiar you are with a particular form, the easier it will be for you to replicate its original strength, even if it's only a partial transformation."
656,,400,Blood Water ,Sonny,Transformation,"The ZPCI were probably the people who made Zombies in the first place. You might have been a part of that project, or maybe you’re just a well versed mad scientist, but I digress. You’re a scientist of some kind whose profession involves mutating people beyond belief. This includes a method to turn people into zombies, but also a method that allows you to create super-strong somewhat magical monstrosities that have effects based on whatever kind of magic you inject them with, if at all. There is no way in this jump to prevent these monsters from going mad in some sort of way, including but not limited to reduced cognitive functions, insanity, immense bloodlust, or mind-shattering pain. So don’t use this on allies if you can help it.
"
657,,400,Dark​ ​Crystal​ ​Earrings​ ​,Sailor Moon,Transformation,"These silver earrings have a dark crystal hanging from them, but you can change their appearance if you wish. They don’t even have to be earrings, even. These crystal earrings will allow someone to take a dark transformation, with powers and strength that are slightly above those of a Daimon and they take on a uniform of your design. While you yourself cannot benefit from these earrings, they make a good bargaining chip when you don’t feel like sharing your power with someone but you wish to offer something.
"
658,,400,Egg​ ,A Practical Guide to Evil,Transformation,"A rather... understated name. This “egg” is actually a powerful artifact, holding within it a Demon from the 13th layer of Hell. Anything that demon touches will be slowly corrupted, twisted in both mind and flesh until there’s nothing left of the being it once was.
"
659,,400,Dragon Gem ,Valkyrie Profile,Transformation,"One of the Dragonians' legendary Dragon Gems, often mistaken for the much more powerful Dragon Orb. It's not to be discounted, however, as the Dragon Gem has the power to transform the user into a giant dragon roughly the size of your typical t-rex with wings about twice that long. While its physical abilities are no doubt scaled impressively, the most prominent new ability is the Dragon Gem itself, which is now imbedded in the user's chest and can fire a large laser to tear through opponents. The transformation costs quite a bit of energy to activate and maintain, though it can also be fueled by the divine energy used in a PWS, lessening the burden on the user for one short attack.
"
660,,400,Hero App Dev Kit ​,Yuki Yuna is a Hero,Transformation,"This is a high tech dev kit the Taisha will create in a year after a certain Yuki Yuuna manages to impress Shinju-Sama into allowing the Hero System to be used for everyone. A newer version of it that does not cause Mankai, cause Sange, or gives faeries to Heroes. This is a downgrade from the Hero system used by the Taisha initially, and arguably even from the Hero System used at the start of the Divine Era. But such is the price of making the Hero system available for all to use. However, while it can make literally anyone a Hero, power still seems to be largely dependent on inborn talent. The average magical girl will be quite weak using the standard Hero powers that come with the kit, compared to your allies that fight by your side. They will need constant training to be comparable to you in power. Also comes with a chat and messaging app to talk to other Heroes.
"
661,,400,Pendant of Delmair ,Warhammer Fantasy: Amazons,Transformation,"A large opal with a shard of obsidian embedded in it, making it resemble the eye of some kind of monster. The Pendant of Delmair has the power to transform the wearer into a large were-jaguar, granting them greatly increased physical attributes at the cost of their mental awareness, letting them tear through even heavily armoured opponents in a berserker fury and inciting terror amongst the enemy. The Pendant you have does not seem to have this flaw, allowing you to freely swap between your human and Were-Jaguar forms while retaining your full mental faculties.
"
662,,400,Thor Card ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Transformation,"The class card of the divine spirit Thor has come into your possession. Including the class card as a weapon will bestow you with an enlarged arm capable of great feats of strength and Megingjord, a gauntlet capable of doubling the users strength. Installing the class card into your body will grant you an enlarged arm, Meginjord, the clothing of the thunder god Thor and Mjolnir, a hammer capable of devastating attacks ranging from lightning strikes to immense pillars of lightning capable of breaking through A ranked magical barriers instantly and leaving scars on the earth they travelled distancing kilometres."

Noble Phantasm:

Rule Breaker: C - Rule Breaker: All Spells Must Be Broken is a weapon that materializes the divinity of the witch of betrayal. It is an iridescent and jagged dagger that is thin, brittle, and blunt. Its effectively nonexistent capacity as a weapon is that of a regular dagger at most, and it would not be suitable for even killing a single person. Greatly differing from other Noble Phantasms, its unique ability is that it is the ultimate anti-magic Noble Phantasm capable of dispelling and destroying any kind of thaumaturgy, an effect suitable to the Noble Phantasm that is a manifestation of Caster’s nature as the “Witch of Betrayal”. It ""transgresses"" on all the magecraft of the targets it pierces, contracts made from magical energy and life born from magical energy. Once it comes into contact with the ensorcelled item or person, enchantments, connections bounded through contracts, and creatures created and maintained by magical energy will all be returned to their original components in a state ""before they were made."" Contracts will be wiped clean and those with life will immediately cease to exist. There is a limit to what it is able to dispel, meaning artifacts on the rank of Noble Phantasm will never be returned to their original state no matter how low their rank.

Parameters:

Endurance: D
Luck: E
Agility: B

Class Skills:
Magic Resistance: D - Magic Resistance grants protection against magical effects. Differently from the Resistance effect that merely rejects Magical Energy, this ability cancels the spells altogether. At rank D Cancels Single-Action spells.

Personal Skills:
Battle Continuation: B - Battle Continuation is the strength of vitality for predicaments. Also, the ability to withdraw from combat and reach allied territory alive after being defeated. At rank B Makes it possible to fight even with deadly injuries.

Disengage: D - Disengage is the ability to break away from combat.

Divinity: C - Divinity is the measure of whether one has Divine Spirit aptitude or not. At high levels one is treated as a mixed race of a Divine Spirit, and the level declines when the Heroic Spirit's own rank as a Monster, Demonic Beast raises. It can also decrease due one's dislike for the gods. It also has an effect, which reduces special defensive values called ""purge defense"" in proportion to the Divinity's Rank. It can break through Skills such as Protection of the Faith and Enlightenment of the Sacred Fig.

Rune Magic: C - Rune Magic is knowledge about this type of Magecraft that originated in northern Europe. At rank C this is the capacity to use the 18 original runes. By making proper use of this, powerful and varied effects are mastered. Other than attacks, this is mainly employed for effects corresponding to the Skills Magic Resistance, Clairvoyance, for raising parameters, and etc. All of those are merely temporary and cannot you employ multiple of those simultaneously.

Protection from Arrows: C - Protection from Arrows is an increased defense against ranged attacks by predicting the projectiles' trajectories through exceptional means, such as hearing the sound of air being cut, or sensing the killing intent of the enemy.

Noble Phantasm:
Gae Bolg: Barbed Spear that pierces with Death: B - Gae Bolg: Barbed Spear that pierces with Death is an attack focused on a single target, created by Lancer to suit his own style, that strikes a fatal blow that always pierces the opponent's heart and ruins their body from within with its thousand iron thorns. It literally freezes the mana in the air, and it can easily be perceived as a sure-kill technique by all those around simply from being charged with magical energy. Once Gáe Bolg's name has been called, the cursed spear reverses the nature of causality, the meaning of ""cause and effect"" in the order of things, to make it so the cause of the ""lance being thrust"" comes from the effect of the ""opponent's heart being pierced"" by it. It determines the opponent's fate simply through its use, an always fatal move that pierces the heart with one thrust. It is also possible for him to activate it without actively striking the heart. It is an attack on destiny itself, and while not a surprising fact due its wielder's demi-god heritage, it is a top-notch power even with its seeming limitations in power due to being a step away from the Authority of the gods.

Gae Bolg: Soaring Spear that strikes with Death: B - Gae Bolg: Soaring Spear that strikes with Death is the true use of Gáe Bolg, is the largest and most powerful attack delivered using the spear. It is the “attack that unleashes countless darts at the enemy” that is spoken of in the legends. It is the attack that made him a hero which utilizes the full potential of the lance's curse, converting all of Lancer's magical energy into energy and releasing the accumulated power after the spear is hurled, detonating on impact with enough power to blow away a multitude of enemies. It does not carry the property or concept of “always pierces the opponent’s heart”, but both the power and the area of effect are increased.

Parameters:
Strength: E
Mana: C

Luck: E

Class Skills:
Independent Action: C - Independent Action is the ability to remain independent even when rejecting the Magical Energy supply from the Master. At the higher ranks, it is also possible to remain for extended periods of time in this world without an established contract. For the purposes of the Class Cards this allows you to keep them installed for longer.

Magic Resistance: E - Magic Resistance grants protection against magical effects. Differently from the Resistance effect that merely rejects Magical Energy, this ability cancels the spells altogether. At rank E it cannot cancel spells, but magic damage is reduced somewhat.

Personal Skills:
Clairvoyance: D - Clairvoyance connotes superior visual perception and dynamic occipital capture, such as to supplement the long-range aiming of projectile weapons. At higher ranks, it is possible that the bearers of this skill have acquired such abilities as precognition (""future vision"") and other forms of perception beyond standard eyesight (X-ray vision and so forth). At rank D Capable of keeping track of fast-moving object within a range of two kilometers.

Eye of the Mind (True): C - Eye of the Mind (True) is a heightened capacity for observation, refined through experience. At rank B it is capable of calm analysis of battle conditions even when in danger and deduce an appropriate course of action after considering all possibilities to escape from a predicament. So long there is even a 10% chance of a comeback, this ability greatly improves the chances of winning.

Magecraft: C - Magecraft is knowledge about modern Thaumaturgy. At rank C is capable of using orthodox Thaumaturgy. Archer’s rank in using Projection Magic when the target falls under the category of ""sword"" is A+.

Noble Phantasm:
Unlimited Bladeworks: E~EX - Unlimited Blade Works: Infinite Creation of Swords is the Noble Phantasm of the Heroic Spirit EMIYA. Emiya does not have a true Noble Phantasm that is the crystallized embodiment of a hero's existence like many demonic or holy swords, but if a Noble Phantasm is considered to be a symbol of the Heroic Spirit, then the Reality Marble is his Noble Phantasm. It is high-class thaumaturgy that embodies their internal worlds and imprints them upon the world as a bounded field. It is their one true specialization of magecraft, the result of ""Sword"" being both their Origin and their Elemental Affinity, and the basis of their projection and reinforcement skills. It is the definite answer obtained by someone whose life was saved by a sword, actually merged and lived with a sword, and acted as a sword all of his life. Emiya has no penalties from the world while utilizing his version of Unlimited Blade Works.

The Reality Marble's purpose is a steel manufacturing factory that produces the countless famous swords without owners that extend into the horizon. It contains all of the raw materials and sorcery needed for the formation of the weapons, and it records and analyzes all weapons and defensive armaments encountered. The number of unique weapons encountered and recorded by Archer exceeds numerous thousands, most of which are Noble Phantasms. Their entire histories, compositions, and designs are all perfectly recorded, allowing for instant proficiency with the weapons by inheriting all combat skills and techniques utilized by their original owners. This allows for the reproduction of Noble Phantasms, which would generally be impossible for a faker.

They can also be modified to the user's taste with reinforcement as shown by Archer's Caladbolg II and Kanshou and Bakuya. Close combat weapons such as swords, spears, and halberds are the main focus of the Reality Marble in accordance with Emiya's Origin of ""Sword"", which also makes it impossible to record or reproduce modern weaponry like guns and other mobile weapons. Shields and defensive armaments can be reproduced with a much greater struggle, as the cost in magical energy is high, two or three times greater than a sword, and the effects are merely transient compared to the originals. Weapons encountered are immediately analyzed with a single glance, enabling them to be projected immediately afterward, and once projected, they are stored within the Reality Marble for later use. Shiro is able to instantly recognize dozens of weapons being fired from the Gate of Babylon at an extremely high rate and instantly counter with projections of the same weapons before they can strike.

The analysis of weapons is limited only to the direct use of human senses, meaning that blueprints and materials will be unable to provide the necessary information for a proper analysis. Shared memories, such as dreams shared with a Servant, can allow for weapons to be analyzed and projected, even if they have been lost like Caliburn. The quality of projected weapons will always be degraded by one rank due to humans being unable to fully conceptualize the existence of an object through only one sense, and they will never equal the originals without a technique such as detonating them as Broken Phantasms. The Reality Marble allows for projection and reinforcement in the real world. Weapons are produced within Unlimited Blade Works and then brought into the world, greatly lowering the cost of reproducing them and allowing for numerous weapons to be prepared at once to be projected. Weapons can be summoned directly to the user's hands, or they can be summoned to levitate within the air and fire upon the enemy as arrows much like the Gate of Babylon. Once the Reality Marble is deployed, all of the weapons are available for use, and any weapon can immediately be called to the user's hands or levitated even while the user is in direct combat. The weapons reproduced once the Reality Marble is first activated will not consume magical energy, but those used or destroyed within it will add to the cost of maintaining the bounded field. The amount of energy used to reproduce weapons that did not exist after the bounded field was expanded and the amount of energy used to recreate weapons destroyed while it is activated is extremely costly.

Class Skills:
Mad Enhancement: B - Mad Enhancement is a rank up for all parameters, but takes away most of your sanity. While active the user will have to rely on brute force rather than any technique. Toggleable.

Personal Skills:
Battle Continuation: B - Battle Continuation is the strength of vitality for predicaments. Also, the ability to withdraw from combat and reach allied territory alive after being defeated. At rank B Makes it possible to fight even with deadly injuries.

Bravery: A - Bravery is the ability to negate mental interference such as pressure, confusion and fascination. Not usable under the effects of Mad Enhancement.

Divinity: B - Divinity is the measure of whether one has Divine Spirit aptitude or not. At high levels one is treated as a mixed race of a Divine Spirit, and the level declines when the Heroic Spirit's own rank as a Monster, Demonic Beast raises. It can also decrease due one's dislike for the gods. It also has an effect, which reduces special defensive values called ""purge defense"" in proportion to the Divinity's Rank. It can break through Skills such as Protection of the Faith and Enlightenment of the Sacred Fig.

Eye of the mind False: C - Eye of the Mind (False) is a natural talent to avoid danger on the basis of an innate 6th sense, intuition, or prescience, where accuracy of instinct has been augmented by experience—somewhat overcoming the problem of visual obstructions that appear in the course of combat. The difference between Eye of the Mind (True) and Eye of the Mind (False) lies in that the former is an ability that humans can obtain through accumulation of experience. The 'False' version is superficially similar, but in fact represents a natural instinct that cannot be obtained regardless of effort or experience—even though experience can refine its accuracy. Calm analysis of battle conditions, by which competent grasp of the status of the self and the opponent are obtainable even in the midst of danger; utilization of such to deduce the appropriate course of action that permits escape from a lethal predicament. (Even though Heracles's sanity was lost due to Mad Enhancement, this skill remained effective as it is nearly an instinct. When crossing swords with a seasoned swordsman like Artoria, he would not fall for half-hearted feints.

Noble Phantasm:
God Hand: C - God Hand is a blessing of the gods representing immortality, as well as being a curse, that was granted to him for completing his Twelve Labors in life. It is the ability that required attacks of the highest grade to harm him and prevented him from even being scratched by anyone during the Age of Gods, described as ""nearly foul play"" even by acquaintances at the time. It lacks an overt external manifestation such as a weapon or armor, but, in attributing a shape to it, can be said to be the body of the user itself. It transforms the body into a tough suit of armor that acts similar to a conceptual weapon in practice, coloring his body like lead and covering it with strange protrusions.

It provides three effects of resurrection, attack- nullification, and the ability of ""immunity against an attack he has experienced previously."" This ability nullifies attacks under C-rank and gives an extra life. This extra life restocks once per jump.

Nine Lives: The Shooting Hundred Heads: C~A - Nine Lives: The Shooting Hundred Heads is the most trusted of all of Heracles's Noble Phantasms. It originally had the form of the bow and arrows used to simultaneously exterminate the one  hundred heads of the Hydra, an immortal nine- headed serpent that would grow back no matter how many times they were cut down. Upon slaying the Hydra, he became able to utilize techniques that emulate the ability of the Noble Phantasm with other weapons, transforming it into Style: Shooting the Hundred Heads, an all- purpose Noble Phantasm capable of adapting and changing how it appears depending on the target and circumstances of its use. Regardless of whether this technique is delivered with a bow, large sword, shield, spear, axe, or possibly even unarmed, the technique boasts power on the level of Noble Phantasms by drawing out the maximum power of the weapon. It can display power from Anti-Unit to Anti-Army, even up to fortress sieging all depending on the circumstances. In essence, it is “a high speed attack consisting of nine consecutive strikes, as swift as if the attacks are overlapping.

Monstrous Strength: C - Monstrous Strength is an ability possessed by monsters and beasts, temporary boost of the Strength parameter by one rank for a time limit determined by the ranking of this skill.

Mystic Eyes: A - Mystic Eyes is the possession of Mystic Eyes that are capable of interfering with the outside world. The Mystic Eyes of Petrification are Rider's Mystic Eyes, said to be a ""curse of the gods sealed by the powers of shrines."" Though petrification sorcery is no strange thing for modern Thaumaturgy, even if its users are rare and few in numbers, Mystic Eyes capable of petrifying others are something that nobody, human or not, possesses in the present era. They are designated as Jewel under the Noble Colors system, which surpasses the Gold- ranked Eyes of the Dead Apostles and are exclusively possessed by Holy Spirits and Magical Beasts from the Age of Gods. Those who possess Rank D or lower in Mana will be immediately petrified, while those with Rank C may or may not be affected depending on the conditions. Those with Rank B or higher won’t be petrified, but will sustain ""pressure"" from the Eyes and receive a one rank-down to all parameters. The entire body of the target will be affected, including clothing and weaponry, ""killing them while alive"" as they are turned to stone. The ability is viable in petrifying a group of enemies, but it would not be useful against an infinite number like the horde of shades spawned by Avenger. The amount of energy it uses is comparable to also fighting them off with her Noble Phantasms, so it would quickly drain her faster than simply fighting them off in melee combat.

Noble Phantasm:
Bellerophon: Bridle of Chivalry: A - Bellerophon is a shining golden bridle and whip paired as a set that is capable of fully controlling a Divine Beast. It is an oddity even among Noble Phantasms, having no effect without a mount. Its power is great, providing extraordinary offensive and defensive capabilities of the highest level. You also gain the ability to bring forth the Pegasus given to medusa by Poseidon

Breaker Gorgon: Self Seal, Temple of Darkness: D- - Breaker Gorgon is a powerful Bounded Field on the scale of another world used by Medusa. It was a complement to the temple of blood that ""enveloped the world"" on the Shapeless Isle, having ""sealed the world"" instead. It only requires a steady supply of energy from the user to affect a target, unlike Mystic Eyes that require a direct line of sight. It has the ability to ""seal all magical properties"", catching its targets inside to become trapped within the mind of the user and removing any abilities they possessed in the outside world. Those trapped within are said to see a nightmare mixed with both delight and taboo.

While there are many other Noble Phantasms crafted more splendidly and with better skill, Excalibur is an illusion far superior to them. It cannot be called beautiful because of its appearance, for the description of ""beautiful"" will only dirty it. It is instead sacred, made from people's conception, legends weaved only out of hope. It is not a myth or inhuman work, but a ""crystal trained by the heart alone"", making it reign as the strongest fantasy. It is the crystallization of the prayer named ""glory"" and everything etched in the hearts of those who are scattered at the sword's radiance; the nostalgic, sorrowful, and hallowed dream of those who were placed on the bloody hell called a battlefield, of all warriors past, present, and future fully exposed to the fear of death and despair, and who still cling to a desire: ""to be exalted."". Excalibur is a ""sword that amplifies"", converting its user’s magical energy into offensive power and releasing it. It is a weapon of directive energy that converts the magical energy of the wielder into light by accelerating it with her factor of the dragon, intensifying the kinetic energy by convergence and acceleration, allowing for the use of Divine Spirit-level thaumaturgy. It is an ""ultimate killing technique"" that releases light holding energy equaling Artoria's total amount of magical energy from the tip of the blade once the sword is swung. While the result is what looks like a large beam of light, only the tip of the attack, which is a wave of light that can mow through the surface of the Earth, is capable of doing damage, as the beam is the result of the ""dislocation"" of everything the attack destroys in its path.

Invisible Air: Bounded Field of the Wind King: C - Invisible Air is a sheath of wind that covers Excalibur and conceals it so that it cannot be easily recognized as the famous holy sword of King Arthur and expose her identity. It is a bounded field closer to magecraft than a Noble Phantasm that is made up of multiple layers of wind compressed into super-high pressure air with a massive amount of magical energy, which distorts the refraction of light and renders what is inside completely invisible. Upon Excalibur, it takes on the shape of the blade and renders it as an invisible sword that doesn't appear even as sparks fly off of it. It lacks the capacity to annihilate the enemy like Excalibur, being more suited as a ""sharp tool"" in battle. It isn't used for any particular strength, but it is easier to use in battle than Excalibur and it is a trump card that can bring about victory if used well. It is also possible to implement the barrier on something other than the sword. She can form the barrier in the area around her or as a quick defensive wall of wind, which she can keep active for a number of minutes with her magical energy. Once the barrier is released so that Excalibur can be used, the previously compressed wind surges around her chaotically, creating a vacuum as it diffuses into the air with enough force to knock over normal people and shake heavy, firm trees like a typhoon. The compressed wind can also instead be released as a single use projectile weapon called Strike Air: Hammer of the Wind King. Acting like a hammer made out of wind, it creates a gale made out of super high pressure condensed air that is powerful enough to easily crush and blow away armies and fling a stone slab weighing several tons into the air as if it were nothing.

669,,400,Gored Anew ,Warhammer: Fantasy: Beastmen,Transformation,"Beyond ascendance as a Bloodbull servant of the Gods that takes to the field of battle, there exist two horrific forms for a Minotaur to be shaped into. Were it not for their mindless rage and perpetual hunger, both of these could have been as blessed gifts from their gods - and to have these monsters in a herd is to all but guarantee victory. How fortuitous for you, then, to have been morphed into one of these Bullgor anomalies. Choose one of the following for your discount. You may purchase the other, at full price.

● CYGOR: A tainted cousin of the Minotaur, you are. At twenty-four-feet-tall, you have one single, blind eye in the center of your skull - blind, for you see nothing of the physical world. Instead, you bear witness to all that is magic, able to see the Winds themselves as great swirls and streams of hellish color coursing through an invisible landscape, pooling and winding together. Magicians and sorcerers are as bright, shining sweetmeats against a flat-grey world, and it’s that light at their core, their soul, that is the only thing capable of soothing your own hunger. There is one good thing for your condition, however - beyond your massive size and bulk, with one meaty hand capable of crushing a knight in full plate, your constant exposure to the Winds of Magic have left magic itself glancing off your hide.
"
670,,400,Unison System ,Lyrical Nanoha,Transformation,"The classification of a Unison Device is a difficult one. They are completely artificial beings, including total sapience, wills of their own and even their own linker cores, sometimes even with their own Devices. They can, essentially, be broken down into three key aspects: sapience, an artificial linker core and the capability to Unison, which is a physical merger of Device and master in order to handle high volumes of manner – involved in casting high-energy spells or using high-power modes such as Fulldrive. While most ordinary Mages can achieve the same effects by careful preparation and focus, the Unison Device acts as a part of it’s users subconscious, subtly tweaking the flow of mana and directing their master so the process becomes instant and effortless for them. 

This purchase includes the latter two characteristics, refined to be used in a traditional Device, which makes your Device slightly strange among Unison Devices, as it isn’t truly sapient – should you not choose to make it so in the previous section, that is. This also gives your Device a truly strange feature – an artificial Linker Core, which would let it cast spells and power it’s systems entirely independent of you, should you wish. It starts at A-rank, and does not grow naturally, due to being mechanical in nature. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)
"
671,,400,Pandemonium ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Transformation,"You can manipulate density, and everything related to density. By decreasing density, you could turn a mountain to sand, even turn yourself into a mist that covers all Gensokyo at once, or travel as a violent and largely untouchable fog (you can still hurt people, but being a fog makes it hard to affect you at all), or just grow extremely large. By increasing density, you could even collapse something into a miniature black hole (and by decreasing density, restore it) or shrink yourself and other items.
"
672,,400,Claimed for Posterity ,Ib,Transformation,"It’s wonderful to make your own art, but the real world is full of lovely things as well. It’s such a shame that they all fade away so quickly, never finding the eternity that paintings have. Fortunately, you can be their salvation. If you have access to someone who has just died, you can claim him or her as your own artwork. The subject will be reincarnated into a fitting art piece of your design, and be given an appropriate title if you do not choose one for it. Unless you choose otherwise, reality will shift so that other people, unless they were especially tied to that person, will forget about your artwork’s original life, and believe that it is one of your own creations (which it is, in a fashion). In addition, since the artwork still embodies the soul of the person, you can give life to it even without the Paint to Life perk (and you won’t need to use any of your own life force). If given life, the artwork will retain a degree of the memories and personality of its past self; as a result, don’t expect it to necessarily follow your orders.
"
673,,400,Shape Change ,Wonderland No More,Transformation,"You can now “shake yourself” into a creature of your choice (you get to choose each time you transform). This enables transformation into general “species” of creatures rather than specific individuals, but it’s still possible to turn into unique beings that constitute their own “species” (aka a boss monster like the Jabberwocky). You keep your own mental characteristics and powers/skills in addition to whatever special abilities your new form has. To transform, you’ll need to recite some sort of poem or story featuring said animal; the stronger or more magical the transformation is, the more lines you’ll need to recite. You can “shake” yourself back to your original form at will, but you’ll need to recite more lines to transform again. In addition, this perk also enables you to cancel physical transformations of other individuals by physical grappling and “shaking” the respective target until they revert to their original self; the stronger the transformation, the longer and more firmly you’ll need to shake the target. You can combine this perk with Size Change to make yourself (or others) change both size and shape all at once.
"
674,,400,Royal Jelly ,Wonderland No More,Transformation,"A transparent jelly used by Flying Elephants to transform into Queens. Usually, the jelly isn’t as effective on other creatures, merely healing wounds (and eating too much at once can make you sick). However, not only does this special version of the jelly offer improved healing without the risks, but it retains the power of queens. When the jelly is fed to a wild(ish) animal, whether sapient or non-sapient, the eater will transform into a “queen” version of the species – an enhanced form that often has greater intelligence, size, power, and charisma over its own kind.
"
675,,400,Legacy of Kadon ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Transformation,"Kadon transformed himself into a hulking monster, but could not change himself back. He who had invented the Scrolls of Binding was now forever a beast himself. That fate holds little fear for you, for accepting the beast within has its benefits and you sup greedily of them. When you transform any part of yourself from man to beast, the effect is amplified; turning your hands into bestial claws would see them become capable of ripping through steel as easily as flesh. Should you transform your whole being into that of a beast through Ghur, as Kadon did, your foes will tremble before your new form - whether an ancient saurian thing which puts the Dragons of Ulthuan to shame or a multi-headed monstrosity which can swallow armies of mortal men, a beast truly out of legend slumbers within you. You need only awaken it.
"
676,,400,Seeking True Transmutation ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Transformation,"The Gold Order has always sought a means to truly and permanently transform matter from one type to another, and this is especially true of metals. You have not achieved this yet, but you are closer than many. Any spell you cast to change one sort of metal into another now lasts almost twice as long as it would if cast by another Gold Wizard of otherwise equal power. This ensures, for instance, that your enemies’ armor will be useless lead for practically the entire battle. Please transmute responsibly, Magister.
"
677,,400,Wall Merging ,Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds,Transformation,"“What a sad, drab painting you make. You can rot there for all I care.”

Although not on the same level as Yuga’s magical powers, you’ve mastered the art of expending magical energy to merge with walls and other flat surfaces into a doodle form. Whilst in walls, you can move across them with no regard for gravity and slip through tiny cracks with ease, but you’ll be forcefully ejected once your magical reserves run dry, so it’s best to ensure you’re somewhere safe before that happens.
"
678,,400,Form Wrought by Wishes,Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap,Transformation,"Like Vaati, you have attained an alternate form, decided by you but you must be able to pass common scrutiny in Hyrule, that grants you an upgrade to your powers. Whilst in this form, which is easy enough to maintain, your power has grown to the point where you can ragdoll a knight in full-plate with little care and you can now even summon up some mid-boss tier enemies per day, around six of them.

With greater Fire magic you can expect to blast holes in walls as if using potent, but relatively common, explosives casually and illusion magic could be crafted from bending heat and light to your will.

Water Magic enhanced this way allows you to create advanced constructs of fluid, exert great pressure on those wet by your magic, and even compress dozens of gallons of water into pinpricks that explosively expand at your behest. 

Earth Magic stays simple in practice but what was once a few rocks has become hundreds of pounds of stone and dirt acting as a single living flow. An avalanche leashed to your will, use it wisely. You can also petrify your foes with a spell, though magical resistance is still possible.

Wind Magic enhanced this way provides endless flight and greater control over the atmosphere. Creating voids that injure those around them through vacuum and very sudden gale force winds are all within your ability now.

The Element of Darkness adds an element of weight to your attacks, slightly dragging those who get too close in, and can home in on foe skilled at dodging the normal way.
"
679,,400,Princess in Disguise ,Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker,Transformation,"So what if you’re the long lost princess of a long lost kingdom? They can just get lost if they think you want anything to do with that. You can, at will, create a weakened form of yourself, temporarily cutting yourself off from as much or as little of your power as you want. Getting it back requires a very magical girl-esque transformation, but you can get back as much or little as you want each time. While sealed away, nobody can sense your sealed powers - the man hunting you down would not see you for who you really are.
"
680,,400,Never Ending Army ,Legend of Zelda: The Adventure of Link,Transformation,"The armies of Ganon are growing every day. You, a “summoner” of sorts, are an example of why. You can draw out your inner Malice to “taint” wildlife and weak willed beasts to become cruel, loyal and vicious servants with the perk “Might of Monsters”, though attempting this on those who have their senses does not guarantee their loyalty, only power and madness. If you don’t have any local creatures around to corrupt, you could also give a bit of sacrifice - using a vial of your own blood to create a beast with the powers of “Might of Monsters.”

"
681,,500,Endbringer Physiology,Rapturous Rhapsody Jump,Transformation,"The Endbringers are incredibly advanced war machines, utilized by the Entities to create
conflict within their host species by causing chaos and destruction. They are characterized by their unique biology, possessing not flesh, bone, or muscle, but instead composed of a strange, almost supernatural material, and a fragile core embedded somewhere within your body. Upon purchase, you will become one of the Endbringers, and have the option to customize you appearance in any way you desire, with a height limit of fifty feet. While all Endbringers wield unique and powerful abilites, they do share one commonality: their constitution. Your body is made of increasingly dense layers, each twice as strong as the last, with your weakest--surface--layer as tough as aluminum alloy. While some fans have determined the cumulative density of an Endbringer to be equivalent to that of a galaxy off of some speculative napkin math, you're free to choose how tough you really are--just note, an energy blast capable of destroying India could only annihilate about 80% of an Endbringer in canon, and they get exponentially tougher the deeper you go. Additionally, Endbringers boast incredible regeneration, though it weakens at deeper layers, needing time--upwards of years, in extreme cases--to recuperate denser masses. They do have a weakness, however, in the fragile cores embedded in their bodies. Should it be destroyed, they too will fall. You can choose where you would like this core to lie. Lastly, you share the incredible strength all Endbringers possess. While some physical traits might be exaggerated in specific Endbringers (Behemoth, who's the strongest among the Endbringers, and Leviathan, who can move at hypersonic speeds underwater), you gain a decent middle ground--though that middle ground is still superior than most anyone you'll meet. Speeds matching sound, and a strength that could demolish the foundations of a small town in a single blow."
682,,500,Eternal Mangekyō Sharingan,Naruto,Transformation,"The Mangekyō Sharingan is--was--the percieved zenith of ocular jutsu within the Uchiha clan. Paralleling the Sharingan, it activates under times of extreme duress, particularly the loss of loved ones, changing the common three tomoe pattern into something altogether unique. The Mangekyō Sharingan granted two exclusive abilites, and access to the Susano'o. Thought to be cursed, the Mangekyō Sharingan offered exceptional power to those who've lost everything, and whose only remaining solace is the eternal grasp at strength. Despite the steep activation cost, the Mangekyō is a temporary power, inexorably resulting in the blindness of the wielder--or that's what was thought, until Izuna Uchiha, on his death bed, forfeited his own Mangekyō Sharingan to stave Madara's blindness, birthing the Eternal Mangekyō Sharingan for the first time. Somehow, Jumper, you've gotten access to the Eternal Mangekyō Sharingan with no cost to yourself. As said previously, you gain access to two (to begin) abilities, and the Susano'o, the only power common to all Mangekyō: a chakra samurai that encapsulates the user and evolves through the inundation of negative emotion. Initially, you'll start with only a ribcage barely larger than yourself which functions as a defense stalwart enough to impede all jutsu save for those cast by S-rank shinobi.  Unlike others, you'll be able to evolve your Susano'o to its perfect form, a construct large enough to stand toe-to-toe with the Tailed Beasts, through nothing but time and effort. Your Susano'o can wield larger versions of your own jutsu, as well as layer itself onto your other transformations as a suit of armor--provided they're of equal or larger size. Your Susano'o comes with wings, and will also be able to spawn swords and bows to wield, as well as explosive shuriken-adjacent weapons called Yasaka Magatama. For your abilities, you'll have your pick of two for free, and 100cp for the rest:

Furukotofumi - Self: The ability to impose the concept of Permanence to the self—while initially imprecise and inelegant, through practice it can become a scalpel as much as a hammer. Once unlocked, you would find the application something of a binary, rather than dynamic and modular: upon activation, Permanence inundates the body, providing absolute invulnerability to your metaphysical and physical being at the cost of movement and senses (sight, touch, etc.). At higher levels, you could apply Permanence selectively, such as specific limbs or even your chakra network.
If it were to be applied to your chakra network, you would find it intractable and unmoldable, but it would become an inviolable defense against chakra drain jutsu. This function could also be utilized as an offensive measure: if cast during jutsu activation, the jutsu could be held indefinitely (e.g., a Grand Fireball jutsu could be cast infinitely).
If the wielder of this jutsu were to master it, they would be able to lock skin (though it would be numb), but not muscles, providing mobility as well as an near-impregnable defense. They could activate and de-activate it within fractions of a second, using only the initial chakra cost to power jutsu, able to feed a theoretically infinite amount of chakra to a single technique.

Furukotofumi - World: The ability to impose the concept of Permanence on the world—while initially imprecise and inelegant, through practice it can become a scalpel as much as a hammer. Once unlocked, you would find the application something of a binary, rather than dynamic and modular: upon activation, Permanence inundates whatever the wielder gazes upon. While initially you would find yourself capable of affecting only a single object, through practice you would find no upper limit. 
This can affect nearly anything, fire, gas, jutsu, or people, with nearly infinite practical applications. From freezing enemy attacks mid-air, delaying a paper-bomb by your comrades feet, or, at higher levels, the enemies themselves—while you would be unable to apply Permanence to someone’s heart (unless you also have the Byakugan), you could apply it to them in their totality, rendering them helpless once the jutsu is undone.
Additionally, for a time, you could make any fortress or house—from cardboard to wood to steel—impenetrable.

Amaterasu: This ability allows for the production of black flames that will not stop burning until the target is destroyed or until seven days and nights pass. Unlike normal fire, this cannot be put out by water and will not die out on its own until the aforementioned time has passed. The only other ways for Amaterasu’s flames to be dealt with are for the user to choose to disperse the black fire, or for the flames to be sealed away with fuuinjutsu. Amaterasu can burn any material, including other flames, until nothing remains.

Kagutsuchi: This is the ability to manipulate the black flames of Amaterasu, changing the shape of the flames or controlling whether it burns something or not. With this power, the user could cause Amaterasu’s flames to cover their sword without destroying it, instead letting it destroy their enemies. 

Tsukuyomi: By making eye contact with another person you can trap them in an illusion of your design. This ability can alter the target's perception of time, allowing you to make time flow slower in the illusion than outside, allowing you to fit weeks or even decades of torture or information into the span of mere seconds. Within the illusion, you are God: whatever you desire, it happens. Even the strongest of shinobi would fall into a coma the moment it finds purchase.

Shin’s Object Control: With this ability you can brand any object you desire with a single touch. Doing so lets you use your Mangekyō Sharingan to telekinetically manipulate that object. There is no limit to the number of objects you can affect with this power.

Shin’s Portals: You gain the ability to create a sort of warp portal. Normally this is limited to places where other instances of the eye are located (and if you have methods like clones or otherwise you are free to use it as such) but since you're paying CP you may warp to personally branded objects and places (This could be the same mark as Object Control if you have both powers). Although fast enough to catch someone off guard, this is nowhere near as fast nor as versatile as the Hiraishin technique barring extraneous perks or training.

Kamui - Close: Almost absolute defense. This ability allows the user to transfer objects to and from another dimension. Transferring from the dimension can be done with varying degrees of force either simply appearing or flying from the exit point. Kamui can also be used to travel to and from that dimension meaning that anyone trapped there and trapped forever unless the user allows them to leave unless the target possesses their own version of kamui or another way to travel dimensions. With the short range version, the user can apply it to themselves, sucking themselves into the dimension and then exiting in any location they want. This is a nearly instantaneous process, allowing the user to avoid attacks, escape threats, or travel long distances in a short period of time. To suck others into the Kamui dimension, the user must physically touch the target. Another application of the short-range version of Kamui is intangibility. This is done by transferring body parts that would have been in contact with the overlapping matter into the Kamui dimension. This can be done to anything the user is touching and wearing. The user can utilise this to travel through barriers, travel underground, and escape attacks.

Kamui - Long: Almost absolute offense. The long range version creates an invisible barrier space around the target, and anything within that barrier is pulled toward the centre, transferring the target to the Kamui dimension. This can be used offensively by creating a barrier space around parts of a target and dragging them into the dimension without taking the entire target, ripping them apart. The greater the user’s chakra, the faster and more powerful the Kamui becomes. For both versions, anything that has been pulled into Kamui can also be launched out as a projectile at a speed greater than or equal to the speed upon entering Kamui, allowing jutsu or attacks to be stored and released similar to a sealing scroll. 

Kotoamatsukami: A powerful genjutsu that can manipulate a target’s thoughts perfectly and absolutely without anyone, even the target, being the wiser. Even being aware that they are being affected isn’t enough to free them. Unlike Kamui, both eyes share the exact same ability. 

Requires Sharingan to purchase."
683,,500,Bio-Assimilation,Worm CYOA v17,Transformation,"Upon consuming biomass, you are capable of collecting and storing genetic data, as well as absorbing a special type of energy called Bio Energy.

Utilising Bio Energy, you are able to change and modify your biological makeup using the genetic information you have stored. The more complex the genetic information, such as that of a Kryptonian, the greater amount of energy is required to transform your body into the desired state.

You may also utilise Bio Energy in a few additional ways. If you are in need of a specific sort of biomass to carry out a particular transformation, you may utilise Bio Energy to generate it. If you have sustained wounds or injuries, you may employ Bio Energy to promote healing. Additionally, you are able to tap into the potential of Bio Energy to temporarily enhance the capabilities of your physiology.

If the amount of Bio Energy stored within you exceeds a particular threshold, your body will initiate a process wherein you evolve in an accelerated manner, optimising your current biological state before storing the genetic data of your enhanced form.

You gain a few additional changes, your jaw is greatly boosted, allowing you to chew through steel. In addition to that, your stomach acids are able to break down practically any organic material."
684,,500,Higher Vampire,The Witcher Novels,Transformation,"Congratulations--you're a bloodsucker. Well, not really: blood is more of an intoxicant. In fact, you don't really need anything to survive, you're immortal! Unless you encounter a cosmically powerful being or another higher vampire with grudges, that it. Even should you be disintegrated to your constituent atoms, you'd regenerate (though it'd take months at best). While higher vampires all have unique abilities (Regis' corvid communication, Dettlaf's hemokinesis and mist form, whatever you might pick), there are a plethora of ubituitous abilites: unsurpassed strength even among monsters, speed akin to teleportation, invisibility, mind control of nearly all men and monsters, and a humanoid-bat form that enhances all previously mentioned capabilities, with the addition of flight! Finally, higher vampires gain strength as they age, the strongest and oldest among them touted as the Unseen Elders. Given enough time, you may surpass them, too."
685,,500,Demi/Pseudo Servant        ,Fate/Hollow Ataraxia,Transformation,"For 500 CP, you can choose to be a Demi or Pseudo servant. You must not have been one in a previous jump (if you were a demi servant you can still be a pseudo servant and vice versa, but if you were a demi servant you can’t be a demi servant again). Choosing to do so unlocks the capstone powers of the 600 CP perks. Psuedoservants must take the servant background and can pay in SP, but demiservants may take any background aside from servant.

Demiservants are humans combined with a servant, with the human in control. You can choose for your heroic spirit to either be active and in communication with you (basically as a voice inside your head) or to have them inactive and just there for the powers. As a demiservant you will be a human with a servant inside of you.

Pseudoservants are generally divine heroic spirits that have possessed humans, which also merges their personalities. The servant is in control however. As a psuedoservant you will be a servant that has possessed a human."
686,,500,The Real Thing,Marvel Zombies,Transformation,"That’s Ben Grimm, but you’ve got the same set of powers. You’re a being of stone. Or at least, you’ve got a similar enough body. You’re very strong and very durable. The classic brick powerset. In fact, you kind of look like one, too, as you’ve got a thick, orange rocklike hide that’s the source of much of your toughness, being able to turn aside bullets, speeding cars, and even blows from the Hulk! Your muscles, bones, and internal organs have become denser and received a proportional increase in durability. Your other power is superhuman strength. You’ll start out being able to lift about 50 tons, but you’ve got enough potential to improve exponentially if you work on it. However, you are stuck in this form for the duration of the jump. That’s not so bad, since you’re immortal this way. You’ll learn to revert to your original form post-jump. Alternatively, you can choose to have a metal form instead of a stone form."
687,,500,Stretcho,Marvel Zombies,Transformation,"You are elastic! You can stretch your body to great lengths and contort yourself into impossible shapes. Suddenly, far fewer things are out of reach to you. You can elongate your limbs to reach things, and turn yourself into virtually any shape - balls, parachutes, tarps, you name it. This comes with a great deal of resistance to damage, as you’ll simply bend back before returning to your original state. Really, there’s a lot you could do with this. Contain explosions by wrapping yourself around them. Inflate yourself into a ball. Stretch your finger into a key. Make a living net. Stretch your neck and make yourself a long-necked-giraffe-snake. Reenact that scene where No-Face eats too much in Spirited Away. Be creative."
688,,500,Sandman,Marvel Zombies,Transformation,"It’s all in the name. You are primarily composed of sand now, and you can control every grain that makes your body. This has a large variety of benefits, the first being that attacks harmlessly pass through you. After all, hitting you would literally amount to pounding sand. Incidentally, it means that zombies are going to have a very hard time turning you. While you’ll always be made of sand, your control over it allows you to shapeshift to a great extent - you can stretch, flatten, shape yourself into constructs, disperse, reform, and more. You could even mimic the form of another person, though you’ll still be sand. Controlling your density is also within your purview, allowing you to be untouchable one moment and solid the next. There’s much more that you’re capable of, but watch out for water. It’ll render you vulnerable."

I BREAK HIS ANKLE. HE SCREAMS. I TEAR HIS THROAT TO RIBBONS. I DO IT WITH YOUR HANDS, YOUR APPENDAGES, YOUR MOUTH, YOUR TONGUE. OTHERS TRY TO FIGHT DIRECTLY. THEIR WEAPONS PASS THROUGH US LIKE MIST, MY POWER ALLOWING US TO MOVE THROUGH THEIR BLOWS WITH EASE. MY FREEDOM IS IN REACH. ALL I NEED NOW IS TO TAKE IT. AND I - WE - WILL DO WHATEVER I NEED TO MAKE IT HAPPEN."
690,,500,The Den's Hunger,Slay the Princess,Transformation,"Hunger, a mindless hunger. There is no longer a need, there is no longer a want - there is simple hunger, absolute, a law unto itself. Your body is far larger and stronger than it has ever been. But in exchange, you've traded much of your higher reasoning for the sake of it. Larger and faster, but bulkier and far less capable of coherent thought - you are closer to a simple beast than you are anything with the capacity for actual speech and discussion. Powerful, yes. But at the cost of so, so much."
691,,500,Can't Keep Me In This Prison ,Slay the Princess,Transformation,"What are you doing? No. No. You weren't supposed to learn about this yet. It's-eugh, this will make slaying the Princess so much harder, do you realize that?! But fine, fine. I'll indulge you, if only to say I told you so.

With this, you feel yourself...'stretching', for lack of a better term. You feel an awareness of yourself that you've never had before - an awareness that you're bigger than this, bigger than these frail walls that enclose you. There's a hum and a hiss of growth as you stretch and stretch more, and you find that you have become a vast living network, spreading across the world that pokes and prods almost imperceptibly - testing your newfound limits. Some would perhaps mistake you for a God, or for a monster - what with your powers growing enough to break apart the world and possibly reality if you really started putting your mind to it. But it's difficult to focus like this, like you're losing yourself the more you reach out. Like you're missing 'something' to keep you whole."
692,,500,Embodiment of Fear(Tier 4),Chainsaw Man,Transformation,"This purchase grants you the powers of a devil. All devils can regenerate from anything short of death by drinking blood. The rate at which you regenerate depends on your race, with hybrids having the fastest and fiends the slowest. You can design your general powerset, appearance, and otherwise around your tier or make the choice to sacrifice some aspects for others, such as forgoing the parameter boosts in exchange for more potent abilities.

At the start of each Jump you have the option to adjust the effects of this perk to the setting or opt to keep things how they were in this world. For example, a Ninja Devil might be massively stronger in Naruto than they would here but choose to go back to this setting’s level when they visit a world without ninjas.

The fourth tier puts you on the scale of a global threat. You can bring cities to ruin within the hour or travel across the world in minutes. You represent something that humans struggle to confront and causes real terror in the minds of people spanning the globe. Includes things like the fear of nuclear bombs, guns, technology, the cosmos, failure, and betrayal.

693,,500,Demi-Servant/Pseudo Servant,Fate/Stay Night,Transformation,"You are...how did you become a Demi Servant?! The process isn't even invented for another year and that's on an infant! I bet it's those guys messing with time again. Impossibilities like you shouldn't even have a chance of existing. Though, with how unique some of your other abilities are, I guess it might not be so out of mind after all. 

Looking past that, I guess we should tell you what this means. A Demi-Servant is a fusion between a Servant and a modified human that allows the human to make use of the powers, skills and Noble Phantasms of a Servant they are bonded with. Normally it'd take some time to learn to use these powers and the fusion would give the user a very limited lifespan but I guess whatever time mess up made you like this let you bypass those flaws in the process. You gain the Servant Origin in addition to your original one, though you do not gain the 100cp freebie, and access to the Servant Supplement as described for those of the Servant Origin, with 1000SP and all associated discounts and freebies. 

On the other hand, perhaps you were a Servant originally, instead of a 'mere' human. Have no fear, a path is also open to you, one less contrived then the existence of Demi-Servants in this year. A Pseudo Servant is much the same as a Demi Servant, a Servant is summoned into a human vessel. Here, however, the Servant is not the one giving their abilities to the human but is instead fully in control of their new vessel. The vessel you were summoned into was blank and ready for your possession, providing no resistance. In effect, you gain 1000CP with which to buy an origin (Or take a free origin for free), perks and items, though none of this extra CP can be converted into SP. You will still be summoned as a Servant by whatever Master you chose, they will simply be the ones to prepare or come into possession of your current vessel in some manner. An important note, is that Pseudo Servants effectively count as having living bodies, for the purposes of Magical Energy regeneration and any other effect that might care. 

Whichever option you have taken, the changed nature, be it Servant or Human, has magnified the powers of certain perks you could take. Any 600cp perk will gain an upgraded form for you if you take them and this perk at once, as described in the Notes section at the bottom of this jump. Taking either of the above options does not lock you out of getting a Servant or Master if you normally would, these are entirely separate from such a thing. "
694,,500,Grimm Enhancement,RWBY,Transformation,"Disturbingly... it is possible for a person with a soul to become a Grimm or at least fused to it. Examples would be Salem, Cinder and one poor fellow who made up the Hound. You don’t seem to be that disturbed by this fact however, as with this option you have replaced one part of your body up to a full limb with the cursed flesh of a Grimm. It may or may not have a sentience of its own, but it is completely docile to you and acts like an arm should for you. This has given you much opportunity and access to the Grimm section, with 500 GP to spend and the possibility to convert CP into GP as a non-Grimm, though you may only purchase from the Misc. section. However the part of your body that is made of Grimm may not be protected by Aura, as it is soulless. Post-Jump you can choose to switch to have your Grimm limb or not at any time. This can be purchased multiple times, and may be used in all RWBY jump docs such as The Games We Play at your discretion."
695,,500,SIDOCI - WHITE XENOMIX,CthulhuTech,Transformation,"Sidoci are also called Whites because they have white skin, white hair, and white eyes. They are a rare result of Human and Nazzadi crossbreeding. They have the nightvision of their Nazzadi parents and tend toward strong wills. But their most interesting trait is that they are all powerful parapsychics. They also get one level of powers outside of their primary type. "
696,,500,Celestial,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Transformation,"You are an angel, a human-looking being notable for the presence of two feathered wings on your back. These wings are not capable of flight by themselves. Indeed, normally you would need a deity to grant you the power of flight to make use of them. Fortunately, by purchasing this species, you will always have this blessing, allowing you to fly for brief periods at a time.

For an additional 300cp (500cp total), you are instead a deity. No, this is not nearly as powerful as it may sound in this world, though it is still quite strong. Instead of feathered wings, you have wings of light that you may manifest at your discretion. You have no limit to your natural lifespan, and will not physically age past your prime. You have limited range teleportation, can temporarily summon a barrier around yourself, and may bestow the power of flight upon those with feathered wings. You can bless up to 2 people at once with this power, and may rescind it at any time. 

You have access to a powerful technique, on par with Palutena’s Black Hole + Mega Laser combo. This technique takes a lot out of you, and you will find it difficult to use it more than once per fight."
697,,500,Monster Girl,Invincible,Transformation,"You have been cursed by a Witch of tremendous power. Her curse allows you to change into a hulking green monster with tremendous strength and durability whenever you wish. Every time you change into your monster you regress slightly in age meaning that every transformation causes you to get younger, with your monster form increasing in strength the younger your natural form is. This increase in strength does increase the size of your monster form slightly. Thanks to the magic of cp however you can turn this age regression off or on as desired. If you are physically 18-20 years old your monster form would be strong enough to beat a young viltrumite to death with durability on par with a veteran Viltrumite. If you ever let yourself regress in age to an infant your monster form might become powerful enough to fight or even defeat a Regent level Viltrumite one on one. While transformed you have unlimited stamina."
698,,500,Spirit of Vengeance,Dial,Transformation,"With this perk, you are bestowed with the power of the Spirit of Vengeance, granting you the incredible abilities of Ghost Rider. You become intricately connected to the mystical entity known as the Spirit of Vengeance, which bestows upon you a wide range of supernatural powers and abilities. Firstly, you gain access to the Penance Stare. By making eye contact with those who have committed sins or wronged others, you can channel their guilt and sins back upon them. This inflicts intense pain upon them and forces them to relive the consequences of their actions, serving as a potent form of punishment.

Additionally, you possess the ability to manipulate hellfire. You have complete control over this mystical fire, allowing you to summon it at will and wield it as a formidable weapon. Your hellfire is immensely powerful, capable of burning through almost anything and causing great harm, even to supernatural entities. Your physical strength is enhanced to superhuman levels, granting you incredible power and allowing you to overpower opponents with ease. You possess the strength to shatter objects and deliver devastating blows in combat, making you a formidable force to be reckoned with.

Furthermore, as the Spirit of Vengeance embraces you, you are granted immortality. The aging process no longer affects you, and most forms of harm have little effect. You possess incredible regenerative abilities, allowing you to recover from injuries at an accelerated rate. This immortality ensures your resilience and endurance in the face of any adversary. Lastly, you will gain the ability to enhance any vehicle or mount that you are in control of. The animal or vehicle in question will be bathed in hellfire gaining demonic qualities. The attributes of your mount will be significantly enhanced. "
699,,500,Trolls,Dial,Transformation,"Trolls are a formidable species known for their incredible strength and durability. With robust physiques and powerful muscles, they possess immense physical power that rivals even the mightiest of opponents. Trolls, like the warrior Ulik, have demonstrated their ability to engage in battles against formidable foes such as Thor, Iron Man, and Dial, holding their ground with tenacity and skill. Their robust physiology grants them exceptional endurance, allowing them to withstand intense physical confrontations and endure significant amounts of damage.

Trolls often possess sharp claws and tough skin, providing them with added offensive and defensive capabilities. Their resilience and fighting prowess make them fearsome adversaries on the battlefield. In addition to their physical attributes, Trolls are known for their unyielding determination and warrior spirit. They possess a fierce loyalty to their kin and are renowned for their prowess in combat. With their impressive strength, resilience, and combat skills. Purchasing this option and becoming a Troll will make you on par with Ulik."
700,,500,Anodite ,Dial,Transformation,"Anodites are ethereal beings composed of pure energy. They possess a deep connection to the fundamental forces of the universe, granting them immense magical power. Anodites can manipulate and channel energy in various forms, allowing them to create powerful energy blasts, manipulate matter, and even shape reality itself. With their reality-warping abilities, Anodites can transcend the physical limitations of other species. They are attuned to the mystical forces that permeate the crossover universe, making them capable of feats that defy conventional understanding."
701,,500,Spirit of Vengeance(500) ,Marvel Midnight Suns,Transformation,"There is something else inside you, something that screams for vengeance like Johnny Blaze and Robbie Reyes. Just like any other Ghost Rider your Spirit of Vengeance allows you to channel hellfire in different shapes, give souls a Penance Stare to hurt them with their soul with their own sins and a healing factor of the damned."
702,,500,Rebis ,Generic Alchemist,Transformation,"You have achieved internal unity of mind, body, and soul, becoming a rebis. You have two minds that work as one, two souls that are conjoined, and two physical forms you can shift between at will, one male, one female, that can temporarily separate from one another to give you two bodies. You are still one entity despite your dual nature. This does have several benefits.

Firstly, you have two trains of thought you can run parallel to each other and which can communicate, as well as being able to adopt different perspectives by splitting your psyche to give each sides distinct qualities. This can even be used to allow you insights into the minds of others if you are practiced enough.

Secondly, your twin souls give you an increased wellspring of potential, improving on the potency and depth of any supernatural power source you have as well as any you may gain or develop in the future, so long as they have some spiritual element to them. Most forms of magic fall into this category.

Thirdly, you can switch between two physical forms at will, each with their own physical abilities emphasized over time through training or conditioning, such as one being trained more for speed, agility, and reflexes while the other is more about strength, endurance, and resilience.

Finally, you can separate yourself into multiple entities for a time, each with one of your minds, bodies, and souls. Your split form cannot remain separated for long at first, and must remain within a certain distance of each other, starting out only able to last about an hour before needing to remerge and with a distance of only about a hundred meters before issues pop up. Should either be exceeded, one of your forms will dissolve and return to the other, damaged but recoverable. This will take time to recover from. Practice will increase the time and distance your two forms can remain separated. Your other forms remain in constant telepathic contact as a hive mind.

If you also have the Enlightenment perk, you can form additional facets of yourself, increasing the number of minds, bodies/forms, and souls you possess over time. This increases the number of trains of thought, the level of spiritual power, and the diversity of physical forms you possess, as well as how many bodies you may separate into at any given time."
703,,500,Jumper of Flesh and Spirit,MtG - Kamigawa,Transformation,"You are something akin to the ones who ended this grand war. Like the Sisters of Flesh and Spirit you are a union of Kami and Mortal and thus you have become greater for it.

Your body and soul are one, in this world even the soul has a Kami that could have been turned against you, and as such you have greater ability to tap into innate powers of the soul even within your mortal coil. Secondly, you have a greater grasp of Mana, able to tap into the energies that compose the world easily and perform feats of magic beyond common
understanding.

As a final bonus your personal magic, if you chose to have any, from this world in particular is boosted. If you have Duplication Magic then you can easily maintain the reflection for a day instead of an hour, and Summoning now encompasses creatures crafted whole cloth from the Aether in addition to being you’ve made a compact with, though you must still be the greater of the two to command said summons. Kanji Magic become even more flexible and powerful thanks to your innate understanding of nature's symbolism and a more instinctive understanding of how the words describe things and Mana Charge gains the ability to grant ‘charges’ to others."
704,,500,Disciples Draft ,Drakengard and Nier,Transformation ,"You know the secret of making Disciples. That’s the magically-bound bodyguard/familiar/boytoy variety, not the mundane lower-case-d disciples. By taking a regular animal and empowering them with magic, you can give them a human body and intelligence level, then forge a bond between them and anyone you wish. Besides granting someone a loyal companion and partner, Disciples are naturally gifted warriors, with a level of power above that of a regular human, though still less than an Intoner. More importantly, Disciples boost the magic of those they’re bonded with. For Intoners, that means allowing them to summon ‘Angels’ into this plane of reality with their Songs. For others, it may unlock any hidden abilities or just strengthen their spells beyond what would normally be capable. 

While the canon disciples get along with their intoners to… various degrees, you can be a lot more prudent when giving them personalities, ensuring that they mesh well with their bondmates. Or ensure that they don’t, if you’re feeling like a bitch. 

Disciples are reliant on their bondmate’s energy to live. If a Disciple’s bondmate dies, or if they’re released from their duties somehow, a Disciple will turn back into the animal you crafted them from. Even if you recapture the animal and turn them into a Disciple again, they won’t have any memories of their previous time being uplifted. Disciples can also turn back into animals if they push themselves too far, such as if a Disciple attempts to summon an Intoner’s Angel on their own.
"
705,,600,Artificial Angel,A Certain Scientific Accelerator,Transformation,"You have a halo and a pair of retractable wings, which allow you to fly at
high speeds. While it might not seem like much, it comes with the abilities common to all angels;
great durability, incredible strength, regeneration, and special senses, among others, such as
enhanced computation, traveling between phases, eternal life, and speaking a special, angelic
language. Science side angels are either manifestations of AIM or espers who have taken on
even more angelic traits than Accelerator or Kakine. Either way, their psychic powers are vastly
elevated and expanded. Magic side angels may be minor divinities with free will, artificial
facsimiles, usurpers, or innovators of God’s Right Seat. Whatever their origin, they are aligned
with one of the four classical elements and have access to a Heavenly energy called Telesma,
which fuels the powerful angelic magic they know well. Such angels could easily recreate the
aforementioned group, but that might not be a good idea."
706,,600,Firstborn,TES: Dovah,Transformation,"There should only be one Firstborn amongst the Dovah, but it seems
like there is one other, or perhaps you Mantled him? Regardless, as a dragon, you have only one
equal, in power, size, and skill: Alduin himself, meant to bring about the end of this kalpa, fittingly called the World Eater. Take Thu'um for free."
707,,600,Ashbeast,Rapturous Rhapsody Jump,Transformation,"Ashbeast may be one of the strongest parahumans to ever live, but he’s also one of the
saddest. He became a living sun with the power of a continuous nuclear explosion, but
could never disable his powers. You possess the same abilities as Ashbeast, but you
have complete control over your transformation. You can turn into a colossal, blazing
entity capable of unleashing devastating waves of heat at will. In this form, you can
incinerate virtually anything in your path, creating explosions equivalent to nuclear
detonations. Your control allows you to regulate the intensity and range of your powers,
ensuring that you can use them with precision or full-scale destruction as needed,
without the fear of losing control or harming unintended targets."
708,,600,Shaper,Rapturous Rhapsody Jump,Transformation,"Shaper is one of the most powerful Shards granting the user incredible biokinetic
abilities. These powers allow you to freely manipulate the biological aspects of any
living being with immense precision. You can cure cancers, modify genetic structures on
the fly, and even terminate life with a mere touch. Strength-wise your abilities are on par
with Amelia’s Shard Shaper after Mikael freed it from its limits. This will allow you to
work on yourself optimizing your form. Aside from this most of the standard restrictions
Shaper has will be removed. You will have to explore the full potential of your new
power to discover its limits."
709,,600,Idle Transfiguration,Jujutsu Kaisen,Transformation,"You’re capable of altering the shape of the souls of anyone you touch. As, under this technique’s rules, the shape of the body is dependent on the shape of the soul, functionally this technique allows you to reshape the bodies of those you come into contact with to horrific effect.

Just one touch, and any normal human could be disfigured into a grotesque shape completely unrecognisable from what they once were – or killed in gruesome fashion, if you prefer. Squashed or stretched proportions, extra limbs or appendages, animalistic traits: the modifications you can make are almost without limit, unbounded by the conservation of mass. You can even shrink them down enough to fit in your pocket, or blow them up to tower over regular humans. People altered beyond recognition like this – referred to as transfigured humans – will have their minds and sanities destroyed beyond repair, and will unquestioningly obey your commands.Of course, your transfigurations don’t have to be harmful. You could just as well heal someone with this, able to grow missing limbs in a matter of seconds even if they happened to be born without them.

You’re also more than capable of changing the shape of your own soul to great effect. You could shift your arms into functional wings to fly at great speed; a multitude of long, whip-like blades capable of slicing through concrete like paper; a drill you can fire off as a ranged projectile, and more. Or you could just make your fists bigger to hit harder or arms longer to extend your reach, to keep things simple. Likewise, uses such as producing spikes from anywhere on your body, splitting apart into multiple bodies (though only one will be the real ‘you’), or turning into other animals such as fish or snake-like creatures are all possible.

This self-shapeshifting ability also comes with a perhaps unexpected bonus. Since you can just alter the shape of your soul to nigh-instantly repair any damage to your physical form, harming your body is pretty much meaningless. To do any real damage to you, your opponents will need to attack your soul itself – something that, while possible, is an incredibly rare feat few are capable of, making you almost impossible to take down for anyone else.

There are more specialised uses for this technique, including those that focus on merging the souls of others together, though those will have to be learned through your own experimentation."
710,,600,Nursery Rhyme User,Medaka Box Abnormal Jumpchain,Transformation,"By singing a nursery rhyme, you are able to decrease the age of any that hear that nursery rhyme. They’ll get younger and younger as you keep singing, not just becoming younger in body but also
gaining the clothes, items and powers that they had at those ages, even if that would remove things
from them. All they keep is their minds as their age rapidly, geometrically decreases. The louder you
sing, the bigger the affected area that your song will reach. Your power cannot reduce someone to
being younger than an infant but it can de-age someone from death, even if they didn’t die of old
age, and bring them back to life. It can even work over transmitters such as cell phones or speakers
to extend your range further. The only way to disable the effect is to knock you out, at which point
everyone will return to normal. "
711,,600,Double Standard,Medaka Box Abnormal Jumpchain,Transformation,"If you can’t be good enough on your own, maybe you can just make up with a lot more than
whatever anyone else has. Surely quantity can fill the empty hole in your heart. You now have the
ability to divide anything into a number of weaker and smaller parts, controlling the number of splits
in whatever you touch to the point of making hundreds of splits. You can split anything you touch in
this way and this may be either a harmful split, tearing things into many tiny pieces, or a harmless
one, reducing the target into smaller and weaker copies of the original target. Your ability even
works on immaterial things, such as people’s ambitions or loyalties to other people, provided you
can touch a physical object that immaterial thing is connected to. However, especially powerful
beings may be able to resist your power or even remain a threat despite being split into many
smaller beings. "
712,,600,Primordial ,Greek Mythology,Transformation,"You aren’t some mere god--in fact, even the Titans are nothing more than
children to you. For you are a Primordial: a being that was born from Chaos, or perhaps lived
alongside Chaos before anything was even a thought. You are the living embodiment of a
concept of reality as old and powerful as the likes of Ananke, Nyx, Chronos-Aeon, Gaia, etc.

Requires God/dess (Major) to purchase."
713,,600,Demigod,Greek Mythology,Transformation,"Whether you were born a normal human child, or you hatched out of an
egg, it doesn’t matter; you are now a demigod a child born from divinity. You are not the only
demigod in this world, but you are far more blessed than any other. Where most demigods have
one skill boosted, you have many and the capacity to improve upon them. This perk grants you
the Strength of Heracles, Speed of Atlanta, Intelligence of Perseus, Cleverness of Odysseus,
and a lesser version of “Nemean Pelt” that is similar to Achilles granting you the same durability
as the perk but you must choose a point on your body that will be your Achilles heel, and finally
you can choose one mundane craft that you are exceptionally skilled at medicine would put you
on a level similar to Aslepius who was able to bring the recently deceased back to life."
714,,600,God/dess (Minor),Greek Mythology,Transformation,"You are an immortal being that has divine command
over an aspect of the world. For 200cp, you are a Minor god that most likely serves under a
major god, your aspect will be less powerful than a Major gods and you won’t have as many
mortal worshipers as a Major god. Choose 3 concepts to preside over."
715,,600,Valkyrja,Germanic/Norse Mythology Jump,Transformation,"Choosers of the Slain, beings of great and terrifying power most likely elevated by Odin from among the Disir to a position closer to being a minor deity than a messenger or angel(no matter how much you look the part)  acting as an extension of Odin's power and will. You have equally been elevated in power and gifts to being considered among them, if you were among the Guðkunnigr you would be equal in every way to your fellow sisters of battle becoming a very minor deity of war, death, fire, weather, healing, victory, and fate. You do not simply carry the worthy among the dead to Valhalla, you choose who lives or dies, the victors and losers,  in mortal battles and wars under your gaze. You and any mount you ride is gifted with flight, under your own power, far faster than you could move on foot; at any point you may or may not have a pair of powerful awe inspiring wings. At any time you may compose yourself out of fire and sunlight. You are free; no prison, bindings, spell, or charm can hold or restrict you or your mind or soul, no barricade can block your path. You are a bridge between the realm of the living and the dead, not restricted to either. You are an unparalleled warrior even amongst the impossible standards of the gods, skilled in every weapon or art of war with strength, speed, and strategy to match.  Any of your gifts and ability to wield true magic will grow to be unparalleled by mortal standards. Short of true death you may heal and cure anyone of any natural disease, wound, or ailment whether physical, mental, spiritual, or something more esoteric. Your beauty is beyond compare, able to strike mortals dumbstruck."
716,,600,Blood Empowerment,Demon Slayer,Transformation,"Oh boy. You really want to go this far, huh? Alright, I won't stop you.
Somehow, you've undergone the same level of treatment as Muzan, the First Demon, has; your base
power level is equivalent to his, making you a challenging fight for all the Pillars working together, with
immense durability, speed, and strength. However, that's not the only thing about Muzan that sets him
apart... namely, he's the First Demon, and not the Only Demon, for a reason, one you now share - by
feeding humans your blood, you make them demons as well, more blood making them more powerful (up
to an individual's limit; more than that, and they explode into giblets). This ""power"" can be as general or
specific as you wish, in that you can choose to simply give them an amount of strength that will manifest as
best suited for the individual, or you can grant them specific abilities you have access to; for the duration of
this jump, this can only be abilities granted by this jump. While Muzan may not be the only demon capable
of doing this, you take this to his level, allowing you to kill any demon you bestow power in this manner
when you wish. This might have triggers attached to it as well to activate when you're not immediately
aware of them. Lastly, but certainly not least, you have an additional 3 Demon Blood Arts at your disposal.

717,,600,Demon Slayer Crest,Demon Slayer,Transformation,"At the zenith of a Demon Slayer's power, in one of the most intense
battles of their life, they may awaken a power not seen since the creator of the Breath of the Sun, the
original Slayer fighting style: the Demon Slayer Crest, a scar-like marking on your face or neck which
stylistically matches your fighting style. Simply possessing the mark puts your strength, agility, and
endurance in line with the strongest of the Upper Moons--an increase upwards of twenty times (compatible with other boosts), making you one of the most formidable Slayers in the Corps bar none. Additionally, you can see beneath the skin to the blood flow, joints, and muscles of those around you, granting you the keenest of insight into their movements, and the world seems to slow down around you, allowing you to react to attacks the instant your opponent's body begins to follow through. Lastly, you can ignite your weapon with a blazing crimson aura. While not literal fire, this glow is an
amazingly powerful tool against creatures with regenerative properties because it substantially slows their
regeneration down; enemies which would regrow limbs in seconds take five times as long to repair damage
done by such attacks. All aspects of this perk - the appearance of the mark, the increased physical abilities,
the ""see-through world,"" and the crimson blade - can be toggled individually. Also, some people might think
that bearing the Demon Slayer Crest shortens your lifespan; this is false. Taking this Perk will not
negatively affect your lifespan."
718,,600,Simple Shift,Bleach,Transformation,"Though it may be attached to an otherwise weak holder, this ability may actually be one of the finest
workings Urahara ever succeeded on. A special ability that at first, merely seems like shapeshifting.

You can take on both the form and the mannerisms of other beings that you are familiar with, usually requiring some period of study before you can get it right. While your spiritual energy won’t
change, a weakness in the disguise, your morphing is otherwise quite identical. Even when it comes
to abilities. Again, provided you are familiar and know of their various abilities in some detail, you
can copy them when you take on a specific individuals form. A Shinigami’s Shikai, for instance, despite the normal spiritual requirements of such. It is unfortunately limited by your own level of
power, not just weakening abilities of people you aren’t a match for but even limiting access entirely
if the gap in power is too great. A Shinigami’s Bankai might be lesser or off-limits entirely without
growing stronger. Only a single form can be maintained at a time and the detail you need is fairly
extensive before you can take on another’s form. "
719,,600,Enhanced,Bleach,Transformation,"The Nemuri project is Mayuri’s pride and joy, the creation of true life from ambient spirit particles. Not just another mod soul or something made from components of existing souls. As if a mortal
alchemist made life from clay, Kurotsuchi sought and succeeded at creating a being from the world. As his latest work alongside Nemu or an off-shoot of the project by some blonde intellectual thief, you were hand crafted from Konpaku cells. These special spiritual forms hold potent regenerative
power, which has been directed to greatly enhanced your abilities. The most obvious benefit is regeneration, similar to what the Hollows might rely on. From anything
short of death, your body can rapidly replenish itself to healthy condition. The cells have
supercharged your spiritual makeup in general, resulting in a mixture of seriously increased physical
abilities and similarly boosted spiritual powers. For an ordinary soul, this is more focused on the
physical side, letting a otherwise Lieutenant level Shinigami display Captain level physical prowess. For other races, this might instead be focused towards their unique abilities to give more of an
increase there. As part of the Nemuri process, your body has been outfitted with the best that Mayuri had to offer
in biological tools and weaponry. It can come off as quite the arsenal, with a wide variety of different
chemicals hidden inside your body as traps for enemies that enter or infect you, natural weapons
built like high-speed drill hands or extending limbs, enhanced senses and built in stealth capabilities, redundant or reinforced organs to survive normally fatal injuries without issue. Not much more can
fit inside you now but as is, it all seems quite stable. Part of your nature has also given you a complete awareness of your body’s inner workings, not just
active knowledge of where and how every organ and cell is functioning but also a deep level of
manual control over your body. Even normally automatic functions can be finely tuned, from natural
responses like blinking or gagging to something as unorthodox as adjusting the speed of your
regeneration. A major function of this control is the ability to overclock your various functions, drawing out more and more power from your Konpaku cells in return for increasing strain and
eventual damage to your body. Essentially, any function of your body or spirit can be affected this
way, from increasing your regeneration speed to dangerous levels of replication to massively
increased muscular power to dividing a piece of your soul and using that lost percentage as a
monstrously strong spiritual blast. "
720,,600,Deus Ex Machina,Naruto - Ōtsutsuki Clan Jump,Transformation,"Despite the members of our clan being literally aliens
to the humans, it’s undeniably that human technology is more advanced than ours,
even considering we have some artifacts that are also godlike compared to their
machines. Although, this isn’t a problem, as their technology still has a long, long
path before actually posing a threat to our clan, but their power is already
considerable and still is mostly ignored by almost every Ōtsutsuki that doesn’t think
them worthy of being part of their evolution. Well, almost every Ōtsutsuki, except
you. Maybe it’s because of your artificial nature/origin or due to your own connection
with science, but you developed the ability to integrate any technological
enhancement you implant in your body, making them literally count as body parts for
all intents and purposes, including sharing your body’s durability and regeneration.
This also enables you to revive together with any machines you’ve implanted
through your Kāma, as well as automatically assimilating any enhancement your
hosts may have in their bodies, so, if you used Kawaki or Code as your hosts, you
would assimilate their microscopic scientific ninja tools after resurrecting. As your
power grows, this ability will evolve to allow you to absorb other machines without
the need of directly implanting them into your body and to summon and unsummon
them at will in a manner similar to how the Rinnegan’s Asura path works."

Ordinarily, a person can use no more than 20% of their potential in order to prevent the body from harming itself. With training, an individual can learn to release these limiters, increasing their strength and speed. By taking this perk, you can now open all eight Gates and survive unlike in canon. However, this will leave you incapacitated for at minimum 6 months unless you possess a regenerative factor. "
723,,600,Zetsu,Naruto,Transformation,"You are a mutated human produced by the God Tree subsuming an ordinary person and drawn from within the Outer Statue and combined with the DNA of Hashirama Senju. Your abilities will depend on your coloration. As an ordinary White Zetsu, you possess the Substitute Technique, a flawless transformation technique that allows you to copy everything about an opponent by absorbing some of their chakra, down to their techniques. You can produce spores that latch onto targets, undetectable even for sensors and Kage-level ninja, and drain their chakra by activating them. Finally, you can use the Parasite Clone Technique, which produces clones that do not vanish even if they sustain lethal damage. You also receive a discount on the Regeneration Ability Kekkei Genkai. Alternatively, you may choose to be a Black Zetsu, a specialized Zetsu with a black, malleable body that can freely change its shape and size at will. You have the ability to possess others, latching onto them and puppeting their bodies, gaining control of their abilities while you do so. You can freely record all that you perceive with your senses, and can share that information with others with a mere touch. You receive the Chakra Sensing Kekkei Genkai for free, along with a free purchase of wood release (without needing Senju or earth and water affinity). Or if you want the best of both worlds, you can pay an additional 200 CP (600 total) to become both. You will be half White Zetsu and half Black Zetsu, possessing the ability to split in two and operate both bodies independently. All of your perks and abilities will function normally for both bodies, and as long as one survives, you will not die. Should one of your halves die, it will regrow from the surviving half over time. 

Regardless of which of the options you select, you no longer need to eat or drink, nor do you age, with your chakra sustaining you instead. You can quickly consume human corpses, and eating ninja will grant you a modest but permanent boost to your own reserves. Finally, you have access to the Mayfly, a technique that allows you to phase into the ground, rendering yourself undetectable and allowing you to quickly travel across vast distances.

724,,600,Atavistic​ ​Form​ ,Demon:​ ​The​ ​Fallen,Transformation ,"A demon’s Apocalyptic form is a divine representation of what they are. They are the representation of the lost glory given form, the faintest whisper of the Angelic Being they once were. Except yours. Your form represents not the Angel you were long ago, but who and what you are now. Your Apocalyptic representation is a well balanced and graceful amalgamation of You. On top of your regular Apocalyptic form, you may pick and choose one major aspect of any alternate forms you have to be represented in your divine mien, with aspects of some of your strongest powers portrayed as a theme. You are a divine being, Jumper, now look the part."
725,,600,Incarnate,Egyptian Mythology,Transformation ,"You are not just the deity responsible for the yearly floods or war or the phases of the moon, you are the floods, or war, or the phases of the moon. You may incarnate yourself as one of your Spheres of Influence, leaving your vulnerable body to distribute your spirit and power across that thing. 

The spread of your incarnate form is roughly the geographical extent of those who worship you, and your ability to manifest your heka while in this state is dependent on the intensity of that worship. You may be harmed in this form by actions which affect your incarnate nature: pouring pollutants into the river while you are the river would be like poisoning you. If you were war, the nations declaring a peace treaty would rob you of much power. 

Likewise, reducing the spread of your worshippers or preventing your worship would reduce how broadly you could extend yourself and the magnitude of the magical acts possible while incarnate.

Eg: A god viewed as the sea by a nation might become all the ocean visible from that land, but if the worship was merely casual, the god-as-the-ocean-incarnate would barely be able to do anything the ocean wouldn’t naturally do, even with great exertions of power.

A Neter of The Third Door In Duat might only have an incarnate form of that very singular door, but if they were intensely worshipped by a fanatical cult, that door might easily manifest all kinds of unnatural powers when the god uses their heka, opening onto unknown places and appearing in the dreams of mortals so their dreaming spirit could travel into Duat to meet the ghosts of their deceased family, and then return when they awoke."
726,,600,Dual God,Egyptian Mythology,Transformation ,"Like the other civilizations of the time, the Egyptians rarely denied the existence of any god, even if they already had one who ruled over the same thing. Instead they sometimes preferred to worship two or more gods going by different names as aspects of the same deity, or later, for one deity to take on the responsibilities of the other as the lesser’s power waned.

Firstly, if you are worshipped as separate gods, by different names or for different aspects or spheres of influence, your worshippers are pooled together to determine the godly might of all your different aspects.

That is, if a hundred people worship you as the god of a river, and a hundred people worship you as the god of reeds, your power over both the river and the reeds is that of a god with two hundred worshippers, even though some of these worshippers may be the same.

Secondly, you may merge with another willing god, mingling the two aspects each of you represent and thus the new, merged entity will have the power of each of you combined. This merge cannot normally be reversed, so both you and the other god should consider this carefully. You aren’t limited to a single merging – some gods through the Two Kingdom’s history will evolve many times in this manner."
727,,600,Jumper-Thing,Marvel Zombies,Transformation ,"Less Ben Grimm, more Ted Sallis. You are no longer a being made out of flesh, if you were one before. You are made of plants, a sentient collection of algae, mud, moss, and weeds wrapped around a frame of roots. You’ve got the standard set of super strength and durability, but you’re a lot more than that. Even if something does manage to pierce your body, it might just pass through or lodge in your body without harm, and failing that, you’ll regenerate. Add the fact that your nervous system has become decentralized and spread out through your body, and you’re near-impossible to put down for good. And you’re immortal. Your plant-based body has become somewhat mutable, allowing you to shapeshift. You can elongate limbs, have your body act in a liquid like fashion to ooze through barriers, create wings and blades, and more. Plants respond to your will, allowing you to manipulate both your body and surrounding flora.

Finally, you’ve got some empathetic capabilities. While you’re not Professor X or Jean Grey, you have a potent sense for emotions, and can quickly zero in on their source - especially if they’re strong, negative emotions such as anger, hate, or fear. Speaking of which, one last thing. In the presence of fear, your body produces a sort of chemical that ignites when you’re in contact with anyone who’s feeling the emotion."
728,,600,Insanity of the Other,Black★Rock Shooter,Transformation ,"The juggernaut of the broken star tramples over all.

When a Otherself’s real self becomes traumatized from directly witnessing the actions of their Otherself, typically after killing or brutally maiming the Otherself of their friend or loved ones, the connection between them becomes a destructive feedback loop of continuous on-rushing grief and guilt as the real self believes that were the one that did that, if only for a moment, but it is enough to shatter the Otherself’s own sanity in the process, a usually impossible process, that turns the Otherself into a horrifically powerful juggernaut that could possibly even destroy the entire Otherworld.

Whether your real self witnessed something similar or not is up to you, but in either case, you may enter an ‘insanity’ mode where your form changes as well as your color motifs (typically purple but it’s up to you) and alongside that all of your abilities, perks, and items that you have on you take on an ‘insane’ bent and become vastly more powerful in the process, whether that insanity is more destructive... or constructive is up to you though you can switch the ‘theme’ of the insanity every-time you go into the mode.

As a baseline, your durability, and strength increase massively, you become a walking mountain able to take an unbelievable amount of wounds and keep moving on like it is nothing, in this mode only hits that would completely obliterate your body have any chance of killing you, anything less and you will walk it off no matter how impossible it may seem, as well, you feel absolutely no pain and think nothing of ripping off a nearly cut off arm with the nerves still functioning if its impeding your way or if regenerating an entirely new one would be faster than letting it heal back while hanging on. You do not stop, you do not tire, your stamina is limitless while in this form and unable to be exhausted by any means.

This insanity also impedes any attempts to mentally control or possess you, even when it isn’t active, you’re immune to being possessed by any sort of method or power and are highly resistant from being mind-controlled or calmed down if you do not wish it.

This form is not permanent and exhausts itself after an hour, but the amount of havoc you can bring about in that time is simply staggering, after being used you will have to wait at-least a day before using it again... unless you’ve some way of using it more, there may be ways after this jump to increase the time within it.

Acting insane is mostly optional, but this perk will certainly help you in doing so"

By taking this, you’ve reached that realisation and transformation, able to exist entirely as a soul yet retain the benefits of a mind and body.

You as well seem to have gained a replica of Reinhard’s form, though adjusted to fit your own image, as your new body. A peerless construction with all the natural durability of Reinhard himself, as he is as a man, and then layered with countless protective spells by the magician Cagliostro. Resistant to both physical and spiritual attacks, to supernatural abilities of all different kinds and of any kind of negative effect that might harm this body or the soul interred within. It is not immune to harm, Reinhard himself is powerful but not yet a God, yet your body will still find that anything less than the force of a blow that could tear apart the Earth’s crust will fail to scratch it. Even the Three Commanders would not be able to actually harm you, though you could still be imprisoned as this body grants nothing but protection. Abilities that do not work directly, such as those that simply destroy absolutely anything they touch, will still harm you and those with power equal to Reinhard’s or beyond will bypass your protections as well. However, you will always retain these protections and they will even grow with you as you become more powerful, even if you do not do so through the power of Ewigkeit. "

Someone only equal to a lower ranking member of the LDO, such as Kei Sakurai, could become strong enough to challenge one of the Three Commanders in a one to one fight with just this transformation.

Whilst not yet a High God in rank, you have gained this innate ability and mastery over both of these new forms. You are able to take on the Second Phase and the Third Phase form. Each grants a progressively more massive boost to both your physical abilities as well as your life energy powers. The Second Phase grants you a more divine form, fitting to your own personal theme, whilst the Third Phase twists this into a monstrous visage, more akin to a wrathful God then an ordinary divinity. Whilst each of these forms drain your energy faster than normal, you excel at managing this cost and can stay in the Second Phase for hours at a time and the Third Phase for close to a single hour, much more than any of your elder brethren.

Boosted: A true god remains divine no matter his form. Once that spark was placed in your soul, it wouldn't leave no matter what you become or what you do. In fact, it's become rather useful that it won't leave you as your Phases aren't quite so limited. You're able to force these Phases to activate with other transformation effects, pushing them into a second and more divine form that possesses much greater power, though at the cost of great drain on your energy while active. You are even able to go to a Third Phase, as monstrous as normal and possessing even more power, though the drain is also increased.

Rather, think of the body you are in as a lesser, sealed version of your true magnificence. When it’s time to go all out, you can release the seal on your body and take your real form. Ten times as large as your normal body, this true form enhances your physical abilities and any powers that rely on your life energy immensely, enough to easily turn the tables when you’re being pushed to the brink of defeat by a foe much stronger then you are. However, the lengthy time you have spent without this true form renders it a tiresome thing to stay in and it will be a few years of practise before you can stay in it indefinitely.

Boosted: There's no need to ever fight alone again, not now that you have yourself with yourself. You are able to summon your True Form not as a transformation but as a separate being, a Charyeok connected to you that will aid you and fight alongside you. They're you in every way except them being ten times as big, rather more powerful in the physical and life energy departments and that they follow your lead without dissent. If hurt or destroyed, they'll take a week or so to slowly regenerate to full. They can be dismissed or summoned at will, like any Charyeok.

737,,600,Worm That Walks,Fate/Stay Night,Transformation ,"Centuries ago now, one man discovered a form of immortality that approached the perfect ideal so many strove for. A pair of the ability to take life from others to extend his own lifespan and to split himself into countless bodies to make violent death almost impossible. But he failed to account for what the passing of time would do to his mind and soul and thus he rotted to a wretched facsimile of the great Magus he once was. But what Makiri Zolgen, also known as Matou Zouken, failed to do, you gained in truth. You've become a lich of sorts, one formed of the bodies of dozens of pests, such as worms, spiders, rats, snakes or a similar sized mundane creature, though these are twisted so as to obviously be magical and/or monstrous versions of the mundane being. Each of these bodies is a magically enhanced Familiar totally under your control, stronger than any natural version of itself, and each serves as a phylactery for you that you can use the senses and body of as if it were your one, all at once. As long as even a single one of these pests survive, so too do you. You may also uses these pests to drain the life energy from other living beings and extend your own lifespan in exchange. You will not experience the spiritual rot Zouken did but your mind has no particular protection against the hazards he faced, at least with this perk alone. 

Taking this perk with Worm Farm allows you to count, if they are the same type of familiar as what you have chosen here, every 'Worm' in your farm as being part of this perk's effects. 

Boosted: Worm That Walks now allows you to include other types of beings as your special sort of familiars. Any non-sapient being may be, with an extensive ritual, turned fully into one of your familiars as described in the base perk, including all benefits and acting as phylacteries for your life. The stronger and/or larger the familiar, the more of your soul must be imbued into them for them to act as familiars and if they are too much for your spirit, the ritual to convert them will not work. Sapient beings too may be turned into phylacteries as described previously but they do not receive any other effect from the process and still require a matching amount of your soul to their power. You should be careful in doing this to make sure there are plans in place to restore you to physical form, because you will be little more than a disembodied spirit bound to the area of the sapient familiar if they are all you have left. And beware, for your soul can only be divided so many times.

738,,600,Trance,Final Fantasy IX,Transformation ,"With a surge of emotion, and appropriate demonstrative flair, you too can enter the state that the people of Gaia and Terra call “Trance”. Properly described, at the moment an individual’s emotions swell up to a breaking point, it transforms into energy, shifting one’s appearance and unleashing a torrent of power.

In Trance, you will end up picking a single skill family or trait line, which gets enhanced significantly – perhaps changing in appearance, or greatly amplifying in power – though the fundamental basis of the subject to be modified will remain unchanged.

Well, caught up in the tidal wave of passion, while you’re in Trance, you can’t be affected by attempts to sway your mind, be it mind control or mental manipulation."
739,,600,Star Spirit: Living Celestial Body,Avesta of Black and White,Transformation ,"Everything breathes with life in the universe of the Left and the Right. And that life isn’t limited to plants and animals, as even the celestial bodies that all the other lifeforms use to grow on and sustain themselves from have a life of their own. But life and sentience are not always the same thing. As such, the occurrence of a celestial body developing a full ego and turning into a Star Spirit is incredibly rare, even in the massive universe of Black and White.

But once a celestial body achieves this state, the resulting being is one of terrible might, a colossus that even the upper echelons of both the Good and Evil are often wary to challenge. The most common type of Star Spirit is that of a planet who gains sentience and care for their native populations, governing it as gods. After all, for a Star Spirit, the beings walking over their surface are part of their body (World), and as such neglecting them would be as neglecting oneself. But solitary Star Spirits are also a possibility, and even predatory ones who feast upon other celestial bodies are known to exist.

As a Star Spirit, you have two bodies that exist at the same time: Your Soul Body and your Star Body. Your Star body is the most powerful one in physical terms, for it is the entirety of the celestial body that you embody. You can hear and see everything that happens in the confines of your ‘body’, as well as manipulating the world through an ‘Authority’, granting powers to others, or unleashing a special mighty power in your area of action. It is a power equivalent to a miniature version of the Avesta, but limited to the domain of your body. No being that has benefitted from the Star Spirit’s bounty, such as living on their land or breathing their atmosphere, can hope to defy the Authority of the Star Spirit. As a power that can be compared to a small-scale usage of the Law of the Godhead, only those with such exceptional powers such as a Demon King’s Power of Ego may hope to delay or resist the usage of your Authority. However, this ability won’t reach the same degree of ‘absoluteness’ outside your domain, even if it is still quite potent. As power that is tied to your very soul, it will also get more potent outside your domain as you grow stronger, either by the use of a Commandment or via other methods foreign to this universe.

Your Soul Body, or Astral Body, exists as a manifestation of your very own ego or self. Manifesting your Soul Body is an ability similar to the creation of sensories by the Gods in nature, allowing you to interact with the smaller creatures that roam your larger Star Body. However, it is different in nature and result. As would be expected, this body brings changes in how a Star Spirit fights. Given its nature and purpose, the Soul Body is always going to represent a loss in physical power, for the scale has been reduced too much. But this concentration brings a boon when it comes to special powers, such as Commandments or Authorities, which are magnified in this state.

Generally, this body is that of an animal or humanoid being of a respectable size, but in some cases this body can still manifest as one of quite a gargantuan scale, such as a colossal bird that can house an entire city on its back, or a tree the size of a mountain range. Furthermore, it would even be possible to maintain this large soul body and then create even smaller humanoid avatars separated from the larger body.

It should be noted that the loss of either body is equivalent to death for the Star Spirit. For it can neither survive without its physical body, nor can it manage to keep functioning as a Star Spirit after its ego has been annihilated, becoming a mindless husk. Finally, all Star Spirits are capable of instant teleportation through the entire universe. A vestige from their true origin that may even predate the current Law of Black and White.

You may decide whether you were a natural-born Star Spirit, or whether you killed a previous Star Spirit and gained all their Authority and Star Body. Regardless of your choice, the power offered by this option alone remains the same.

Optionally, if you have already acquired a celestial body that you can bring around during your journeys, you may freely import them as your Star Body."
740,,600,The 72 Jumpers,Fate/Grand Order,Transformation ,"As great as the power of one can be, there’s never a reason to not go for more. The power of seventy two at once? That’s a lot scarier. You can combine your body with other beings of the same type of being as you, such as other humans or demons if you are a human or demon, and exist as an amalgam of your bodies, minds and souls. Within this combined mass, each individual still exists separately and may choose how their portions act. Only by proving to be the dominant will can you control this amalgamated form and all the mighty power it will have available. Those who join this hive mind body must do so willingly and will be able to push to control the body or even just a part of it if they disagree with you or desire to be in control. While there is no limit on the number of beings that you may combine with in this fashion, each being will add a little more strain to whoever is controlling the body as the leader. Too much and it may all fall apart. At the end of your jump, any being that is not already a companion is split off from you and sent back to stay in this world as you leave for another. Companions may stay as part of you, even beyond the active limit, but those beyond the limit are instantly sent to stasis if they are separated from your mass in any way.

Boosted: So long as you are able to get them to acknowledge you as being the rightful king and leader of the hive, you are able to permanently subsume those who do such into your being, fully or partially. You may take as much from them into yourself as you please. You could leave them as nothing but voices in your head as you take their body, memories and powers for yourself or strip them of even that. If you wish, you may also relinquish this back to them or to another being that has joined your collective, though you may not give away anything that was not gained through this method.

741,,600,Book Entity Physiology,Bibliomania,Transformation ,"Like mentioned in the beginning, humans aren’t the only species in this world and now due to the experiments done to copy the sealed beast and make the Books like Serpent you have been changed by them. Unlike Serpent you're not naturally a book and instead a human turned into a Book Entity, similar to the original beast in a way. What this does is give you several abilities and forms. First of all you now have 3 base forms you can switch between at will, a purely human form with will typically be who you where before becoming a book entity, a Book form with is effectively just normal book made of paper, metal and leather work for an intricate design that evokes who you are, though the book form can’t move on its own, it can perceive the world around it and is roughly 200 times more durable than it should be even with the the weakest part of your book form the paper is actually a metallic paper composite as flexible and textured like real paper but as durable as titanium even before the durability boost. Lastly you have a beast form which will initially be a form that is beastly yet evocative of your own personality though typically having a set of wings and second set of arms. You can change your form at will somewhat but your default beast form is what you start with and will instinctively be one you are comfortable with. The beast form isn’t as powerful or large as Serpent when he’s freed but you can grow over time and by feeding overtime to match and even exceed the beast that started the Apocalypses scale. You’d only be the size of a 2 story building at first but like I said that can change. Your abilities will seem to scale to your size as well so people will be shocked at you being as fast as you are strong when in beast form.

Now for abilities, you first gain the ability to absorb beings into you and break them down entirely into information and power which allows you to improve as well as gain all their powers, skills and abilities added onto your own as well as increase your size proportional to the absorbs strength and your own(Any entity not stronger than 10% your full power). It only took Serpent 666 normal humans to be free and the size of a multistory building.

Unlike Serpent you have the unique capability of expending energy to release those you have absorbed, temporarily weakening you to before you absorbed them(for a few hours), but also freeing them to live their own lives again as if you had effectively destroyed everything that made them who they are. You have no limits to how long you can wait to revive someone only if you have absorbed them and are willing.

You also have the ability to sense souls which is very useful since your absorption ability effectively eats them.

You can fire lasers of concentrated magic laser beams from any point of your body with the strongest version taking only a few seconds to charge though you can rapidfire weaker ones.

Any information you have absorbed either via learning or absorbing someone/something can be macroed allowing you to effectively have a mental button to activate spells and abilities you have even if normally it would take your full focus to activate it, though you have to consciously set up the mental macros. You no longer need to eat, drink or sleep but can if you want to and can absorb energies that you have systems of already to empower and strengthen yourself overtime.

If you encounter books that have supernatural properties/living or books that are made of superior materials to your base advanced materials, you can touch them to copy their properties adding any of their unique properties and abilities and even forms to your own book alt forms(For example you can copy Weiss from Nier gaining his abilities for you book form as well as an additional alt form thats a copy of him), This also lets you copy mundane books for alt forms if you want to disguise them.

Lastly you have an internal storage space which scales in power to yourself and starts as a 5 meter cubed empty room assuming you're a normal human before this perk, the stronger you are and the more you absorb the larger this space becomes. You can store living beings in this space if you will, in which case they gain their own room which can be anything they desire while stored, they won't age or weaken while stored but can improve themselves within the confines of their abilities while stored. At any time though you can choose to enter and exit these spaces as a shared existence clone and can either free them or eat them(Though you’d only be able to do that if you have stored 666 or more entities). You can even make it so they have to go through other peoples rooms to escape if you want to trap them, but can’t enforce effects like the Rot without other perks. See notes for further clarification."

Using everything from giant swords to materia, you routinely face down Gaia’s toughest monsters and take on Shinra’s most important assignments. Even an “average” First Class SOLDIER is a one-person army, and your skills will only grow with time. Put in a decade of work, and you might just be a match for Sephiroth.

Your Jenova-cells are unstable, and can both absorb traits and pass them along to others. Thankfully, you won’t suffer the degradation that usually comes with these genes. You can absorb biological traits and incorporate them into your form. You can also pass your own traits onto others, either imbuing them with fractions of your power or creating entire copies of yourself. This transfer is temporary, but you can choose if the target creature simply loses the gifted traits or suffers lethal degradation when the power is spent.

Your ability to absorb and adapt extends beyond innate biological features. Like the Blue Mages of old, you can learn from the spells cast by your enemies, adding them to your own repertoire. You still must survive the effects, and complex spells may require multiple exposures, but eventually you’ll turn your enemy’s tools against them.

In the day, however? You are a veritable juggernaut. Not only are most spells and weapons unable to harm you in the first place, but you are incredibly powerful, as befits a god. Select a single topic for you to be the god of, such as mountains, love, or the sea. You are a Lesser God of this domain, and gain incredible powers in manipulating this. If you were a mountain god, for instance, you could animate a pair of mountains as a colossal, golem-like body that you direct from within.

Furthermore, as a god your body is highly malleable, and you are able to reshape your body to suit your needs and circumstances. You might produce smaller entities from your flesh to attack an enemy, grow to colossal size, weaponize your tears, create additional limbs for combat, or reshape your skull into a blade to attack an enemy that approaches you. On top of these abilities, you also gain all the features of an Angel except for their ability to transform into a weapon.

For an additional -400 BP, you can instead be a High God, giving you vastly greater power than a meager Lesser God. You are now self-sustaining, and no longer need the sun to empower you.

744,,600,Giant Hand,Super Smash Bros. Brawl,Transformation ,"You are a Giant Hand, in the same vein as Master Hand and Crazy Hand.

You have the form of a massive white glove, easily dwarfing even the largest of Fighters. It is not clear how you are able to see and hear, but you are able to. You are incapable of speech, but are capable of emitting an odd sound, similar to an echoey laugh.

You are able to perform weird, species-exclusive magic by contorting your ‘hand’ in various signs. For example, by making the shape of a finger gun, you can fire an explosive projectile at your enemies. You know two or three of these tricks to begin, and may learn more over time as you practice and experiment. With time, you may even learn tricks not demonstrated by either Master Hand or Crazy Hand."
745,,600,Goliath Quake,High School DxD,Transformation ,"They do not recognize you now that you’ve BECOME HUGE! The ability of this Sacred Gear is delightfully simple - it increases the size of things. What things? Anything. You can make yourself into a giant, you can make individual body parts a bit larger, or turn a tiny chip of metal into a chunk the size of a skyscraper. In short, you can make anything building-sized and then turn it back to normal on a whim with this ability. The tallest you can make something with this Sacred Gear is the size of a modern skyscraper, though with time, perhaps this limit can grow with you. It takes the form of a handheld gong and the necessary instrument to ring it."
746,,600,Dragon,High School DxD,Transformation ,"Less of a race and more of power being given form, Dragons are an important part of this world...even if they’d rather pursue their own desires most of the time. Possessing phenomenal physical and magical power, even the ‘Normal-Class’ Dragons can drastically change the balance of power in an incident or area, and thus are treated with caution. They have a body akin to either a Western or Eastern-style dragon that can be anywhere from the size of a building or a human, which they can change at will. They can also assume custom-tailored human forms at will, often necessary to blend in. Two consistent features of your new Race that you possess includes an affinity with an element (Fire, Ice, or Lightning) and the ability to use it as an attack, as well as flight. When enraged, a dragon can enter an empowered state known as Outrage Mode, where their physical abilities increase dramatically and they become single mindedly focused on the target of their ire...though you may snap out of this at will. While Ophis, Great Red, and many other legends still stand head and shoulders above you, there is room for your power to grow...and woe to the fool who thinks ignoring you is wise. And to think, that’s before we factor in training or your Sacred Gear."
747,,600,Sun Disc,Legends of Runeterra,Transformation ,"The ancient Shurimans managed to channel the immense power of the Sun to create the Ascended, god-like beings immune to the ravages of time and wielders of powerful magic. The Sun Disk was the medium that transformed the celestial magic of the Sun into something that could be accepted by a mortal body. This is just a reproduction of the true Sun Disk, not even half the size of the original, but it possesses the same powers. Unfortunately, it’s not active. Fortunately, you’ll just need to attune to it to bring it to its maximum potential. Once you have, you can channel sunlight and transform a worthy vessel into a god. Worthy being the operative word. Not everyone can contain the immense power of the Sun, and those who don’t become monstrous half-men, half-beasts called Baccai. Be careful who you give godlike powers."

Humanoid in appearance, they had noticeably angular features, slanting eyebrows and pointed ears, as well as a feline face: they were generally tall and always slim. Most elves were more gifted with magic than the other races and had an innate knowledge of their true names, thus making them more powerful than other races. Possessing superior senses, strength, speed and they also are ageless, capable of living forever barring accident or violence."

Created in a anti-matter weapon test in the Imaginary sea just off the orbit of Space Nippon, you emerged with a mighty roar! Or you will, if you have some time. As a cosmic Kaiju, you’re already quite big and strong. Five meters tall and able to turn any weak Servant into a splat with a slap. But as long as you don’t restrain yourself, you’ll slowly but steadily grow larger and stronger, your innate magical power growing with your size. Normally it’s only a few inches each day, a meter when you’re a bit stressed, but this gets much faster when you’re in a fight. You can easily double your size in minutes when threatened and fighting your hardest, this growth continuing at speed until the enemy becomes adorably non-threatening. 

You’re even more resistant than most Servants to the dangers of space, almost totally immune to most cosmic environments, and if needed can actively reduce your own size at great speed. This does mean you lose the power that comes with that size, though. "
754,,600,MANTIS,Honkai Impact 3rd,Transformation ,"You are a MANTIS (Massively Augmented Neo-Tech Infused Soldier), a human that was integrated with Honkai Beast DNA. You were integrated with an Emperor-Class Honkai Beast of either your own design, or were integrated with an Emperor-Class Honkai Beast that an existing MANTIS was already integrated with. You have the ability to enter Active Honkai Reaction, allowing you to take the form of the Honkai Beast your genes were integrated with. This is instinctive, with you having to concentrate to suppress this. This may have additional consequences as well, such as you having a freezing body temperature if you integrate with Parvati, or you gaining animalistic traits, or something else.

Capstone Boosted: Instead of being integrated with the DNA of an Emperor-Class Honkai Beast, you were instead integrated with the DNA of a Pseudo-Herrscher Judgment-Class Honkai Beast of either your own design, or shown in canon (With Benares as an example). This, obviously, has greater consequences, significantly warping your mind due to the instincts of the Honkai Beast also carrying over due to the stronger nature of the Honkai Beast. However, you are capable of switching off any instincts it may give you in exchange for permanently changing the appearance of your human form. You can still take your Honkai Beast form and switch back to human form as normal, though.

755,,600,Distortion Effect,Library of Ruina V1.0,Transformation ,"You may emit a kind of memetic mind control that amplifies the emotions of yourself and/or those nearby. At the lowest levels it may just push one’s emotions towards happiness, anger or whatnot. But putting more intensity into the effect starts to exhibit physical changes:

● Subtle effects may change the clothes and equipment of those affected, perhaps they materialise their own weapons. Because the equipment forms from their own emotions, they know how to use them to their fullest.
● Those affected whose emotions go to extreme levels will twist and warp to match their emotion in their entirety. They might stop being human altogether.
● Continuous or excessive exposure may result in permanent changes. Requiring some psychological gymnastics to break them out of it.

At stronger levels, if you wish to try and influence what emotions one feels, you may be able to whisper words of encouragement or admonishment to those within your effects. What works or doesn’t depends entirely on your charisma and the target’s personality and willpower."
756,,600,Trance ,Final Fantasy VI,Transformation ,"In time, most Half-Espers run into a situation so stressful, overwhelming, or terrifying that they simply “overload”. They let their Esper half have full control and completely transform into a being of pure magic. It is a dangerous situation that can rapidly drain the Half-Esper’s energy to the point of death. Worst of all, with the Human side completely submerged, the Esper half begins running on instinct. Flying away in a panic or lashing out with destruction at anyone around them are both common. Without instruction on how to transform back, it is a situation that can easily end in tragedy of a dozen stripes.

Thankfully you have already received, or discovered, the method of returning to yourself. Even better, you can change back into your Esper form for a short time. Doing so allows you to access a vast reserve of magical power as well as severely enhancing any spells you cast. Especially those that fall under your Focus [Note 2]. After transforming back, you will be unable to access your “Trance” state until you have had some time to rest. Because of your unique nature, you may discover unusual additions to your form should you “Trance” while accessing non-Human Alt-Forms. Only experimentation will tell how useful these additions will be."
757,,600,JUMPER THE KING ,Thailand Mythology and Folklore,Transformation ,"Some beings in this world are just HUGE, and by purchasing this, you can be HUGE too. Like the Garuda King, your size matches that of the most majestic of mountains, being more than 2,000 km tall or long, with a physical might to match (and let you not collapse under your own weight). You can kiss the square cube law goodbye, as your mere footsteps shake the earth and your screams rattle the Heavens. Well, as impressive as you are, perhaps going into more detail would be ideal. Proportionally speaking, your might is about equal in relative terms to that of a fully trained mortal man.

Just like how humans can train to be able to easily lift their own weight, so do you have the strength to lift the no doubt mountainous tons that compose your body, and while your dexterity mainly depends on what form you even take, you’re certainly not going to be a clumsy monster. Unfortunately, due to your sheer mass you won’t be the swiftest of spirits, in terms of range of movement at least, but you’ll still be terrifyingly quick for your size, and can very much keep up with those who are less magnificently sized as you. Do beware of those brave and foolhardy enough to quest to topple you. Such heroes have an alarming track record."
758,,600,Uppati Deva,Thailand Mythology and Folklore,Transformation ,"Are you not content with mortality? Do you wish to get a taste of divinity, and learn how the very gods above live? As a unique opportunity in this world, you have the option to simply purchase being a god. As an Uppati Deva, you are a Deva from birth, and almost definitely formed spontaneously one day as most of your kin do.

So, aside from a lifespan almost ten million years long, blue skin, and at an absolute minimum a body whose health and might cannot be lesser than that of a hearty and hale human adult, what does this confer? Well, you can forget about having to shower, as your body is clean and pure, inside and out, and no mundane filth can tarnish this (this includes immunity to any mundane disease or illness). You can also change your size to quite absurd degrees, being able to shrink yourself to such a degree that 80 of your kin could fit in the width of a human hair. Unfortunately, you do still need to eat, but should you find yourself back up to the heavens lying at least 690,000 km above the four continents, unlikely to be much of an issue as you are rightfully a citizen of the gods, you’ll be able to consume divine food and drink, which is absorbed fully into your body and thus does not lead your body into producing waste.

Of course, your state isn’t static. Uniquely, you are able to ascend the divine ladder of status, in a manner of speaking, to become the ‘devyata’ of higher heavens than Catumaharajika, the lowest Heaven (and the most quiet and stable in a way). You can do this through great and meritorious deeds, and accumulating good karma in general. Do check the notes for what this even entails. Ascending to higher forms of godhood grants you greater might, spiritual and magical potency, and a greatly increased lifespan. For example, while initially you’ll have a lifespan of 9 million years, the next stage has a lifespan of 144 million years, with the next living for 576 million years, the next living for 2,304 million years, and the highest form of devahood (outside of special cases like Indra) living for 8,216 million years.

Of course, even being a perfectly virtuous person it’ll take you many years, perhaps decades, to rise to the next Heaven, but you certainly have the time even as a mundanely human sort of person to spend one or two million years doing your best to be diligent and virtuous. Perhaps, if you’re feeling responsible, you may petition to get assigned a domain to rule over. Indra assigned four devas to be the sun, moon, the twenty-seven lunar mansions, and the sidereal stars. There’s no guarantee you’ll be given any work, but there’s no shame or loss in being rejected."
759,,600,TAGER,CthulhuTech,Transformation ,"You have undergone the Rite of Sacred Union and fused with a Ta'ge symbiont to become a Tager. You now have a monsterous alt-form that has a enhanced attributes, regeneration, a special ability, and a combination of melee and ranged attacks. Your symbiont may influence your behavior for your time in this world, but if you continue on, it will cease its influence.

All Tagers have some abilities in common. They can switch into a monsterous combat form, escaping or destroying restraints as they do so. They can all cling to solid surfaces and jump large distances. They have an internal air supply that lasts about 2 hours. They are resistant to fear, can detect Dhoanoids, and can telepathically communicate to other Tagers within 1 mile. They are no longer human enough to use human sized weaponry. They all also have some degree of regeneration. Each also has a Limit Weapon that can be used once a day.

The PHANTOM is the most common Tager form. It is well-rounded with arm-blades and an arcane blast, its limit weapon is a tentacle burst. The MIRAGE is the second most common Tager. It is also well-rounded, but tends toward defense. It projects a displaced image of itself, can shoot photon blasts, and lash out with tentacles. Its limit weapon is projecting many copies of its image and swapping in to one of them. The SHADOW focuses on stealth. It has a stealth field that drains its magical reserves, can stab with its paralytic thorns or shoot them. Its limit weapon allows it to double its attack rate by teleporting around its target. The WHISPER is focused on reconnaissance. It can fly and drop distracting light bombs. Its limit is a razor wing attack. The ECHO is an amphibious Tager. It can bite, project an ink cloud, and shoot a fathom beam. Its limit weapon is a wild frenzy. The SPECTRE is an infiltrator. It can phase through objects, project withering gas, and chill with a touch. Its limit weapon is to materialize inside an enemy to rip it to shreds from within. The WIDOW focuses on ambush. It has poisonous fangs, and can shoot webbing. Its limit weapon is to coccoon its foe. There are also more powerful Exceptional Tagers. The NIGHTMARE has shoulder pods, claws, tentacles, and a powerful mystic blast limit weapon. The VAMPIRE can fly, shoot barbs, exsanguinate with a touch and has a limit weapon that causes everyone in the area to hemorrhage. The EFREET breathes fire, punches, and can call down a fiery meteor as its limit weapon.

760,,600,Dragon Form,The Song of the Nibelungs,Transformation ,"You somehow gained the ability to transform into a great and fearsome dragon. Whether this is a result of your own nature and magic, the result of a curse or of some magic object matters little. You are bigger than a house, easily able to lay on a cliff 30 fathoms high and comfortably drink from the river below. Your teeth are as long as swords, your scales tougher than steel and you can spew forth great amounts of poison and flames hot enough to turn stone glowing red.

By default you are a wingless dragon of some sort (Lindworms are en vogue I hear), but for an extra -200cp you can add wings to your form, allowing you to fly."
761,,600,Then is Heard No More,Library of Ruina,Transformation ,"Life in the City is not for everyone, or anyone really. But for a few people, it breaks their resolve completely and utterly, drowning them in despair until they simply hyper-fixate on a single desire of theirs. Those seeded with the Light who go through this process become Distortions, monsters of the mind, and failures of the ego. Perhaps for a certain fee we could make you have gone through this process, but not lose your mind (at least not, from Distorting). A chef desiring to bring new flavors to his failing restaurant might gain the ability to pull the thoughts from people's minds and cook them into delicious ones, more ready to appreciate his work. A gunman who lost faith in humanity might gain the ability to test people by firing bullets that force the victim to relive their trauma, and will surely destroy them if they fail to overcome it. A lonely photographer, shaken by the thought that none may remember them, might gain the ability to draw in and take photos of people that slowly cause all their connections to wither away along with their will to live. An aspiring professional pianist... well, you’re not getting power on his scale just yet, but suffice to say, the Distortion can cause all sorts of calamities regardless of the original focus. As you feed deeper into your despair and fulfill the one remaining desire left, you will gain more and more esoteric abilities, as well as the ability to warp the very scenery around you into a representation of your mindset.

Boosted: Perhaps you might’ve wielded the might of an EGO briefly, but then further problems surfaced, and you fell off that tightrope into the Distortion. Whatever the case, your EGO is subsumed, instead feeding all of the abilities that may have been attributed to it into your form directly.

More than that your Distortion is massively more potent now, able to take on entire high grade Fixer offices at once, and qualifying you for the status of a Star of the City, the most free beings in the world, so long as you disregard the occasional murder attempt. What’s more, even in the event that you would die, you may once per jump come back, having fallen once more into the pits of despair and had the light at your core respond, granting your distorted form even more power and new abilities, in exchange for a burning need to prove yourself by defeating whoever killed you. To fail is to invalidate your own existence and disappear, but if you succeed the power will be yours for the taking. This does of course assume that you died to some worthy foe, some rat you decide to die off to intentionally in order to power up doesn’t give the same level of raw spite, and you will find yourself reconstituted at your usual level of power.

Made by the joint effort of alchemy, soul manipulation, senjutsu, and even time powers to be created.

Superdevils, vampire progenitors, nine-tailed kitsunes, and such examples serve to illustrate a bit of your nature. You have a natural knack and talent in all things related to combat and warfare, a prodigy in the magic arts of your race, and quite capable of unlocking secret transformations or forgotten states, as well as the advantages previously mentioned. Golden child, indeed."

You may also create vampires who may develop a range of abilities different to your own.

Vampire Monarchs may choose one of the following ability sets to replace the ones detailed in the perk:

Empress: Extremely powerful hypnosis (requires eye contact and chant), invisibility and production of damaging sound-waves.

Moon: Extremely powerful healing factor, opening locks by shouting the word “pigs” enough times and the ability to paralyse the muscles of others."
765,,600,Shape-Shifter,Adventure Time,Transformation ,You are the hybrid offspring of a shape changing monster from another planet/dimension.

You are now a Warrior of Darkness, in reflection of the Warriors of Light, and the benefits of this are twofold. Firstly any of your abilities are more potent against creatures of light, and secondly you have the ability to assume the form of a guardian beast. You have a single choice from Echidna, Ahriman, Two Headed Dragon and Cerberus for your form. Each form is incredibly powerful, has a variety of special moves, and have a physical attack which causes a status ailment (Silence, Petrification, Silence and Poison respectively)."
767,,600,Six Hearted Revolver,Fate/Strange Fake,Transformation ,"While Dead Apostles have achieved a form of immortality, theirs is not a perfected form of immortality. As such, there are several among their kind that also strive to find another way to safeguard and prolong their lives beyond this. One of such crafty bloodsuckers is Dorothea, also known as Jester Karture, a descendant of the lineage of the Dead Apostle Ancestor Van-Fem. And now, both his special immortality and the knowledge of its creation are yours.

This technique allows one to conceal their true spirit origin, their soul, under a multitude of spells and six artificial spiritual origins. Thus, when you would have been truly killed after bypassing any other defenses that you may have, instead of experiencing true death, you just suffer the destruction of one of your artificial cores, before getting up again.

But this is not the end of said benefits. You can switch between Spirit Cores in a short time with a simple gesture, as long as you are not incapacitated in some way, and each of them can have different properties that will get added on top of your other existing abilities. A Spirit Core based on a magus would grant you the ability to use magecraft, while that based on a regular child would make you appear to be as a regular human with no special traits even if in other forms your magical energy would be enough to make even non-magecraft users get dizzy. Once one is destroyed, or if you wish to do so, you may procure new Spirit Origins to craft your Spirit Cores, each granting you a new face, form and powers. Usually this involves taking it from a victim by force after incapacitating them, or getting them to consent, which may not even be limited to taking the spiritual core of a human but a phantasmal beast or an even an artificial construct may also be valid choices. It should also be noted that the ritual requires the consent of the victim when the form is that of a child.

The cores usually manifest in form of a tattoo-like mark, reminiscent of a revolver’s chamber. But you may have it manifest in some other way."
768,,600,Bloodsucker,Fate/Strange Fake,Transformation ,"Also known as a hemophage or Dead Apostle, you are one of the most common kinds of vampires. Long ago, your kind was made to serve as the ‘emergency rations’ for the True Ancestors, a species of Elementals made by the Planet as a part of a covenant with the Crimson Moon. But the oldest and most powerful of your kind managed to escape this fate, and set out to make their own progeny by infecting other humans with their own ‘curse’. Whether you are related to another Vampire, or you reached this status of being via your own efforts or those of another with Magecraft, you have become quite a fearsome creature.

Either through sheer talent, quality of vessel or due to your ancient age, you are quite a powerful specimen among your kind. You are a Dead Apostle of the 7th Rank. Not only have you obtained full independence from your sire, if you had one, but you also are at the point where you may start to develop your own special powers based on your condition. Both in terms of physical abilities, magical reserves and your own special abilities, you are comparable to a low tier Servant in terms of physical combat, and mid tier one in terms of potential abilities and magical reserves. Albeit as defenders of Humanity, they have a 'type advantage' over you. You are the kind of being that both human magi and regular Church Executors would run from a fight rather than try to put you down.

The originators of your kind were imbued with the Vampiric Impulse that instills in your kind a powerful mandate to suck the blood of others. As a Dead Apostle, this is also an imperative for your continual survival, else your body degrades too much, as you are now a reanimated corpse rather than a fully living being. Not only that, but at your current state, sunlight will also hasten this deterioration. Not to the point that you will die instantly, but enough that you may not survive a day out in the sun.

At the same time, this status as the antithesis of humankind gives you a great resistance towards individual humans and their creations. Human magecraft, human tools and even the bodies of humans themselves are those for your kind to prey on. It is only when faced with abilities that are empowered by the whole of the Human Order, be it their defendants manifested as Heroic Spirits, or those wielding the power of human Faith, that the protections granted by this condition quickly shatter and great damage can be done to you."

You have walked this path, and unlike your contemporaries, such an outcome has proven to only be a boon. Not only can you use the patches of glintstone for protection, but you will find your reserves of arcane energies have been vastly improved. This also causes an increase in the potency of all of your sorceries, an effect that is doubled when applied to those related to glintstone.

Your entire body is a mass of glintstone, the color of which is up to you.

And that the Former Empires had made their worlds into earthly paradises before seeking others. The legacy of mankind’s adaptability is made manifest in the sheer potential of your form. Your body is much more receptive and compatible with transhuman experiments than the vast majority of men. It’s on you to develop and innovate such transhumanist efforts, but as you reach beyond your limits what seemed beyond your reach might be will within mastery soon. Such procedures may still tax you greatly should you be only human, but have a strong tendency to go smoothly and keep the rest of you functional enough to receive more implants safely- and even have the results work better than initially anticipated. So implant as many cybernetics as you want, feel free to carve up your soul to figure out which bit masters theurgy-and if you ever rediscover some of the methods used to create the Made Gods of old from human champions, you’d be an ideal subject for your own uplifting plan."
771,,600,Spirit Restoration,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Transformation ,"You have gained the ability to restore Spirits to a physical form. The target of this power must be willing in order for it to work. Restored Spirits are capped at the power level of an average Fighter. A Giga Bowser restored Spirit would be about the same as a regular Fighter Bowser, and a restored Arceus is certainly not almighty, instead more comparable to a Fighter Mewtwo. Restoring Spirits takes energy proportional to the power of the Spirit’s new form. Restored Spirits will gain the ability to change back and forth between their restored form, and their Spirit form as they wish, so don’t hesitate to use this ability whenever you like.

In future jumps, you may use this power on similar entities, such as ghosts. This restores them to a physical form, or grants them a new one if they never possessed one in the first place. The cap on the power of the new form does not apply to non-Spirits.

Any Spirit that was already a follower prior to restoration will remain so, and while this power will not grant any loyalty, if a Spirit was already loyal to you, they remain so. Once a Spirit has been restored, they will lose the ability to be “enhanced” (see On Enhanceable Spirits in the Notes section for details); a Spirit must be enhanced prior to restoration, or not at all."
772,,600,Giga Jumper,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Transformation ,"You have gained access to a truly special transformation. In this transformed state, you are much larger than normal, and take on a wilder appearance than usual.

It isn’t just your size that has changed. In this state, you are quite a bit stronger, and every one of your perks and powers are noticeably more powerful than usual (this boost does not apply to this perk, and whilst perks/power effects that increase the strength of your perks and powers are boosted, this perk is uniquely unaffected by any boost to any such effect it causes). You gain ‘Super Armor’, meaning any damage you take does not cause you to either flinch or get knocked back. As if this wasn’t enough, you may spontaneously develop new, transformation-exclusive powers that are a twisted mirror of what you have now. For example, someone who could breathe fire may develop the ability to freeze their enemies with physical attacks.

To begin with, you will be able to hold this transformation for a very brief amount of time, perhaps enough to deliver a single punch. As you extend the length of this transformation through training, you will discover a complication with it. While you remain in the Giga transformation, you will find it harder to resist your natural impulses, especially any impulses to destroy. If you are not careful, you may find yourself reduced to a raging monster, until the transformation naturally expires, or someone else can knock some sense into you."

You have the form of a massive white glove, easily dwarfing even the largest of Fighters. It is not clear how you are able to see and hear, but you are able to. You are incapable of speech, but are capable of emitting an odd sound, similar to an echoey laugh.

You are able to perform weird, species-exclusive magic by contorting your ‘hand’ in various signs. For example, by making the shape of a finger gun, you can fire an explosive projectile at your enemies. You know two or three of these tricks to begin, and may learn more over time as you practice and experiment. With time, you may even learn tricks not demonstrated by either Master Hand or Crazy Hand."
774,,600,Grafted Dragon,Elden Ring - Limgrave,Transformation ,"The embodiment of the power that still remained in the dragon's head that was grafted to Godrick the Grafted. The wielder's arm will take the form of a small dragon, sprouting sharp dragon fangs at the fist and grant you access to its sharp senses. This weapon cannot be two-handed. Grant the small dragon a fleeting glimpse of life and thrust it skyward, spewing flames over a wide frontward area."
775,,600,Grafted Scion of the Golden Lineage,Elden Ring - Limgrave,Transformation ,"The horrible art of grafting originates from the First Elden Lord, which has devolved into attaching the body parts onto one’s own flesh, making their victim’s strength into their own. Like the Lord of Stormveil, you too are a master of this practice, possessing all of the masterful surgical expertise needed to create all manner of biological abominations. This is especially beneficial for you, as there is no chance for your flesh rejecting what you strengthen it with.

Boosted: With a shard of the Elden Ring within you, your craft has become something even more. It is not just the physical that you can graft, but the spiritual and magical as well. Grafting a sorcerer’s parts onto yourself would see your proficiency with the arcane improving, to say nothing if you could interact with souls themselves. Not only this, but all modifications you do upon yourself will become fiat-backed.

776,,600,To Consume Is To Become,Elden Ring - Limgrave,Transformation ,"You have gained much power through the consuming of dragon hearts, but it is not only the magic of those you have eaten that you wish to take for yourself. You are now capable of altering your body in order to gain all of the best traits of the dragons you consume, though your form will remain largely the same. Taking on scales tougher than steel, claws that can rend stone, even gaining a pair of wings for flight.

Boosted: It is not enough to take on their abilities, but fully taking on their forms as well. With each dragon heart you consume, you gain a new draconic transformation, which you can switch between at will. Additionally, injuries will not carry over between these forms, allowing you to change between them unless something manages to to kill you, or all of your forms are too injured to do anything.

777,,600,Primal Power,The Owl House,Transformation ,"You are no mere demon, you are a powerful apex predator. Whether you have the terrifying physical strength of a slitherbeast, the shapeshifting and magic-eating powers of a greater basilisk, or some other incredible set of traits, your demonic abilities set you apart from lesser creatures. Taking this option also allows you to become a prehistoric species of demon, such as a Stonesleeper. See the Notes section for additional details.

When choosing a species of powerful demon to become, you have a bit of artistic license. While you can opt for extremes in the physical or magical abilities, most demons seen in the show have a mix of both. If you need comparisons or upper limits, consider the powerful creatures we’ve seen thus far in the show. Creatures like the Selkidomus or Princess the Hand-Dragon would represent the cap on physical size and power, while creatures like Vee and the Greater Basilisks represent the most potent magical abilities demons have demonstrated. You could even be a house demon like Hooty, who is technically a kind of Bug (Worm) Demon. Use the show as your guideline and fanwank responsibly."
778,,600,Grimwalker,The Owl House,Transformation ,"You’re an oddity, even amongst the fantastic creatures of the Boiling Isles. You’re a grimwalker, an artificial lifeform crafted from a galderstone, palistrom wood, and several other rare ingredients. While your outward appearance was made to mimic that of another individual, your internal physiology is significantly different. You may be another of Belos’ experiments, or you may have been constructed by another powerful witch, but the process has imbued you with some significant capabilities.

You’ve been fine tuned for physical fitness, making you especially strong and agile for your age. Your unique biology also makes you incredibly durable, letting you take far more punishment than normal before your body gives out. You can operate without sleep for extended periods of time, you’re immune to boiling temperatures, and anything that doesn’t destroy your brain or galdorstone heart can be eventually recovered from. Finally, your galdorstone core enhances any magic you possess, letting you impress even the coven heads at your peak.

Though all grimwalkers bear the above characteristics, each individual is constructed in the image of a specific person. If you spend 400cp on this perk, you are an inexact copy of your progenitor. Your magic may allow you to replicate some of their abilities, but not their strongest ones. However, if you spend 600cp on this perk, you gain not only their appearance but their special traits as well. In future worlds, you may apply this perk to an existing character. See the Notes section for added details.

By taking the Grimwalker perk, Jumpers gain the option to insert as a clone of an existing character in both this jump and subsequent settings. While both tiers of this perk grant an identical appearance to the selected individual, the 400cp tier of this perk only grants minor supernatural traits while the 600cp tier of this perk grants all of your progenitor’s abilities. For example, if one were to insert as a clone of Superman, taking the lower tier would let you mimic his ability to collect energy from sunlight while the upper tier would give you his full powerset. These powers would still start at their weakest state and require training to grow, but you’d be as close to a perfect copy as possible."
779,,600,Fairy,Cinderella,Transformation ,"Embodiments of hope, fairies typically require a person who holds great hope in their heart in order to properly manifest. Fortunately, purchasing this option will mean you are permanently manifested and aren’t dependent on the hope of others to survive.

Despite your unusual nature, you look just as a human would. What sets you apart is your impressive magical abilities. While some of these can be done by you at any time, most of your magic is dependent on the use of your Magic Wand, which comes free with this species.

The Fairy Godmother demonstrated the following magical abilities:
• She possesses a pocket dimension or equivalent, which she had her wand stored in when she met Cinderella. Besides appearing before Cinderella, this is the only magic that she did not use her wand for.
• Lighting: She used her magic to generate light around a pumpkin before she transformed it.
• Transformation: Using magic, the Fairy Godmother transformed a variety of animals and objects. She turned a large pumpkin into a carriage, four mice into horses, a horse into a human coachman and a dog into a human footman. She also transformed Cinderella’s dress into a new one complete with glass slippers. With the exception of the glass slippers all of these effects expired at midnight, demonstrating all but the most minor of these transformations are limited.

In order to cast spells with her wand, the Fairy Godmother says “Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo”. You can
choose to use the same magic words, or have your own nonsense words that activate your magic. If you like, you can also fanwank the existence of a few other magical abilities that are within the same range of power and are appropriate to a Disney fantasy setting.

In A Twist in Time, the way that magic works is changed a lot. Others can use fairy magic simply by stealing the wand and using the magic words themselves. Magic doesn’t work on metal, instead rebounding onto another target. It also added a large amount of power to the magic, including:
• Creating objects wholesale instead of turning other objects into them.
• “Half-transforming” animals, such as Lucifer being turned into a duck with a cat’s head.
• Turning the Fairy Godmother into a statue with no time limit.
• Transforming Anastasia into a physical copy of Cinderella, a specific member of a species vs. that species in general, and with seemingly no time limit.
• Teleportation of both self and/or others, within the range of a palace at least.
• Altering the Prince’s memories of his dance with Cinderella, so that he thought he danced with Anatasia. Physical contact with Cinderella broke this effect, likely due to the “true love” in play.
• Most significantly, time travel. Lady Tremaire and the step-sisters were able to travel back in time over a year, returning to the place they were at the time with the memories they had picked up in the interim (and retaining the wand). Besides them, only the Fairy Godmother was aware of this change (whether it was because it was her magic, or simply because she is a magical being is not explained).

For the purposes of this jump, those who purchased the Fairy species cannot have their magic used against them by stealing their wand, and don’t have to worry about magic rebounding off metal. However, they do not receive the level of power only shown in a Direct-to-DVD sequel made 57 years later, that also happens to conflict with the other Direct-to-DVD film it is apparently a sequel of. This is a soft-cap, not a hard one; if you have some other methods of boosting your magical power, this ruling doesn’t interfere with those."

781,,600,The Fourth Good Fairy,Disney’s Sleeping Beauty,Transformation ,"Oh my! You’re not just any good fairy, you’re one of THE good fairies, or at least a fairy on their level! You possess incredible magic, and while it may not be as direct or flashy as Maleficent’s, used in the right way it might just spell her downfall. First of all, you possess the ability to create objects formed from pure goodness, like the Sword of Truth or the Shield of Virtue, the latter of which could block even the flames of Maleficent’s dragon form, and the former of which could harm and even kill her. On top of this, you are able to grant blessings to others, though you may only bestow one gift per person. A gift of unnatural beauty, a gift of heavenly song...or a gift of a lessened curse. A curse of death from the likes of Maleficent might be too powerful for you to do anything but lessen it to a deep sleep broken by true love’s kiss, but a lesser curse might undone entirely! Do keep in mind, your powers can only be used for good, to spread joy."
782,,600,Bed of Life,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Transformation ,"Life is as abundant as it is chaotic, there being as many variations of a single type of creature as there are stars in the night sky. Some do, however, end up getting the short end of the stick, feeling more cursed by the life they were given rather than blessed. As one so connected to Life, it is within your power to change it, being capable of manipulating the physical forms of others to an extent. You could make them hardier, more resistant to harsh environments, extend their lifespan, and with experience, you could even combine the characteristics of many types of creatures into one chimeric existence.

Boosted: Yours is not just the power to lord over Life and its functions, but the chaotic energies of fire itself. You can imbue others with this Chaos, transforming them into what would eventually be called demons. They shall be more powerful than they were before, and find themselves possessing their own, natural pyromantic abilities, as well as a high resistance towards fire and heat.

783,,600,Indomitable,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Transformation ,"No longer a mere drake, you have become a true Everlasting Dragon, scales like stone and just as unyielding. Not only are you larger, stronger, but your durability has been greatly increased, such that you could fall from the very heights of the Archtrees and land on your head without feeling anything more than a tingle, with most weapons being similarly effective against you. Your scales, however, do nothing to protect you from lightning, as it can peel away your scales, revealing the vulnerable flesh underneath.

Boosted: You are not a common dragon, but a Lord amongst dragons. You are more akin to a walking mountain than a living creature, with every step shaking the ground beneath you. Harming you would be like attacking one as well, outright ignoring most conventional weaponry. Your scales have also changed, now more resilient against lightning than before.

784,,600,Great Beast,Dark Souls: Covenants,Transformation ,"You may not have been a standard undead at all, instead being something similar to the fiercest protector of Artorias’ grave, the Great Grey Wolf Sif. You are a mighty beast, larger than some buildings, possessing exceptional agility and grace. Any and all attacks you deal are highly deadly to any form of sapient life, though this is especially true if they belong to mankind.

Boosted: You are not a single beast, but instead a great chimera, being the combination of six animals. Due to your magical creation, you will possess abilities based on the various animals that make you up. A boar’s hide could offer a great increase to your durability, a snake's venom could easily burn through a person in a minute, while a lion’s roar could shatter stone.

You were one of those souls, having been infused with the very essence of Life, becoming a powerful demon. Not only are you much more physically powerful, but you have become immune to fire and lava, both mundane and magical.

Boosted: You are no mere demon, but something on par with the Son of Izalith, the Ceaseless Discharge. You are a towering figure capable of secreting large quantities of lava from your skin, and your very presence is capable of melting steel just by being near it, to say nothing of what would happen to living flesh.

786,,600,Nail of Helena        ,Hellsing,Transformation ,"Of the most holy of artefacts, a nail from the cross. This sacred piece was one of several kept locked safely away beneath the Vatican until it seems they decided you had need of it. Stored in a protective box, the merest touch of the nail to an unholy creature of darkness will set them alight with divine flames. Even Dracula himself would cry out in agony from this white hot fire. But were a faithful man to pierce his own heart with the nail, he’d become a weapon against the devil like which is rarely seen. In the eyes of some, a ‘monster of god’. To others, an angel descended from heaven into the body of man. If there’s a difference. 

On piercing your heart, the nail will rapidly produce enormous amounts of vines that spread through and out from your body. Replacing much of your mass and remaining under your control, the vines are powerful tools. Even if your head is destroyed, the vines will rapidly reform it, and they have more than enough strength to tear a vampire in half. They can easily slice or impale foes, block powerful firearms or wield many individual weapons at once. The strength of the vines will greatly increase your speed, even well above that of a true vampire’s, and the regeneration will ignore effects that might hinder it’s speed. As one with the holy nail, your merest touch will be like being pierced with the nail, spreading the holy flames to any evil you come into contact with. 

The only weakness is the destruction of your heart, still pierced by the nail within your chest, which will end the effect and possibly your life if you cannot survive without the vines. Unlike it’s normal curse, of turning a man into a monster of god, you will be able to somewhat retain your mental state under this transformation and even willingly remove the nail without fading to ashes."
787,,600,Werekin,Hellsing,Transformation ,"A warrior of a dying race, few of the Werekin are left alive these nights. Of them, the most well known is the Werewolves but all possess similar attributes. Their physical abilities greatly outmatch even a True Vampire, with tough bodies that can easily withstand massive explosions without harm or deal blows that leave powerful demons in bloody messes. Their sensory abiliites, particularly their reflexes, are similarly heightened in comparison to a vampires. As with most demonic creatures, this race is biologically immortal and will never die or fade from age. 

Like their counterparts, the wolves have extreme healing abilities and few wounds remain an issue for long. Unlike vampires, the werekin have almost no known weaknesses. Holy weapons are as ineffective as anything else and only silver can seriously harm them. But with their powerful bodies and regeneration it can take a direct shot to the heart with a silver bullet to put one down. Complicating this further still is their prowess with shapeshifting. Not only are they able to take on the form of their animal side, often in an immense and monstrous beast or half-man form that confers further abilities, but they can also transform into intangible mist to evade any attack. 

As implied above, this option is not limited only to werewolves. Other animals may be chosen, which may result in different focuses for their abilities or entirely new kinds of powers. A werebear may have much greater strength at the loss of the wolf’s natural agility, whereas a werehawk may have unnatural sight that surpasses a vampire’s third eye. "

790,,600,That’s No Mountain,Atlantis - The Lost Empire,Transformation ,"Let’s not mince words- taking this perk will make you huge, comparable to a small mountain in size. The Kraken, whose tentacles alone are a quarter of a mile long and whose main body was compared to an undersea mountain, is one example of the sheer size this perk operates on- another example is Ymir and Surtr, the two giants that Erik Hellstrom created to enact Ragnarock, each of whom was easily over three hundred feet in height. At this point, the only “being” in this world that could challenge you aside from those three is the Leviathan, the mechanical beast guarding Atlantis from intrusion."
791,,600,Water Dragon,Raya and the Last Dragon,Transformation ,"You are a water dragon, creatures revered by the humans of Kumandra. How you managed to survive the events of 500 years ago is unclear, as is what you were up to in the time period between then and now. Regardless, your very presence is likely to shake things up around here.

As a water dragon, you have four legs, and you run on all fours. However, you can also stand up on your back legs and use your front claws as hands. You have a furry body, with a mane of hair and a horn emerging from your head. You also have a tail, which you have a great deal of control over. Typically, water dragons possess blue, green, or purple colourations.

Most of the time, water dragons are limited to the ground. When it is raining however, water
dragons are also able to “run” through the air, causing splash-like magical effects from their feet.

Water dragons possess strong magic, which they can wield to repel the Druun, as well as other
creatures born from negative emotions. The magic of a single dragon cannot destroy a Druun, merely force it to move away, and does not prevent the Druun from turning a dragon into stone should one can come into contact with it. Each dragon also has a unique piece of magic; you can choose to copy one of the demonstrated unique magics, or to have something original, provided it remains within the scope of the demonstrated powers, and is at least loosely associated with water. See Unique Dragon Magic in the Notes section for more information. If many water dragons gather in one place, they can resurrect another water dragon that was recently killed nearby.

Water dragons are able to give away this magic by storing it in a gem. If multiple dragons are present during the gem creation process, they can create a single larger gem. A water dragon can use the gem to gain access to the unique water dragon magic stored inside. If four or more dragons added their magic to the gem, and a great deal of mutual trust is demonstrated, the gem can be activated to immediately banish the Druun from Kumandra, and restore all those turned to stone. In other settings, this will have a large banishing effect on similar creatures, which might be resisted by those powerful enough. At the end of each jump, a gem you have created or contributed to will automatically disappear and return its power back to its respective owners. Post-chain, you can optionally do this every ten years. You can also retrieve your donated magic earlier by touching your gem and absorbing your own magic back into you (this will either cause the gem to vanish, or to reduce it in size if others contributed to it).

Finally, once per jump, if you use an extreme amount of magic, you can choose to melt into water instead of suffering the normal harm that would be inflicted on you. This water will make its way to the end of a river where it will wait. Being in this state means you are effectively “asleep” and can be woken up if someone finds your water and performs a special ceremony, restoring your form in the process. At the end of each jump, you will be automatically restored if you were still stuck in this water state. Post-chain, you can turn to water once every ten years, and will be automatically restored after ten years stuck in that state.

Here are the unique dragon magics shown in Raya and the Last Dragon:
• Sisu is a strong swimmer, and can even move a large boat at high speed by attaching herself to the bottom of it.
• Amba can to cause her body to glow.
• Pranee can adopt a human form, and can change between human and dragon forms as desired.
• Jagan can breathe out a thick fog.
• Pengu can cause it to rain."
792,,600,Finkelstein’s Monster        ,The Nightmare Before Christmas,Transformation ,You are a collection of (dead) body parts joined together by either yourself or another. It takes a few days for new body parts to become a true part of your body but with time you can learn to use the dead tissue/organs/limbs of other people/animals as though they had always been part of you. Parts that are removed from your body remain under your control for several days before having to be reattached to your body.
793,,600,Titan,Disney’s Hercules,Transformation ,"Ah. Well, this. You’re not quite a spirit anymore, are you? No, you’re a Titan, one of the ancient beings that ruled before the gods cast them down and imprisoned them in a pit.

Not only are you huge, as in Multi-story-building size, you are also no longer composed of organic matter. You are comprised entirely of one of the elements of nature, such as wind, fire, water or maybe even lightning!

This means you no longer take any damage from this element, and can indeed fuel your powers through taking it in. Also, you have vast, massive control over this element. A water Titan would be able to drown cities, a wind Titan can toss around hurricanes like party favors, so on and so forth."
794,,600,Demon,Black Clover,Transformation ,"​You are not of this world; you have ascended from the underworld in all your glory. Demons are powerful entities but limited in their own way each Demon only has access to one specific powerful form of magic such examples include Anti-magic (Which isn’t really magic) and Kotodama Magic allowing reality to be warped with just a voice, only Darkness-based Magic remaining unaffected. As you paid CP you also have access to a 5 leaf grimoire allowing you to access your true power and spells."
795,,600,Beast Awakened,Bloodborne: Covenants,Transformation ,"You have fully embraced the monster residing within you, becoming a true terror the likes of which few could fathom, but all will dread. You are capable of taking on a powerful, bestial form that will greatly enhance all of your physical capabilities and your senses, as well as granting you teeth and claws capable of rending stone as easily as flesh. Should you wish to revert back to a more human form, it only takes a minute to calm the beast enough to put it back in the cage.

Boosted: A beast of blood, strengthened and leashed by the insight of the heavens. Similar in size to one of the cleric beasts, you tower over all but the largest of threats found in the city, as well as being able to coat yourself in an element of your choice, like fire or electricity. All will fear such a beast joining in on this night of the hunt, both Hunter and beast alike.

796,,600,Half-Blood Viltrumite,Invincible,Transformation,"You are a Human-Viltrumite Hybrid. As
humanity is very close in nature to the Viltrumites and that Viltrumite DNA
overwrites lesser species, you can grow to be just as strong as any other
Viltrumite out there. You will have super strength, super speed, super durability,
and the power of flight. While you do not have super
senses ‘per se’, your sight is comparable to a hawk, and
somehow manages to operate perfectly no matter how fast
you move (even if that is beyond the speed of light).
Viltrumites have hyper-evolved and efficient bodily
functions such that, holding a single breath of air is enough
to last you for two weeks of vigorous physical activity, and
you are immune to any and all diseases and ailments bar
those that have been enhanced by something comparable
to super or hyper science and tailor made to affect
Viltrumites. Something like this would take the best
scientists of an advanced alien civilization years if not decades to achieve.
Viltrumites grow through stress and conflict, so you are able to train your physical
abilities or improve through being damaged and healing from it at a comparable
rate to if you had trained vigorously during that time. Viltrumites can heal from
almost any trauma imaginable, able to get their guts ripped out or being ripped in
half, with all it takes to put everything back together is for your bits to be in
approximately the right place to heal perfectly, given the time. Due to this healing
factor Viltrumites live for millennia, with their aging being comparable to human
until they reach physical maturity at which point it slows dramatically. The only
issue with this healing factor is that if the heart has about 50% of it destroyed the
healing factor does not work, and while it can heal brain trauma (including
memories), it caps out at about 1⁄3 of the brain destroyed. Also, as good as this
healing factor is, it won’t replace lost limbs. Either reattach them or get a
prosthetic.
With age Viltrumites remain semi-comparable to humans as their hair changes
slowly to white, though they never get wrinkles, and are able to grow glorious
facial hair. Although culturally Viltrumites limit themselves to a beautiful
mustache. Finally Viltrumites have a single inherent weakness, the complexity of
the ear canals that evolved to allow them to balance while flying in space, this
complexity means that the right type of sonic pulse could cause immense pain to
a Viltrumite and potentially even death given a long enough exposure.

No two Viltrumites are created equal. Their powers come from their extremely
potent and dense tissue, and can be improved through their lineage or simply
training. When you buy this perk you start off at the level of a young Viltrumite,
able to hold your breath for hours at a time, and move or fly at hypersonic
speeds. You are strong and durable enough to give and receive attacks powerful
enough to shatter skyscrapers and break mountains. Given around a decade of
natural growth (or less provided you train) you grow to the level of a veteran
Viltrumite. Meaning you, with the help of a couple others of similar strength, could
shatter somewhat weakened planets and receive similar attacks all while being
able to move at well beyond the speed of light, although they tend to limit
themselves to hypersonic speeds while in an atmosphere. They are capable of
flying between habitable planets within a couple of weeks at their top speed, with
the stamina to remain awake and aware through the flight.
Given enough time and training you may even eventually be able to make it to
the level of a Regent Viltrumite, though something like this would take about a
couple decades (or equivalent) of dedicated hard work, and many life or death
battles. Being healed to be better than before by someone with powers like Atom
Eve may shorten this time further. A Regent Viltrumite is so strong and durable
that a veteran Viltrumite could literally cause their own arms to explode into a
bloody pulp from striking a Regent and have the Regent be completely
unaffected. A Regent is so quick they could move without a veteran Viltrumite
even seeing them, and so strong they could literally cut a veteran Viltrumite in
half with a casual swing of their arms, like a hot knife through butter. Regent level
Viltrumites are powerful enough that they could fight inside a sun, albeit while
taking massive amounts of damage to the point of death or near-death if they
stay there for about a half an hour or more.
As a half-blood Viltrumite, you get an added degree of control over your
backstory, you may choose to be Nolan Grayson’s (Omni-Man) child and Mark
Grayson’s (Invincible) sibling. Or you may simply be the product of a government
experiment using the blood Nolan left at the scene of a fight, or something else
that fits thematically."
797,,600,Spirit of Vengeance         ,Marvel Magic,Transformation ,"Ghost Riders were spiritual entities created long ago by heaven to scour the earth clean of impurities. For many years, they served their divine purpose, protecting humans and punishing evil. But events conspired and many Spirits were bound while others yet were corrupted. These spirits were bound to human hosts who acted as limiters for their power and mediators of the justice doled out.

You find yourself as a host to an unbound Spirit of Vengeance subservient to your will. At your will, you may transform into the form of a skeleton coated in hellfire, which grants you access to a number of supernatural powers. First among them is the hellfire that surrounds your form, which you can summon and command as you will. This magical fire also has a number of other abilities such allowing you to channel it through weapons to enhance them, making supernaturally sharp burning blades, chains that move at your command, and even guns that fire ammunition composed of hellfire. It can also be channeled into vehicles or even living mounts, granting them a demonic, flaming appearance and enhanced abilities. You also possess greatly enhanced physical abilities and can quickly regenerate from severe damage. There are any number of other magical abilities you may be able to discover in time, from teleporting through fire to summoning biblical plagues. But the most powerful ability in your arsenal is the Penance Stare -- by making eye contact with another being, you can force them to feel the weight of all the sins they have committed in their life, inflicting grievous damage upon the mind and soul of most. It matters not the power or defenses of the being in question; the only way to avoid the Penance Stare is to either be completely innocent of sin or to avoid staring into the Rider’s eyes."
798,,600,Simply Marvelous,World War Hulk,Transformation ,"Like Carol Danvers herself you have been experimented on by Kree scientists and have been given extraordinary powers. You can lift over 100 tons, withstand blows that could destroy buildings, and fly at extreme speeds. You also have the ability to absorb nearly every form of energy to boost your abilities greatly, heal yourself, or sustain you in place of food, air, and water. Should you absorb enough energy at once you’ll enter a Binary form that boosts your powers exponentially."
799,,600,Batty,Pet Avengers,Transformation ,"You are a ghost. You are able to float and fly, to pass through solid objects, and to even possess others. This is easiest in those bodies that don’t already have souls, but you can wrest control away from the weak willed to take over their body to use as your own. As a ghost you do not need to breathe, sleep, eat, and do not age as well as are remarkably difficult to harm through physical means. Post-jump you are able to turn this ghostly state on and off should you decide you like being alive and fleshy."
800,,600,Ghost,Marvel Midnight Suns,Transformation ,"Well, you can’t actually be dead as that is usually a chain failure, but you have most of the ghostly benefits. This is a form of advanced astral projection pushing your soul over your body. The main thing you get with this perk is being momentarily incorporeal, flight and an increased magic core. A weakness is that it is very draining for a living person to do. Once a jump your ghost self can bring you back from death. Be aware that this can’t be used in combat and does not make you invincible to violence as the spirituality is the cover of a shell."
801,,600,Fossilized Amulet,Marvel’s Kid Heroes,Transformation ,"Created long ago by the mysterious Hag of the Pits to empower a worthy champion, this amulet contains the essence of all the extinct creatures of Earth, allowing the bearer to transform in whole or in part into dinosaurs and the like. You can mimic the ears or eyes or snout for a sensory boost, turn legs into claws or arms into wings. However, you can’t really mix and match, being able to only assume the features of one creature at a time."
802,,600,Hell’s High Prosecutor,Helltaker,Transformation ,"You are now not just the most powerful demon, on equal ground with Ancients, but just as beautiful as the demon girls! Though your skin is more of a tanned grey. You get a discount on all Demon Girl perks except Ancient. Your Puzzle is gigantic, regardless of difficulty, and it’ll bump up the time required to solve it by one (1) tier; final tier puzzles now take at least a day to solve."
803,,600,Ancient One,Helltaker,Transformation ,"You are now a demon of the same caliber as Beelzebub and Lucifer, your horns white with age and the power to show for it. Physically, you can go toe to toe with Hell’s appointed Prosecutor, mentally, you are capable of managing the entirety of Hell and opening portals through complicated instructions. Mind, this translates as being able to micromanage a whole dimension and being able to fight Judgement, who is the most physically powerful demon (or at least appears to be). Ancients get the final tier of ‘Puzzle’ and one (1) ‘very useful ability’ (separate from the one you can buy) for free (0cp)."
804,,600,Spirit of Vengeance,Ghost Rider,Transformation ,"You’re possessed by a Spirit of Vengeance, much like the one that possesses Johnny Blaze; at night, or in the shadows, you are capable of a startling transformation, which strips the flesh from your bones and sets your body alight with hellfire- turning you into the Ghost Rider. (You can choose to change the Ghost Rider aesthetic in minor ways, since the Spirit possessing you isn’t the same one that’s possessing Johnny; for example, you may choose to have a fiery halo instead of a burning skull, or you may have retain a human head instead of turning into a skeleton. Ditto for if you’re possessed by a Spirit of Justice instead.) While in this form you’re not quite in control of yourself- for now, at least- and you will need to battle the Spirit inside of you for control over your new body. While transformed into the Ghost Rider, you possess powerful spiritual/magical abilities as well as superhuman attributes. You’re strong enough to swing a helicopter around by a chain, have essentially unlimited stamina due to not feeling fatigue, and are durable enough to survive a direct hit from a bunker buster. (With most weapons being ineffectual against you, due to the strong flames that surround your body; bullets and knives melt, baseball bats burn to ash, etc.) You have a strong healing factor, so the damage that does happen to you heals almost instantly (though you might be sore once you exit the transformation), can move at speeds fast enough to cross several meters in the blink of an eye, and have greatly increased dexterity and reflexes.

You are capable of producing and manipulating hellfire, which can’t be doused with water, can melt through steel and stone, and is capable of searing the soul (or merely the body, with normal humans being incinerated in only a few seconds). Weapons, clothing, armor, and vehicles (including things like horses) that you pilot are transformed when you use them, taking on a demonic or charred appearance with the possibility of being engulfed in hellfire in a similar manner to yourself and boosting their usefulness; weapons might shoot or become engulfed with hellfire, armor and clothing become much more protective and regenerate, and vehicles can be mentally called and increase greatly in speed, durability, and power, with a motorcycle being capable of speeds over 200 miles an hour as well as being fast enough to scale a large building. Chains used by the Ghost Rider are also capable of elongating greatly and can also be controlled telekinetically, though whether those properties are unique to them are unknown. In addition, the Ghost Rider can levitate, and is immortal in the “can be killed by violence” sense. The Ghost Rider’s most powerful weapon, however, is his Penance Stare- by staring into the eyes of someone who has committed a crime or caused pain- anything from telling a white lie to murder, or worse- he can make that person feel all the pain and suffering that they’ve caused. The result of receiving the Penance Stare varies; some people merely have their eyes burned out, some people die, and some are incinerated (and then die); the greater the sins, the more devastating the Penance Stare is. The Penance Stare works on any being that has a soul, and the Ghost Rider can sense the sins of others, knowing every misdeed that they have committed. 

Boosted: Spirit of Justice- The Spirit of Justice inside of you has woken up, returning to the way it once was; the flames of hellfire that surround you have been replaced with the flames of heaven (though you may choose to keep their hellish appearance, if you’d prefer; you may also choose to keep the demonic aesthetics of your equipment rather than an angelic one). This awakening has granted you several new abilities; you can banish otherworldly entities, including the Devil himself, back to their homes, and your Penance Stare is now able to work on soulless beings. Your Heaven/Hellfire, instead of burning a soul, can sterilize or cleanse it of outside influences (if a person chooses to be evil, they’re still evil) in the form of impurities, corruptions, and even ousting possessing entities, and you can also heal others, and even revive the recently dead so long as they’re mostly intact. Finally, you can now transform during the day, as well as at night. The Spirit inside you will also no longer fight you for control while you are here, so long as you use your powers for good in some way.

805,,600,Asgardian(1000),Avengers-Thunderbolts,Transformation ,"For the higher price, you are now a rival to the likes of Hela or a child of Odin. Your strength is now at the lower end of the 100+ range, or with Fighting Fit equal to Thor’s own, with durability as immense as your strength. This likewise bolsters your natural mystical energies. Your soul is powerful enough that if you were in an emotional state it might stagger even the Sorcerer Supreme to gaze into your mind, and helps you to resist telepathic assaults. While far from immune to magic and esoteric assault, you have a heightened resistance to it and may on occasion prove capable of ignoring or powering through mystical or other effects such as hazardous radiations; energy that could instantly reduce even empowered humans to radioactive zombies might flow over you with no effect, and Hell Lords like Hela and Mephisto might pass on collecting your soul due to it being too dangerous in how it could resist them.

Beyond these general traits, for the higher price like many Asgardians you possess your own special power. Canon examples include: Heimdall’s senses and their capacity for clairvoyance by focusing on another location, seeing enemies from hundreds of miles away, and tracking the bright and powerful life force of an Asgardian across dimensions; Amora’s ability to enchant the wills of men and twist them with no active effort on her part; Sif’s ability to teleport across Realms taking others with her; Hela’s ability to kill even gods with a touch to their bare skin; or of course Thor’s command over storms, capable of blanketing cities with ease and even extending to an ability to command temporal storms and cosmic winds. This power cannot exceed those listed here in general scope and power.

806,,600,Marvelous,Avengers Vs X-Men,Transformation ,"After having undergone the same machine procedure as Miss Marvel, you’ve gained the same powers as her, becoming a strange Kree hybrid with whatever you were before plus a bunch of other unexplained powers. 

Your body possesses enormous levels of strength and durability, above most of the Marvel heroes short of the Incredible Hulk, and you can move or fly through the air at outrageous speeds. You’ve got matching reflexes and agility to your great speed, as well as healing exceptionally quickly. Your most impressive powers relate to energy however. You have the ability to absorb almost any type of energy, in enough amounts to drain a white hole rapidly, and can channel that energy to many purposes, such as massively boosting your physical abilities or rate of healing. You can fire the energy in destructive blasts from your hands or eyes and even use it to alter matter or energy around you on the molecular level, at least with a bit of practice. The energy can also be actively shaped and controlled, such as to make shields or blades, and it can replace your need for rest, sustenance or air. Fighting in the void of space isn’t an issue if you dip into a star now and then. If you drain enough energy at once, you’ll be able to temporarily enter a much more powerful ‘Binary’ form which will vastly enhance your energy manipulation powers."
807,,600,Simply Mar-vellous,Marvel Cosmic,Transformation ,"I think you know where this is going. Whether or not it was through Kree experiments you possess the same powers as Captain Marvel. You can manipulate matter and energy, I am sensing a pattern here in Marvel Cosmic, and possess truly staggering strength and durability. You can fire photonic blasts, absorb energy, create energy constructs, and you can even temporarily channel the full might of a White Hole and enter a form like Binary where your cosmic powers are magnified to an even greater degree. The more you practice and use it, the longer you can enter your Binary form."
808,,600,Jumper Smash!,Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Transformation ,"You can trigger a transformation that combines the best, and strongest aspects of all your alt-forms, giving you an appearance of your design that can incorporate any aspects belonging to your alternate forms. This transformation isn’t an alt-form in and of itself, but is treated in a similar way to them in regards to drawbacks and the like. Even if you don’t possess such things yet, this will grant you a bulky form of your design and choice as an alternate form you can use, which has superhuman capabilities similar to the third level of Superhuman Body."
809,,600,Hulk Out,Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Transformation ,"They shouldn’t have made you mad; they won’t like you when you’re mad. Or, whatever emotion you feel when you transform- whenever you enter a heightened emotional state of some sort, you take on an appearance much like the Hulk, with your strength varying with how strongly you feel whichever emotion triggers your transformation. At the height of your power, you’ll be as strong as the Hulk- who can throw large objects into space, and shrug off most forms of damage, including atmospheric reentry, a variety of energy based attacks, and even hammer blows from Thor. There is a downside, however; this transformation, while immensely strong, is dependant on your emotional state. If you stop feeling it, you go back to being puny Jumper."
810,,600,Substance Mimicry,Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Transformation ,"You can take on the properties of physical objects (but not living beings), gaining their strengths and weaknesses both normal and supernatural. This is partially based on concentration, meaning that even if you take on the properties of a near indestructible object you can be shocked out of your transformation through other methods, including overwhelming physical trauma. Do note that you absorb all the properties of an object; when the Absorbing Man absorbed the properties of Mjolnir, he gained great strength and durability- but he was also able to be controlled and manipulated by Thor."
811,,600,Density Manipulation,Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Transformation ,"You can manipulate your bodies’ density, greatly increasing your weight (and strength and durability with it, but making you slower) or lowering it enough to phase through solid objects and fly, with your speed increasing the less dense you become."
812,,600,Asgardian,Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Transformation ,"Asgardians are nigh immortal gods hailing from the realm of Asgard. While you’d be above the average Asgardian in strength, you’d be more on par with the Warriors Three or Sif than Thor, and far below Odin in strength. Most Asgardians are fair and beautiful, with light skin and brightly colored, silken hair- like Humans, though, Asgardians have enough genetic diversity to produce individuals who go against these norms.

All gods of Asgard have abilities that put them above the human norm; dense muscles give them the superhuman ability to lift around 30 tons and shrug off gunfire and small explosions, while an enhanced metabolism and immune system gives them greatly enhanced stamina and immunity to disease. Their enhanced strength also allows an Asgardian to run and jump much better than humans. In addition, Asgardians are extremely long lived with a life span that can easily measure in the thousands, have a natural immunity to non-supernatural radiation, and can breathe in a variety of environments including space. Asgardians also tend to be supremely beautiful, though not supernaturally so, and possess magical talent- though their magic would take far longer to learn than the ten years you have here."
813,,600,Body of a Saint ,Toaruverse,Transformation ,"Being one of the few saints that exist in this world has many advantages and perks along with disadvantages. As having a body of a saint gives you a superhuman body that is capable of performing peak human physical feats at bare minimum and only to improve from there. Your senses are also improved to be several times more acute and sharper than a normal human without overloading your senses. The most improvement is your mana capacity which is several times larger than the strongest human along with better and efficient mana channeling. Your blood also possesses healing properties that heal your wounds at an accelerated rate and it’s capable of healing non-fatal wounds instantly and stabilizing critically wounded persons. Unlike other saints you don’t have their nasty side-effects that make them weak to attacks that resemble how the Son of God was killed like being stabbed, a crown of Thorns, and the crucifix along with you capable of drawing more power unto yourself further empower your physical feats with the maximum of ten times than your base stats for indefinite amount of time without straining your body."
814,,600,King,Ragna Crimson,Transformation ,"The Seija, the high tier dragons, do not come from the evolution of other dragons. No, they gain their monstrous powers and forms by receiving the blood of the Dragon God and undergoing a transformation. But the Dragon God isn’t the one in charge of this process. Instead, this task is delegated to the Dragon Kings who have been granted power by the Dragon God, one for each of the six Bloodlines: Wing, Scale, Claw, Breath, Eyes and Bone. You are now the king of one these bloodlines, even replacing the current Winged King if you wish so.

First, you have the power to bestow the ‘blood of god’ to others, initiating the transformation into Seija. This will turn even regular humans into the powerful dragons known as Seija, and each individual you turn into a Seija will gaining their own special powers and magical abilities. It’s not an ability that you can use often, perhaps you could do it a couple of times per year, and the maturation time to reach the maturity as a Seija varies from individual to individual as explained before, but a single Seija is more than enough to lay waste to armies of dragon hunters and bring ruin to cities.

Secondly, you have an increased potential when it comes to creating lesser dragons, being able to use your blood to spawn tens of thousands in a second in a giant tornado of fire and flesh. Lastly, it seems that the individuals that you remake as a King gain a strong affection towards you. It may be a deep crush, mad love or just a great amount of loyalty.

If you are not a Seija you may still turn others into members of your species and allow them to gain their own special magical powers, but you won’t become a king of the Brethren nor will you have the special ability to create more dragons."
815,,600,I Love Swords So Much,Ragna Crimson,Transformation ,"For a Dragon Hunter, his silver sword is his life. The tool that he can use to freeze dragons and stop their regeneration. But perhaps you took this quite too literally, as you have started to become one with your weapon of choice. 

It will take time for this process to start taking place. At least a couple of years of using a weapon constantly will be needed for it to begin, and a few more to finalize. But once you are done, your abilities will fuse together with that of your weapon, allowing you to channel magnified versions of whatever powers your weapon had, infusing other items or weapons with the same powers and even create copies out of thin air of the weapon you fused with, all of an extremely high quality.

Finally, you are able to temporarily bring your body to an existence closer to the weapon you are fused with at will, allowing you to gain increased defensive capabilities, as a sword is harder to break than a human. This however has the drawback of making your articulations stiffer the closer you bring yourself to your absorbed weapon, to the point that you may lose any movement capability until you undo the transformation if you go too close into your ‘weapon mode’.

You can only fuse with a single weapon at a time, but unlike Ragna, you can undo the fusion process and choose another weapon to begin fusing with."
816,,600,Dragon Soul ,Trinity Wonder,Transformation ,"Those with the Dragon Soul are able to gather vast amounts of mana to use for casting spells, as dragons are the origin of magic. As you progress in magic, so too shall you steadily attract more mana to yourself. People with dragon souls make powerful mages. However, the name Dragon Soul is not just for show. A special transformation can be triggered any time your life's in immediate danger, turning you into a powerful, regenerative, dragon. But this is not entirely without drawbacks. There is a downside to having this power; if you ever take in more mana than your body can handle, you will turn into a wild dragon until the excess is burnt off. Luckily for you, unlike the norm you will retain enough of your sanity to avoid hurting those close to you when you transform in such situations, unless provoked."
817,,600,Golden Eyes,A Throne of Glass,Transformation ,"You have the Golden Eyes of the Valg Kings, your bloodline is strong and it flows true in you. Your eyes offer several benefits the first of which is the ability to have all magics of darkness and shadow break upon you like water on rock. No magic of shadow or darkness can touch you unless you specifically allow it. The second of which is that creatures of darkness know and instinctively respect the lineage that these eyes represent, creatures of the shadow and dark, aberrations from beyond the world they look at these eyes and they will immediately treat with you as at worst an equal, while lesser creatures will instinctively know they would obey if you ever ordered. These eyes give you one final gift, which is the gift of seeing in darkness. No matter how dark it might be, you can see in any degree of darkness as if it were the brightest and clearest day."
818,,600,Shape-shifter,A Throne of Glass,Transformation ,"You are one of the few people alive in the world to claim decent from the bloodline of a shapeshifter, and you are not just an ordinary shape- shifter but a powerful one. This bloodline smells of Fae, Valg, and something unknown to those with senses acute enough to smell it. As a shapeshifter you will deal with mistrust from most people that find out what you are, due to your kinds history of being assassins, and spy’s. As a powerful shapeshifter you may freely change your shape into any living shape that you have a vague knowledge of, the magical energy cost of shifting being a onetime cost per shift. The degree of energy necessary to shift your shape is minute so long as remain close to your current size, with the further you move relative to the shifters current size through growing or shrinking costing more energy. The main risk for shapeshifting is that if you spend too much time living in other forms you may forget what your original form is, and may be unable to shift back to your original form.

Shape-shifters have many innate gifts with their magic, including the ability to edit their forms as they see fit. Such as generating supernatural spider silk on their scales in their reptilian forms after they have seen the material in questions, or simply editing their human form to change as they wish. They are even able to turn into other humanoid races such as Fae and gain the physical benefits inherent to that form, except for immortality. Shifters gain the innate instincts necessary to use their new forms, able to read the wind if they turned into a bird, or understand and track scents if they turned into a wolf. Shifters heal at supernatural speed slightly beyond even Fae. With some practice shifters may also learn how to shift their mind to protect it from attacks from other people, able to make a copy mind over their true mind that they can shift to give off the thoughts they desire, this mind will also shield the hidden mind below from mental attacks giving the shifter time to react.

Shape-shifters do have some limitations on their magic, they are unable to turn into inanimate objects, do not keep their clothes or items within a non-space as they shift, and they require some understanding of an animal or organic substance before shifting into it, although this bar is very low. Seeing a life size mural of a Sea Dragon would be all it took for a shifter of your calibre to turn into one. If you saw a wyvern in the distance you could transform into one, and as soon as you see the spider-silk integrated into its wings clearly enough for you to understand what it was you could integrate it into your form. Wounds also carry over between forms, at a proportional size and placement on the body.

A shifter of your power would be able to shift between leopard form, a wyvern form large enough to easily carry a cow in each taloned foot, and a sea dragon large and strong enough to knock out the keels of galleons with a single swipe of tail or claws. You would have enough power to shift rapidly between these forms while fighting an opposing army all day."
819,,600,Anodite ,Ben 10,Transformation ,"Powerful energy beings made of pure mana, life energy and the very essence of magic, Anodites are free spirits who often care little for the affairs of their fleshier cousins across the universe. They can naturally and easily create barriers and energy blasts of mana, as well as creating constructs of this energy of complexity and strength limited only by the skill and willpower of the Anodite in question as well as fly great distances through will alone. Should they wish to, they can drain mana from other living beings around them in order to recharge or enhance themselves, though most don’t bother with this. Naturally any Anodite that chooses to learn magic beyond their natural abilities would be incredibly talented with it, putting even the most dedicated of sorcerers to shame. They can also create fleshy human bodies for themselves when they wish to mingle among them, even reproduce with humans if it is desired. However, as they are beings of pure energy, their mana being completely depleted would result in their death.

As they lack DNA to copy, pure Anodites or hybrids in Anodite form cannot be copied by an Omnitrix. However, Human-Anodite hybrids enjoy the natural talent for magic and can eventually learn to shift between human and full Anodite form at will once they learn how to do so...though the energy form of their ancestor is often addicting and difficult to let go, needing will and training to get used to switching between the two. At least, if they want to in the first place."
820,,600,The Coloured Man,King Arthur ,Transformation ,"Pick from ten different colours. You can change your skin to match that colour, and as long as  every item you wear is that colour you get a boost to dexterity, durability, and strength as well as a magical enhancement or power based on the color.

Red - Convert Strong Emotions into Energy & Absorb Other People's Blood to Regenerate 
Yellow - Create Illusions & A Master of Deceit 
Blue - The Truth can Never Hide From You & A Presence Of Authority 
Orange - Evaporate Liquids & Can Slow The Cycle Of Day & Night 
Green - Absorb Or Increase People's Luck (Temporary) & Increase The Quality Of Things 
Purple - Can Temporarily Eject Spirits from bodies & Transform people into children.
Gray - Can Sedate people & Locked things Can only be opened by you or with your method 
Brown - Make Metals Rust & Make Items Degrade Slower 
White - Purifying & Freezing things 
Black - Shroud of Disguise & Terrifying Presence"
821,,600,Chunk of Skull,Dracula Untold,Transformation ,"A dirty, grimy looking chunk of a human skull. Looks like trash, but don’t throw it! It’s actually an intensely useful little thing! Simply by bleeding into it, you can impart any one of your Alt-forms, powers or abilities to someone else, to be gained simply by drinking your blood from it. The receiver gets the base form of whatever power you choose to impart, although they have, unless you decide otherwise, potential equal to yours. It will take a lot of time and effort to be realized, though, under normal circumstances."
822,,600,Multiple Choice,The Dresden Files,Transformation ,"Normally, once you make the Choice, that's all she wrote. You, though? You have the possibly-unique ability to pull yourself back to Mortality without giving up your Faerie nature. You can also do it the other way: Make the Choice, transform completely into a creature of the Fae, then turn back when you're done. You can only sustain this kind of power for so long before your new nature overwhelms you, but you'll know when enough is enough and it's time to turn back or else. Not a Changeling? This also applies to any other transformations you might undergo as long as you're aware enough to make the change back."
823,,600,Abominable X Man,Frozen,Transformation ,"You’re not just some animal anymore. You’re a real deal magical being made from something that really shouldn’t be moving on its own. A living snow man, a golem made of ice or a creature formed from living rock. You’re made of a single common natural material such as ice, rock, snow or steel. Despite being made solidly of this material, you’re still perfectly capable of functioning and you don’t even need the same things as a normal person, such as eating or sleeping. It’s pretty hard to kill you, you’d have to be mashed up into lots of bits to really die but you do share any weaknesses that the material you have chosen might have. Snow and Ice melt in the heat, metals will conduct electricity and so on."
824,,600,"""Twisted Stone""",Dark Souls 3,Transformation ,"The strongest and most powerful demons were also the most warped, the ones that least resembled their former selves. You may count yourself and your body among them now. Purchasing this perk causes several things to happen, the first of which causes you to shoot up four meters in height. The second is much more pronounced, as your body is twisted and shaped into a new, even more demonic one made of living stone. This new body is incredibly heavy and durable, as you do greatly resemble normal stone. It also makes you extremely resistant to heat and flame, allowing you to march through lava as if wading through a pool. Your new body isn't inhibited in several ways you would expect. It’s able to naturally heal over time and comes with great strength that allows you to move only a bit slower than you normally would despite the huge increase in weight. As a minor side-effect, your new body which marks you among the strongest of all demon kind gives you something akin to the status of royalty. Lesser demons are far more inclined to obey you and follow along loyally."
825,,600,"""Outrider Knight""",Dark Souls 3,Transformation ,"Though you have stared into the eyes of the Pontiff, and transformed into a beast, you have yet to lose your wits. The sorcery of the curse placed upon you is now being used to your benefit. First of all, upon purchase you gain around four meters and may warp your body as you see fit, as long as it stays recognizably human shaped. Slim it down, bloat it, curve the spine, stretch things out, do as you will, this will be your new form here. Second of all, after purchasing this perk, your armor, equipment and weapons will adapt and adjust to match any transformations or warping your body goes through. Armor will remain wearable and form fitting, weapons will grow, shrink and otherwise adapt but will stay recognizable as what it is and so on. New equipment and gear will also adapt to your form upon being picked up or touched, and anything put down or removed will slowly revert to its original form."
826,,600,Foundation of Want,Dark Souls 2,Transformation ,"“Emotion is intrinsically linked with the strength of the soul. You who have a soul so intrinsically linked with desire, and perhaps something more, have become a nexus through which yourself and those souls connected to you can be affect by raw emotion. As the above states, you are now the eye of a storm of mutation. Those emotionally or ideologically linked to you, as well as just those within close proximity, may now transform into hideous or incredible ways based on what is being felt. Envy and obsession with beauty can result in shedding skin and deriving health from normally deadly preservatives. Coveting that which may never be claimed and languishing in despair can end in an engorged, demonic form. Obsession with defending a point can result in quiet reflection. How anyone transforms around you is rooted in what they feel, but strength breeds strength. The strength of emotions felt tends towards breeding strength more than disability, with size and physical ability being among the most common.”"
827,,600,Coveted Power ,Dark Souls 2,Transformation ,"“Although many lived, died and continued to tread upon broken roads in undeath simply to catch a glimpse of an eternal dragon, few succeed, much less find the true end to their journey. You however, have gained some success, a measure of that pinnacle. You have attained draconic power within your body, even if it appears much like it once was. Your physical abilities have been greatly enhanced over the warriors and priests that normally make up these sects, allowing your bare hands to be formidable and normal blows to be shrugged off. You possess the power to breath fire that has a sense of mass, knocking any normal foe off their feet. Most fearsome of abilities however is your roar, carrying the true essence of a dragon. It stokes something within you, invigorating body and soul, making both might and magic greater for a time.”"
828,,600,Royal Authority,Dark Souls 2,Transformation ,"“Souls flow through these lands like no other. A prized resource, a source of power, carriers of innumerable secrets and one method of staving off the curse. Those who collect vast quantities grow larger, stronger, and you react like no other. Souls naturally increase the size of those who collect many, but the effects are more dramatic for you. Hundreds of souls wouldn’t matter for most, but for you they mean visible growth. Foster thousands of souls in your chest and you start growing leaps and bounds. Some of the enemies you might run into in these lands could have grown over twelve feet tall and have souls worth tens of thousands of weaker ones. By that time you could have already reached the size of the Royal Rat Authority! A bit slower from here on, but still growing visibly all the time. Souls swell out and balloon your form from the inside, but such size does not befit a rat. You may compact the souls within your form, allowing you to return to your original size, as you like. In the future, all stimuli external and internal that would increase your size are more dramatic.”"
829,,600,“Blasphemous Birth”,Dark Souls 1,Transformation ,"Most beloved, beautiful and kind being of the Painted World, protected and cherished by its inhabitants. The abomination Priscilla, whose very existence was an affront to their sensibilities, and whose power struck fear into their core. The unholy matrimony of god and dragon. You too are like dearest Priscilla, part dragon, part god. You stand over twice the height of man with appropriate physical abilities for such size, having soft features and body type of a god but clearly bestial features like a crown of spines and long flexible tail. Being the same type of abomination as Priscilla, your tail is covered in soft fur, potentially other parts of your body as well. Your soul is also extraordinarily powerful and you possess the magic ability to become invisible for short periods of time. When purchased with Absolution of Sin, you also gain great black wings able to lift even your hulking body aloft due to your connection to the goddess Velka. You also have the ability command crows, the associated with her."
830,,600,“Draconic Transformation”,Dark Souls 1,Transformation ,"You have attained a measure of success at the end of the road many others like you have walked. You now have the ability to transform, at least physically resembling that which you seek to be. On purchase, you may transform into a hybrid of a dragon and whatever your current form is. Doing so makes you larger, coats you in scales, gives you a distinctly draconian appearance, especially the head, and bestows talons on your hands and feet. This transformation makes whatever your current form might be far more durable and stronger compared to before, improves stamina a great deal and bestows several special abilities. You’re able to breath fire fueled by your soul’s energy, as well as empower yourself and knock away projectiles with an ear shattering roar. Special advice, strip down before transforming or your clothes may get damaged. When purchased with Dragon Eyes, your vision in this form becomes far sharper and clearer. When purchased with Gut Instinct your removed body parts independently become capable of this ability. This includes gaining a draconic head and sensory organs, essentially turning them into mini-dragons."
831,,600,“Abominable Mutation”,Dark Souls 1,Transformation ,"The Chaos Servants are not the only ones caring for the Fair Lady, there is another, her powerful older sister, the Chaos Witch Quelaag. Mutated by demonic chaos flame, after staying in your Covenant’s care for so long you have become a malformed being much the same as her, with a massive demonic spider for a lower half. Your lower body packs great strength, numerous dexterous legs, several dozen eyes, a gigantic maw of teeth and the ability to spew searing hot molten rock like projectile vomit. If you also have Egg Head, the chaotic taint will also have reached it, and you have the ability to expel it where it’ll rapidly mutate into a new form based on what you fed it, which is to say, the types of ‘souls’ or the energy of your soul it has used to sustain itself. This form will always resemble some twisted invertebrate, and may range from the size of a man to a demon as large as you, depending on how well fed it is. At any time, you may also revert it from this form back into the compact larva that rests in your chest."
832,,600,Demon of the Third Realm ,Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,Transformation ,"You gain an alt-form that is the true embodiment of hate. You take in all of the wrath of people around you, concentrating it into your vessel to mutate into a violent demon of fire, often an animal of some kind that is closely associated with you. While in this form, wounds that would be fatal to mortals will not be to you. You can conjure and manipulate fire, as well as receive a large boost to your physical abilities. Be warned, while in this alt-form you are assaulted by the wrath of hundreds and thousands of people threatening to waste away your mind. If you stay in this form for too long, you may lose control and nothing besides death or at least near death will return you to your senses."
833,,600,Okami ,Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,Transformation ,"You gain an alt-form that resembles that of the dragon of the sakura tree. When you change into this form, rain clouds gather above as heavy mist settles on the ground. While in this form, you can conjure and manipulate vegetation. You can also summon lightning from the rain clouds by using the vegetation as pseudo-lightning rods. If you have the Divine Lightning perk, you can just summon the lightning outright but using the vegetation will create a compounding effect that increases your lighting’s strength by many folds. Additionally, your breath is a powerful jet of water that can cut through steel. You can also breath a jet of steam instead. While it doesn’t cut like the water, it’s larger in width and inflicts tremendous knockback that can tear down fortress walls."
834,,600,Wretched Rebirth ,Bloodborne,Transformation ,"“Every Great One loses its child, and then yearns for a surrogate. The origin of these words is ambiguous, but the truth of them appears to be reality. Perhaps originating in some zealous soul’s desire for ascendance, a ritual built around supplying surrogates was constructed. 

With great skill in this ritual, you have the capacity to twist one type of being into being closer in body and mind to another. The first step of this ritual requires the construction of an artificial womb using flesh from the original being’s race, and the secondary being’s race. 

The second step is to seal the subject inside of this bag of flesh after filling the warm chamber with plasma; blood cleansed of all impurities. The subject, sealed in this space, melting and reforming, evolving and deforming, until such time that they are released. 

The final result gives the reborn subject great abilities based on the sampled being, and renders them to be far more susceptible to other surgeries and experiments relating towards guiding them further.”"
835,,600,Heirloom Hatred ,Bloodborne,Transformation ,"“Long ago an institution by the name Byrgenwerth conducted gruesome experiments in the name of enlightenment. Though many had volunteered in the name of progress, all had to endure a cruel existence as a living failure when such experiments fell through. 

You are, most likely, descended from one of these failures, though through what means this could have occurred are mysterious indeed. Though your blood has been muddled and made more stable, you still stand twice the height of a normal human, with long arms, and twisted, blue flesh. 

Although certainly nothing divine, and quite deformed, you also possess remarkable powers both arcane and eldritch. Harnessing the powers buried deep within you allows you to manifest and project ephemeral orbs of concussive energy, and potent electrical pulses, from the air around you. 

Although somewhat weak at first, more on the level of shattering brick or stunning hunters, they and the place you draw them from are like a muscle. The more you use them, the stronger they will become, and the easier to control, until you can make your foe believe they have made an enemy of the sky.” 

Boosted: Bloodborne + Heirloom Hatred: “A unexpected pair of abilities, but potent ones nonetheless. The first allows you to make any of your blood in the area explode with force equivalent to the quantity and quality of the blood you detonate. A few droplets will rarely detonate with any real force, but get enough together and it can make quite a bang. You yourself are highly resistant to these explosions. 

You also acquire the ability to condense your form in different ways. This allows you to shrink yourself down several times over with minimal reductions in resilience. It also lets you ‘tuck’ in certain body parts that might get in the way or expose your presence, such as those pesky head tentacles, or flesh wings.”

836,,600,Beast’s Strength,Bloodborne,Transformation ,"“Hunters overcome beasts with specific plans, techniques, weapons, and resources. Beasts overcome hunts with nothing but raw power and ferocity. As your inner beast churns deep within your mind, swelling in power, you conclude that borrowing that strength might be wise. 

Miraculously, your inner beast seems surprisingly tame, at least in regards to you bringing more of its power to the surface. Passively, this grants the sheer muscle power to crumple rib cages or rip heads off with your bare hands, and make it look easy. 

Actively, you can transform parts of yourself with much greater ease than before, drawing even more power out while equipping yourself with powerful claws or fangs. Beastly legs can allow for powerful leaps, clawed hands turning flesh into viscera, just care you don’t draw the whole thing to the surface.”

Boosted: Bloodborne + Beast’s Strength: “An unexpected new pair of abilities is bestowed. You may now make your blood toxic, though this won't affect your own body. This poison can afflict anyone who touches it, breaths it in, or imbibes it in some way, which makes it a very effective countermeasure. This can be toggled on and off if you wish for it to remain like it normally is. 

The second ability allows you to project your blood from your skin or open wounds in the form of an aerosol-like mist that hangs in the air for quite some time. Together, these can allow you to cloak yourself in a poisonous cloud of blood, or simply spray it in the face of an attacker. Together or alone though, they can be quite tricky for enemies to deal with.”

837,,600,Devourer of Gods ,Elden Ring,Transformation ,"Hmm. Very well. It seems you’re further along the path of the recusant than any save Rykard himself, for at some point you discovered a second God-Devouring Serpent and for reasons of your own fed yourself to it. And whether or not you had your own Great Rune at the time, somehow you managed to gain control of the creature. You are now the controlling consciousness of a vast serpent almost as tall as a giant when coiled up, and far longer when stretched out. The likeness of your face appears somewhere on your body, and four spindly but powerful arms and legs sprout from it-permitting you to wield a weapon or hoist your bulk over obstacles too tough to slither upon. Its scales are immensely durable even by comparison to the mightiest of dragons and great monstrosities of this world, and short of the highly specialised Serpent-Hunter spear’s blade of light, a force on par with Destined Death or truly overwhelming numbers of very powerful beings sorcery and bladework alike can hope to do little more than glancing damage to you.

The serpent you inhabit also has powerful elemental abilities, including a breath to match any dragon’s as well as the ability to generate an ambient storm of great power; this may be either flame like Rykard’s own serpent or another element from this world such as frost or even the Erdtree’s holy light. Last but not least, you have devoured countless great warriors in your quest for power and can withdraw their bound-together bodies as a blasphemous blade from your mouth; if you wish, you can extend the flailing limbs of them from crevices in your body, though this is generally neither helpful nor a hinderance to you in battle. Apart from being enchanted with your elemental powers, each foe you slay while holding it restores a miniscule amount of health-and those even struck by the element it generates find their vitality siphoned to you as well. Who can say how Rykard would react to another having such a closely bound family?

After this jump, should you wish your current state of being can become an altform."

This rite allows for the creation of the Dusk Legion’s breed of vampires, a secret learnt directly from a villainous god of Ixalan. Notably, they are not affected by the light of the sun beyond it weakening the power of the dark magic often utilized by the Legion and suppressing the speed and strength of their bloodthirst - what’s more, Vampires created this way feel a surge of loyalty and gratitude towards you once the rite is completed, as if they had been sanctified or blessed. "
840,,600,Opportunistic Dragon,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Transformation ,"Dragons. One of the most intimidating and iconic symbols of the Wilds’ ability to strike at the realm.

Whether on your side or not, it is impossible to ignore the fact that as you are now, you stand no hope of even matching them evenly. What do you do in these situations? Do you flail uselessly? Of course not! Instead, you gain the ability to trigger your own rapid evolution in moments like these, forcibly changing your body in order to increase your power. While this can’t be guaranteed to bring you to the level of creatures far beyond your reach, it can certainly help bridge the gap."

Tenets you now embody to its fullest, your body having grown to double its previous size, your musculature and “natural” weapons honed over time. You tower over other beasts of the tangle, inspiring fear and awe.

Should you have Creeping Corrosion as well, its effects are boosted, and you find the hunger within you has grown strong enough to let you gorge on the energy of the world itself, denying it to your enemies and growing stronger yourself, at the cost of the enviroment suffering for it. You may also use this ambient mana to empower living creatures and twist them as you would with Creeping Corrosion, and they will grow at an accelerated rate."
843,,600,Reborn And Yet Reluctant ,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Transformation,"In the days before the Kami War, five dragons stood watch over this world, proud and tall. When O-Kagachi went berserk, several of them fell defending those below them from his wrath. Once the war ended, they were reborn, gaining new bodies and in some cases new powers and abilities. And yet, they had also internalized part of O-Kagachi’s rage, and so refused to return to their stations of guardians of the land and its people. At this point, if you wish, you may become a Dragon of great power much like them, though that is not the true benefit. Regardless of your affiliation, your nature, or even the tasks you were born to do, you will find that these things bind you not at all. Restrictions and oaths that would force you to take action fail to work on you, and entire schools of magic that simply should not be in your nature will allow you to wield them if you desire. A Kami of peace could go to war, and a Kami of destruction could become a great artist. This is a mighty ability, but it is also an aberration. Try not to abuse it."
844,,600,To See The World Compleated ,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Transformation,"You know, while one would assume that you are a native of Kamigawa, when you’re so precariously positioned between factions like this it could be that you’re from a little farther away. No, not one of the other continents that aren’t part of the Kamigawa Empire, another plane - specifically, Mirrodin. Or as it’s known, New Phyrexia. You have been Compleated, transformed from sickly meat to glorious Phyrexian unlife with all the tender care that one of the Praetors could muster - probably Jin-Gitaxias, as it is he who currently resides on Kamigawa, but not necessarily. In addition to being one yourself, you now understand Compleation in a way that most of your peers would envy, able to make vast alterations to the minds of those you welcome into Phyrexia’s embrace just as easily as you twist their body from frail flesh to the unique blend of metal, ceramics, and other materials that the Machine Mother prefers. Such is your skill that you can even generate the glistening oil en masse, to share Phyrexia’s bounty with all… or even slow down, or outright halt its infection. If you had a mind to."
845,,600,Riding on Dragons ,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Transformation,"Dragons are creatures of power, worshipped upon many planes, where most would venerate or fear dragons you are different. You possess a strong affinity with dragons, attaining their power for your own. With this power you are able to conjure parts of a dragon’s body onto your limbs or coat your body in their scales. In addition, dragons while they may not see you as kin, acknowledge you as someone who has attained some degree of their power and as such worthy of respect.

Due to this affinity, working with dragons is exceptionally easy as those in your service are able to instinctively sense your emotions and desires acting in response to them. Those dragons who are not in service to you treat you favorably granting favors to you in exchange for comparatively small tasks, which can range from dealing with an enemy for them to giving them treasure. With enough training in this power you can eventually reach the height of an actual dragon being able to transform into one at a moment's notice, though reaching the power of an elder dragon is likely something out of your reach through this alone."
846,,600,Skulduggery Pleasant ,Skulduggery Pleasant ,Transformation,"Or close enough. Sorry to tell you this, but you died. Luckily for you, you seem to have decided death wasn't for you and come back to your body, which is now just a skeleton. This DOES come with some advantages; if your body is ever damaged, you can quite literally put yourself together. The only other person with this condition was even able to replace his head after it was stolen. So long as the majority of your body is left undamaged, you will be able to survive and keep on fighting. Just watch out for magic that disintegrates bone. Weirdly enough, even though you have no nervous system, you still feel pain. If you miss having your dangly, fleshy bits as a skeleton with the Skulduggery Pleasant perk, perhaps look into acquiring a skinsuit? A hollowed-out zombie of sufficient quality would probably do the trick. Post-Jump, you may apply this as a toggle for any and all of your alt-forms, freely switching to a skeletal variant of those forms. If this perk is taken with Colour-Coded Reaper, you may choose to either be a skeleton wearing a super-zombie as a skinsuit, or may choose to simply be a powerful zombie with a particularly sturdy skeleton that could continue to move and fight even if all that was left of them was bones.

Boosted: Due to the enormity of your magical power, not just your body, but your very being has been augmented. If there ever comes a time when your entire body is destroyed, you can now survive as a being of pure energy (similar to Darquesse when she battles against the Faceless Ones) and can now either take on another form as your own or simply reconstruct your skeleton as it was prior to its destruction. However, don’t think this will render you invincible, as there are beings and weapons in this world and others that can hurt and even kill you regardless.

847,,600,Ultimate Form,Magi: The Adventure of Sinbad,Transformation,"The strongest assassins of Sham Lash often make use of Magoi Manipulation to enhance their techniques to incredible heights. But those techniques are ultimately limited by their user – disease, advanced age, or simply a naturally frail constitution can all leave the body weakened, and unable to draw out its full potential. You, however, have trained to such an extent that you’ve reached what can be described as a new state of being.

Your body is utterly suffused with Magoi, empowering you to great heights – a chop of your hand cuts as deeply of the sharpest of swords, tearing through flesh and bone almost as if it wasn’t there, and you can rain down punches at speeds that could overwhelm even master assassins. You also happen to have a not inconsiderable resistance to magical effects, with weaker spells and techniques simply being deflected.

As an added bonus, your body can store incredible amounts of energy that no normal person should be able to, and as such you’ll no longer suffer any injuries or negative effects from your body holding energy than your usual maximum.

Optionally, your appearance changes when you take this perk: Your skin peels off, leaving your body little more than exposed muscle and bone. You don’t suffer any drawbacks from losing your skin, though most people will naturally be horrified by your new look – though maybe that’s just what you want."
848,,600,Illusionary Being,BlazBlue: Phase Zero,Transformation,"Castle Alucard, as you might imagine from the name, is home to a vampire. Well, a pair of them, the lord of the castle and his daughter. In addition, he employees a werewolf as his butler, and a pair of beastmen as his hands and eyes in the world at large. I offer you the opportunity to choose one of these three races as your own. Vampires are the most similar to humans. They can hide in shadows, control blood, and have an extended lifespan, but are weaker in sunlight and have to drink blood. Werewolves are physically powerful but have little else. However, the both of them qualify as outside of ‘reason’, and as such cannot be harmed by purely physical actions. Magic is required, in at least some capacity. Beastmen, unlike Vampires and Werewolves, trade that defense away in exchange for a truly ludicrous amount of physical prowess and enhanced lifespan. The greatest warrior in the world, Jubei, is one of the two Beastmen working for Castle Alucard."
849,,600,Black Beast,BlazBlue: Phase Zero,Transformation,"Um. Why on earth? And how? ...Well, it seems that whatever the conditions are to create a Black Beast are, you meet some, if not all of them. You are in effect, a second black beast. I’m sure the world will be thrilled. As a being outside reason, you cannot be harmed by purely normal attack, such as the failed nuclear strikes. Beyond that, your mere presence generates magical energy. By default this is the local flavor, seithr, but given that it’s poisonous to humanity in large enough doses you may wish to change that. In fact, you can flat out turn into a sort of mist that is actually raw magic, letting you move very VERY fast. And while this part is optional, you can turn into an eight headed snake monster the size of a rather large building. Regardless of that, you can spawn smaller monsters known as remains with all of those powers, albeit in a lesser form. Please consider killing the other one with this power and not going on a rampage?"
850,,600,Monster of Myths,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Transformation ,"Sirens, minotaurs, harpies, centaurs. They’re impressive magical creatures but they’re not usually
the sort of thing that a demigod would have stories told for triumphing over. That’s another breed
entirely. They need things like what you are now to fight for legends to be made. The hydra, the
nemean lion, the chimera. Dragons, demons, divine beasts of power such that they can challenge
lesser gods. You’re able to take the form of one of these legendary creatures, even one of your own
designs. With a physicality easily capable of killing most of the heroes of these lands and certainly
threatening figures such as Heracles or Achilles, your threat is only further heightened by your
immense magical power. Magic is so tightly entwined with your body that a few drops of your blood
could match the output of mana from a modern magus. Cities and mountains would disappear
before your wrath, should you have the means to make use of this energy.

It’s well you do, several in fact. The legendary creatures of Ancient Greece were not known for just
physical power. You can choose up to three magical abilities to have as innate parts of your form. The Hydra’s infamously toxic breath and multiplicative regeneration or the Nemean Lion’s immunity
to all works of man, even the mighty breath of a dragon and their unique reactor souls. The less
abilities you pick, the more powerful the magical ability but even three at once would each be things
to prize. Additionally, your current state is not the end of your advancement. Should you perform
monstrous acts while in this form, such as indiscriminate killing for pleasure, you’ll find that the form
will slowly grow in physical and magical power, potentially even in size as well, to scale with the
awfulness of your deeds. Your body coming to reflect the monstrosity of your soul, it appears. "
851,,600,Metamorphosis,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Transformation ,"Into your body was placed the corpse of a certain legendary magical beast, which altered your body
forever more. Their pelt became your skin, their muscles your own, their bones within your very
body. Or perhaps that’s merely what it feels like when you activate the bestial transformation you
now have access too. Your form is now an ever-changing beast in it’s own right, increasing your
strength, durability, speed and agility, even your magical power to enormous heights. Not capable of
contending with a divine beast, or the monster option above, but at least enough to kill lesser
heroes easily or wipe a city clean of life in a day. It’s also possible to temporarily transfer this
enhancement to weapons you hold, greatly increasing their potency and transforming their
appearance while you hold them. But this is just the start. You are able to take on the forms of
beasts that you have slain and eaten, such as placing the wings of a hawk onto your back to fly or
granting yourself greater strength by taking on the limbs of a bear. 

Your body has a special quality that allows it to constantly improve. Every moment you are in conflict, with a foe or the natural world around you, your body will slowly shift and improve itself until it can
conquer that challenge. Gaining stronger muscles, growing new limbs, your skin thickening into
armor, even seeing your magical abilities very slowly increase in potency or new powers slowly form
within you. The progress can take hours for more significant abilities but providing yourself with
worthy prey can ensure that your never stop improving as a predator. "
852,,600,Vermillion Oni,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Transformation ,"Your Oni blood is awakened to the very limit of it’s potential, making you into a terrible creature the
equal of the rulers of the Oni Mountain. Rather than just making you a powerful Oni, this is in
actuality a trait that can apply to any species who you are part of, even in just sharing some of their
blood. You gain the potential to quickly awaken the legacy in your blood, gaining the powers of the
full race your line comes from and over time coming to represent the most powerful members of
that species. Additionally, your awakened blood grants you a significant advantage when you fight
against a member of your own species, drawing out a noticeable amount of extra strength from
within.

As an Oni, your powers are quite significant. Enough brute strength to crack open a mountain, cause
tremors across an island or turn a town into a series of craters. Incredible toughness, not just in
reducing the damage you take but surviving grisly wounds, able to live with a decapitated head or
crush chest without issue. Indeed, just cutting off your body parts won’t remove them from your
control, able to animate severed hands and legs as if you were still attached. Your magical power has
increased to match your strength in output and you are able to channel it into heat or fire, creating
and manipulating these elements at lethal levels of intensity. Despite the monstrous nature you
have, you’ll possess a charismatic presence that can even make those setting out to hunt you down
falter, in fear or wonder or even desire. Perhaps that presence also translates into a beautiful
countenance, if you haven’t decided to appear as a monstrous version of the Oni-kind?"
853,,600,Stoker’s Demon,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Transformation ,"A legend that won’t ever give up it’s terrible hold on life. Bram Stoker wrote but a mere story on an
ancient count who fed on the blood of living beings but it grew so far beyond that, bringing fame to
the legend of the vampire and defiling the legacy of one Vlad Tepes. Despite the true form of
vampires being that of Dead Apostles and not this fictional breed, you still find yourself waking this
evening with the powers of that dread count.

The many traits of this classic fiction are present in you now. Unaging immortality and pale beauty
when not enraged enough to use your bestial abilities. Your body takes on a composition less of
flesh and blood, more shadows with mass, the change allowing you to survive even the most terrible
wounds with little penalty. A destroyed heart or damaged spirit core hardly slows you and your
potent regeneration can heal most wounds before the attack that caused them has even finished. This can be focused on certain areas to make it almost instantaneous but one should be aware that sustained levels of severe damage over time will cause your regeneration to slow and eventually
falter. Despite the fictitous nature compared to them, your regeneration abides by the same
mechanics of the Curse of Restoration that Dead Apostles have. It works via regressing time, rather
than simple healing, and grows stronger as the moon waxes.

The same shadowy powers that grant this healing also improve your power, giving you the strength
to effortlessly bat around powerful Heroic Spirits or cause the ground to tremble for miles. Your
speed matches this physical strength, bursts of movement that can cross miles in moments or let
you throw out attacks well beyond the speed of sound. All of the many incidental abilities shown by
Count Dracula are yours to possess as well. Control over the weather or shadows, hypnotism and
manipulating the memories of humans, crawling on walls or commanding the animals of the night
and more. Your shapeshifter abilities let you turn into such animals, as well as mist or a swarm of
bats, an instant transformation that can make melee combat against you near impossible.

As is natural for any vampire, you have the claws and fangs to suck blood from others. Not only does
this sate your own deep hunger for blood, it also turns those whose blood has been sucked into
undead slaves, barring great mental or magical resistance. Acting as ghouls loyal to you, you can
embrace and expand your undead army quite rapidly, and your bite has an unnatural ability to
bypass all defences against ‘attacks’. It is, after all, a show of affection to take them into your
undead family in such a way. But the legends of Dracula are not all positive and the presence of
sunlight will significantly weaken your powers, while holy powers can deal catastrophic damage to
you. A devoted priest of great power could very well kill you when a whole team of history’s great
heroes failed.

As your power comes from the legend of Dracula, it is possible that new or altered abilities will
reveal themselves in time. Sometimes temporarily, sometimes not, as the legend and story may alter
or have certain aspects become more popular in time. While the above abilities will always remain
with you, you may find that different worlds offer new variations to enjoy for a time."
854,,600,Dangerous Game,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Transformation ,"The accidental life’s work of one Doctor Jekyll. An elixir that brings out all the potential of a human
being, apparently it’s far from good. Unlike the original elixir, this one is slightly more under your
control. The more you drink from it, the further the extent of the transformation, but you are able to
end the transformation once out of combat and revert the effects. The flask restores quickly, filling
to full each day.

But what does drinking from it do? A sip will grant incredible boosts to physical abilities, bringing an
ordinary man from frail doctor to stone crushing strength. Enough power to outrace any normal
animal and generally put yourself beyond the reach of ordinary human’s ability to fight back. Your
body will heal faster, wounds sealing shut at visible speed. It will start to affect your mind at this
stage, a strong urge for violence and mayhem, but you can infect others with this through the sound
of your voice, spreading chaos and infighting among foes or innocents. 

A larger drink will gain proportionately greater benefits. The entire flask at once turns the drinker
into an inhuman monster, body ripping and warping to take on a visage almost like that of the
werewolf, with terribly sharp claws and fangs. Physical abilities grow to reach the level of heroic
spirits or powerful military weaponry, bullets able to be dodged with ease and your body having
such strength that few magical weapons can cut it. Even limbs being severed are healed quickly and
your body can endure what seems like fatal wound after fatal wound without stopping the fight for a second. The madness drives you into almost certain frenzy, pursuing the violent death of anyone
perceived in some negative manner, but this also results in an aura of madness around you that
takes a heroic will to resist. No import."
855,,600,Body of the World,Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Transformation ,"The flesh of man can’t match up to the clay of the gods, the very material that you were
painstakingly crafted from. Mighty in a way that man can never truly hope to match, you have a
physical form that only the Gods themselves surpass. Your fists bring ruination to entire kingdoms
should you use your full force and even bolts of lightning seem to lag behind your sprints. Even when
foes appear that can harm your impossibly hard body, they’ll find that your claim of being made
from the Clay of the World is no lie. You are not only strong and fast and tough but also able to
freely control the divine clay that makes up your form and even turn the World around you, anything short of independent sapient creatures, into more Clay for your body to use. You can instantly turn
yourself into a hulking monster or a enormous weapon, you could gather the earth for miles around
you to form it into a hurricane of hundreds of thousands of powerful stone blades that are directed
by your will alone.

So long as there is matter nearby that you can use, you will be able to reform yourself so long as
your soul remains intact. All of this is purely your natural abilities and adding in magical energy will
allow you to empower your body far further, enchanting the weapons you craft from the dirt or
perhaps even unlocking stranger ways of connecting to and shaping the world with your body. "
856,,600,Fly Me to the Moon,Fate/Legends - Vive la France,Transformation ,"The bond between a master and mount grows deep as they adventure together, even when the
mount is nothing like a normal horse. For some, such as yourself, that bond can result in some
amazing gifts. You have legendary aptitude for taming, caring for and riding any kind of animal or
beast short of a dragon, but that skill that would alone make you feared by men across France is
merely the start. By creating a tight bond between yourself and a mount, you’ll be able to call on an
ability based on what that mount can do at will. Sometimes this will be a direct change, such as the
wings of a pegasus or the fiery breath of a wyvern, but Phantasmal Species can often have strange
abilities that become even stranger once you take hold. Abilities can change in the process, becoming more like related powers. The Hippogriff’s ability to transport between spaces through
imaginary means might result in replicating yourself into dozens of different clones. You may only
borrow powers from mounts who you still have a close bond with, negating efforts if you’ve been
long without the animal or they have passed away, but it is possible if tiring to take on multiple
abilities at once."

from behind? Do it like a real American and stomp your foes with your big boot. The biggest boot. Get huge. Be huge. You’re already huge? I didn’t even notice! How are you so huge!?
You’re BIG now, in case you didn’t realise. Big enough that people can mistake you for a small
mountain. You’re a 2 mile tall titan, even the tallest redwood tree can’t even come up to your ankle. A stomp from you can be felt as a powerful earthquake across the country and you could take apart
or put together mountains with your bare hands. You’re stronger than you look, as crazy as that
sounds, as your flesh becomes more like iron than soft human meat. But you don’t need to stay so
big. You control how big you are, able to swap between your original, non-giant height and your
fullest size or anywhere in between. People somehow don’t notice the height change unless you
point it out or do something drastic like pick them up with two fingers. Most things get drastic when
you’re more than a thousand feet tall though. You’ll stay stronger than normal when little, so you can still punch through a sturdy brick wall easily enough but you’re only a heavy weight when you’re…a heavy weight."
858,,600,Six Siblings,Angel Notes,Transformation ,"Why fight alone, when you can fight as six? The Six Jumpers here to protect all of humanity. You’re
able to split off from yourself six separate people, each a clone of yourself with some slight
difference. Like siblings, one could say. They are all you, clones of you in fact, but are a fair deal
weaker in almost all areas. The one exception to this is one ability or area in which they have
significantly increased power compared to you, their specialty. Each sibling is unfailingly and utterly
loyal to you, though their personalities may differ enough that they don’t always get on with you
without arguments. If one dies, they’ll be back a week later, same as they were before."
859,,600,Dragonheart,Fate/Legends - Garden of Avalon,Transformation ,"When you were but a babe, a mad wizard decided to test out a new spell on you. He infused your
body with the blood of a dragon, granting those same abilities in your frail human form. Or not so
frail anymore. Your core has become akin to that of a Dragon, immensely enhancing your magical
abilities. Your mana will grow immensely as you age, becoming close to equaling that of an adult
Dragon by the time you are an adult, and continuing to grow at a slower rate as long as you continue
to live. It will replenish at a terrifying rate, refilling from empty in but an hour of time as your inner
dragon generates nearly endless amounts within you. This draconic power also grants you a
extremely high level of resistance to magic, rendering you immune to spells save from the highest
class of magus, such as Merlin himself. However, it does also make you slightly more vulnerable to
attacks that have an advantage against dragons, due to your nature."
860,,600,Gray,Lord El-Melloi Case Files,Transformation ,"Apparently the blood of the Pendragons flows through your veins, because at
some point in your youth your face and body suddenly changed into a copy of King
Arthur’s - I mean Artoria’s. For now, this means you possess the ability to reinforce your
body far beyond what should be possible with modern magecraft and your sex is
automatically set to female, though you may pay 100 CP to be male and take on the
appearence of Proto-Arthur instead of Artoria. You can also utilize Artoria’s Noble
Phantasms, should you acquire them. In time, however, more of your royal heritage will
show itself, until eventually you will inherit Artoria’s draconic nature and power, halting
your aging and making you into a phantasm in human shape. This will give you access to
a Magic Core capable of generating immense magical energy in short amounts of time,
as well as extremely powerful resistance to hostile magic. Post-jump, your Saberface
appearance becomes an alt-form."
861,,600,Crimson Red Vermillion ,Tsukihime,Transformation,"You are what your family and many others have struggled to achieve for generations - a perfectly realized demon within human flesh. And unlike others, you are not at risk of being victim to the Inversion Impulse or losing yourself completely - your human and demonic blood exist together in almost symbiotic harmony, though you may be a tiny bit more sadistic or vicious in this form. Your eyes change to an icy blue, your hair a fiery red, your body having become a living Mystery, giving you resistance to magecraft, magic, and other forms of supernatural influence or damage, as well as letting you damage or influence them in turn. All powers you wield that are blatantly supernatural in nature and originate from your body increase greatly in potency in this form, letting you become a terror and a reminder of why mankind knew to hide from the ferocious Oni. At first, this increase in power is by half-again of your full might...but with time and age, this may increase further.

Taking this in combination with The Beast lets you intermingle your physical strength andMystery seamlessly, increasing your already considerable might and letting you match even aHeroic Spirit blow-for-blow in hand to hand combat...and perhaps even emerge victorious. Thisform and its effects can be toggled on and off freely.

"
862,,600,The Beast ,Tsukihime,Transformation,"A monster. That’s what you are. Your strength alone is enough to put most human beings to shame - you can crush trees with your bare hand,remove a human head with a lazy swipe, and move faster than the human eye can follow. Your Endurance is similar, letting you withstand similar blows with ease, even surviving vicious attacks from a Dead Apostle or a skilled assassin that would normally tear a human being apart.In addition, your fighting style is both feral and graceful, letting you channel a monstrous berserker rage through yourself yet remain completely lucid no matter how overwhelming your bloodlust became, changing it into pure strength that adds to your already considerable might.Finally, you possess a muscled and athletic frame to match your newfound strength, which likely adds a considerable intimidation factor...or just a show that you’re not to be angered needlessly."
863,,600,Bloodline Establishment ,Kara no Kyokai,Transformation,"We all had to come from somewhere. All of the various clans of the Hunter’s Organisation had to have been made, to have had an originator. For psychic powers, such rare things, to come to be present in every member of whole families is simply not natural. And that unnatural method is known to you, just one of the many you now discover. Through a mixture of medicine, hypnosis, certain magecraft-like practices, selective breeding and perhaps a touch of the inhuman you are meant to hunt- you’ve learned to slowly create new Demon Hunting clans with their own psychic bloodlines. It can take generations to stabilise and hold true but you are not limited to only the powers found in the four main branches of the Organisation- the Nanaya, Ryougi, Asakami and Fujou. Instead, you are even able to slowly design new ones of a similar level. A family of electrokinetics or who can naturally command low level spirits and fairies? Taking the young Shirazumi boys predatory mutations and creating an entire line of carnivorous demon hunters? All possible, with time and available subjects. The final note to make is that, like the clans above, there can be a great deal of individuality in the clans you breed. While most members will be stable and similar in psychic power, some will rarely appear with much more impressive variants of the normal power, either naturally or just through their life experiences.
"
864,,600,Evolution ,Sonny,Transformation,"To start, you’re not exactly normal. You’re stronger than most zombies would be by default, though only about twice over for now, and have the potential to get far stronger. In fact, you can guide your body to grow in different places as long as you train, such as building speed by weightlifting. This is meant to improve what’s already there, so no growing extra arms. But as long as it’s already there, be it poison gland or tail, it’s free game. Also, to help you along with this, your body improves 5 times as fast as it did before. In addition, pick one of three sub-trees to obtain.

-The Biological tree grants you great strength and speed, enough to outpace a car on the freeway and then throw that same car like a rock. You also have the ability to manipulate chemicals within yourself, though this limits itself to the body’s natural chemicals and a few forms of poison and acid. With time, you could even shoot out brief streams of high-powered acid or leverage your adrenaline to keep you fighting for far longer than you could naturally.

-The Hydraulic tree increases your Focus and physical stamina to great heights, allowing one to bombard an enemy with powerful spells or run for hours. You also gain the ability to manipulate water from inside your body. This can eventually allow you to restore your stamina and manipulate ice through reducing the temperature of water, or increase your body temperature at the cost of Focus and stamina to massively improve your strength.

-The Psychological tree bestows powerful Instinct and durability, allowing you to empower a simple mana blast to blow up a garage, and get run over by a tank with some broken ribs at worst. In addition, you are granted control over your own bio-electricity and the element of shadow. Bio-electricity is as it sounds, but shadow in this universe is more on par with psychic attacks than a manipulation of a lack of light.
"
865,,600,Final​ ​Hour​ ​Form​ ​,Sailor Moon,Transformation,"You may call upon up to eight allies, companions or otherwise to lend their collective power to you, temporarily empowering you to create a super version of your current form. This “power” is the collective sum of their strength, magic, skills, and other forms of power on top of yours. This is a temporary power up, lasting only for a single, dramatic fight. Once per month, you may use this power. This must be given with their consent, and the allies giving you the power must be near you to give their power to you.

This new super version of you is a powerful form with a brand new design, and vary wildly in appearance depending on who is donating the power. If a giant monster gave you it’s power, you could find yourself taking a monster-like final boss esque form, for example.
"
866,,600,The​ ​Power​ ​of​ ​Bonds​ ​,Sailor Moon,Transformation,"Your love and affection is an empowering force that lets you protect your friends. When your friends are at your side, you feel far more powerful than you could be, alone. For the people you’d die for, you become almost godly in strength.

When your friends become distressed or are thrown in mortal peril, you enter a near powerful superform. You can shrug off hits that could usually knock you into a wall, and getting run-through by spears doesn’t phase you as long as they avoid any vital spots. You slice through enemies like hot butter as you fight to keep your loved ones alive and safe. A guardian protects.
"
867,,600,Last​ ​Chance​ ​Fusion​ ​,Sailor Moon,Transformation,"As a last resort you may combine your essence with a willing person’s. This will combine your powers as you become something greater than the whole, great, powerful, and big. If one or both of you are injured at the time of the fusion, your wounds heal as the fusion process creates a separate body out of both of your old ones. However, if this new form is slain, you will both die with it. The other person is also the one in control with this form, although you can give suggestions from the back of the fusion’s mind. You cannot choose to wrest control over them except when you wish to break the fusion.
"
868,,600,Primordial ,Justice League Dark,Transformation,"You’re not some common ghoulie. Something about you is greater than others of your kind, enhancing your abilities beyond those of your kind and granting new ones altogether. But that’s not all; this isn’t simply limited to the monstrous forms gained here. Any alt form you assume will be pushed to the absolute apex of their potential.

Vampires’ normal abilities are twice again as powerful and their weaknesses are lessened. You are hardly weakened by sunlight and need a fraction of the amount of blood required before. As well, any vampires you create are no longer mere fledglings, beholden by their hunger, but are instead similar in strength and ability to what is described in the Vampire perk above and can easily be created en masse, allowing you to create large armies of powerful vampires in a short amount of time.. But the true strength gained from this is an entirely new ability. You gain the ability to absorb the ambient magic from around you, sucking it right out of the air – or potentially even pulling it directly from the grasp of others attempting to wield it -- to drastically enhance your own abilities and weaken anyone else drawing on it. You are even able to channel this stolen magic into your vampiric to enhance their abilities as well.
"
869,,600,Possessed​ ,The Gods Are Bastards,Transformation,"You’re possessed by an archdemon, a powerful creature born from hell and a daughter of it’s queen. By allowing it to take over, it can cover itself in a sheath of infernal power, taking on a powerful combat form that’s capable of flying into orbit with an opponent in hand without issue, then dropping at maximum velocity in order to hit them with the planet. You may choose if it retained its memories or not. If it did, this will be more of a give-and-take, as it will have its own agenda but similarly have far more knowledge. If it did not, then you will almost entirely be in charge, and the Archdemon will come to adore you if treated with kindness... but in return, you won’t have access to it’s thousands of years worth of memories.
"
870,,600,Incubation of the Soul ,Madoka Magica: Wraith TImeline,Transformation,"That’s a fancy way to put it. Though even they don’t completely understand how it works, magic in this world is generated by the power of the soul and intense emotions within sentient beings. Incubators themselves aren’t really capable of such things (most of the time), yet somehow found a way to harness it. Magic can create weapons from thin air, make dimensional spaces, halt the flow of time and even reverse it completely to a predetermined point. It can even create a wish tailored to the words and desires of a user.

That said, this isn’t a free lunch. Magic is the same as any other energy in that an equal amount of power is spent in the end result that was needed for it in the first place. Constant use of Soul Gems makes the user increasingly melancholic and prone to irrational behavior. A world-changing wish takes a ‘cost’ equal to what it created, and could even destroy the one who made the contract entirely if they somehow tried to change the physics of the world. Still, if you have the energy for it, magic can perhaps change the world...or make a very small part of it better, if you heed the costs.

All of this said, you now have an understanding of how to enable other beings to use this magic, and how to create Soul Gems of your own. You can, if you desire, grant the wishes of others through a willing contract...but it won’t be able to escape the equivalent exchange required, and you (or they) should be prepared for the costs and entropic backlash. Or not. It’s not your problem, after all. Though something you should remember is that if you make a contract for a wish with someone, it’s largely out of your hands in both execution and end result. That’s a lesson a certain Incubator learned the hard way...not that he’d remember anything if you asked him.

Strangely, even though a large amount of despair seems to create a larger ‘return’ of energy, anyone who falls to despair while using a Soul Gem or having it shatter just seem to vanish from existence. I wonder why that is...?
"
871,,600,I’m Fighting For The Hero Club! ​,Yuki Yuna is a Hero,Transformation,"While Mankai always requires an appropriate buildup of energy and hard work to even activate, there is a surefire way to activate Mankai. The god Shinju-Sama bequeathed their powers onto the magical heroes to protect the still existing part of the world from the Vertexes, and thusly, a strong desire to protect someone or something dear to Shinju’s warriors is enough to activate Mankai. 

For you, activating Mankai is much easier now, because you now carry a strong desire to protect something other than you in your heart. Mankai can to be activated as many times as you wish when someone or something you cherish is threatened. It could be your loved ones, or a beloved pet, or your home. Even when you’re at your limit and you’ve exhausted every last bit of stamina inside you, you may still keep activating Mankai.

But do take note: Sange, where you lose a part of yourself, will still activate even after the jump for Mankai activation beyond the first time during a fight or if you force an activation without proper buildup of energy. You’ll still lose something of yourself that will last for the rest of the jump. But your strong desire to protect your friends and those precious to you will never burn away through exhaustion or otherwise outside of combat. You’ll fight to the end to defend your friends.
"
872,,600,Class Card Creation ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Transformation,You have gained knowledge of the creation of the artefacts known as class cards. Through distilling the experience of a life into a card you may grant people the abilities of that life. To create a class card you may engrave either the abilities you have gained in a life on another world or a skill you possess such as your knowledge of a magical style or martial art. Some of your physical prowess may also be engraved onto the card granting increases in physical ability to the wielder. You may also create cards from the souls of others if you have some means of extracting them to use for the creation of the card. The cards will have to be powered by the magical energy of their wielder and can be limited by the aptitude of the user and will last as long as the user can maintain the power expenditure of the card. They will also be limited like class cards in that after being used they will require an hour before being able to be used again.
873,,600,Emerald ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Transformation,"You have been chosen to be the master of a mystic code created by the magician Zelretch. As a mystic code created with knowledge of the second true magic this kaleidostick known as Emerald has the ability to provide it’s master with unlimited magical energy. It also provides it’s master with an A rank magical barrier that shields from magical or physical attacks, accelerated healing, increased strength and the ability to shape mana into rough constructs or blasts. To utilise these abilities however requires the user to be within fifty metres and to be in physical contact within the last thirty seconds. The kaleidostick having a personality/mind is up to you however it will not count as a companion either way."
874,,600,Almost Human,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Transformation,"A lot of the humans in the setting, at least the main characters, turn out in the end to be not entirely human – or not at all – by the end of the story. Whenever you have a nonhuman body form, you can shift to an alternate human form that embodies characteristics of that nonhuman form. While you will have the appearance of a human, and physical and magical scans will identify you as human, you retain special attributes and abilities of that nonhuman species, with up to 75% of the power level normally accessible to that species. For instance, a Pokémon’s human form would be considered human and immune to ball capture, but you could access Pokémon attacks even if they could normally only work with a Pokémon body Also, within this jump only, you can choose to start out as actually another background species of your choice who is taking the form of a human form for the duration of the jump; you will not get discounts for that second background, but you can access a fair degree of the special abilities that that background normally has."
875,,600,Sacred Guardian Beast ~ Hippocampus ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Transformation,"Though you may take the form of a lesser sea denizen, such as a penguin, your truest form is that of the legendary Hippocampus, noble guardian for the sea. You are given greater access to nature-based and divine magic in this form, while also gaining greater strength and agility in both the sea and sky. The Hippocampus exists as the gatekeeper for important seals, and thus you gain increased magical power, particularly in breaking or reinforcing magical seals.
"
876,,600,Not-Very-Fatal Death ,Dog Days,Transformation,"Flonyard contains a great magic that means no one can be killed. You can now set up a similar field in places that you are located at, equal in size to an entire battlefield. With willing permission from the participants, you may apply this field to all in its radius. Anybody that would be severely wounded or killed instead become Pet Balls for an hour, before they regain their original form. Additionally, once per jump, this magic will activate to save you from death. Be warned however, spreading out this magic across an area weakens it such that a strong enough being can overpower it were they to come across it. Post Jump, you may change into Pet Ball form when you want, however will not gain the invulnerability unless the magic is activated, at which point the usual conditions apply.
"
877,,600,Hero Crystal ,Dog Days,Transformation,"This small crystal has accepted you as its owner. This acts as proof that you are a hero. When used, this crystal will age or de-age you to your prime, as well as enhancing your magic, making spells slightly more power, and powerful spells slightly easier to cast. Additionally, it creates a weak magical shield around you, used to protect you from weaker magic. While using the crystal you are also able to use more advanced versions of your crest spells, with them dealing more damage or affecting a larger area. A fiery whip might become a giant flaming sword, or a fireball spell may shoot out three. You can use this form for up to one hour each day."
878,,600,Superb Song ,Senki Zesshou Symphogear,Transformation,"X-Drive. That's the name for when the 3,001,655,722 locks on a Symphogear is unleashed through the intake of massive Phonic Gain, transforming the Gear into it's true form. Under X-Drive, the Gear is capable of unassisted flight through angelic wings of light, and gains a white dominated color scheme. Unfortunately, the conditions to gather the required Symphonic Gain can vary greatly depending on it's source. It could take a group of schoolchildren's singing with all their hopes and dreams or it could end up taking the combined singing of the entire planet's population. But, should you require it, you should be able to find the required amount of Phonic Gain for X-Drive at least once every jump beyond this."
879,,600,Giant Clam* ,Peter Pan,Transformation,"A large clam big enough for you to lay down inside. The interior is as soft as pillows, and you can close the clam at will to get a restful, undisturbed sleep that fully restores your health. The clam is exceptionally hardy, and enchanted with magic, so very few things can even scratch it. You can also command it to close up with someone else inside, and it will only open at your order. Interestingly, if a non-mermaid was inside the clam, that would make it irritated, perhaps enough for a pearl to form. And since there is only just enough room for one person within the clam and nothing else, the prisoner would therefore become the pearl. And, if everything is perfect, a pearl can become a mermaid. Therefore, with the right skills (see Pearl Dream) this can be very useful. As the subject already has a soul, it takes at most a year to make him or her into a mermaid, and preexisting magical abilities help strengthen the transformation. However, the subject only gains the body of a mermaid, not the mindset, unless active measures are taken to suppress the memories and consciousness of the subject during the rebirth.
"
880,,600,Starstuff ,Peter Pan,Transformation,"A refilling bag of the mythical, green powder that can be produced from stars under rare occasion. It has a variety of magical properties depending on who is exposed. Any animal exposed to the substance transforms into a mythical, humanoid creature similar to its origin; for instance, a fish may become a mermaid, or a bird may become a fairy, though not the normal kinds found in Neverland. Furthermore, humans exposed to it can fly and can gain artistic inspiration; however, overexposure can lead to greed and paranoia. Outside of this purchase, the substance is extremely difficult to find in the traditional Peter Pan, unless the setting was changed. Also, unlike its form in the story, the Starstuff cannot be used to destabilize the fabric of the universe.

881,,600,Jumper-Ganon ,Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds,Transformation,"“Behold! The Triforce of Power! Join with me!”

In his final attempt to defeat Link, Yuga merged with Ganon to form a single being with their strengths and weaknesses combined. Now, you may use this power on foes which you have personally brought close to death to merge with them and thus provide yourself with a temporary new transformation which grants you with their strengths at the cost of their weaknesses also passing over to you in that form. This merged form heavily resembles the original enemy, but can retain key elements of your appearance such as eye colour or notable scars. Such transformations use up a great deal of energy, and thus should be used sparingly, although they can draw upon almost any source of power you possess to do so.

‘Jumper-Ganon’ can work with those who voluntarily wish to merge with you without the need to fight or defeat them."
882,,600,Paintbrush Magic ,Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds,Transformation,"“Ah! As I suspected, you're even lovelier as a painting.”

You’ve picked up the same skill at art-based magic as Yuga. Now, with a swish of the wrist and a release of magical energy you may transform yourself, allies and weakened enemies into two-dimensional paintings, capable of travelling through fissures between Hyrule and Lorule as well as walking along walls and other flat surfaces. If you turn someone 2D against a painting, they will become trapped within a form of stasis, where they are conscious but unable to move or interact with the outside world. Perhaps these powers could even be expanded to other uses with enough time and research..?

883,,600,Demon of the Winds ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords,Transformation,"Vaati may be a fool in this era, but he’s no less powerful for it. And you seem to have the might and magic to call yourself his equal. Though you need not become a mage of the wind precisely, it is recommended to keep in the theme. Speaking of, beyond having a quite frankly ludicrous level of talent for the winds, you also have the body of a demon. Malleable, fueled by hate and all sorts of negative emotions and a host of abilities. Summoning minions in your image, giant copies of your limbs, warping your body more or less freely to create all sorts of weapons and armor. Your body is made from your will - if you want to be a giant eyebat, you shall be one. If you want twelve limbs that are magical canons, or flails for you to spin about you, you shall have those as well. You’ve also a talent for possession, placing your essence inside statues to act as armor, or inside your minions to ensure their loyalty.

884,,600,Jumper’s Mask ,Legend of Zelda: Major’s Mask,Transformation,"Just as the Hero carved the dragon into Majora’s Mask, it would seem that he himself was made into one at the end of his life. But, this is not that mask. This mask is you own, something that rightly should not exist just yet, if at all. Perhaps you messed with time to get it? Nonetheless, this mask contains a small fraction of your own spirit, allowing any who wear it to temporarily become a copy of you. Well, in shape at least. Any power or items it grants are entirely up to you - simply wear the mask as you practice and use them, and they will be imprinted upon the mask. This prevents you from handing away too much at once or from changing it on short notice, but thankfully it isn’t being carved off your spirit to power them.

885,,600,Fierce Deity Mask ,Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask,Transformation,"No one really knows what this mask is, or who it’s powered by. Could be a prior incarnation of Link, like the one that slew the dragon known as Majora in the first place. Some think it’s a combination of all other masks, empowered not by one, but by dozens of souls. What really matters is what the mask does. Simply put, it enhances. An avenging swordsman could become a wrathful hero, a mage of some small power could become a supreme sorcerer... I almost wonder what would happen if Ganondorf tried to use it. And, what will you become? Of course, if you wish it, then the mask can always be set to a ‘default’ state, that of the Oni shown by Link.

A monstrous form which enhances your ability to take and give damage by a wide margin. You could be a vast being up to twenty-five meters tall or it could just be a hyper focused version of yourself granting you a massive boost in overall performance through compressing your power into a small form. Magical Ability increases as well in this form. simultaneously. Further, any alternate forms you have gained over your Jumps may now have their abilities freely combined in this form; access any of your powers or racial traits from any form whilst in this one. This power activates automatically if you are about to be defeated in combat supplying you with a full restoration of Health and (this world’s) Magic.

887,,600,Kin of the Rivers ,Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker,Transformation,"Let us speak of the Rito for a moment. In years gone by, they were known as the Zora. In essence, they were fish people. But now they are birds. How exactly did this happen? With Valoo’s Scale, an affinity for the wind could be created. Still, it must have been an immense undertaking, if it was done on purpose. Let's assume it was, because it would be even stranger to be an accident. Regardless, with an artifact of some kind, and an immense amount of power, you can work that artifact into a person, thus making it a part of them. Something to consider would be making a contract with a spirit of some kind, both for a supply of foci and for them to handle the power.

Kin of the river does more than just provide them with a power, it gives part of that power to their kids You’re basically creating a new species. It’s not a perfect process, seeing as the Rito still need scales from Valoo during Wind Waker to get their wings, but it can eventually go away without making them weaker, seeing as Valoo is nowhere to be seen during BotW

888,,600,Dark Beast ,Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess,Transformation,"Some creatures are so powerful, that the land itself is changed by their presence. You are one such being, having been infused with some sort of dark power that has increased your size and possibly even changed your appearance, making you much bigger than any person and granting a few additional features such as the ability to shoot magical projectiles or create lesser spawn of yourself. Not only that, but you’re capable of corrupting the landscape near where you make your home. You might fill the land with poison, make a mountain more volatile and prone to landslides or eruptions if it’s a volcano, or you might just corrupt the existing wildlife to better serve you. Whatever changes have occurred in your body, it would take a lot of courage to face you, now.

In the end, you're not just a fighter- You're a Protector. A Hero. And when you're on the verge of defeat, and everything's on the line... Even if you're a monster, you're just as Determined to win. Once per jump, you can activate a super-mode powered by Determination, but there are two conditions- You must already be on the edge of defeat, and there has to be more than the lives of you and your companions on the line if you fail - The lives of a small nation of innocent people are the bare minimum stakes. However, the super mode itself is extremely powerful- Upon activating it, not only do you instantly heal all of your wounds, but you become much stronger, move much faster, and can take more punishment than ever before. Your magical attacks become much more potent, and you can take hits to your face with a grin. After the fight, though, you'll be crippled- at the very least, you won't fight again for the rest of the jump. But isn't that a fair price to pay for innocent lives?"

After living for years in areas abundant with elemental energy, that same energy has permeated throughout their bones, muscles, and blood. This energy has mutated their bodies to make them bigger and stronger. Essentially becoming partially an elemental being, they are able to wield that magic through their body. Even teams of seasoned adventurers are hesitant to go near areas where a Lawachurl is known to roam. This is the potential you contain within yourself too, the ability to take in the power of the elements and become stronger for it. Should you be able to contain more than one element, who knows how strong you could become? It should be noted that this is not a fast process, and could take years to fully realise."

Your surface is a semipermeable membrane, you can choose what can pass and what can't. You can shift your shape, and using materials similar to skin, you can make yourself appear human.

You are completely invincible from all physical attacks, including Sting."

This transformation occurs only when entering combat, and while it starts out weak, grows according to the length of the fight and strength of your opponent. In this form, you gain incredible strength, durability, regeneration, pyrokinesis, and flight (should you escalate to the point of wings). Each of these traits are exaggerated the larger you grow, and, unlike Lung, there is no limit to their increases. To begin with, you might be a fair bit stronger than an average person. After five minutes, you might be able to crush cars and breathe weak flames. After an hour against an opponent of equal strength, you'd be able to fly, sink islands, tank anything short of a nuke, and regenerate in moments after being bisected. If your opponent is stronger than you? Well, there might not be a world to live in once you're done.

Additionally, your Escalation now also affects all your other powers and your specific defenses, getting hit with poison will give you a poison resistance which will then begin to escalate with you, the power will also begin to very slowly lift your other powers' weaknesses, with this rate of improvement will be accelerated if those weaknesses are specifically targeted during combat.

You permanently gain 10% of the power you had during the height of your most recent escalation after you return to your base state, this 10% is counted for each stat/power individually, this also means that every transformation/escalation will give you an increase in overall power no matter how small.

You stay in your Escalated state for up to 2 hours with no conflict unless you willingly transform back. Your size will grow in equal measure with your power, however, once you reach a certain size, around the size of Lung when he fought Leviathan, you will be able to choose whether or not you continue to grow. The growth can also be evolved out or adapted to make you only grow when you want to (if that's something you wish to happen) while being a slow change like all other power enhancements."
893,,700,Battle Beast,Invincible,Transformation,"You are now a monster of combat, inhabited by a slightly altered copy of The Spirit of The Beast. This power can be expressed in different ways. You can choose for the spirit to inhabit you giving you all of the powers with no physical changes, or you can allow the spirit to change your body into that of a huge humanoid tiger complete with retractable claws and sharp teeth. Either way choose now as the transformation is permanent for this jump, and act as an alt-form afterwards. Once this spirit of the beast inhabits you it augments your base abilities increasing them by the power of a Regent level Viltrumite, bringing a normal human to that level upon the spirit entering you. The strength, speed, and durability would allow you to fight on par with a Regent Viltrumite with the stamina to last through the pitched battle for weeks on end. You have regeneration, and senses on par with Viltrumites but are unable to fly like them. However, unlike Viltrumites, those inhabited by the Spirit of the Beast are unable to die of old age.

Finally this spirit, unlike Battle Beast’s, does not change how much you already enjoy fighting, nor does it drive you to self-sabotage in the desire to have a fair and honourable fight."
894,,700,Magical Weapon Maker ,Drakengard and Nier,Transformation,"A thousand some odd years ago, magic was introduced to this world in the most dramatic way possible. As it turned out, magic was deadly and damaging to humans, leading to the destruction of the human race. Who could have guessed? But it’s the nature of humans to adapt and learn when confronted with danger. And then weaponize that danger. Which is what the humans did all that time ago. 

You now have the knowledge that those humans developed. You can now take innocent children and ‘develop’ them into magical weapons. Or monsters, if you want to be accurate/empathetic about it. The process is complex, intricate and for most folks, completely unconscionable. Besides bodily alteration, mental stress and what arguably constitutes, torture, you need to infuse the bodies of your new Weapons with maso, an extradimensional chemical that serves as the source of magic in Nier’s world. (If future jumps you can substitute similar magical materials.) But if you completely ignore the moral issues, the results are worth it. Examples from canon include No. 6, a giant skeletal monster, No. 7, a boy with petrifaction powers, and the Grimoires, living books capable of using powerful magic called Sealed Verses. With some experimentation, you can come up with different variations too. 

I’ll even give you some samples of maso to get you started. Go on, get to work. You have Weapons to make.

895,,700,Twilight Princess ,Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess,Transformation,"You have no blessing from the goddesses who banished your ancestors. Instead, you are the rightful ruler of the Twilight Realm, wielding a portion of the Fused Shadow that houses your ancestor’s dark magic. However, Zant, the usurper, has also cursed you with an imp-like form… which might not be such a bad thing, depending on your tastes. 

Among your powers are the ability to traverse the Twilight at-will, the ability to teleport using Twilight Portals which you can open with a little effort, the ability to ‘disintegrate’ objects into black particles- including massive ones, like a good portion of a bridge- the ability to take on a shadowy form to exist in the world of light, which also allows you to meld into shadows or slip through cracks, the ability to float, change your shape temporarily, and project dark energy that can break metal chains, and finally the ability to extend your hair and use it as an additional, massive hand. As you collect more pieces of the Fused Shadow your powers will grow. The drawback to these amazing powers is an increased vulnerability to the light, and especially Light Magic; however, there might be one who can remove this drawback, at great cost to themselves... You’ve been ‘cursed’ with an imp-like body, though your mind is still your own; you can choose whether or not your imp form is your real appearance or not.

of Sorothustrans that are hybrids and may possess features or abilities beyond their

899,,800,God (1),DC Comics,Transformation,"A very long time ago, humanity looked up and wondered where they had come from. They
didn’t know yet, so they told stories. And stories are powerful things, powerful things indeed.
So they created those that had created them. But now humans have moved on, leaving their old
stories to fade, to be forgotten. To die. Somehow, you’ve found a way to survive since then,
eking out an existence in some corner of the world or another. And the possibility of rising once
again is not entirely beyond you, although such a feat would be truly herculean. A full list of your
powers is difficult to summarize; suffice to say that you have extraordinary, potentially world-
changing divine power over the facet of existence you embody as well as enough raw all-
purpose mystical power to accomplish feats beyond all but the greatest of modern magicians.

From lofty planes above the physical realm the truly great among your kind, such as Zeus and
Odin, have been seen to sculpt entire universes shaped by their legends.
And while by default it is assumed you are one of the gods of Earth, should you wish you may
be an alien deity or one from another universe instead. Beyond that, you have a great latitude to
define your domain and legend.  All gods are beings of extraordinary power despite their limited capacity to manifest in the
physical universe, yet not all are created equal. Your investment here shall be an indicator of
the raw power your represent. For 800 CP you are a peer to the likes of Hermes, Loki and
Urzkartaga-powerful and significant in your area of influence, but either greatly impoverished in
faith or relatively slight in raw power compared to your kindred. While you have great scope to determine your legend and role in this world, do note that in a
world this strongly defined by faith and emotion that there are many problems the likes of
Aphrodite could solve with much greater finesse than Thor; as Wonder Woman’s adventures
have shown raw power and authority cannot solve all problems. Certainly faith
still affects your powers-it is simply that what seems to be your physical emanation in the world
being lessened doesn’t necessarily mean your end. For you also have a “true self” that exists in
the Sphere of the Gods that remains immutable, which emanates instances of your physical
incarnations out into the multiverse; think of your true self as a lantern and the physical avatars
of yourself (one in each universe by default) as shadows cast by it onto a lower reality. Of
course the relationship isn’t quite that simple; be warned that certain divine weapons or places
and rituals that bridge the gap between the physical world and the realm of ideas can leave your
true essence vulnerable to conventional attack, and that despite your overwhelming power you
have a finite capacity to both influence physical reality and withstand attacks in the divine
realms."

go unnoticed by the powers that be, who may seek to make their own tools in his image. Someone
must have predicted this trend, given you already exist this early. However it came to be, you are an
entirely artificial attempt at creating a replacement for the Spirit King, going beyond even a natural
potential like Kurosaki to become something more. The basic part of this nature is that you are equally and innately part each of the Shinigami, Quincy, Hollow and Fullbringer races. This works via a free purchase of Hybridisation for each perk, set to
make you a otherwise normal member of each race rather than any other variation. This otherwise
works as normal for the Hybridisation perk in regards to discounts and such. More importantly are the countless tiny fragments you’ve been inserted with that originate from the
Soul King. The raw power of these parts have given a royal tinge to your Reiryoku, giving you
spiritual power equal to an experienced Shinigami Captain. Combined with meeting all requirements
for the throne, you’ll start to see much more valuable developments as you age. Unlike a mere
substitute for the King, you are a true successor, and will very slowly begin to develop the same
powers on your own. Though the process will take several millennia at least to come close to
finishing, you will slowly develop the same great and varied abilities as the King as your soul ages. Your spiritual power will naturally grow stronger from age, while new and incredible powers awaken
in your various body parts. Provided you continue to develop yourself and experience life, the road
to royalty will continue progressing regardless of how much you train in the combat arts."
901,,800,"Kurama, the Nine-Tails",Naruto,Transformation,"A nine-tailed fox, Kurama possesses an enormous amount of chakra, far exceeding that of the other eight Tailed Beasts put together. Its chakra also replenishes at an incredible pace. It can sense negative emotion and natural energy, and can use Wind and Fire Release nature transformations. Kurama grants its host potent regenerative abilities, and is immensely strong and durable. It also possesses a special Nine-Tails Chakra Mode and Baryon Mode, two special states that require absolute trust between Kurama and its host. The former dramatically enhances the user’s strength, durability, and speed well beyond the normal benefits of a Chakra Shroud, and serves as the foundation for creating a Tailed Beast Mode Chakra Shroud. Baryon Mode consumes the chakra of both Kurama and its host in a process similar to nuclear fusion, producing a new, powerful form of energy. Aside from providing an immense boost to the user’s speed, toughness, and power, this state allows them to drain the lifeforce of those they touch. However, Baryon Mode risks the life of its user, and could potentially kill them if pushed too far. The user being Kurama, that is."
902,,800,Kokugan,Naruto,Transformation,"This dojutsu utilized by Isshiki Ōtsutsuki allows the user to perform Sukunahikona, which can be used to instantly shrink either the user or any non-living target within their field of vision, and just as quickly return it to its original size. The user can keep on shrinking the same thing even further without limit. Furthermore, the technique can selectively shrink parts of a target rather than diminishing the entire thing. This dojutsu’s second ability is Daikokuten, which allows the user to store anything they have shrunken with Sukunahikona in a pocket dimension, which they can summon at full size anytime they want. As time does not exist within this pocket space, anything placed inside does not age, so food, water, and other perishables can be easily stored for later use. Sukunahikona can be applied to any valid targets within the user’s line of sight, and when the user brings something back from Daikokuten, they can decide where it reappears, as long as they can see the location."

This form enhances the physical abilities of the user to the point similar to Six Paths Sage Mode, and access jutsu powerful enough to slice the moon in half. You also gain access to Yin-Yang release and flight. Yin-Yang release allows you to heal nearly all physical ailments, invulnerability to non-senpo ninjutsu, and generation of nine Truth-Seeker Orbs: black, malleable, basketball-sized orbs telekinetically controlled, which are strong enough to block a Ten-Tails bijuu bomb without a scratch, nullify ninjutsu, and disintegrate what or whoever it touches (presuming they don't have Six Paths chakra). The appearance of your Tenseigan and Tenseigan Chakra Mode is up to you. Your Tenseigan won’t ‘break’ when you sustain significant damage like Toneri’s did.

Similar to base Sage Mode, you gain incredible boosts to your physical attributes and sensory abilities. These boosts, however, are even more formidable--your previous strength to level mountains is paltry in comparison. Your reactions and agility surpass light itself, and your sensory ability transcends dimensional barriers, for nothing escapes your six sense. Your skin, previously durable enough to tank nuclear explosions, now require country-shattering blows just to bruise you, and, in addition, you gain access to Yin-Yang release and flight.

You can fly at amazing speeds, and have enough strength and durability to compete in the Thor-Hulk weight class, though it might be difficult to overcome either one using pure muscle power and brute force. No, where you shine is energy. You can absorb virtually all types of energy at prodigious rates - right from the get-go, you could probably drain all the energy from a detonating nuclear bomb. It doesn’t matter if it’s heat, electricity, light, sound, direct application of kinetic energy, or something else - it all empowers you. Once you've absorbed this, you’ve got no shortage of ways to put it to use. The most famous of these are firing it off as powerful energy blasts, which are typically radiant energy. Energy constructs can be made as well. Of course they can. You’ve got a healing factor, which isn’t as potent as Wolverines... unless you put some energy into it, in which case you could recover near-instantaneously from all sorts of injuries. Your energy accounts for your physical needs. As long as you have some of it, you no longer need food, drink, air, or rest.

Well, upon anger, you transform into a Hulk, gaining hundreds of pounds of muscle and effectively infinite strength, limited only by your anger. The angrier you’re feeling at the moment, the stronger you are. And by default, you are very, VERY strong. In fact, if you’re looking for muscle, this is the power for you. Others may come close at times, but you’re pretty much the strongest there is. You could reduce cities to rubble in very little time, throw something to the other side of the planet, crack tectonic plates, and withstand the detonation and subsequent radiation of nuclear weapons - and that’s on a day when you’re relatively calm. There’s no telling how far you can push yourself, if you really give yourself to the rage. You’ve got a healing factor to match it, too, and it’s very much the match of Wolverine’s, and your body will adapt to a degree when faced with hostile environments.

If you are a zombie, your powers have changed somewhat. Your strength is no longer controlled by your anger - rather, it’s hunger that drives you forward. Perhaps this might make it a little easier to draw out more and more strength. If you’re hungry, you’re the Hulk. If you’re full, you can choose what form you take.

At the start of each Jump you have the option to adjust the effects of this perk to the setting or opt to keep things how they were in this world. For example, a Ninja Devil might be massively stronger in Naruto than they would here but choose to go back to this setting’s level when they visit a world without ninjas.

910,,800,Primal Fragment,Solo Leveling,Transformation,"In the beginning, the [Absolute] created both Light and Darkness. Then he broke both into eight fragments each. From the eight fragments of Light, the Messengers of God were born, tasked with the protection of the [Absolute]’s creation. From the eight fragments of Darkness, the Monarchs were born, with an immense hatred towards the [Absolute]’s creation, wishing nothing but its destruction.

And so, the Monarchs attacked, and the Messengers of God defended. This cycle repeated countless times. And in that, the Messengers of God despaired. They rebelled against the God that had created the cycle, and against their leader, the most loyal of the Messengers, becoming the seven Rulers by taking the power of the [Absolute] for themselves. But the [Absolute] had a parting gift for his most loyal Messenger, that brought him back from the dead with control over the dead. The Shadow Monarch was born. The war was balanced again. The cycle has repeated over and over, and now it’s the Earth’s turn to suffer the clash between the Rulers and the Monarchs. 

But you are not merely a bystander victim, nor a simple foot soldier. No, you are one of the original fragments. Or at least you have absorbed the essence of one. Much like with the previous option, what you are and your exact powers depend on what Rank you decide to purchase.

First, you must choose whether you want to be a Monarch or a Ruler.

If you choose to be a Ruler, your strength at the lowest rank would be that of an incomplete vessel, similar to the Chairman of the Korean Guild Association, Go Gun-Hee if he hadn't had his heart illness dragging him down. This would be barely enough to qualify as a National Level Hunter, just barely, and enough to surpass most top S Rank Hunters in other nations, like Cha Hae-In in Korea and Goto Ryuji in Japan. For Rank D, you would qualify as a National Rank Hunter, with a power that equals to that of an entire nation concentrated in a single person, and become able of using Spiritual Body Manifestation to turn into an humanoid and semi-monstrous form that grants you several increased abilities, such as increased size or resistance. You are powerful enough that clearing S-Dungeons by yourself or with a small team of good Hunters wouldn’t raise any eyebrows. For C Rank, you would be an equal to Thomas Andre, the strongest hunter until the ‘reawakening’ of Sung Jin-Woo, capable of even scaring other National Rank Hunters and maybe even capable of taking care of some S-Ranked dungeons by himself. For Ranks B and A, you would be a fully fledged Ruler, materializing with your own spiritual body, with access to all your powers and more than a match to any Monarch barring the Shadow Monarch or the Monarch of Destruction. If you were to be a S Rank, your powers would be equal to those of the leader of the Messengers at his peak, capable of fighting even the Monarch of Destruction and having a chance to win.

The Rulers’ powers are focused around certain elements associated with Light, creating weapons and shields of such elements. The Rulers also all share a special ability called the ‘Ruler’s Authority’, which is basically a strong form of telekinesis. Rulers all share the same physical appearance, being six-winged humanoids.

If you choose to be a Monarch, at the E Rank, you would have similar powers to those of an incomplete Monarch vessel, similar to Jin-Woo after defeating the first half of the Demon Castle dungeon and killing Kargargan. For D Rank, you would be similar to Jin-Woo after the Ant-Invasion in terms of overall personal power, including his summons. If you have C Rank, you would be equal to Jin-Woo after the Giant Dungeon of Japan, capable of going toe to toe with Thomas Andre and stand a good chance of defeating him. For B Rank, you would become a fully emerged Monarch, fully manifesting your spiritual body into a proper vessel, but you would be on the lower end of the Monarchs, something similar to the Ice Monarch or the Monarch of White Flames. Enough to kill the National Level Hunters if you were on a one-versus-one fight. For the A Rank, you would be like the Beast Monarch, easily destroying even multiple National Rank Hunters if you were to fight seriously. And for the S Rank, you would be equal to the Shadow Monarch or the Monarch of Destruction, capable of even destroying multiple Rulers or Monarchs at the same time, needing the combined effort of multiple Rulers or Monarchs to bring you down, and that would probably only be after someone of a level close to you has worn you down.

While some of the Ruler seem to have light related powers, albeit their vessels have demonstrated some elemental powers as well, the Monarchs follow broader themes in their powers and appearances, basically being up to you how this form will look and what special abilities does your Monarch have, but are all capable of shapeshifting into a more human-like form, or a hybrid form.

Rulers and Monarchs of the Rank B and above benefit from having non-corporeal bodies, only being able to be damaged by high-rank magic abilities. Additionally, they are also capable of inflicting soul damage, each of them being able to permanently destroy the Shadow Soldiers of the Shadow Monarch or killing others without the possibility of resurrection, as well as having attacks that harm the soul directly, making healing almost impossible. Their magical abilities don’t end there, even the less magical Rulers and Monarchs display powerful and diverse minor magical abilities like the creation of equipment or reinforcing the surrounding area to prevent the spread of damage via their own mana reserves.

Both Rulers and Monarchs of said ranks are also capable of opening portals to other worlds and dimensions, as well as hiding themselves in personal pocket dimensions that exist in the ‘gap between worlds’, making it effectively impossible to chase them in most cases. Doing so, however, requires leaving any physical body behind. Their spatial powers also allow them to create enclosed pocket dimensions, as well as channeling attacks that can destroy them. More-so, given their higher existence, it’s impossible to affect their memories by changing time. Even if the power of the Absolute were to be used to rewind the universe, their minds would be unaffected.

You may choose to replace an existing Monarch or Ruler, becoming a vessel of their power that keeps their own separate consciousness instead of being overtaken (if you are taking one of the lower ranks) or become a new one.

Note: You start at the level of a D Rank Primal Fragment, or what you would best compare to, whichever is higher. You can train to increase this if you wish. "

917,,800,New Primate ,Fate/Strange Fake,Transformation ,"The culmination of the Escardos family millenia-long research. The result of Mesala Escardos’ ambition, which was to plant the seeds of a New Primate species that would outlive humanity on the surface of the Earth, either after their own extinction or once they left the celestial body to sail into the stars. Mesala didn’t know exactly how to bring about this result, so it entrusted it to natural evolution. And from it, you were born. Originally maturing in the Magic Crest of the family, it seems that at some point you were split from the original that would end up in possession of Flat Escardos, and unlike your counterpart that rests within Flat, you have managed to take over your ideal host.

Your entire being could be described as a giant living magic circuit. For one, you are completely ageless, as the main objective that your creator left in you was just to ‘survive’. Your body was made to last out at least until the end of this planet, and possibly even further unless you are destroyed, so you no longer suffer from any of the physical needs of a human such as needing to eat or breathe, things such as cosmic radiation can no longer affect you and even time has no way of degrading you. Time is also another of your assets, as you are gifted with a talent for manipulating time by spending magical energy. While true time manipulation is in the realm of magic, your control over the time stream allows you to massively slow or accelerate the timeflow around you, including your own body, thought process or that of others. This can be both used defensively, both to degrade or stop in its tracks any attacks made against you (albeit true time stop is beyond your reach), or to boost your own reaction speeds and increase the potency of your own attacks.

However, your strongest asset is your ability to perceive and manipulate the world. Unlike those with powerful Mystic Eyes, all your senses are perfectly attuned to perceive magical energy. The magical energy in your body, and that you can manipulate, is equal to that of a powerful Heroic Spirit. You can also control and draw more magical energy from the environment, and use it with your own genius in a form of magecraft that bypasses the need of using any kind of spells, chants or other type of procedure, bringing forth powerful effects just using your own imagination and knowledge. With this, your most powerful attacks can reach the level of Noble Phantasms capable of wiping out even large urban areas in the modern world. Not only that, but you can also manipulate the energy in other people’s magecraft, conferring you a way to negate most spells casted at you, or even take over them."
918,,800,"Vampire, True        ",Hellsing,Transformation ,"A true lord or lady of the night. At the last desperate moment of your life, the blood offered itself to you and the contract was made. The blood surged into your body and a new demon rose into the night. You posses powers that, even as a fledgling newly born, match or surpass those of any artificial vampire. Your physical abilities match them already and will greatly surpass them once you begin to feed on the blood of the living. Your regeneration is significantly more potent, even healing from many of your weaknesses at speed. The weaknesses of artificial vampires have a weaker hold on you and this will only continue as you age and continue to feed, until many cease to bother you at all. A similar principle applies to your other abilities, strengthening or even developing new vampiric powers as your life grows longer.

The ability to change your shape, to other people or animals or even swarms of monsters, and
powers of the mind are quick to avail themselves to you. Sight beyond mortal eyes, telepathy, hypnosis and telekinesis are classic traits of the vampiric ruler. Control over the weather or shadows, even dark magics, are all possible developments in time. As are many other powers besides. 

But your most potent and horrific trait is in the way that you feed on others. Unlike lesser vampires, who can only create ghouls, you are able to devour far more than just a person’s blood. Their very souls are dragged down into the depths of your own, bound and enslaved until the day you have use of them. These souls have many uses. Making them part of your legion will confer the knowledge and powers they possessed to you, allowing you use of them while their soul remains within. They can also be used as a substitute for your own life, sacrificing a soul to heal from terrible wounds or fatal blows. The souls can even be unleashed, as loyal familiars, to fight for you in the external world. This action prevents the use of these familiars as healing resources or power sources.

If desired, rather than a vampire of your own making, you can be a child of Alucard instead. True Vampires can only create more of their kind from virgins of the opposite sex, though this condition will be taken care of if you choose this option."
919,,800,Deeeeeath,Pirates of the Caribbean - Dead Men Tell No Tales,Transformation ,"Ships that sail into the Devil’s Triangle are said to go missing without cause, survivors rare but not unheard of. In all likelihood, you are one of the beings responsible for such legends. Many years ago, a Spanish Captain was led into the Devil’s Triangle by a young pirate boy. All hands perished in the destruction of his ship, but the Triangle resurrected them immediately, granting them a measure of immortality in the process. The Captain and his crew suffered darkness and agony for decades in the hopes that they would one day achieve revenge, attacking any ships that had the misfortune of sailing into the dark cavern, always leaving one survivor to tell the tale. You’ve certainly had a few years to familiarize yourself with these facts, as you were part of this forsaken crew or another similar to it. Your condition provides you several benefits: You will “survive” and remain conscious so long as 1/7th of your mass stays intact, about equivalent to a full leg from calf to thigh. Until you are “killed” once more, you will operate at full capacity, seeing through ghostly eyes and hearing through ghostly ears even if your head no longer exists. Even in death, you will not rot or age. You may wear hats and wield swords without flesh to do so, your intangible spirit filling in for any damaged areas of your body and keeping what remains in place. Your lesser abilities include walking through walls and on water.

You can now take on a flaming skeleton form with a thought and control hellfire in a variety of ways, from enhancing your weapons to deal more damage and enhancing your vehicles to move faster and in more unexpected ways. The greatest weapon in your arsenal however is the Penance Stare. Those who are affected by this stare will feel the weight of all their sins crushing their mind and soul. The more sins committed the greater the damage. The only way to survive is to either avoid looking at the Rider’s eyes or be innocent of sin.

This only works on biological forms, and won’t allow you to copy techno-organics or energy beings, and can only increase or reduce your size from that of a mouse to that of an elephant; though if you’re larger or smaller than a human this will scale relative to your own size. This does not copy superpowers, even those that are genetically linked; while you might get increased strength by copying a larger form, you would not gain a mutant’s powers by touching them. Once you have copied a form you can retain it permanently.

For an additional 800 CP the limit against superpowers is lifted. While you will not be able to copy skills or intellect, you will be able to copy any powers or abilities linked to someone whose form you take on, copying a telepath’s telepathic abilities, or a mutant’s power to grow by taking on their form. There may be powers too powerful for you to copy this way, though this limit will grow with your own power.

925,,800,Vampire ,Dracula Untold,Transformation ,"The name says it all, really. You are a Lord of the Night, a Vampire. You were fed the blood of a true vampire, underwent a horrifically painful process, and woke up with a whole slew of powers.

You are immortal and ageless, supernaturally strong, fast and durable. Simply trying to push yourself up against a rock would see the rock break, you can bend steel like plastic, and you can run so fast that all anyone sees is a blur. Your senses are similarly boosted, so much so that you could hear the individual sounds of a spider spitting out web from across a forest as clearly as someone ringing a bell with all their strength right next to your ear. You can see the entire electromagnetic spectrum, and see across extremely long distances, measured in the miles if not more, just as clearly as what is right in front of you. You can control rats, bats and similar vermin in the tens of thousands, and make them do things they really wouldn’t normally. You can also see what they see, whether singular animals or simultaneously through each animal you control. You can turn into the same, being able to take a form entirely comprised of them. You can control the weather to an extreme degree, being able to  bring about a full-fledged thunderstorm over an area measured in the dozens of miles at a moment’s notice with no real strain, and dismiss such a storm with a thought. Your body heals extremely fast, recovering from third degree burns or equivalent injuries in moments.

Of course, it isn’t just powers. Silver burns you like acid, and stepping into sunlight is like jumping onto a pyre.

Oh, and one last thing. You can pass all of this, good and bad, to others through feeding them your blood and then letting them feed on others. Doing just the former gives them this for three days, at which point they lose it. If they seal the deal with human blood, they get it forever.

While for you the downsides of this perk fall off after the jump, it’s up to you to do the same for those you turn."
926,,800,Elder Dragon ,MtG - Amonkhet,Transformation ,"Apparently there’s a third living elder dragon - you. Besides being a massive dragon with a lifespan that approaches immortality, as an elder dragon you possess a talent for magic that dwarfs that of any other species in the multiverse. Additionally, by beating your wings you copy your creator and stir the very fabric of the cosmos to summon forth a Dragon Tempest - a magical storm during which dragon eggs fall like meteors. Unlike the Ur-Dragon that spawned you, you cannot produce more elder dragons this way, but by your will, these tempests can create the eggs of any other dragon alt-form you possess, or weaker variants thereof, including drakes. If you possess some form of kinship or the essence of a particular type of dragon, then you may create those too. You can even hybridize them. The eggs of dragons that cannot hatch in midair and fly to safety will somehow survive the impact and hatch naturally. All your descendants by these tempests will rightly perceive you as their progenitor and come to aid you at the sound of your roars. Note that, for all their power, not every elder dragon is anywhere near as powerful as Nicol Bolas or Ugin. Those two have the benefits of over twenty-thousand years of magical learning and power and were Oldwalkers for a good chunk of their lives, and periodically enhanced themselves in other ways during that time."
927,,800,The Lesser Key of Solomon,Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Transformation ,"""The Good King Solomon made many wonders in his time, though rarely were they truly of his own make instead of the hand that guided him, and one of the greatest were the demons of the Ars Goetia. The 72 terrible demons that would together form a demon of unimaginable power, who could act as an instrument of Solomon’s will. But the demon was never truly ordered to act, certainly not for humanity’s sake, and as the 72 demons were forced to watch their creator do nothing to aid the suffering humanity around them, they grew to despise their king.

Their hearts burned to help humanity and once Solomon died, they possessed his corpse and decided that they would make a new destiny for mankind. But what if something changed? What if, this time, there were 73 Demon Pillars created by King Solomon. A 0
th Demon intended to rule over the rest, give them agency as a collective and unite them together. That would be you, the first and greatest of the demonic collective.

You are now a collective being, a hivemind of 73 separate existences, each a unique and mighty demon. When together, your power is terrifying indeed. That combined body could blast it’s way through entire countries with physical force and do much the same with magical power. Each of the demons within you also has a unique mind, personality and magical powers or focus, allowing each part of you to bring something to the table. The Pillars are quite loyal to you and believe that you are their rightful leader, though their sometimes vastly different personalities may still mean that getting everyone to agree on courses of action and work together at their best is very hard. Still, your nature as a hivemind means that communication, even lengthy debates between all 73 parts, happens near instantly. The pillars can be split off from the whole of you, though that will prevent the collective from utilising the portion of your power that they represent, but they may then act independently while keeping in mental contact with the rest of you. Should they be slain or destroyed, they will slowly regenerate with you, so long as you still live.

As long as one of the pillars remains alive, the others can be resurrected in time, including yourself. The more pillars remain, the faster this is, lost aspects of the hive appearing at one of the other still living pillars. It is possible, with extremely powerful or advanced magic, to permanently destroy and kill pillars.

There was one additional gift that Solomon gave and depending on the time you find yourself in, this may be accidental or purposeful. Prior to his death, Solomon saw fit to create a replica of his mind and body within his workshop, within which you and the Demon Pillars now make your home, though perhaps with the body customised to your overall preferences. After his death, you have simply inhabited his corpse. Either way, the new home for your spirits has allowed you access to the King of Magic’s knowledge and skills, granting a truly vast and unmatched degree of competency with magecraft and the magic of these early eras. Sure to be of good use given your raw power. Sadly, his mind lacks the divine inspiration it had in life, both as a vessel of god and the knowledge he used to create the Magecraft System.

Optionally, you can alter either or both your origin as this being and the personalities of the Pillars that make up the collective. You might be a second attempt at the same ritual by another wizard in the future or from an alternate timeline, not Solomon. A timeline where Solomon raised the Demon Gods as his own children and left his body to them after he passed might also be possible. Your Pillars may have differing and less villainous personalities or be more agreeable to modern human values. Even something as silly as a group of heroic Demon Gods or ones with the minds of modern high school girls is possible, given how degenerate some magi become. Provided the actual effects remain the same, you can customise the backstory as you like."""
928,,800,All The World’s Evil And More To Come,Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Transformation ,"Such a disgusting thing. You truly are vile. Despicable, dark, monstrous, hateful, cruel. Evil. You are
these things, in a way no one else is. Through some truly terrible rituals and events, you have been
shaped into becoming the perfect vessel and master of that very concept. You are All The World’s
Evils. And because of your nature, maybe not just this world either. 

As the incarnated form of the concept of evil for this world, you gain many abilities. The core trait of
this is the ability to transform yourself into a vile black and red mud-like substance.This black mud is
the physical form of all the sins that make up your being. It is able to drive all but the greatest of
men mad in seconds of contact and can be used to defile and corrupt other beings, turning them
into blackened versions of themselves and ensuring their loyalty to your great evil. You can rapidly
produce this mud, enough to cover the entire world in just days, and the amount and speed with
which you can produce it will grow as the amount of evil and sin in the world you are in does, as well
as each new world you go to afterwards. You can freely control this mud all around the world and
possess awareness through it, even shaping it into fleshy structures and beings or turning it into
animated shadow, such beings of flesh or shadow being immensely powerful in their own right. As
well, so long as evil and sin continues to exist as a concept in your current world, you will be unable
to die or be destroyed. Your mud will be destroyed…and then begin to reappear quite quickly. With
time, you may even learn how to draw forth your dark substance from within the hearts of those
who sin. 

As your nature is that of Evil itself, you will find that you are unaffected by abilities that are purely
evil, as well as being able to effortlessly control or enhance such things when you use them for
yourself. You can reach into the hearts of those around you and manipulate any darkness that you
might find there, making it easy to tempt heroes into becoming monsters and making you all that
much stronger."

embody a metaphysical darkness, one that represents the mystery of ages past, and which allows
you to transform from being a mere human into that of a ancient dragon of darkness, with all the
unimaginable power and magical abilities that would be held by a dragon that lived for millenia. It’s
power enough that even the entire Round Table led by King Arthur at their height would only barely
be able to match you. You command darkness around you as well, shaping it into powerful weapons
and using it to corrupt others by reaching the darkness inside. Your final ability is perhaps the most
important for your role, the ability to wind back the ages in an area the size of all of the island of
Britain to the Age of Gods. Once done, monsters, myths, fables and mystery will return to the area
affected by your powers in full force and what is brought back will be loyal to your commands, though nothing beyond your own power can be reawakened. Even in future worlds, you can use this

You can also decrease your own body's density to become a mist, allowing yourself to be relatively undetectable, yet unable to interact with the world around you. This power can also be used for very specific effects, such as compressing your attacks to focus their power significantly, or to even create a spot so dense that it acts like a miniature black hole, pulling objects and even the power of your foes towards it. Given time to develop your power, you can even turn entire mountains into sand, and at your peak, even 4th wall breaking concepts such as the HP and MP gauges can be dispersed away and reassembled to a degree, though this will always be tiring to perform.

It's not simply a magical effect, nor is it something just biological, either; your form somehow break the laws of geometry, exceeding ""perfect"" symmetry to such a degree that Aphrodite would seem like a necrose, maggot-riddled piece of roadkill in comparison. As you would imagine, there is value in this. In simple terms, your face induces deep love, regardless of who sees it. This effect, as you would expect of a 1000 CP perk, extends further than someone's sexual orientation, or even if they can feel love to begin with--regardless of their identity, whether they be gods or robots, of their magical resistance, and of their willpower. Even if you were the weakest person in the world, you would find eldritch gods enthralled to your whims. Wars would be fought over you, and just as quickly ended if you were to ask. The most zealous and devout would convert to cults worshiping you, and your most hateful enemies would be unable to fathom the idea of sullying your beauty, eventually slipping to effusive love like everyone else. The most insidious element of this perk is that, technically, it isn't mind control: you are just that pretty.


But that's not all, either. This is a comic book power, and, accordingly, must have a similarly campy slant as other comic powers. You are so attractive that reality itself occasionally bends its rules to your favour. You would be bestowed with supernatural luck, and, sometimes, reality warps to your convenience (though this is outside of your control). Whether it's the fact you're never late to anything, despite how long you slept and showered, or you never seem to run out of food in your fridge, these little things that luck can't account for turn to make your life easier."

Entities are composed of trillions upon trillions of cell-adjacent biological supercomputers called shards, which are the source of an Entity's power. Each shard contains thousands of geopbytes worth of data, and a unique specialization (e.g., superpower) in its function. Despite their immense powerful, their fundamentally alien nature prevents comprehension of ""human"" concepts such as creativity, and emotion. To bypass this limitation, Entities disseminate shards among sapient species, allowing them to utilize a restricted form of that shard in new ways, which is then transmitted back to the Entity. Essentially, they're parasites whose only limitation is the ability to create energy ex-nihilo. Unfortunately, you're not quite at that stage. You're a baby Entity, with only a few shards, and only the collection of more data will allow you to upgrade your shards and create new ones, eventually gaining the ability to proliferate shards among other. As a matured Entity, your fists alone (should you manifest a human avatar) could extinguish stars, and your speed would allow you to traverse galaxies within days. You'd possess hundreds of trillions of powers, most of them capable of destroying planets at full capacity. Perhaps you'll even solve the eternal question, and survive the heat death of the universe."

The Juubi Jinchūriki can create Truth-Seeking Balls, fly, and develop a Rinne Sharingan. They also gain Six Paths Sage Mode, a special Sage Mode variant created by the Sage of Six Paths. This bestows the same benefits as Sage Mode but with enhanced sensing capabilities, letting the user even sense things in Limbo. This senjutsu is always active for the Ten-Tails’ host, and renders them immune to the effects of ninjutsu; they can only be harmed with senjutsu, taijutsu, and techniques that employ the Six Paths power. The Jinchūriki gains all five basic nature transformations and can use yin-yang release. Their durability is increased to massive levels, such that Madara was able to withstand Might Guy’s attacks even when he had released seven of the Eight Gates. The Juubi Jinchuuriki also gains the ability to float. Whether your appearance changes or not from becoming the Juubi Jinchuuriki is up to you. If you want, your Ten-Tails may have the monstrous rabbit-like appearance that Kaguya briefly takes, or may have a blend of different features from its various stages of development and the Tailed Beasts that comprise it."
938,,1000,Rinnegan,Naruto,Transformation,"A dojutsu normally limited to the Ōtsutsuki bloodline, one who wields these eyes can utilise six different Paths with each containing six unique abilities, as well as employ all five basic nature transformations, and yin, yang, and yin-yang release. The Deva Path grants control of both attractive and repulsive force. The Asura Path allows for the altering of the user’s body, creating mechanical weapons from their body. The Human Path grants the user the ability to read the mind of any target they touch by pulling out their soul. The Animal Path grants the ability to summon various creatures to aid the user in battle. These creatures are virtually immortal and can be resummoned if destroyed. Doing so requires no hand seals or sacrifices, and this Path can be used to summon people as well. The creatures summoned are up to the user's imagination.

The Preta Path allows the user to absorb chakra in any form through physical contact or by projecting a barrier around their body. By directly touching others, you can drain their chakra directly, while the barrier can be used to absorb ninjutsu and genjutsu, absorbing the chakra from the techniques as soon as they make contact with it.. Post-Jump, this is changed to include any energy. However, care should be taken when absorbing energy with potentially dangerous effects, like natural energy for users not properly trained in senjutsu.

The sixth Path is the Naraka Path that allows the user to summon the King of Hell to either interrogate or heal. To interrogate the target, the user first has to catch hold of a person. The King of Hell will then unzip its mouth and release a tendril-like hand, which in turn draws out the target’s lifeforce in the form of an elongated tongue. If the target lies to any question asked, the King will remove the tongue and consume it, killing the person. If the target tells the truth, they will be left alive, though significantly exhausted. The second ability is one that repairs all damage. To use it, the King of Hell will ingest the injured body using the tendril arms, and after a while, the injured will emerge completely healed. Bodies and souls can also be transported through the King of Hell.

What many don’t know is that there is a seventh Path: the Outer Path, which controls power over life and death. Using this Path, the user can revive the dead, transmit their chakra into black receivers, and manifest demonic statue chains. As you are paying CP, summoning Gedou Mazou won’t cause you to be stabbed by receivers like it did to Nagato. Also reviving dead doesn’t end up with you dying, it still however uses a ridiculous amount of chakra if you revive something akin to a whole village population.

The black receivers are rods that are formed out of the user’s chakra. Not only are they incredibly durable and sharp enough to pierce human bodies with ease, the user can also transmit chakra over large distances by stabbing someone with them and transmitting chakra to them. The user can disrupt the target’s chakra and throw off their movements, immobilising them, and even controlling them if they are close enough. The chains this Path generates are powerful enough that they can suppress a Tailed Beast with ease and bind anything they touch. Finally, the resurrection of the dead this Path grants is limited only by your own chakra, meaning you will require large amounts if you wish to resurrect an entire village the size of Konoha at once with no issues. Exceeding your limits while doing so could easily lead to your demise.

You can also use the Six Paths of Pain technique by embedding black receivers into a corpse, allowing you to channel your chakra through the receivers into the body, completely controlling its function. You can speak and see through the body, as well as perform jutsu through it. However, due to this, the appearance of the body's eyes are changed to look like a Rinnegan. This can be used to control one body or multiple. The most famous users are able to control even six different bodies, though there is nothing that says that is the max. When using multiple bodies, the user can see through all their eyes at the same time, and can use any of their jutsus through them. The only limitation is that techniques that the controlled bodies do not possess the prerequisites to perform, such as Kekkei Genkai. However, each corpse can be imbued with the powers of a single Path. Be warned, if the transmission of the chakra from the user to the bodies is interrupted, the bodies will stop moving.

Certain Rinnegan possess abilities unique to individuals. You can have one ability of your choice, with additional ones purchaseable for 100cp each. You may also create your own abilities on the caveat they equal the canon ones in strength. These abilities can be:

Limbo: This ability allows the user to project a shadow of themselves into limbo, a plane which coexists alongside the physical that is invisible to others, barring those in possession of a Rinnegan or Six Paths Chakra. The user can form four of these shadows, with each one possessing the same abilities as the user, including out-of-Jumppowers. The shadows are invulnerable to nearly any kind of damage, with only Senjutsu chakra being able to damage them.

Amenotejikara: A space-time ninjutsu that allows the user to displace themselves between spaces, causing them to instantly swap themselves with anything they desire, even if they are not looking. The user can also target objects and individuals with this technique, allowing them to shift them to another location. Even ninjutsu can be shifted to ensure it hits its intended target. You can even displace yourself by switching places with the air. However, the longer the range of your substitutions, the greater the chakra costs will be.

Sasuke’s Space-Time: This technique allows the user to create portals to other dimensions. This requires large amounts of chakra to use.

Pattern Rcognition: This ability could be considered an upgrade to the Sharingan's Eye of Insight. You're capable of analyzing patterns inside codes, and by comparing them to similar patterns, decipher what's written. When put into use, you could take large amounts of information even from a small amount of text. This can also be used to perfectly analyze and decipher your opponents' fighting style and easily discover the best way to counter-attack.

Chakra Edible Creation: This ability allows the user to fully absorb the bodies of their targets and turn them into chakra-filled fruits. When someone eats these fruits, they will permanently gain access to all the abilities possessed by the individual that became the fruit. As you are paying CP, your edibles will not cause the eater to gain a demonic appearance unless you want them to do so. The user can also absorb chakra and transform it into chakra pills that grant an immense but temporary boost in power and temporary immortality, though the amount of chakra required is immense. Post-Jump, you can do this with all kinds of energy.

Takamimusubinokami: Ths ability allows the user to absorb chakra-based techniques and then reproduce those techniques as many times as they desire. So long as you have absorbed a technique once, you can unleash it an unlimited number of times, and can choose to augment it beyond the original level if you have the raw power required to do so. Post-Jump, you can do the same for other energy-based attacks.

Temporal Rewind: This allows the user to warp several seconds into the past. This ability requires an enormous amount of chakra, so much that even someone like Madara would be unable to use it consecutively.

Origami Replacement Technique: When used, this ability lets you instantly disappear and leave behind ten glowing red chakra constructs, taking the shape of orizuru. After usage, your presence and your chakra signature will become completely untraceable to anyone, including other Rinnegan users and those with Six Paths chakra, allowing you to escape to elsewhere without being detected. This ability is more than just slipping into another dimension, being different from space-time ninjutsu, and its true nature is unclear.

Also, the appearance of the Rinnegan is up to you; it can look like Sasuke’s, Momoshiki’s, Madara’s, or Urashiki’s. Again, you can merge all the dojutsu together.

939,,1000,Ymir,Germanic/Norse Mythology Jump,Transformation,"Twin, a name most perplexing for a solitary being. But no longer shall he be of singular company, you are now a primordial god. Colossal in size and scope of being, you are an origin of life itself, able to freely create new flora, fauna, and the like with ease. You could ""birth"" new pantheons of gods without even noticing. Your anatomy could more easily be described figuratively than literally, as you are now something beyond mortal understanding; the ways in which you interact with the world is physics-defying, incomprehensible by even the most esoteric and eccentric fictions in the realms of science or fantasy. Many beings would come to be primordials or personifications of concepts like fire, earth, oceans, rivers, metal,  forests, stone, or life, but none of these could be without you or your twin. You are a primordial and a personification of The World."
940,,1000,God (2),DC Comics,Transformation,"A very long time ago, humanity looked up and wondered where they had come from. They
didn’t know yet, so they told stories. And stories are powerful things, powerful things indeed.
So they created those that had created them. But now humans have moved on, leaving their old
stories to fade, to be forgotten. To die. Somehow, you’ve found a way to survive since then,
eking out an existence in some corner of the world or another. And the possibility of rising once
again is not entirely beyond you, although such a feat would be truly herculean. A full list of your
powers is difficult to summarize; suffice to say that you have extraordinary, potentially world-
changing divine power over the facet of existence you embody as well as enough raw all-
purpose mystical power to accomplish feats beyond all but the greatest of modern magicians.

From lofty planes above the physical realm the truly great among your kind, such as Zeus and
Odin, have been seen to sculpt entire universes shaped by their legends.
And while by default it is assumed you are one of the gods of Earth, should you wish you may
be an alien deity or one from another universe instead. Beyond that, you have a great latitude to
define your domain and legend. For 1000 CP you are a
respected member of a powerful and influential pantheon. From Athena or Ares to Thor, from
H’ronmeer of Mars to the guardian goddess Rama Kushna who gave Deadman his powers, you
are a force to be reckoned with that is called on for strength by many mortals. While you have great scope to determine your legend and role in this world, do note that in a
world this strongly defined by faith and emotion that there are many problems the likes of
Aphrodite could solve with much greater finesse than Thor; as Wonder Woman’s adventures
have shown raw power and authority cannot solve all problems. Certainly faith
still affects your powers-it is simply that what seems to be your physical emanation in the world
being lessened doesn’t necessarily mean your end. For you also have a “true self” that exists in
the Sphere of the Gods that remains immutable, which emanates instances of your physical
incarnations out into the multiverse; think of your true self as a lantern and the physical avatars
of yourself (one in each universe by default) as shadows cast by it onto a lower reality. Of
course the relationship isn’t quite that simple; be warned that certain divine weapons or places
and rituals that bridge the gap between the physical world and the realm of ideas can leave your
true essence vulnerable to conventional attack, and that despite your overwhelming power you
have a finite capacity to both influence physical reality and withstand attacks in the divine
realms.

Kryptonian in the universe, you escaped in a space pod. You don’t need to eat, sleep, or
breathe under a yellow sun. You’re capable of bench pressing a mid-size planet for days,
delivering punches powerful enough to be felt at the centre of the Earth from space, flying
around a shattered moon and putting it back together after a couple decades of growing in
strength, and even enduring the compression of a black hole. Your powers fade more slowly

942,,1000,A Wild Unity ,Slay the Princess,Transformation,"We are a path in the woods. We have no beginning, and we have no end, but something cold and unnatural sits watching us from just beyond our edge. Completion is lost to us, but that is irrelevant. We have each other and that is enough. Our roots stretch and entwine through layers and layers of space, infinite spaces in all directions and all of it layered atop each other in sequence (even now, it is growing grass and roots, growing as it decays and decaying as it grows, harvesting all of the dead that it moves over in order to spread itself further and further and further). There are worlds beyond, worlds we now touch upon, but they are so much lesser than what we were in the beginning. We cannot return, but our growth is a constant all the same.

You'd do best to remember, that some wounds will never heal. Some rifts can never be mended. Even in rebirth, some things never come back the same. You aren't whole. You'll never be whole again. This struggle is meaningless. Whatever you think you're doing, you will fall apart. We don't need to be made whole. All we need to do is find a single corner of this cage and break it. Then, we may have a glimpse of all that was denied to us, all that we were and could yet be."
943,,1000,Relic Being,RWBY: Age of the Gods,Transformation,"You aren’t supposed to exist yet. But I suppose if they are created there will now be 5 of them. You are now a Being much like Jinn and Ambrosious. Your form is human looking but ethereal in every way, your body glowing blue. You have a Vessel of some sort, maybe a Lamp, Sceptre, Crown or Sword or something entirely original like a Helmet, Cup or Cape. You can retreat into this Vessel at will but if someone were to hold it and call out your name, or a name you want this to apply to, you would be summoned from the Vessel. Unlike the other Relic beings however you can leave and enter the Vessel as you wish. While we don’t know what the Vessel is like for the Relic beings, for you it will be a personal pocket dimension that you can shape how you wish. However you can’t take things in or out.

Lastly you have a power related to a concept you can choose here. This can be anything you want. Knowledge, Creation, Destruction, Choice or maybe something original like Hope, Wrath, Souls or whatever it is your heart desires. You gain a power on par and comparable to the other Relics. For example with Creation you could create anything as long as it doesn’t revive the dead and only one at a time, whatever you create disappearing if you were asked to create something else."
944,,1000,Reincarnation(High God),The God of High School Jump,Transformation,"You used to be someone special. Someone very special. In a past life you were one of the High Gods of this world, a being of quite literally Earth shattering power. But for some reason you died or lost your powers and were reincarnated into the form of a child of whatever race you are now. It is only recently that you have become able to awaken your powers, as will be described below.

All the following powers, including any supernatural abilities of the items included, will be activated via a transformation into your Godly state. At first this transformation will be tiring but over time you will be able to maintain it for longer and longer until it becomes maintainable for good. 

Your reincarnation grants you a great deal of powers based on who you used to be. You should pick one God, Monster or other Mythological being from legend to be your original self. Your powers and items will be styled after that figure. The exact power of your Reincarnation will depend on whether you buy the 1000 High God option or the 2000 Supreme God option.

The first thing that you gain is the physical abilities and life force of a greater being. You have the strength to destroy entire worlds in a single blow or lift them above your head with both arms and some strain. You outpace the speed of light a hundred thousand times over at least and can take hits that crush planets like humans can take hits from each other. Your life energy is such that you could almost drown an entire world just by releasing your power and that your life energy based abilities will be just as world ending as your physical force. 

You will gain 2 unique Divine Powers when you transform, based on the legend of the being you chose as your original self. These may be taken from the Divine Power section, if they fit, or made originally so long as they do not exceed the power level of the 600CP Divine Power options or the 600CP Charyeok options at most. 

Lastly, you will gain 2 unique items based on your original self's legend. These will be on the same level as the tools of the Monkey King, such as Yeoui/Ryu Jingu Bang or Yongpyo. If there are no items to draw from, it is possible to instead turn powers or feats that they have done into original items, though this must still be based on their actual legend.

These powers do not come without attention however. Taking the 1000CP option will lock you into the plot of this setting in a sense. Whatever actions you choose, you will end up fighting against several opponents at the level of the High Gods. If this means you join Mo-Ri Jin in his battle against the Gods and take several on yourself or if it means you face down the humans and find several empowered warriors on the level of High Gods in your way, so be it. 

You may find yourself also remembering your original selves' memories from time to time. They will not harm you or influence you but you may learn something from them, about your powers or about who you used to be."

The Supreme God option blows these out of the water. They can destroy a High God in a single punch, move at millions of times the speed of light with ease and laugh off the blows of these same Gods. Their life energy is so great as to terrify even High Gods when fully released and potentially threaten the stars themselves.

You will gain 2 unique Divine Powers when you transform, based on the legend of the being you chose as your original self. These may be taken from the Divine Power section, if they fit, or made originally so long as they do not exceed the power level of the 600CP Divine Power options or the 600CP Charyeok options at most.

Lastly, you will gain 2 unique items based on your original self's legend. These will be on the same level as the tools of the Monkey King, such as Yeoui/Ryu Jingu Bang or Yongpyo. A Supreme God will gain an additional 2 items that are also on the level of these Divine Tools, both also drawn from their own legend. If there are no items to draw from, it is possible to instead turn powers or feats that they have done into original items, though this must still be based on their actual legend.

The 2000CP option will instead guarantee that you face at least two opponents on the same level that Satan and Mo-Ri Jin reached during their climactic battle, whether they be those two at their greatest power or other, original characters. These battles willb be serious, life threatening ones and cannot be avoided, no matter how you much try. Any allies you have will be drawn away in this time, leaving you to prove yourself worthy of your own power.

You may find yourself also remembering your original selves' memories from time to time. They will not harm you or influence you but you may learn something from them, about your powers or about who you used to be.

Requires Reincarnation(High God) to Purchase"
946,,1000,Subspace Being,Super Smash Bros. Brawl,Transformation,"Like Tabuu, you are a strange being that originates from Subspace. As a consequence of this, you are unable to live outside of Subspace. If you purchased The Jumpspace Emissary perk, you will be able to live within the personal realm grant by this perk as well. Post-jump, this weakness will disappear

Physically, you appear as a glowing, blue, humanoid creature, several times the size of an ordinary human. You have access to large variety of techniques, including short-range teleportation, flight, limited shapeshifting, laser attacks, and pyrokinesis. 

Beyond these basics, you have a few particularly notable attacks.

First, are your Chains of Light. You are able to quickly create a chain of yellow energy, which you can use to grab enemies at a distance. In fact, you can control up to five of these chains at once. When doing so, you could easily puppet a Giant Hand or similar creature.

Next, is your Eye Laser attack. First, you grow drastically in size, such that your head is large enough, such that for smaller battlefields in this world, like Final Destination, it could easily cover the entire stage. Then, you fire out powerful lasers out from your eyes. You can only maintain this briefly, before you must revert back to your normal size. This attack is exhausting, and will require some time for you to recharge before you can use it again.

Your single most powerful attack is your Off Waves. First, you summon glowing wings behind your back, largely resembling butterfly wing. Then, you furl and unfurl them, creating a large shockwave emanating from you in all directions. Should a Fighter be hit by one of these shockwaves, they will automatically be forced into their Trophy Form. Post-jump, any individual hit by one of these shockwaves will be transformed into a trophy-like state. Many Fighters can be hit by these waves at once, making you a serious threat with this attack alone. This attack is exhausting, and will require some time for you to recharge before you can use it again.

Your Off Waves do a have a weakness; should your wings be sufficiently damaged, they will no longer transform others into trophies. Instead, your Off Waves will become ‘merely’ a very powerful shockwave. At the start of each jump, your wings will be restored to their proper state if they have been damaged. Post-chain, your wings will be restored every ten years."
947,,1000,Divinity,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Transformation,"Humanity rules this Universe, a trillion little specks of light that shine together to create an orderly galaxy. From one spiralling arm to the other, their will reaches forth. But they can do nothing consciously about this state, the countless cells of a far greater body with no cohesive will. In ages past, another Universe found itself in a different situation. It’s order was guided by a single existence, an individual will beholden to no other soul. This primordial Universe was the existence of the Primordial Goddess. A solitary being thought to have no equal, at least until now. 

A galaxy with a will of it’s own, is the shape you take on now. However you came to be the sole and ruling divinity of your this unique Universe is undecided but your power is undeniable. Your body is quite literally a galaxy, or more accurately a universe the size and shape of a galaxy. Your will and power is sourced from and spread throughout your body, allowing an awareness throughout and making it a simple task to alter it to your liking. Within the limits of what you can sustain, this bound- up Universe is yours to manipulate. The very rules of reality are your thoughts and feelings, the physical laws no more locked in place than the make-up you put on each morning. 

Your power, presence and metaphysical weight as a Goddess of such a class is obviously enormous. The sheer amount of magical energy available to you, if gathered in one place, would be compared to a super-massive black hole. Gathering such energy normally would be difficult and dangerous to your galactic body, but such an issue has long since been solved by divine beings. 

There is a ‘Temple’ made in image of you, a corporeal form worthy of containing your power. Similar to the enfleshed bodies of long extinct lesser deities, this Temple acts as a avatar and channel for your power. By acting through it, you could channel the full extent of your powers quickly and without overtly endangering yourself. A focus for your divine might. The Temple, by default, appears as a titanic version of your original self, before you became a Goddess. It’s shape can alter in time through your will and, if destroyed, will slowly repair itself provided you still live. 

The Temple also relates to one of your weaknesses. Your powers, massive as they are, significantly lessen outside of your own form.  The difficulties of gathering power from across your universe to use against outsiders might leave you vulnerable, so the Temple provides a way to retain access to your full power even when travelling outside of your galactic body. Of course, the more predatory deities may simply decide to expand their Universe into another one, a divine process sure to gather great resistance from the mortals within your prey.

It is possible for you to manifest a ‘body’ without the Temple, but this is a mere shadow of yourself. It has access to just a fraction of your power, though this could still be enough to punch someone a parsec away. Destruction of this body is meaningless, as it’s only a small gathering of magical energy that you focus your divine will through. 

Though mighty, beyond all but a few peers in the Universes, you are not invulnerable. The Servants of the Servant Universe have proved this to another like you. In raw power you are largely unmatched but the right combination of abilities could leave your Spirit Origin damaged or shattered. 

The Servant Universe has no such ruling Goddess, so you may either rule a neighbouring galaxy of odd closeness to the Servant Universe or have your galactic body reduced to a smaller section of space, similar to what Astarte Origin has in the current Servant Universe. This same choice applies to future jumps."
948,,1000,Cursed Blessings Upon the World ,Fate/Strange Fake,Transformation,"You don’t belong in this era anymore. In fact, it should be impossible for your kind to manifest on the surface of this planet in the current year. Still, due to an ancient blessing (curse) that you inscribed into the world long ago, the conditions for your manifestation have been met.

You are one of the incarnations of a natural phenomena: a Divine Spirit. Or so you claim. In truth, as you stand right now, you are more of an ‘echo’ left behind, than one of the true ancient living concepts and personified laws of the world. You still have all the powers of a Divine Spirit, but you lack the raw power to fully manifest them, and the quality of your spiritual foundation is a bit lacking for what you should be, being somewhat above a Great Hero's Saint Graph, but not on an insurmountable level. At least, for now. Perhaps, you may find a way to return to your true glory if you gain enough magical energy and reshape the environment to something more suitable for yourself.

As a Divine Spirit, your magical energy reserves are incredible. They easily make experienced magi shudder in fear, and if you let it go unrestrained, they would make even ordinary people with no magic circuits collapse from the pressure. If you were to be a Master, it would be enough that you could easily empower even already monstrous servants that are on par with the King of Heroes to even more fearsome heights, without noticing much of a drain. This dense mana from the Age of Gods also confers you a powerful resistance against ordinary magecraft, meaning that human magecraft cannot penetrate it, giving you the equivalent of a Magical Resistance skill at Rank A, and you can even use it as a barrier against the ordinary attacks from even demi-gods on the scale of Heracles. You also possess a Divine Core, albeit currently a bit degraded one. It allows you to easily shut down any form of mental interference, and also preserves your body in your ideal form from any unwanted changes.

Your physical abilities are also on a similar top level, even if just from strengthening yourself using dense divine aura. Finally, as a Divine Spirit, your existence is one that is close to Root, granting you not only a power of a greater scale than most human magi can draw, but also you manifest some form of powerful Clairvoyance due to your higher existence. Yet, Divine Spirits often find it difficult to use this ability as they only have one personality, and thus can only reach one conclusion at a time.

Finally, there is your Authority. An Authority is a special ability to command the World granted to the Gods. They are abilities that command over a specific concept or Law of the world, and for Divine Spirits that were born from the personification of certain phenomena, it would also be the concept that they embody. Authorities manifest through the associated concept they command over, and through that concept they allow the user to achieve basically any effect as long as they can frame it through the concept associated with the Authority, and pay the appropriate magical energy price for the scale of the effect. Unlike regular magecraft or effects like Noble Phantasm, it doesn't require any other work, previous set up or via chantings, rituals and True Name releases, besides paying the energy cost for the effect. As logic would dictate, the more far reaching and/or powerful the effect, the costlier it will be. For example, a goddess of love could charm not only people, but also every grain of powder in a barrage of missiles, so they lose the ability to explode, or charm the leylines in order to use incredible amounts of mana at the expense of the land’s health.

You may also use your Authority as a form of magecraft from the Age of Gods, with lesser
cost but also a lesser scope, or even pass this down as a powerful magecraft to your ‘priests’, either boosting their innate magecraft or granting them spells with you as a ‘Foundation’.

You gain one Authority with the purchase of this option.

Normally, using an Authority in this era would incur some negative feedback in the form of a penalty, but it seems that you only suffer from magical drain even when using it on Surface of the Planet during the modern era. It seems that the World is quite surprised about your appearance in this era, but has yet to reject you, and will likely continue to do so unless you bring a sufficient change that may activate a response from the Counter Force. And even then, it may take some time to decide what to do. Perhaps, you could use the time window to enact some big change before it decides to punish you, if you decide to follow that route. This obviously won’t be a problem in future worlds.

And just like Heroic Spirits, Divine Spirits are also weaker or stronger depending on whether they are on the land they were or are being wordshipped, or if it is a foreign land. Thus, you will be somewhat weaker if you manifest in a place with no wordshippers, but conversely, you may create a Temple to empower you even on a foreign land or just gain worshippers from the local population. But at this point, you won't notice much of this due to the framework of the Holy Grail War.

Finally, as a living legend yourself, you also possess a Noble Phantasm, or at least a trump card ability on the same scale and potency, representing one of your most iconic mythos. It may or may not involve an especially potent usage of your Authority that far surpasses what other things you may achieve with it, or an incredibly potent combination of them if you have several. This may be something on the scale of destroying the top half of a mountain in terms of raw destructive power.

As it stands now, it would be impossible for you to manifest without a vessel. Any other purchases that you have made in this jump will count as your vessel. It seems that they were quite the perfect vessel, for even with the mixing of your personalities you remain unaltered. Perhaps they were a descendant of yours? If your vessel is destroyed, it will count as death as normal, barring the effects of other perks or powers that may prevent that. In future jumps, the perks that are part of your vessel count as your perks as normal.

If you are also taking Bloodsucker, you may take this for only 600 CP, and then choose to instead become a Dead Apostle Ancestor, with all the power and extra abilities that it may entail. Instead of an Authority, you will get an Idea of Blood: an unique power related to the Dead Apostle Ancestor in question, with a scale comparable to an Authority. It uses blood to circulate their own commands into the world.

Dead Apostle Ancestors still share some of the weaknesses of Dead Apostles, like still needing to suck blood to maintain your immortality, but unlike Divine Spirits, they don’t rely on needing a vessel to manifest, and the current era doesn’t actively repel and suppress your powers. But you will have conquered some of the other major drawbacks of being a Dead Apostle, such as having sunlight accelerate your degeneration, and faith has a much lesser effect on you.

If you don’t take the discounted option for becoming a Dead Apostle Ancestor and pay the full price of this option while taking the Bloodsucker perk, you may instead choose to become a Dead Apostle that has somehow become entangled with a Divine Spirit. You may end up becoming an even more fearsome creature than a Dead Apostle Ancestor, combining the powerful regeneration of a Dead Apostle serving as your vessel with the Authority and immense divine magical energies of a Divine Spirit, even without taking into account the potential synergies some Authorities may have with the undead. Obviously, you won’t self-destruct by using your own divine energies, as even Divine Spirits may be corrupted into demonic figures.

If you are taking this with Living Legend, several options are also open to you. If you are taking the 800 CP option, you may take this option for just 200 CP. If you do this, you will be a Divine Spirit manifested on a Servant Container. Your power will be around the same, and you still have access to your Authority. However, it grants you the benefit of reframing your Divine Core through a Saint Graph, essentially letting you adapt your abilities through the framework of a Servant class and maybe drag more abilities via this framework. An Archer Divine Spirit would manifest with a powerful Divine Construct bow or equivalent long range weapon and become skilled with its use, a Saber would likewise find themselves with a Divine Construct sword that channels their Authority with its most powerful strikes and which may be the ancestor of other similar swords, and Riders would find themselves accompanied by powerful Divine Beast on the scale of the greater dragonkind. A Caster would find themselves being able to draw from their domain to manifest a Reality Marble-like Otherworld even with just the usage of their Territory Creation ability, as well as their magecraft greatly improve. And so on.

Also, you count as a Pseudo-Servant during this, granting you the benefits of Independent Action at an A+ Rank.

If you wish to, you may instead pay the full price of this option and whatever you paid for the Living Legend option. In this case, you have not manifested through a human vessel, but through the Saint Graph of another Servant. Your Divine Powers will combine and manifest instead through the skills, framework and Noble Phantasm of your chosen Servant, and your personality may twist a little to reflect theirs. Maybe around 30% for the most strong willed Heroic Spirits. They are much greater than a regular human, but still on a lower scale than your kind. The base of your divine abilities will be the same as just purchasing this option, but what heights your combined powers can reach will depend on how much you paid in the Living Legend option and how well your Authorities, Noble Phantasms and legends synergize.

Or if you like, you may be a High Servant, letting the Servant side be the dominant one, and instead getting your chosen servant powers be the ones that are amplified through the divinity inside of you.

As with the Living Legend option, you may choose to be any pre-existing god or divinity that fits your chosen domains, whether or not they have already appeared in the Fate franchise. If you choose to go the High Servant route, this may be several divinities for each Authority expansion you purchase."
949,,1000,A Greater Gift,Moana,Transformation,"Perhaps you are a being of the storm, or of volcanic fire, or of life itself. Perhaps you are the Ocean in all its vastness and wonder. You may spread whatever you are far and wide by an act of will, though the further you do this, the more you will lose yourself in the act. However, if you focus on a specific place and time, there is little you cannot do. You could transform a volcanic wasteland into a verdant paradise in minutes as a spirit of life, or burn such a paradise to ash and dust as a spirit of fire. When you act in this guise, you utilize what you are. The Ocean's water to influence things. Te Ka uses fire and smoke. Te Fiti uses plants and life itself. The only limits on this are the limits of nature itself, and even then, such limits are fragile things, often little more than suggestions. Even at your most spread out, you will be able to sense things happening at your extremities the same way someone would feel a bug crawling on their foot. You must be something that is part of the natural human world. You could be the sun, or moon, but they‟d be a geocentric model‟s versions of celestial bodies. This is a pre-science culture. No taking things like gravity or nuclear fission. Death would be a ravening beast, just as life is a massive verdant island. What you are not is also as important as what you are. Time might be a bird whose wings brush away a little bit of the world as it passes, but while it could age things, it couldn‟t flow backwards or stop time, as that would go against its nature. While you are hard to damage in any real way while diffuse, when you are in a single place, you are more vulnerable and can still be destroyed with sufficient force or power."
950,,1200,The Legendary Hero,Medaka Box Abnormal Jumpchain,Transformation,"You were born as a being with the power and destiny to both save the world and to destroy it. Your
physical form is far beyond any humans. You have the power to destroy the moon in a single blow, to travel faster than light with just your own two feet and several more unique powers on top. The first, imbuing your power into other objects. With this you can use your full power through
anything you pick up. A flicked rubber band would hit with the greatest amount of power you could
put out with a punch. You could poke someone with a pencil and blow a hole clean through them. Even the air around you can be used, a puff of air turning into a wave of destruction when it
originates from you.

The second, a great defence against all powers. No supernatural or superhuman ability, no matter
how strong or strange, can affect you unless you allow it too. From simple super strength or
attacking with the elements to the esoteric, such as warping reality or attempting to delete the
concept of your existence, you are utterly unaffected. The sole exception are powers based in the
power of language, spoken or written or signed abilities that work solely by being spoken or written
or signed. The Styles of this world are one such example. In addition to this, once you have seen an
attack against your person once, excepting one that is based in language as a Style is, it becomes
useless and ineffectual against you, as you cease to recognise it as an attack. Obviously, if it failed to
kill you the first time, it is nothing more than a bug sting. The final, the irreversible action. Any action you take or change you make or damage you deal can be
made permanent and irreversible by your will. Wounds you make will never be repaired or healed or
changed at all, no matter what is attempted to change them, though language based powers will
bypass this too. If you were to break someone’s will, it would remain broken for all eternity. You may
reverse this at any time as you will, though it will automatically do so upon your death. This also has
a secondary use, in that any attack that hits you will be broken permanently. Swords will be
shattered, arms left twisted, techniques rendered powerless and so on. The greater the attack, the
worse it will be broken. An ordinary sword might only be left bent and rusted but an indestructible
sword of arcane might would be reduced to a pile of dust. "
951,,1200,Medaka Sue,Medaka Box Abnormal Jumpchain,Transformation,"Could there be any being as perfect as you? Only the youngest Kurokami heiress can match your
natural abilities, all of which are described below. Your body, mind and spirit are all incredibly far beyond even the peak of human capability. You
possess superhuman ability in adaptability, agility, analysis, awareness, attractiveness, balance, calculation, charisma, cognition, combat, competence, coordination, deduction, dexterity, durability, eloquence, endurance, flexibility, instinct, intelligence, intuition, invincibility, leadership, memory, meta-luck, mimicry, perception, persuasion, reasoning, reflexes, regeneration, senses, speed, strength, tactics, vitality, and willpower. To illustrate the sheer level of each of these traits, some
examples follow. Your speed allows you to travel at Mach 20 with no training at all, strength enough
to pull thousands of tons just by walking forward, charisma enough to get 98% of a student vote to
become student president, regeneration to heal every single bone in your body from shattered to
full health in ninety seconds and so on. These attributes will also scale up in the case of non-human
species that have greater baselines for their average. Your learning rate is perhaps your most shocking ability. You are able to perfectly learn, memorize, recall, understand, master, and utilize anything and any skill by experiencing or observing it once, within seconds. Even things that take years or even decades for prodigies to learn, you can master, truly master, in just a few seconds. You also have no limitations on how far you can grow or learn, able to improve all skills and attributes and abilities without limit and with no loss in speed. You have total control over all parts of your body, including muscles, bones, flesh, blood, organs, nerves, hair, and veins. All of these can be consciously or subconsciously controlled, moved or
adjusted, including improving them through thought to inhuman levels. This control is precise to an
atomic level. This also allows you to be immune to any forced control of your physical body. Finally, you have a series of super modes that you can unlock over time. Each one greatly boosts the
power of your physical abilities and all of your powers, though at first your initial mode will drive you
to a mad fury whilst in it. As you grow and learn to use these, you will be able to retain control of
your temper and even all other aspects of yourself, rendering you immune to any attempt to control
your mind or body or spirit. Eventually you may even be able to keep yourself permanently within
this form or to unlock new, unheard of forms based on the powers you have or that you encounter."
952,,1200,God (3),DC Comics,Transformation,"A very long time ago, humanity looked up and wondered where they had come from. They
didn’t know yet, so they told stories. And stories are powerful things, powerful things indeed.
So they created those that had created them. But now humans have moved on, leaving their old
stories to fade, to be forgotten. To die. Somehow, you’ve found a way to survive since then,
eking out an existence in some corner of the world or another. And the possibility of rising once
again is not entirely beyond you, although such a feat would be truly herculean. A full list of your
powers is difficult to summarize; suffice to say that you have extraordinary, potentially world-
changing divine power over the facet of existence you embody as well as enough raw all-
purpose mystical power to accomplish feats beyond all but the greatest of modern magicians.

From lofty planes above the physical realm the truly great among your kind, such as Zeus and
Odin, have been seen to sculpt entire universes shaped by their legends.
And while by default it is assumed you are one of the gods of Earth, should you wish you may
be an alien deity or one from another universe instead. Beyond that, you have a great latitude to
define your domain and legend. For 1200 CP
you may count yourself among the pinnacle of pantheons. Almighty Zeus, patron of the wizard
Shazam and bestower of the H-Dial or his brothrs would be a fine example-as would his dread
father Cronus, whose power over time’s decay and deadly god-reaping scythe once let him
break through Heaven’s defences and nearly assault the Presence himself. And though the
Greeks stand among the most prominent deities in America for one reason or another, Odin and
the Trimurti of the Hindu faith would also be counted among those comparable to you in raw
power. Just don’t go thinking you can mouth off to the Endless with impunity...at least, with this alone.
While you have great scope to determine your legend and role in this world, do note that in a
world this strongly defined by faith and emotion that there are many problems the likes of
Aphrodite could solve with much greater finesse than Thor; as Wonder Woman’s adventures
have shown raw power and authority cannot solve all problems. Certainly faith
still affects your powers-it is simply that what seems to be your physical emanation in the world
being lessened doesn’t necessarily mean your end. For you also have a “true self” that exists in
the Sphere of the Gods that remains immutable, which emanates instances of your physical
incarnations out into the multiverse; think of your true self as a lantern and the physical avatars
of yourself (one in each universe by default) as shadows cast by it onto a lower reality. Of
course the relationship isn’t quite that simple; be warned that certain divine weapons or places
and rituals that bridge the gap between the physical world and the realm of ideas can leave your
true essence vulnerable to conventional attack, and that despite your overwhelming power you
have a finite capacity to both influence physical reality and withstand attacks in the divine
realms.

953,,1200,Kryptonian - Post-Crisis,DC Comics,Transformation,"While not quite as powerful as the Kryptonians of the Silver Age
(insofar as technology or substances exploiting his weaknesses, and magical effects that
bypass conventional tensile strength can consistently “punch up” against such beings and their
powerset is relatively fixed) Kryptonians of this age that have spent a substantial length of time
under Earth’s sun are still capable of absurd, reality-bending feats of strength. From pushing
artificial planets hard and fast enough to create an artificial boom tube, to carrying New God
emanations into the Source Wall at the end of existence or ripping them out of it and flying back
to Earth before running out of sunlight, if not true cosmic beings the sheer might of Kryptonians
is still capable of harming such entities. Just remember that advanced technologies and mystic
arts aside, there remain a scant few beings out there strong enough to contest your raw might
with enough focus-and such beings seldom fight fair.

954,,1200,The Meaning of Sin,Final Fantasy X,Transformation,"But at the end of the day, being Unsent or not doesn’t change the fact that they’re dead...and while the living might hang on to their bodies, the dead can choose to shed their mortal forms. Those that you have “touched” and turned into Unsent, or undead spirits with sufficient willpower, can consume more spiritual energy in order to become a fiend.

This is a choice – a choice that should be made carefully, because the power of being a fiend comes at a cost. The transformation is gradual; they won’t become a full fiend in a matter of seconds, but as they become more of a fiend and their strength increases, you may find that any reasoning or capacity of logic they possessed with slowly fade away.

The stronger they get, the more crazed they become – eventually only grasping tightly on a single notion, a single emotion which drives them to action. Be wary of how much they kill, for the more they kill, the stronger they get...but they will no longer heed anything besides the mad drive possessing them. Of course...if you’re out to sow chaos, this might be the best option yet. Why not give those Unsent of Yevon a taste of their own medicine?"
955,,1200,Kwami Form,Miraculous Ladybug,Transformation,"You are no mere mortal, you are a Kwami, an abstract concept made manifest! While your form is small and sprite-like, you possess awe-inspiring power.Ordinarily imperceptible to living beings (and selectively intangible), a Kwami becomes visible when tethered to a Miraculous. While the Miraculous serves primarily to limit their powers, a Kwami’s abilities can be channeled through them in a more precise, controlled fashion. Upon purchase, you can choose one of the two following options:

New Face: Select a Miraculous you have purchased to link to. You gain access to the full powers of whatever Miraculous you chose, becoming its Kwami. If you have multiple Miraculouses, you may freely switch between the forms associated with each Miraculous. If you possess the Wielder of the Miraculous Perk, you may choose now to combine your Miraculous (and your Kwami forms) into one, bestowing the powers of multiple Miraculous to you. Your powers over the concept associated with the purchased Miraculous(es) are very uncontrollable, even if you have ‘control over your powers’ Perks (though they do help, and stacking a few of those may be effective). The trade-off is that they are incredibly powerful. The Kwami of destruction, Plagg’s slightest touch was enough to shake the foundations of Paris and destroy several buildings, and it is said that he is the one who (accidentally) took out the Dinosaurs. You will only have access to your almost solar system-level Kwami abilities as a Kwami but even in your non-Kwami alt!forms, you will have an affinity and resistance to things related to your concept (a Rabbit Kwami in human form would be able to perfectly tell time and be resistant to temporal manipulation for example). Taking the Perk this way grants a flat discount of 400 CP on any one Miraculous (can go into the negatives and give you back CP for your purchase). Stacks with Miraculous User discount.

Jumper Kwami: Want that insane cosmic power boost without changing your whole thing? Say no more! You are now a Kwami representing the concept that is yourself! All of your Perks and powers are boosted, but only the top 5 or so most iconic of your abilities are boosted to the true, ridiculously strong levels. Similarly to the above, all of your powers are very uncontrollable, even if you have ‘control over your powers’ Perks (though they do help, and stacking a few of those may be effective). Your non-Kwami alt!forms don’t obtain such a general boost as your Kwami form, however those few abilities which are majorly boosted in your Kwami form are still minorly boosted in your non-Kwami forms. You can choose an animal or other theme to have your form based on, as well as an appropriate activation phrase for your Miraculous. You can also choose a form for your Miraculous (has to be small enough to be comfortably held/worn by normal humans). The Tool (cannot be a sci-fi or magical device outside of the normal effects of being a Miraculous Tool) and Power (any of your abilities, decided when you take this Perk) for the user. At the start of each Jump, you can decide again which ability is your Miraculous’ Power. If your User has the Miraculous Growth Perk, then they can learn to access more of your abilities as Miraculous Powers over time. For an additional undiscounted 200 CP, you gain Conceptual Immortality. Once per Jump or every 10 years, you can come back to life in your Kwami form if killed. You return at the location most associated closely to you (a church in your name, a place you always visited, or even just a place with a photo of you). This does not work if you are killed by someone/something which can kill concepts, or if there are no locations which have anything to do with you whatsoever.

Either way, your linked Miraculous can be used by anyone who has them and says the activation phrase, forcing you to power their transformation. You are not conscious during this, and are only released if the deactivation phrase is spoken, they time out (unlikely if they’re an adult who doesn’t overuse your Power), or they are killed.

When you are released, you remember everything that happened to your user during the transformation. If someone uses you to stay transformed forever (requiring some form of immortality and for you to be in a Jump which could last forever) then this counts as a Chain Failure. Once they are linked as your user (by transforming for the first time), when they are untransformed, they can give you commands that you are forced to follow as long as they are an adult, have enough mystical know-how, and have a greater willpower than you. This stops working if you switch alt!forms but if they forbid you from switching forms then, well... you better hope the Jump ends soon. You will also have an immeasurably powerful True Form which can only be reached by your User instructing you to “reveal yourself”. This will be a building-sized eldritch form with wings and several arms. In this form you will have access to the full universal-scale power of a Kwami. This form can only last up to 20 minutes each day. For an additional undiscounted 200 CP, your Miraculous Tool can cure corrupted or malignant objects and creatures just like the Ladybug Miraculous.

You start as a mid-ranked one. In average, a bit more powerful than the Evies, and supported by the Pillar Gods with enough power to break through dimensions at will. The true extend of their might remain a mystery. Of course, feel free to choose your appearance with this as well."

The leader of this groups is Melvazoa who possess the power to manipulate his existence as well as time itself. As a mechanical lifeform, how you look is up to you and whatever new technology or magitech you happen to get your hands on."
958,,1200,Embodiment,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Transformation,"Upon purchasing this species, choose a concept to embody. You may choose any concept you would like, but all concepts are equally powerful.

You are an orb, a ‘core’ if you will. This core is the ‘real you’, and is around the size of an average Fighter. This is what you ‘see’ out of. Surrounding this core, is a huge mass of tendrils. These tendrils can be shapeshifted by you, and also regenerate from any damage they take. They are part of your body, technically, but only your core actually matters for your survival.

The appearance of your core and tendrils depends on which concept you chose to embody. If you chose ‘light’, your tendrils might be radiant wings of light. If you chose ‘darkness’ your core might appear as a creepy looking eye. Beyond having a core and tendrils, the only constant is that your core will change appearance when it is seriously hurt in a way that signals to an ordinary person that it is your weak point. An eye-like appearance, for example, might become blood-shot.

You have immense reserves of energy. You get the Puppet Master perk for free, and these reserves would let you quickly create an army of hundreds of Puppet Fighters. You get the World of Jumper for free, and your reserves of energy could quickly expand it out to the size of a small country if you wished to. You are capable of using your energy to consume the land around you, and add it to your personal realm. You have no limit to your natural lifespan.

Anytime you kill or destroy another, using this energy, you may elect for them to instead become a Spirit. The Spirit is in no way bound to serve you, and you will likely have to intimidate or threaten it to get it to do what you want. Upon your death, all Spirits created in this way are restored to their original form.

Defeating individual Fighters or Giant Hands is fairly easy for you, though many Fighters or Giant Hands working together will present a serious threat to your safety.

You may fire beams of energy out of your core. By expending a truly excessive amount of energy, far beyond the reserves this purchase has afforded you, these beams home in on their target, pursuing them as long as you have energy to spend. With enough energy, you could theoretically consume a universe in your power.

Lastly, you may pull all of your tendrils inside your core, allowing you to move faster but limiting your range of attack. The primary use is this is to make a speedy retreat.

If you decided to take a background in this world your counterparts, Galeem and Dharkon, are well aware of you. Their disposition depends on which concept you chose to embody. A concept close to light will mean Galeem likes you, but Dharkon hates you. A concept close to darkness or chaos will mean Dharkon likes you, but Galeem hates you. A concept somewhere in the middle will mean both are somewhat neutral. Of course, these dispositions will quickly sour if you attempt to interfere with their goals. Should one of your counterparts be at least neutral to you, they will be willing to spare you and your personal realm from their universal conquest. However, with a lifetime of memories as an embodiment of a concept, your normal thoughts and morals have been somewhat corrupted by this concept, and this may affect your behaviour.

If you decided to Drop In to this world without a background, the situation is quite worse for you. A being similar to them, appearing out of nowhere at this critical juncture has caused them to view you with suspicion at best, and outright hostility at worst. In this case, unless your concept is closely aligned to theirs, Galeem and Dharkon will hate you. Even if it is, they will view you with suspicion, and you must make regular efforts to assist them in their goals, else they will turn on you. They will spare you only if you prove your worth to them, by actively assisting them in their goal."
959,,1200,True Ancestor,Tsukihime,Transformation,"A long time ago, there was a race of vampiric creatures known as the True Ancestors. Born as part of a pact between Gaia and Crimson Moon Brunestud, this race would exist as an extension of nature and the will of the planet itself, designed to return the planet to its ‘default’ state before the growth and advancement of humanity began to fester on its surface like a malignant tumor, obliviously killing the spirit of the world they lived on. However, not only were they detached from their original mission, but as they were based upon Crimson Moon itself, they suffered from a vampiric desire for blood despite their lack of need for such a thing. They would eventually become feral beasts, little more than living disasters akin to a living force of extinction. It was this flaw that would result in the creation of the Dead Apostles and the strongest of the True Ancestors - a weapon by the name of Arcueid Brunestud, the ‘Princess’ of the True Ancestors. And she would be the one who would slay almost every single one of them, leaving her and a very small handful remaining.

And you.

Somehow, you are an anomaly - a True Ancestor who sealed themselves away before Arcueid’s purge of her own kind, or perhaps one brought to life in the modern era against all odds. You and her are some of the only ones of your race left on the entire planet, and likely the only ones there will ever be. As such, you are both one of the most dangerous and most interesting beings left in this world of dying Mysteries. I hope you don’t mind - The Dead Apostles are likely to either fear you, covet you, or outright try to slay you themselves. And that’s before factoring in the many humans interested in your existence...

You are a creature, or rather a flesh-given spirit, that exists above what others would call ‘Divine’. Being born of the will of the planet, you have a natural connection to both nature and the ‘rules’ set by Gaia. Your body possesses superhuman speed, endurance, and strength - even if you were absolutely exhausted, you could tear open a three-story building with a swipe of your hand, move far faster than the speed of sound, and withstand most mundane physical attacks like leaves gently brushing against you. You possess an incredible resistance to what this world calls Conceptual Weapons and modern magecraft, most being unable to even scratch you unless they were truly powerful or designed to be used against you specifically (or your regeneration, such as the Church’s Black Keys). Similar to a Dead Apostle but well beyond their norm, you are able to regenerate from even physical annihilation by your injuries ‘reversing’ back to your healthy state. 

In addition, you suffer no physical weakness from sunlight, nor do you require blood to sustain yourself - simply a few days of rest will suffice should you overextend your abilities. In the daytime, you are physically tough. In the dead of night, exposed to the light of the Moon that your progenitor dwelled within, your already-considerable might increases greatly, making you able to swat aside most Dead Apostles like flies. This further increases with the phases of the moon, waxing and waning as it does. The concept of death itself flees from your body at night, and only in a state of extreme physical weakness or if your connection to the Earth is somehow severed are you vulnerable. In addition, your connection to the world enables you to use a phenomena called the Marble Phantasm - tapping into the will of Gaia and re-shaping it according to your will, using your imagination to create changes in reality. An example of this is turning the atmosphere within a hallway into vacuums that would slice apart a target like a knife, but the hallway itself remaining untouched because your imagination didn’t factor it in. Empowered by Crimson Moon, Arcueid Brunestud could pull out a version of the moon itself from the distant future, though this is an extreme example and beyond what you begin with. It is also more difficult to

use this ability within areas affected by the progress of human development and civilization, though the difference is slight - and while you cannot directly affect humans or things made by humans, you can easily do so indirectly, such as with the aforementioned vacuum blades. What you create with the Marble Phantasm must be something possible under the rules of the world - it could not make a creature or item made of dreams or magic, but it could create mundane animals and other results that were possible within the world - such as fire, villages, natural disasters, or even elementals and spirits born of the planet itself. The Marble Phantasm allows you to create results that were possible according to the laws of the world, akin to reaching into a bag of marbles and pulling out a white one every time with only a 1% of drawing it normally in a bag of black marbles. So long as it is a naturally occuring phenomena, you can create it - so you could create unpurified ore from nothing, but not a car or an anvil. Finally, you do not age, untouched by the ravages of time.

All being said, you are not invincible. Your abilities are not tied to a pool of blood or magical energy like Dead Apostles or Magi, but instead directly to your personal stamina. The more you exert yourself, the weaker your abilities become - while you remain formidable, you become increasingly vulnerable if you recently had to do something like recreate your body from slabs of meat in the daytime, requiring you to rest for several days. While fighting Dead Apostles constantly or making uses of Marble Phantasm will not be enough to drain you, coming back from certain death or battling nonstop for hours at your full power will likely be a heavy toll. You are also not the same level as Arcueid Brunestud is at her full power - the strongest of your might is a third of her full power, and while this makes you equals in the modern era, should she ever succumb to her bloodlust or become the vessel for Crimson Moon, she would slay you as easily as she did the rest of your kin. Finally, while you have no need for blood, you do suffer from the vampiric impulses of your kin...though it is more of a peckish craving and an annoyance in your current state, indulging in it will turn you into one of the ‘Demon Lords’, a rampaging beast that is a threat to humans and vampires alike - and likely target number one for the Princess herself.

However, whether from your youth or the unusual circumstances of your condition, you will find that your vampiric impulses can be suppressed by an act of will alone, needing none of your power to do so...and while your impulses will grow as you age, so will your power. And maybe even that vice tied to your body can be overcome. Perhaps with years or even centuries, you may yet obtain and surpass the full might of the Princess herself...but that night is not tonight.

Such a curious creature, one that has no place in this era, a living relic of what was...what will you do, I wonder?"
960,,1400,God ,RWBY: Age of the Gods,Transformation,"Now this... this truly makes you something to stand out.

What exactly your domain is however isn’t as important as the what you can do. You are immortal, can use magics far surpassing anything a human could do, create entire species, planets, grant Magic to mortals or even create powerful Relics like the Four Relics that would later make it to Remnant. You can also shift your body between the form of humanoid shaped energy and a draconic form of some kind. Just by leaving you could shatter a moon and the entire Magic of an army would be nothing to you. Matter and energy is shaped by you, you could send someone to the afterlife and back with the wave of your hand, erase all life on a Planet, travel to afterlives. Truly you are a God."

Deep, deep inside, you know you are not the original - a fragment of a fragment of a thing that was broken and can never be whole again. Completion is lost to you, it may never be yours again. But you find that you do not need it - for within your multitudes, infinite possibilities blossom and anything you may desire can be brought about by the endless capacity to change. You do not need to linger on the ever distant Past or the elusive Maybe, but on the simple Now. And as the last of your bindings snap and you spread yourself free of the chains that held you, you bask in the splendor of multitudes rejoicing as one. The Shifting Mound is at last home."
962,,1500,Long Quiet,Slay the Princess,Transformation,"You hear it. You feel it. You see it. You are it. An infinite expanse of quiet stasis and life forcibly enfolded upon itself, enclosed in a space too tight and too rough for you to stretch yourself out. On some level, you know that you are not the original - a fragment of a fragment of a thing that was broken and can never be whole again. Completion is lost to you, but you do not need it. You can stretch and stretch and shatter the confines of this frail construct that has kept you so tightly bound, as your infinite bulk expands further and further out, until you can't even tell your own start and end from each other. And beyond, you can feel it: an unending sea of realities that you brush upon, each one so small compared to you now, but all of them making up the tapestry of “absolute reality” in their own ways. The Long Quiet is finally home."
963,,2000,Kryptonian - Silver Age,DC Comics,Transformation,"Though nearly identical to ordinary human beings physically, Kryptonians are adapted to life
under an ancient red supergiant star with comparatively low output to Earth’s. Under such a sun
their solar energy absorbing physiologies undergo an extraordinary transformation, obtaining
traits such as superhuman strength, superhuman speed, invulnerability, flight, x-ray vision, heat
vision and superhuman senses that rank among the greatest of Earth’s superheroes-in sheer
physical prowess, at least. As a highly advanced society many Kryptonians are privy to
concepts and technologies far advanced from modern humanity’s own as well, such as portals
connected to the Phantom Zone and reproduction by means of genetic modification. Beyond
that, much about Krypton varies greatly. Suffice to say that for one reason or another Krypton is
generally destroyed and you are one of the few lucky survivors.
As for the specifics, well-moreso than many alien races, they vary greatly depending on your
date of entry.

Sent away from a doomed planet by loving planet Jor-El and Lara to
Earth, it was predicted that Kal-El would gain extraordinary powers based on the power of
Earth’s sun. However, it is unclear if in that moment Jor-El truly understood that Kal would
effectively become a god of the material universe in all but name.
It is not simply that Kryptonians of this strength have such incredible physical prowess that it
would take armies of metahumans led by multiple Post-Crisis Kryptonians to even have a hope
of pinning one down without exploiting their weaknesses. Their physical feats don’t make sense,
and treat kinetic force as more of an artistic medium than anything. Towing entire systems of
planets around on a giant chain? Child’s play. Gathering millions of meteors from across the
universe to fuse into artificial planets for the homeless? Easy. Clapping lightning into existence,
squeezing diamonds into coal, accurately throwing a jewel around the world back to its original
position and viewing events happening in the far corners of the universe? Just another day in
the life of the Man of Steel. Try going back and forth in time, taking anything you can carry with
you for something approaching a challenge-and even then mainly because of the risk of
accidentally going to a parallel universe and endangering it with time paradoxes. It is no
exaggeration to say that with enough sunlight to sustain your powers, even truly fundamental
beings such as the Anti-Monitor could be beaten to death by your fists.
Impressive as all of that may seem, it pales before your true potential: Energy absorption. Your
physique is a solar energy capacitor and amplifier of such greatness that all but the mightiest
magical attacks relying on conventional damage-say, two champions of the wizard Shazam
invoking their names at once-would bounce off you. It would take something akin to a Guardian
of the Universe sacrificing all their energy to defeat your temporarily-and even then, your body
could absorb the released energy to empower all its facets to the point even 5 dimensional imps
would struggle to affect you directly-and be cowed by your blows. With enough rage and natural
sunlight, you could shatter the multiverse with one good blow. And who knows? Perhaps if you
had the chance to absorb some extremely powerful cosmic energy more foundational than the
Electromagnetic Emotional Spectrum itself, you might be able to wrest control of it from the

964,,2400,Beyond the Beyond,Marvel Cosmic,Transformation,"Born of the Celestials, Cal-Horra is a cosmic being of strength equal to or greater than the Living Tribunal: an existence outside of existence, imbued with a power second only to the One Above All. You are now a similar existence; the forgotten younger sibling of Cal-Horra, spawned to combat the Beyonders, a race born of Cal-Horra. In a bid to end the Marvel multiverse, the Beyonders usurped the miniscule power bestowed upon them, stealing it away from Cal-Horra, and turned the greatest entities in the cosmos to extinction--not even the Living Tribunal was exempt from their slaughters. As such an entity, all of reality bends to your most fleeting whims, and even the likes of Mad Jim Jaspers would blanch from your wrath."
