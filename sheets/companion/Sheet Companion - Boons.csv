Cost,Perk Name,Source,Description
100,"A Nice, Peaceful Laboratory",SB Stellaris,"Your scientists are slightly more productive than others. Fanatics get a bigger boost, as well as cheaper lab equipment and upkeep.
(Notes)
These apply in some form to any empire, nation, civilization, or organization under your control, even if you don’t Import your Empire into that future Jump. The perks will be adapted as needed to actually be relevant towards any organization they are applied to. The party does directly benefit from effects that affect the people in these organizations."
100,Her Majesty’s Majesty,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,"They say that every hero of these times was a marvel to look upon. The statues that remain from these years in modern times would seem to give that impression and should you eventually have one made of you, it won’t fall short. Whether it’s being beautiful or handsome, you stand out like a shining jewel even among heroes. Many can’t help but gasp once they see your visage and it’ll smooth out plenty of problems for you, not least in finding a suitable partner. Your beauty will also affect the things that you make and rule over, even something as large as Rome itself, but this effect slowly takes hold over time. While a sword you wield may slowly become more ornate and fine over days of use, an empire might need years to be fully affected, but it and all it’s people will be shining by the end. You can have this stop at a certain level if you like, whether that’s to keep some parts of your empire ugly or just to stop everyone from maybe becoming self-obsessed snobs that never stop looking in mirrors."
100,Sparkling Finish,Pokemon Anime,"Did I say you found a Key Stone? I meant to say a Sparkling Stone! A gift of the Guardians of Alola to those they believe hold great potential; when paired with a Z-Crystal it can allow a partnered pokemon to unleash a tremendous expression of elemental power. Be warned, if used too often it can place a strain on both the pokemon and their human partner; so try to use it only once every few minutes. All while still acting as a functional Key Stone! This purchase comes with a single Z-Crystal corresponding to a Type of your choice."
100,Z-Power,Pokemon Anime,"Now we’re cooking with gas! This upgrade increases the size and potency of your Sparkling Stone! Aside from lessening the strain of performing Z-Moves, and allowing it to utilize Legendary Z-Crystals; this one comes with a little extra bonus. Namely, the ability to generate special Z-Crystals for pokemon whom you develop a strong bond with; allowing them to express their natural abilities in truly extraordinary ways."
100,Muse,Civilization,"You are an inspirational presence­ You could serve as someone dispensing sage advice, a legendary model, or create some other suitably thought­-provoking circumstance with another power. People who interact with you (even when unaware) are prone to sudden bursts of insight and inspiration.
In any case, you don’t have direct control over what this inspiration leads to, but it’s usually related to whatever interests the inspired has. A musician might be inspired to create a defining piece of his genre, or strike out into new territory, shaking up the status quo.
Regardless, this inspiration will make history."
100,Patron,Civilization,"Maybe its by luck or careful management of your burgeoning culture, but there has always been and will always be a place for the arts in your eyes. This perk ensures that you can live comfortably off of completely creative and aesthetic endeavors such as painting, sculpture and the like­ clients will find you, museums will want your works, and so on.
This effect even applies to members of groups or organizations you lead­ subsidizing the arts will never impact your budget no matter how extravagant­ the means and funds simply appear, waiting to be distributed."
100,Solid War Machine,SB Stellaris,"Your ships and armies are slightly better than others, in every useful metric. It might only be 5%, but that really does make a difference.
Fanatics get a significant bonus to everything.
(Notes)
These apply in some form to any empire, nation, civilization, or organization under your control, even if you don’t Import your Empire into that future Jump. The perks will be adapted as needed to actually be relevant towards any organization they are applied to. The party does directly benefit from effects that affect the people in these organizations."
200,Key Stone,Pokemon Anime,"An ancient stone whose untold power can be unlocked by a trainer possessing a powerful bond with their pokemon; its existence is still a mystery to many. When activated this stone may channel Infinity Energy through a partner possessing an appropriate mega stone, causing them to mega evolve; temporarily transforming them into a far more powerful form. However, if the bond between the trainer and their pokemon isn’t strong enough they won’t be able to handle the power; causing them to rampage until they exhaust themselves.
Still, in the right hands this could turn a regular pokemon into a force capable of challenging legendaries. Of course, we can’t have you lugging around a loose marble everywhere, so it’ll be inserted into an accessory of your choice; though bangles are the traditional choice. Lastly, to make sure you can put it to good use it’ll come with one mega stone of your choice. If you Purchased The Power of One you gain a discount on this item, and it’s upgrades."
200,Mega Wave,Pokemon Anime,"Now how did you get your hand on one of these? A miracle of arcane engineering brought about by the Azoth kingdom; this upgrade allows your Key Stone to mega evolve multiple pokemon at once, and removes the need for your partner pokemon to carry a mega stone. That said, this is normally a rather unpleasant process that would test the loyalty of most pokemon; so I’ll tweak it a little for you. Rather than torturing your pokemon, each connection past the second will place some strain on you instead. A normal man would barely be able to sustain at most six mega evolutions at once, but would likely fall from exhaustion shortly after. Though that’s a small price to pay for the power you’ll gain with this."
200,Skill Reinforcement,Fate/Grand Order,"Much as the overall power of a Servant is not immediately reached, neither is the individual power of their Skills reached at the start. To find their full potential with each ability, these Skills must be reinforced with Gems gathered from suitably similar opponents. Sabers must destroy Sabers to get Gems for Sabers and so on. Rare materials must also be gathered to do the process. Finally, a proper amount of magical energy must also be spent. Once the requirements are gathered, any Skill or ability may be Skilled Up and made more powerful overall. While there is no limit to how many times a Skill may be Reinforced, nor that it must be a Servant Skill, the costs will continue to increase for further and further Skill Ups on the same skill. Gems will need to be obtained from stronger foes, materials will become rarer and more magical energy must be spent."
200,Specific Specialization,Overlord Jumpchain,"You can purchase this perk more than once, each time you do so you can specialize in a specific branch or theme of magic. You will then be capable of spells of greater potency, scope, power, or so forth within that specific theme. The spells and magics you learn via these choices will always be superior than the ones you could learn without them, often being cheaper to cast, more powerful, larger in scope, or so forth. Taking a specialization doesn’t make you worse at things outside of your specialization, it just makes you better at the things you specialize in. Pick from the following list.
Warder
You’re really good at warding things. Specifically areas, creatures, and items. You could ward a small town so that those with hostile intent against the residents would be cursed the moment they step inside, or could potentially create wards that just keep such people out completely assuming you’ve got the time and are willing to spend the effort making them. You’re also really good at creating wards against specific effects such as mind control, instant-death, curses, and ironically enough wards that will let you ignore other wards. You could even erect wards on individuals to allow them to temporarily ignore a weakness they might otherwise have, such as allowing a lesser vampire to walk about in daylight or allowing a fire elemental to resist cold damage.
Starseed​ ​Awakening​ (Sailor Moon) ​(600 CP)
Within you is a great power. The power to take an ordinary Star Seed and blossom it into a flower of glory just below that of a Sailor Crystal’s. You have a supernaturally powerful ability to bring out anyone’s potential with a reasonable amount of personal magic-assisted teaching. This act allows them to gain powers based on their personality and who they are. A fiery person could gain fire powers, a statistician gains the power to manipulate probability, a cat gains the ability to defy physics, ect ect. It is up to you to define the limits of these powers, but these awakened powers are initially weak. Training can help someone increase in power. This power also grants the recipient a human form, if they lack one. Or, if you wish, you may instead wish to help add to the glory of a Sailor Crystal. You may grant a one-time power-up to someone with powers other than the ones granted by this perk, but if you use this ability, you cannot grant them the powers this perk gives someone. This power cannot be copied without a means to emulate parts of the Awakened Person’s soul you wish to copy.
You may not steal an Awakened Person’s power without their full consent, and threatening or coercing or mind controlling them into having them give you their power does not count as consent. Eating a person or ripping out their soul does not count as consent.
A person can only be Awakened once. Comes with optional magical girl transformation sequence if you wish."
200,Present Arms!,Generic Monster Tamer,"This is quite the unusual ability you possess, the ability to convert a tamed or willing monster into a weapon, piece of armor, or other form of equipment such as a lantern. The monster maintains its abilities, altered to fit their new form and function, but are directed by their wielder as well as their own intent. You are able to train monsters to take on their equipment form at will, even partially, without your intervention, even manifesting their equipment form entirely for their own use once they master the ability. Post Jump, you may use this ability on anyone, not just monsters, including yourself."
300,Superwarrior,Grant Morrison’s 18 Days,"There are untold numbers of warriors in this day and age, but to be a real, proper Kshatriya means to be a Superwarrior, a being who is as much crafted as born.
All but immortal, with wisdom, beauty, and strength of arms that defies all comprehension, you stride the world as if a god, for you practically are one in this base day and age. Your strength, appearance, and mental faculties are all boosted several orders of magnitude, hundreds of times until you stand as very close to perfection, or as close as any mortal being can get without having been born in the First Age, the Satya Yuga,
You possess extreme natural aptitude for all skills that can be learnt, though naturally you gain no knowledge just from taking this blessing."
300,Rapid Assembly,SB Stellaris,"Your people can build structures about three times as fast as they should. It should take four months to turn 700,000 square kilometers of dirt into suitable farming land, but your people can do it in 40 days. It would take others nearly 60 years to construct a dyson sphere, but your empire can do it in under 20 years.
This also slightly increases the effect of any other effect that would improve building speed."
300,Resizing,Generic Monster Tamer,"Now this is an unusual trick. You have the ability to cause monsters to grow smaller and cuter, as well as returning them to their original size or anywhere in between. You can even teach monsters to adjust their size on their own.
For an additional 100cp, you can even allow a monster to grow up to half again larger than their normal size.
Post jump, you may use this on yourself and teach the technique to others, not just monsters. For most humanoids, growing smaller also seems to revert age, though this has no effect on your actual age.
Rock of Ages (Generic Xianxia) (300)
You have managed to unlock the secret of agelessness and youth. But what is the benefit to immortality if you cannot share it with others? You may bestow this longevity with others though this is not without cost to yourself. You must expend enough magical or spiritual energy to essentially blow up a mountain each time you use this technique. As such, you will likely require time and meditation in between each use of this ability and may be unable to utilize it altogether if you lack sufficient spiritual or magical strength. When you do succeed however the target's body is returned or accelerated to their physical peak and will remain as such forever unless external forces seek to rob them of their youth and vigour. You do not have to use energy from your own stores; energy siphoned from items, or other beings will work just as well."
300,Runesmith,Bloodborne,"Runesmith Caryll of Byrgenwerth was a scholar like many who studied beside them, and yet, they were privy to a special sort of knowledge. Inhuman mutterings behind the walls of mundanity gnawed at their consciousness, and the only thing they could do was write them. Whatever Caryll heard, whatever skill they developed with transcribing words that humans could not possibly fully fathom, they have once again manifested within you. While you aren’t any better at speaking the language of the Great Ones, you may now write their words, which maintain that power. These incredible runes may be emblazoned straight upon one’s mind with the proper tools, conveying their abilities, each unique and relating to the word they represent. Take care, as the unenlightened human can’t handle too many words, meaning only three or so could be benefited from by most. Greater perception, insight into the abnormalities in one’s surroundings, will let one better pick up the murmurs of Great Ones, allowing one access to writing more runes.”"
300,Skill Sets,Generic Monster Tamer,"Monsters often have a number of skills they can work with, but many focus on only one or two, strengthening those abilities, but causing their other abilities to fall to the wayside. You, however, are able to direct your monsters to create 'sets' of skills they may swap with a few moments of concentration. Each set will emphasize a trait or two of the monster, making it stronger, such as boosting defensive power and reaction speed or improving speed and bite strength, however, they may only have one such set active at a time. You can even teach non-monsters to do this, post jump, yourself included."
300,Trigger,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user’s tongue is able to stretch up to a dozen times in length, the tip thinning and sharpening into a strong, mosquito proboscis-like tool that can be used to inject a chemical cocktail into victims.
This injection targets the target’s Quirk gene, rapidly and potently mutating the Quirk user’s Quirk into a powerful new form. Fire breath could develop into large scale fire manipulation; a strong punch Quirk could develop into something street shattering in force.
In all cases, the target’s quirk becomes far more threatening, but may also mutate in unpredictable and not always beneficial ways. In addition to Quirk mutations, physical mutations will occur based on the individual’s Quirk.
While under this Quirk’s effects, targets suffer from reduced cognitive abilities, as well as varied mental defects. This may include heightened aggression, mood swings, delusions of grandeur, and/or delusions impending doom. The effects of this Quirk normally fade after one to two hours.
Through this Quirk’s targeting of the Quirk gene, it can activate dormant genes within the Quirkless in order for it to take effect. This can be dangerous in such cases and may leave permanent alterations or damage to those affected. The Quirk user is immune to their own chemicals."
400,Battle Meditation,Star Wars - The Clone Wars,"A Force power that allows you to boost the morale and combat prowess of your allies while simultaneously reducing the capabilities of your opponents. At it's basic level, it can only affect small groups of people, but at it's most powerful it can affect an entire fleet."
400,Contractor,/tg/ Worm,"You are capable of granting people you touch powers, up to ten people at a time. These can be normal people or those who are already parahumans, and you can decide what these powers are. At any time you can revoke a power you’ve granted, regardless of where the target is.You have no special control over those who you empower, cannot empower yourself, and you cannot stack more than one granted power onto somebody. These powers are roughly mid-range for parahumans, nothing impressive, but nothing bad. Alternatively you can drop the amount of granted powers you can have out at any one time down to five, with those being the equal of those granted by the Cauldron Vials in the gear section."
400,Fortune Teller,Paper Mario,"You possess the skills of a wizard, able to look to the stars in order to perform a variety of auguries. Through the reading of stars you are capable of divining the location of treasure, find the next step towards a goal you possess, call upon a number of buffs that can be placed on yourself or others, or call upon the power of star roulette. The first two powers give rather vague answers but are never wrong, the buffs can range from finding more money to dealing more damage, but the last one is a bit more complicated. Star roulette is a blessing you can place upon yourself or others that will cause a mystical roulette wheel to appear after a certain amount of enemies are defeated. Any result from the roulette wheel will grant the spinner an item (such as a life shroom or POW block), the item differing based on the result. Longer lasting buffs or recurring versions of star roulette require more time and effort to perform."
400,Galactic Contender,SB Stellaris,"Powerful empires muscle each other around. As a contender for the top spot, you deal more damage to those also in the running, and take less damage from them.
This also applies to your rivals, people who think that they’re your rivals, ancient empires, and omnicidal or near-omnicidal threats, like the Endgame Crises.
(Notes)
These apply in some form to any empire, nation, civilization, or organization under your control, even if you don’t Import your Empire into that future Jump. The perks will be adapted as needed to actually be relevant towards any organization they are applied to. The party does directly benefit from effects that affect the people in these organizations."
400,Maestro,Medaka Box Abnormal,"Now you might not be all that special on your own, really, but you’ve got a tendency to make all those around you that much more amazing. You’re able to draw out the true potential of those around you that you care for and spend lots of time with, both in regards to their powers and even them as people. So long as you are constantly around someone that you have a good relationship with, you’re able to slowly bring out their true powers, increasing their maximum power by up to three times their normal level if you’ve spent a few months with them. You’ll also find that they begin to get over mental and emotional issues with ease so long as you keep talking to them, though this is mostly based on what they see as a problem. This increased power and sense of self will slowly drain if you cease to constantly spend time with a person, draining to nothing by the end of a full month.
Martial Culture (Civilization) 100 CP)
Discipline radiates from every defensive wall and the hearts of all who are of your Civilization. People who follow you or are loyal to your cause gain a soldier’s bearing and commitment to their cause that fits in seamlessly with their lives­ they are more professional and dedicated than before, but no less ‘themselves’. As an added benefit, physical training for yourself and those who follow you are twice as effective, ensuring everyone is acting at peak performance."
400,Metamor Stair,Medaka Box Abnormal,"Evolution is a wonderful process. It made these humans that are so fun to mess with, didn't it? But sometimes you can't be bothered waiting a few million years for something to happen and just want it now. Now you can, with just a touch, force anything, be it a person or an object, to evolve to a new and better stage up to twice. A monkey could be made to become a man and then into an evolved form of man. A blade could be turned into a chain sword and then into an energy sword. There is no cost to these acts but they may only ever be performed twice on a specific thing."
400,Mother of Creation,Exalted - Infernals,"Theory is all that remains of the Exalted host’s understanding of Cytherea. The truth regarding her secrets has yet to be won. Still, many of the legends Exalted scholars once collected point towards the same direction. A creator and inventor by breed, just as the other Primordials were, but hers was the imbuing and purifying Essence. It was her who provided Gaia’s Essence with the substance to spin Creation out of the Wyld. It was her who strained to purify the purest of the Primordial King’s flames into a new and white flame, hotter than even her king could stand, which would become the fires of the Daystar itself. It was her who worked with Oramus to bestow upon Luna her ever-evolving, indomitable urge. So too will you be a force to imbue and and purify, to raise up the efforts of others to new heights unseen on their own. With your help, the meek shall become mighty and the mighty shall become transcendent. This ability shines brightest in the creation of all things, such that craftsmen and sorcerers alike would all but beg for your aid. You shall become the muse, your power the amplification of the might and efforts of others into something far more than they could ever achieve on their own."
400,No Gods Or Kings,Pathfinder,"Most divine magics are drawn from the power of the gods or other semi-divine beings. But then the question is raised: from where do the gods draw their power? And why should they hold monopoly over such power? Why must mortals grovel at their feet to be healed or cured? There must be other ways to draw upon such forces without submitting yourself to another being.
And there is, so you have found. You have gained the nearly unique ability to tap directly into the source of divine power from which flows the might of the gods. Through the strength of your convictions alone, you may draw upon any magic which would ordinarily require you to be in service of a god or other higher being to access. And what’s more, those who follow your causes may also learn to draw out power in such a way as well, though their connection will not be as strong as yours."
400,Primordial Spring Morning,Grant Morrison’s 18 Days,"(Requires Superwarrior)
All beings in the Satya Yuga are without vice and full of compassion. All humanity shall be living saints and there shall be no need for religion or faith. All humanity will be tall, powerfully built, honest, youthful, vigorous, well spoken, and full of virtue. There will be no need for agriculture or mining, for the Earth shall yield up her riches on her own.
There is something about you that is not of this world. Something purer, truer... something ancient. It seems that the Yajnatek labs were particularly successful with you, and they accomplished something they’d only barely dreamed of.
The memory of the Golden Age is strong in you, and it pours off of you into the world. Wherever you go, the world remembers the Dawn with you. Weather turns pleasant and mild, things like disease, age, and fear start fading from the land. The Earth grows bountiful to absurd extents, such as it was in those glorious days when the world was new.
While at no point will this make people physically equal to what they were in the Dawn of the Universe, the longer you stay around, the more of your power you put into actively enhancing your effort, the closer to the Satya Yuga the world around you gets. You get to decide the area this occurs across, but the larger the area, the more the effects are proportionately diluted.
While the ethical, moral, and environmental effects can get right back to the first age, the martial effects you can cause cap out at making things about two thirds of what a modern day Superwarrior can do.
Your physical and mental attributes are increased to the point where you now stand as far above a normal Superwarrior as they do above the rank and file of the Third Age. Your speed is as lightning, your blows could shatter mountains, and your skin withstand blows that could crack a continent.
In future jumps, you find yourself the absolute epitome of whatever race, type, being, or entity you come to be. Whatever the reasons might be for someone to not be such, like blood, magic, curses or the decline of the very world itself, none apply to you in any way, shape or form. You are the greatest, mightiest, wisest and most perfect being there can possibly be for your race/species etc. If there was a first generation, you belong to it, though this does not change your starting location or time."
400,"Humanity, Fuck Yeah!",Generic Space Opera,"Somehow you exude an aura of protagonist-y-iness that even encompasses your allies, almost as if not you personally are the ‘protagonist’ of the story, but your entire species, or faction. Anyone on your side will be overall more competent and less prone to bad luck."
400,That Twists The Sky,Exalted - Infernals,"GNAT. YOUR TINY, WEAK SELF DANCES ALONG THE PUPPET STRINGS OF FATE AND YOUR BETTERS.
FIGHT.
STAND UP. WREST THE STARS FROM THE SKY. BREAK THEIR LIMITS. TWIST THE PROPHECIES OF THOSE WHO WOULD DARE TO RESTRICT YOU. TAKE YOUR FREEDOM, AND GO FORTH TO SHATTER THE FATES OF ALL WHO WOULD GAINSAY YOU. NO FATE CAN HOLD YOU, AND YOUR TOUCH DESTROYS THE DESTINIES OF ALL OTHERS. STANDING FIRM AGAINST PROPHECY, YOU CAN EXTEND YOUR NATURE AS A BEING OUTSIDE FATE TO THOSE YOU WISH. GO FORTH, FATE-BREAKER.
Again, I shall explain my liege? As one of the Princes of the Green Sun you do, of course,
already stand outside fate. But now you will also be extremely resistant to effects that would
force you back under fate’s sway, and gain the ability to bring others outside fate."
400,Thaumic Unity,Generic Monster Tamer,"You've stumbled onto an unusual ability that allows you to physically fuse two monsters into a single, stronger monster temporarily, so long as the monsters are willing. The fusion shares traits from the component monsters, though they may manifest differently or in new ways, and are strengthened by the combined strength of the two monsters. The greater the synergy and trust between the monsters, the greater the power of the fusion and the longer it will last and the more you practice, the more monsters you can include into the
fusion (up to a maximum of five at a time), though more monsters tends to shorten the time of the fusion. Already fused monsters cannot be fused again.
It is possible for monsters to become permanently fused, however, this requires exceptional trust and synergy between the component monsters as well as a desire to become a permanent fusion, a rarity for such willful creatures. Alternatively, if you possess the Creature Synthesis perk, you may make this fusion permanent.
If you possess Burst Fusion, you may include yourself as part of the fusion, either acting as a voice in the back of the mind of the fusion to extend the fusion and increase its power or as the main member of the fusion, becoming the single controller of the fusion.
Post Jump, you are able to use this on any individual, not just monsters."
400,"To Me, My Minions!",Dragon Ball Z,"No man fights alone. This is something that tends to be forgotten. Wars and battles are won with the strength of many in concert, not the few. You are the epitome of this concept, able to coordinate and cooperate with your allies to defeat foes that would destroy you in singular fights, or even who would normally defeat you as a horde. While one warrior in this world may be able to defeat a hundred, you can show them the true power of a hundred warriors fighting as one. In addition, you’ll never be at a loss for those willing to follow your commands, attracting loyal followers with little effort. Finally, though you may be stronger than your followers in terms of battle prowess, you will find that power can, at your will, be spread out through your minions… bolstering them with your ki and physical strength, letting even the lowliest mook punch at one tenth of your current power."
500,Divinity,Hades,"You have a spark of divinity within you, tying you to a specific domain and setting you as something beyond the ordinary. This functions as a Capstone Booster for the 600 CP perks and the 4 Point Patron Powers, and grants the following effects.
Divine Domain: You are linked to a specific domain. This can be anything from Agriculture to Fire to Sports. You can both draw power from and exert influence over your domain. Your power over your domain is not quite to the level of the Olympians yet, but it will reach that level with a few decades of development, and potentially the level of high gods like Zeus or Demeter within a century or two.
Awareness: You possess a divine sense that can inform you of the local state of your dominion and the state of other areas that you control or own.
Status Curse: Your divine energy is capable of inflicting a specific penalty against your foes. This penalty is related to your Domain in some way, and can range from causing them to take damage when attacking you to slowing them down to attracting projectiles to them or more.
Boon Granting: You are able to gift a portion of your divine power to others in the form of Boons, minor powers related to your Domain in some way. These Boons can grant the ability to use your Status Curse, improve attack or defense or luck or any number of other attributes, or have other effects. Initially, you are limited to only granting around a dozen minor boons at a time and you must be in a person’s presence to do so, but in time, you can grant more and stronger boons, and you can even grant them at a distance. When you are prayed to, for example."
500,Pentakai Bench,King Arthur,"Just as every king has his followers, all drawn to him by numerous reasons. You have your companions. Whenever one of your followers are near you, both of you get a small boost of power, around a tenth of your or their base power. This increases with the amount of followers you have around you each getting the boost as well."
600,All I Have to Do is Watch,Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey,"Your mere presence inspires others to be better, to create, to excel at their chosen field. As long as you observe them for at least half an hour a week this effect is maintained for that week. If you watch them work for an hour, this effect lasts a month. If you watch for 13 hours, it is maintained for a year. If you watch them for an entire working week, this effect is maintained for their entire career (30-35 working years). The exact degree of this inspiration depends on how invested you are in their field. If you’re favorably inclined, it makes them a bit better. If you’re absolutely obsessed with the field, it makes them the best they could possibly be. At the very least, expect a 50% improvement."
600,Ascension,Hollow Knight,"The true purpose of a Godseeker is as a servant, to bolster the gods they serve with their complete and utter focusing of mind. A trait which you excel at in the small-scale. By harnessing SOUL, you can focus on a single target, and see their power skyrocket. Normal hands may now shatter stone. Bolts of SOUL turn into meteors. Their true power is unleashed, for as long as you continue to focus SOUL into them, this ascension of power steadily draining your reserves at around 8% every second.
(Capstone Boosted - Voidheart)
Your supportive powers are potent, and the addition of the Void does not increase their power, but their permanency. Consistently utilizing Ascension on a target will grant them a portion of said power permanently, eventually granting their full benefits always. This may take several dozen sessions and a lot of SOUL, but let their potential be fully realized, and then, push it even further beyond."
600,Auspice of Unexpected Victory,Exalted - Modern,"It’s never too late to fix your past mistakes. There is a reason why when the Yozis grievously wounded the Incarnae, the Solars needed only you at their side to cast them down and send them into confused retreat. Some grand feat of your kind’s Astrology magics has made you truly live up to the ideals of the viziers. When you designate a target, whether a single person or up to a specific group of unique beings like the Solar Exalted, as your chosen heroes the strands of Fate twist to favour their victory. What could have been a pawn or an irrelevant wanderer is guided by subtle forces to succeed and prosper at their goals until their actions can change the very world you live in forever.
Though they learn and grow no quicker than usual, everything they set out to accomplish seems to be supernaturally efficient and snowball into plentiful opportunities to reap benefits for themselves-both strategic assets, and opportunities for personal happiness. You need not train them personally, but you gain supernatural foresight into when and where to appear when they most need a helping hand-or simply someone to talk to about their questions and troubles. And as one final boon for those under your wing, a perception-distorting shroud similar to the magics obscuring the Sidereals in Creation proper hides your heroes from powerful organizations and entities that already know of them and wish them harm. While no infallible aegis, it would take considerable effort to lay bare your heroes before they have come into their power.
Should you wish, you may increase your age to be old enough to be a near-contemporary to Chejop Kejak, the remorseful leader of the Gold Faction.Though you are just young enough that your lifespan is guaranteed to outlast this decade. Know that little you have done will have greatly changed the state of affairs in this world. Is the knowledge and experience worth it, to feel so helpless when you could have done so much?"
600,Battle Brother’s Bond,Pokemon Anime,"Nothing brings people together quite like fighting for their lives, or navigating a dangerous ravine without having your bones picked clean by scavengers. When pressed into a stressful situation you are given the opportunity to see others as they truly are deep inside; revealing snot nosed brats as the selfless heroes they could be. After which you may choose to heighten the effects of this experience for both yourself and others; greatly accelerating the development of your relationships, and overcoming conflicts that would get in the way of you working together. However this is only the beginning.
In time you may understand each other intrinsically regardless of language barriers; and develop the fortitude to stand against squads of legendaries undaunted, tear asunder mental influences from one another, and defy dark fates should they try to separate you. Beyond that, perhaps even the power of the mighty Battle Bond may be achieved... though it’s been ages since the world’s been witness to a bond of such strength."
600,Butterfly Miraculous,Miraculous Ladybug,"The power of Transmission. The power to grant superpowers to others. Takes the form of a brooch. Kwami is Nooroo. Default weapon is a cane-sword. You can only empower one person at a time. Allows you to sense powerful emotions even when not transformed, and determine the identity of the person experiencing them, as well as an approximation of the cause behind them. Deactivating the Miraculous doesn’t revoke powers that have already been distributed. There is a limit to how far an Akuma butterfly can get from you before it exceeds your range. The emotions used to create the powers aren’t required to be negative ones.
(Capstone Boosted - Miraculous Mastery)
Upgrades the user’s abilities to match Scarlet Moth, allowing the user to create multiple Akumas at once."
600,Chain Resonance,Soul Eater,"While a Utility Meister is able to alter their soul’s wavelength to resonate with varying people and weapons, Chain Resonance is a technique usually only born through tight-knit bonds and teamwork, and you can now perform it easily.
Chain Resonance is resonating with several teammates at one time, meister and weapon, to create a feedback loop of power and enhanced teamwork. As long as your chosen teammates aren’t rejecting your invitation, you can pull others into Chain Resonance, bringing them up in power in the process. If there’s a small or moderate difference in power, they likely could stand as your equals until the technique ended, and if they’re that much weaker than you they’d still get buffed tremendously. The only limit to the number of teammates is the number you can account for and connect with."
600,Communal Power,Valeria Bleach,"The source of our power was once a single being. All Fullbringers come from this one origin, a communal heritage that creates a connection between all. It is perhaps why they are able to share parts of themselves and take from those willing. And why it has such unique effects when such is done. Fullbringers are able to share parts of their Fullbring with others of their kind. Instead of copying each other’s abilities, it instead increases existing Fullbrings with aspects of the others. A Fullbring whose primary purpose was a full body armor that enhanced physical abilities would grant effects to other Fullbrings in the same style, increasing their coverage and physical traits. A Fullbring that rewrote the past may instead give a new time-related aspect to existing powers. Of course, to some extent, an increase in raw power is also to be expected if shared from someone of greater power than you.
What is unique about you is your perception of this origin. The Soul King, whose body grants your Fullbrings, was more than just the origin of your kind. He was the origin of a great many things. Some known, some not. A realisation that expanded your awareness and allowed your sharing to apply beyond Fullbringers. To give a part of yourself to others, or take from those willing to give, you can carry out the same process. Take part of a Shinigami’s Zanpakuto, using it to boost either your own sword or your Fullbring or something else entirely. Any individual can only grant a part of themself every so often but once given, it is permanent. Through this, you and your friends can grow stronger and expand your horizons together."
600,Getting The Gang Back Together,Shaman King Kang Zeng Bang,"Sometimes, when you start developing superpowers, you leave your old friends behind. You usually make new ones, but there’s always one or two whom you stop being friends with. Or maybe it's an entire gang. Regardless, if you can spend time with them, your old friends will start to develop powers of their own. In this jump, it means shamanic powers. In others, it may mean slight intelligence boosts so that they can build themselves power armor, or a sudden fascination with martial arts. Regardless, you don’t need to leave them behind anymore, because they can, and WILL, be coming with you from now on. Even if it is just to sit on the sidelines and cheer at you during the Shaman Fight. It’s time to get the gang back together."
600,Great Man Theory,Civilization,"You may designate someone as a ‘Great Person of History’. At that point you may attribute a single discovery, innovation or great historical action to that person. Everyone will (including the subject) will believe they did it as well. The selected person gains as much knowledge on the subject as needed to maintain the illusion of their accomplishment, such as dinner conversations or being on the lecture circuit. They may only end up being famous for one thing, if you permit it. Companions remember that they didn’t actually accomplish what you gave them credit for.
If you maintain contact with your Great Person of History, they become phenomenal leaders and can easily manage nations, corporations, research groups in your stead. You gain a perfect awareness of their actions and accomplishments, and can instruct Great Persons with mental or verbal communications, such as the Muse inspiration aura. Subsequent actions or discoveries they take are attributed to them, but rely on your borrowed talents and skills.
You may designate up to eight Persons of History at a time per jump, and remove one such blessing every decade. Removing this blessing reduces their charisma and organizational skill to normal levels, and you no longer have a perfect awareness of their production. At the end of a jump, all Great Persons are reset, and you may select new ones."
600,Gem of Cyttorak,X-Men Evolution,"This rather unique and humongous gem is a one of a kind item that endlessly emits a special type of radiation that has a strange effect on those with mutant powers. In future jumps this’ll mean someone with mutated genetics and innate/biological abilities. When a person bathes in the radiation from the gem for a second, the powers they possess are permanently evolved and enhanced into something many times better than before.
The gem does this evolution by using various means such as removing any weaknesses of powers, expanding and dramatically strengthening the powers, and possibly even granting new powers as well. The last one is done with a case by case basis however as not everyone’s power will be enhanced in that way. Should this valuable gem be destroyed another one will reappear in your warehouse a day later."
600,In Hoots We Trust,Gloryhammer,"The belief you inspire in your allies boosts their own capabilities beyond their normal limits. All of your allies, followers and companions gain a noticeable boost to all of the skills and attributes, with the strength of the effect being proportional to the amount of faith they have in you.
Hootus Dei (Capstone Boosted - Cosmic Infinity)
The more powerful you are personally, the more exaggerated this ability’s effect is. At low levels, a friend who knows you have their back will react quicker to danger and be safer for it. At higher levels, even the least of those who worship you will spontaneously be able to perform miraculous feats of strength and skill as if through divine intervention, if their faith be true."
600,Master of the House,Fate/Grand Order,"Just because you’re a Master, doesn’t mean you can do nothing but supply mana. There’s a long tradition of Masters being genuinely helpful to their Servants and you’re one of the best examples yet. Even if you happen to be a below average Magus in other areas, when it comes to magic that supports your allies, you could help even some of the strongest of heroes. Your support magic, any magic that buffs or enhances one of your allies, is multiplied many times over in effectiveness as long as it is being used on an ally and not yourself. A spell to grant physical strength that might normally only put someone at the peak of human ability could now increase an EX ranked Servant’s strength by a third again. Every one of your buffs will be an invaluable boost to your team, making you just as vital a combat member as any of them.
(Capstone Boosted - Demi-Servant/Pseudo-Servant)
Your buffing ability now scales to the combat level of the ally you are using it with. The stronger they are, the better your buffs for them will be. But this is individual and specific, even buffs that affect entire areas will affect each individual ally on a different level. You may choose to purposefully not use this if you believe your own natural buffing strength, including the base perk of this perk, would be better suited."
600,Norito,/tg/ Sekirei,"By kissing someone­ - it can be a peck on the hand, or forehead -­ you can propel their abilities to absurd heights for a short while. A platonic relationship will grant a noticeable boost in power and tactical options. A bond that can stand the test of time ­­-- pure, true love (platonic, romantic, or otherwise) ­­-- will leave previous efforts in the dust"
600,Protagonist Privileges,Generic Space Opera,"It may be because of some bias the creators in the genre share, but somehow it usually falls to the humble human to take up the main protagonist’s mantle, despite such variety surrounding them. You are aware of this and thus have accepted the burden. The reward you received for that is a definitive increase in overall competence, an increased resistance to bad luck and happenstance and Jumpchan given permission to ‘fake out’ people with a death once per jump."
600,Realm of Myths,Civilization,"You and your chosen people are greater, grander than the others. Your civilization or organizations you lead, including yourself and your Companions, grow taller, healthier, and more mythic in stature.
Legendary feats are now possible for you, such as wrestling a river, or dancing for twenty days and nights without food or rest. You could try to seduce the wind or tickle a mountain. Over time, you can also imbue this trait onto your chosen people (and companions), though any active conceptual effort on their part requires your presence. Those affected gradually become, grander, larger-­than-­life, and serve as inspiration for all kinds of cultural tales and mythology."
600,Rune Magic,Doom 2016,"The most common form of magic in hell, Runes are used for traps, sealing, sacrifice, short range teleportation, and much more. Moreover, when inscribed on the self, runes can be used to enhance strength, durability, maneuverability, stun your enemies, and more. However, you can only have one rune active at a time, although you may swap between different pre-inscribed runes at will.
(Capstone Boosted - Prophecy of the Seraphim)
Your rune magic abilities are greatly enhanced, allowing you to have up to four runes active on yourself at once and allowing you to inscribe runes on others, each person capable of having two runes active at a time."
600,Burst Fusion,Generic Monster Tamer,"With the danger monsters can represent, normal training and equipment may well not be enough to survive in battle, so, you've developed a way of adding the strength of a monster to your own. With a few moments of focus, you can combine yourself with a willing monster, adding their abilities and traits to your own and gaining their combat instincts on top of your own. Additionally, the more trust you possess with the other monster and the better you work together in battle, the stronger this fusion becomes, though this caps at about twice as strong as it would be baseline. You may concede control of the fusion to the monster if you so choose. These fusions are temporary, lasting roughly five minutes to start, but extending up to an hour as the fusion grows stronger.
If you possess the Present Arms! perk, you may spiritually connect with the monsters-turned-equipment for a similar, but lesser, boost.
Post jump, you may fuse with anyone in this way, not just monsters."
600,The Binding,Storm Hawks,"No longer limited to forming bonds with items, you can form deep magical bonds with other people. With the right crystals to provide power, you can easily grant superhuman levels of strength or speed to others, or even allow them to fly. A fully-developed Binding allows this energy to flow both ways, sharing such powers between both you and another. These bonds are potent and not easily broken, able to support and strengthen other mystical abilities that depend on having connections with other beings. Though the Binding is normally built upon trust, friendship or other positive emotions, it is difficult but possible to use this offensively as a way to bypass an enemy's wards and protections. Beware though, for such connections cut both ways, and you will want to be discerning in who or what you open your soul to."
600,The Old Wizard,SB RWBY,"You’re very special. You possess the magic of the Old Wizard who created the four Maidens. This grants you a variety of magical abilities, such as the ability to transform into animals, create protective barriers, speed up your reflexes, and perhaps even more with time and practice. In addition, you have the ability to grant other people magical powers. These abilities may never exceed half of your own power-level, and you may not grant a person more than one power each. You may also rescind any powers given at will. These powers could range from simply transforming into a bird, to full elemental control or more assuming that you’re sufficiently powerful. Granting people powers in this manner is very draining, requiring a huge amount of magic to grant more powerful abilities, which may leave you without your magic for some time.
Lastly, once per Jump, if you die, you can reincarnate into an existing person of your choosing, becoming a voice in their head. Your soul will slowly merge with your host’s soul over the course of a year until only a single soul remains. This single soul will be a merger of your own and your host’s, but you will have full control, and your personality will be unaffected. Over the course of the merger, you will slowly regain all of your perks and abilities. With some effort, you can take over your host’s body before the process completes, though only temporarily. Attempting to reincarnate into any extremely powerful beings without having sufficient power of your own will fail, effectively killing you. The being you reincarnate into must have a physical body."
600,The Power of Holding Hands,/tg/ Symphogear,"You bear no weapon so that you might reach out to both your allies and enemies. This perk grants two benefits, firstly you may apply the enchantments and other benefits of a weapon you could be wielding to your body, be it a flaming sword left in it's sheath at your waist or an Armed Gear you don't form. Secondly, you may take the costs of an ally's powers upon yourself in place of them, applying any cost reductions you may have in place of theirs – although you may use theirs if you wish. Bear the burdens of your friends so that they don't have to.
(Capstone Boosted - Implanted Relic)
Now it becomes possible for you to take upon the backlash effects from multiple people, but on top of that, the backlash is reduced even further based upon the strength of your personal relationship with them, granting no benefit for random bystanders, but reducing a potentially lethal backlash to a minor tickle with true friendship, and all but negating the strain with a bond of love."
600,Under the Same Moon,Rise Of The Guardians,"It’s great being able to support your friends, but it’s hard when all of your supporting abilities only work when you’re nearby and you’re nowhere to be found. Fortunately, the Man in the Moon doesn’t even need to be on the same planet to lend his support, and neither do you. If you have Perks, powers, spells, or abilities that in some way support or strengthen others, but only in a limited range, only if some specific condition is fulfilled, only if triggered or activated, or only for a short time, then your allies and Companions will still receive the benefits of all of those abilities no matter the distance between you, even if an ability would normally only be able to affect a select amount of people. (If a beneficial effect might not always be desirable, such as invisibility, then the recipient may suppress these effects at will.) Of course, you won’t be able to stack these benefits twice.
(Capstone Boosted - Guardian)
Supporting your friends is nice. But many strangers are just friends you haven’t met yet. If there is someone who you would approve of benefitting from a supporting ability you have, then they do, even if you haven’t even met them yet, even if you don’t even know their name. This Perk has a certain amount of prescience; you need not fear these abilities benefitting someone who you approve of now but wouldn’t later on. And for the people you already considered allies? Even more barriers are broken down. Previously, your supporting abilities could benefit someone almost anywhere, so long as they were in the same universe. But now? So long as they are someone you consider a friend or ally, they will benefit from your abilities even in different universes, even if they stay behind and you move on to a new Jump."
600,World Emphasis Framework,Exalted - Alchemicals,"It is quite a shame really, it is arguable that should the eight nations come together they could have easily pushed back the Void. The ideological and nationalistic differences are what give each nation their individual strengths but they also lead to conflict which mitigates those strengths. That is where you come in, when you seek to unite the nations of a world together to fight against an existential threat it becomes increasingly easy to get past their biases and diplomatic issues. Such an alliance of nations will also be empowered by the stability of this alliance, such that a world fully united before the existential threat would be able to fight back at triple its combat power.
Upon the ascension to a Patropoli or Metropoli, you may find that while operating on this scale you might face threats that not even the nations of the world can tackle. The Adamant caste rarely ascend to this venerated form but those who do tend to be home to various machines taking care of their fellow Operatives. Such a collection of heroes perhaps contain the densest amount of power packed into a small group and sometimes
that is necessary for the stability of the world. Every being that resides within your walls shall grow into nothing less than a hero. Mortals shall form the lowest level becoming heroes but those already heroes will find themselves even higher than that. Should all inhabitants be united as one and as numerous a people as the smallest of nations, they could even combat an alliance of all the nations of Autochthonia."
800,Omega-Level Healing Factor,X-Men Movies,"You heal real fast. In addition to normal healing being sped up, this also means you'll be in the prime of your life for centuries and you'll never need to worry about mundane diseases or - to a lesser extent - poisons. Pretty much the only way to completely kill you is to destroy nearly all of your body, destroy your whole brain, or decapitate you and move your head away from your body.
(Notes)
Omega is regrowing your whole body in an hour from a drop of blood. A blood transfusion will also permanently grant someone a healing factor equal to beta level."
800,"Unshakable Spirit, Flawless Mind",SB Stellaris,"The party, and your followers are immune to mind-control, mind-reading, mental intrusion, possession, and forms of corruption. They can carry around cursed artifacts all day without even hearing voices telling them to fall to evil. They are also immune to mental trauma and illness.
In addition, they are also highly observant. A single soldier has as much situational awareness as a recon platoon. They also possess an instinctive judgement of where weak points are, and ECM, illusions, or other information-based countermeasures are an order of magnitude weaker against them.
​Upgrade​ ​(Generic Isekai) (400 CP)
When focusing on a target, you can determine its attributes, abilities, and general status. By spending some of your own mana, you can enhance any of these things. The price grows for targets of a higher level than you, and you can specify specific things to upgrade, ranging from specific attributes all the way to species. This skill can improve anything and everything, but can't be used to learn things. This ability can target almost anything, from equipment to party members, as well as yourself."
