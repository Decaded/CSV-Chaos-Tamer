Cost,Perk Name,Source,Description
100,For The Alliance!,Star Wars - The Original Trilogy,"Knowing how to negotiate is essential for any diplomat, but sometimes it's how you look that matters not what you say. Your presence in a group makes people get along better, just by being in the room you could help make a compromise during a trade negotiation or convince someone to stop arguing and focus on the current issue. You must be a member of one of the groups taking part in the negotiations in order for this perk to work. Regardless of your reputation with the opposing group you will always be able to help out somehow, even if you're negotiating the surrender of a genocidal alien species after you've killed thousands of their soldiers the diplomat sent to speak with you could be so impressed by your feats that he'd be more willing to make concessions."
100,Idolised,Fate/Legends - Garden of Avalon,"Too often are the kings and queens of this world distant to the commoners. How can you truly have faith in someone you have never seen? How can a knight believe in a leader that shows no emotion at the passing of his friends in battle? Perhaps all they need to do is look a little bit further into you to find what they want. You find it incredibly easy to connect to everyone that is following you or has you as a leader, even if you’ve never met them. You are able to form an emotional bond with them so long as your actions affect them, as if you had a chance to talk to them personally. This also lets your actions speak for you, even if you never show emotions, letting people believe in you even without saying it outright. The better you are for someone, the stronger the bond you can force from afar with them."
100,Your Highness,Code Geass,"You have the ability to give off an air of and mime the mannerisms of royalty, and can dramatize your every movement and statement much like Zero presents to the world while allowing you to speak in a very dramatic fashion. You will be taken seriously when you have this active if as a result of this being active people wouldn’t normally take you seriously."
200,A Princ(ess)’ Bearing,Legend of Zelda - Minish Cap,"To stand as a Royal is to stand apart from the common folk. Your every motion is an example of economic movement, with little to no waste in each action. This allows you to get more done faster, not because you are moving faster but simply because you do less to finish a job than others would. In addition to this economy of motion is the air of authority and sheer charisma of one who has the blood of Kings within them."
200,Best of Friends,Pokemon Anime,"The life of a Trainer can be a long and lonely road; whether due to seeing others as obstacles and tools, or becoming too hesitant to reach out to those you’ll leave behind. However, you seem to be the exception to this. No matter how long or far you travel you’ll never treat others as simple background characters in your life, and it’s easy for you to push personal hesitations and inhibitions to talk with others on even ground.
This makes it very easy for you to strike up new relationships with others, whether they’re a waitress at an out of the way café or the princess of a small nation; almost as if your differences make it easier for you to get along, rather than get in the way. These bonds seem to strengthen with exceptional speed and ease, and always stand the test of time; your fond memories of one another being just as vivid the next time you meet. Why with you around, it’s even easier for folks to get along with each other! After all, to you there’s no such thing as “too many friends”; so, go out, and make someone’s day!"
200,Camaraderie,Code Geass,"Whenever you work with someone on something for more than a few days and both you and the person in question would be amiable to it, both you and said person quickly bond over the work you’re doing and you quickly build trust and friendship between you both. Note that this only works if it could happen over a long period of time, this just drastically shortens the amount of time necessary to make it so, making the quote “became fast friends” or comrades a reality."
200,"For You, Anything",Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,"A good king is every man’s dream, should he not be one himself. In the eyes of the men around you, there’s few kings that could be better than you, and you’re pretty good at making others think that way too. You’ve got a great talent for converting enemies to join your side even before you’ve actually beaten them, though offering them the hand of friendship after proving you could have killed them is a lot more potent. Even should you not convince someone to fight with you, you’ll find others never have hard feelings towards you after beating them, even if that means conquering their nation, should you have been fair and reasonable in your methods. Play your cards right and conquering a nation could see it’s people gladly join you and extending a hand to a fallen foe could see a new friend in moments. It does help that most others find you quite agreeable to spend time with and you’ll rarely be without some friends to pass the long nights with."
200,Form Up!,Pokemon Anime,"Wanna know the difference between you, and all those schmucks wandering around like hobos? Teamwork! I don’t mean just spouting orders, and hoping everyone does something useful either; but bonafide well-drilled coordination that comes as naturally as breathing. Before you know it, all of you will be working together like a well-oiled machine; quickly picking up how to compensate, complement and predict one another’s actions. Why with just a bit of practice you and your friends will be performing flashy entrances and poses straight out of power rangers, and executing maneuvers with the kind of precision usually reserved for well-choreographed movie scenes. Just the thing you need to run multi-pilot vehicles or perform intros that’ll prove you’re not just some nameless grunt!"
200,One Vision,SB Stellaris,"Your Empire follows your leadership. Everyone underneath the party understands that the goals they set are important and worth following, even if they don’t understand why."
200,Team Attacks,FancyFireDrake RWBY,"WHITE ROSE! BUMBLEBEE! FREEZEBURN! LADYBUG! FLOWER POWER!... Okay the last one doesn’t work so well as a name for this stuff, but they can't all be gold. Huntsman Teams at Beacon are usually in groups of four. With so many people working as one, teamwork is of the essence, and it’s vital to be able to cooperate flawlessly. Luckily this is no problem for you. Any team you’re on and actively train, fight with, or support seems to always work at their absolute best. Unique possibilities to combine your strengths come to you with ease, making it laughably easy to come up with special techniques. Also, you have a good sense for how to name these techniques that makes them impossible for your enemy to predict, unless they’ve seen it before. Try to come up with something better than ‘Jumper x Companions’, though. Be a little creative, will ya?"
200,Teamwork Always Works,The Games We Play,"An asshole once said that lack of communication kills, but good communication kills a whole lot more. Just, you know, the targets instead of you and yours.
You and anyone you fight with will find that you instinctively know the strengths and weaknesses of each other, moving to protect and support as if you’d been working together for decades. You know how to best use everyone in any given situation, where they would be most effective, what their weaknesses are and how to cover them.
You also understand just how to communicate all this, and more, to your team without offending or upsetting them, knowing just the right way to talk to them. Everyone likes you, and you make teamwork work."
200,Well-Oiled,Diabolical,"Your organization is run with near flawless efficiency. There are no miscommunications between ranks or sections, logistics is always on point, you will not suffer shortages or delays in movements or supply, and there will never be any political or bureaucratic bickering or hindrance. You consistently come in under budget and ahead of schedule, and everyone always knows their place in your plans. Your organization can literally run itself in terms of day to day operations."
400,Everybody Stop Fighting Please,Gurren Lagann,You know how to end conflicts peacefully and help people resolve disputes. You can keep your allies together and help people get over their trust issues.
400,For Clan and Country,Exalted - Burn Legend,"Beyond the advent of the modern era’s decadence, simple infighting and dereliction have left the great Ryuujin houses in near-universal destitution-save for a few houses in Japan. Across Europe, Brazil and North America the remnants of the old houses send itinerants to do what they can against the spiritual foes of the world, while hoarding places of power. But what if someone rose to the challenge? A patriarch or matriarch of such fortitude, charisma and warmth that with luck and pluck the Ryuujin diaspora could once more be forged into a unified force. What if that someone...was you?
You are the kind of born leader who seemingly effortlessly sits atop a totem pole in many fighting games. Whether you are officially a businessman, a dojo owner or something else, your force of personality and management skills command tremendous respect in sectors beyond your impressive field of nominal expertise. Your management skills and organizational expertise are as formidable as your intimidating presence, cowing lesser men into living up to your expectations. Moreover, a quality of your ki lends your spiritual signature a degree of charisma by itself. Where others of your family may resort to kidnapping lost dragons for their power, you will find your very spiritual energy adept at cultivating a familial warmth to put them at ease as you warmly greet them as a long-lost relative and explain the necessity of putting them in a kung fu battle - at once uplifting, and wreathing you in an aura of ancient power that demands respect"
400,Hand in Hand,Pokemon Anime,"Just because humans and pokemon are different, doesn’t mean they must fear each other. After all, legend has it that once both man and mon ate at the same table. Moreover, it is by combining the things that make us different that we can reach past our limits and create something truly wonderful. Raised under such traditions it’s no surprise you’ve become skilled at mediating and promoting cooperation wherever you go. In fact, you find that the greater diversity involved in an endeavor, the greater the end results will be; from more fruitful harvests, to longer lasting structures, or more effective stratagems. If variety is the spice of life, then you’re surely on your way to be a master chef."
400,In Your Presence,Grant Morrison’s 18 Days,"Wars are won not by armies, not by astras and not by vimanas. Wars are won by people. And there are few people such as you. The presence of a divine being such as you on the base earth is like a blazing light amidst the darkness, an impossible radiance that explodes out of you into the souls of all around you.
Your charisma is like a brand on one’s senses, a burning, endlessly bright light that penetrates all obstructions and burns itself deep on the souls of any that behold you. It’s all but impossible for any in your presence to even imagine not doing anything you will, or doing something you forbid.
With but a conversation you can turn the harshest of enemies into devoted fanatics willing to die at your word, and armies would march at but a gesture from your exalted self. Your beauty rises to match your inner might, transforming you into a vision of perfection made manifest. You’re not just good-looking, you’re a God made manifest, a sight men would kill to just see once. Such is your grace that people fall in love with but a glance, and thousands would kill themselves out of despair at the thought of parting company from you.
While it is still possible to resist you, it would take someone with a will strong beyond words and belief, someone willing and capable of laughing in the very face of God Manifest. After all, that is precisely what they would be doing."
400,Regal Charisma,Code Geass,"You have charisma and social tact on par with Schneizel el Britannia. When speaking to others below your stations, your words inspire awe and obedience among personnel, citizens, and alike and when speaking to people on par with or above your station, your words make them think of you as useful, competent, and worthy of your station, granted you are doing your job or what your supposed to be doing. You also become a Master negotiator on par with the White Prince, becoming one of the best in the world, able to broker peace even when both parties hate one another to murderous degrees, or just to talk someone down from doing something rash. You could even manipulate others to do your bidding with a few sentences uttered by you with the right words and motivations."
400,Shining Form,Fate/Legends - Garden of Avalon,"Your will is infectious. Those that stand with you find that they share all your great determination and quickly develop a close understanding of who you are, feeling your ideals unfold before their eyes and understanding why you must act as you do. It is a powerful thing to feel such intimacy with your leader and it can quickly inspire an incredible degree of loyalty in others, letting them become close friends, staunch supporters and excellent battle brothers in just a few battles together. Should someone fight alongside you for long enough, they will even find themselves unwilling to break their oaths to you. They may end up opposing you as an enemy but they will not act dishonorably and break a vow they made to you. They owe you that much at least."
400,"Stop, Collaborate, Listen",Warhammer 40k - T’au,"Humans do not quite mesh with the specialized mentalities of the 4 main T’au castes, but can empathize and communicate with them all to a degree. Explaining to the Fire Caste why relying on artillery and aerial bombardments would destroy your own economy or convincing the Water Caste why tripling the budget won’t finish the Ar’ka Cannon in one third of the time is within your purview. You can draw different mindsets into unison, even mindsets that aren’t fully intelligent, such as dogs and horses, helping bring understanding and empathy for others where the Water Caste would only bring functionality, resulting in partners somewhat capable of stepping out of their previous specializations to a more general mindset."
400,Talk no Jutsu,/tg/ Naruto,"Your charisma is massive. You are the life of the party, the heart and soul of your team. You know how to bribe people and get away with it. You can even convince weak willed people to outright surrender to you or defect to your cause."
400,The Greater Good Takes All,Warhammer 40k - T’au,"Unlike the Imperial, Orkish, or Eldar creeds, the Greater Good is happy to accept all peoples into its embrace. Unlike the Necron creed, the Greater Good doesn’t simply demand all people in its domain die. You can now convince people of almost all races, cultures, species, and contexts to coexist and work together happily, ensuring that civil strife will not arise from your people and ensure a minimum level of functionality for your society, regardless of how diverse its people. Moreover, while the most zealous will be beyond this ability to sway and integrate, you will still be able to understand them and anticipate them to a degree."
600,Believe In The Me That Believes In You!,Gurren Lagann,"Your capacity to inspire others is legendary, people will naturally flock to you for leadership, children will see you as their champion and your lovers will hold you in their hearts for all time. Even if you die your followers would just make you a martyr and carry on your cause. Aside from being inspirational you also gain the ability to appear in your followers' dreams/hallucinations whenever they're in danger. You can use this ability to guide them out of illusionary prisons or give them the advice they need to survive on their own."
600,Got That Fuji Fire,Fate/Grand Order,"Servants have a whole lot of power. If it were just you, even if you had a bunch of other Masters with you, against the forces of evil? You’d be pretty screwed. But the Servants can’t do it alone either. Legendary people come with legendary egos and legendary problems, getting them to work together would take a miracle worker. That’s your cue. Be it loyalty or friendship or love, you’re like a magnet for all three. Just a few days of fighting alongside someone is enough to forge a lifelong bond of brotherhood or cause someone to fall deeply in love with you. Not just one at a time either. Even a few dozen people, each normally hostile to you and only grudgingly working with you for their own sakes, could fall in love with you at the same time. Talking to people and fighting with them or supporting them, that’s all you need to show them why you’re the man for them.
(Capstone Boosted - Demi-Servant/Pseudo-Servant)
Loving you will now allow someone to grow in power the more deeply they fall in love with you and open up to you. Their bond with you will unlock new levels of power within themselves, some that they had lost and some they never realised they had available to themselves."
600,Heart of a Hero,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,"It’s the heart of a true hero that creates legends like that of Jason and his Argonauts, rather than the strength or skill he might have held. An almost indescribable charisma that lures other great beings to the main character to aid him, such charisma that you share. While normal people find you very easy to like and trust, you find it almost effortless to draw the admiration, interest and positive attention of divine beings and heroes alike, even without trying they will gather around you and sometimes offer blessings or significant aid. Actively trying could put together a loyal, closely bound dream team of the best heroes of the age or have multiple rival gods set aside their differences to aid you in major ways, providing powerful blessings or clearing major obstacles from your path. This can be pushed too far, and the wrath of the sorts of people you attract is definitely something you don’t want placed in your direction, but you have a good sense of how people think of you and what their limits are, particularly towards how far you can push them to do immoral things. While your capabilities are strongest when applied to heroes or divine beings, you also find that they are still effective against anti-heroic and villainous characters, though to a much lesser degree."
600,King’s Charisma,One Piece - New World Edition,"Your word is law, and all who listen know it. You are an incredibly charismatic individual, capable of getting dozens, if not hundreds of people willing to follow you to the ends of the earth and doing whatever you ask of them with the right words and actions. And if you were to acquire the use of Haki, either through training or the perk, you would be able to use Conqueror’s Haki, which lets you command basic animals and enforce your will upon those weaker than you, causing them to be paralyzed or faint."
600,Military Genius,Code Geass,"You become the foremost expert in running a military force, resource management, and best military strategist in the world. Along with this you gain the charisma of an experienced military commander, able to inspire people you’re in command of effortlessly and effectively move your forces to near zealotry when it comes to your causes. Whenever you oversee any sort of recruitment efforts, you can expect it to go five times quicker than if you weren’t and this guarantees that any that are recruited under you are not traitors, turncoats, spies, or working for other governments or militaries. Even people who slip through the cracks and are only in it for themselves can easily be swayed to your sphere of influence once they’ve participated in an operation or two under your command, perhaps seeing that your forces are for the good of the world and are needed for whatever bad things are happening in the world, like minimizing civilian casualties. All operations commanded by you make all troops and personnel operate at 100% efficiency without any ill effects to them for the duration of the operation."
600,The Hero of Charity,Fate/Legends - Nirvana Yuga,"In a time when feuds have lasted generations and terrible wars raged for years over the problems of a meagre few, it must be something special to be someone that the enemy cannot deny. Yours is the soul of a gallant hero, a mien of such intensity that all who see you are forced to acknowledge that you are someone important in this world. Whatever impression you leave on people, whatever effects you have, they are magnified enormously. What might be a normal rivalry between young men could develop into a tale remembered in legends for millennia to come, a god who might feel respect for your humility in obeying his wishes normally would feel himself so filled with shame for taking advantage of you that he would force himself to grant his finest weapon in recompense.
A stature as what you have, as a hero or an antagonist, is certain to gather many allies around you. When a few words of friendship and a battle at each other's side is enough to become lifelong friends, you are sure to become an icon to those around you. Indeed, your very nature is that of one to whom friendship results in far greater results than normal. That which you receive from your dear friends willingly becomes vastly greater in scope. Fighting alongside your brothers in arms would see you defeat foes thrice your might in normally impossible battles. A weapon received from a dying friend would ignite with a hundred times it’s normal shine, bolstered to incredible levels by the bonds you share. If you found yourself fighting the heavens themselves, with only the gifted power of two gods that have declared themselves your friends, you might yet succeed. For what could even an entire pantheon hope to achieve against the power of friendship?"
600,True Companion,A Study In Emerald,"When the game is afoot there is nothing better than to have a stalwart friend at one’s side, or perhaps
watching one’s back. To you comes easily the power to strike up friendships with the loners, the suspicious,
and the isolationist, and once you earn someone’s trust and company, to share the destiny and of those you
travel through life beside, linking your fates and the great deeds (or misdeeds) you both may accomplish.
If the one of you is protected by fate and divine providence, so too shall the other, for only a grave
threat indeed shall separate you. As a matter of instinct, you will always recognise someone who will make
a true and excellent companion and will always recognise your existing companions regardless of
circumstance or failing memory. Fate has in store greatness for you and your chosen companion(s)."
600,We Stand Together,/tg/ Worm,"In anything you are personally involved in, you can instill effectively perfect cooperation and teamwork among those around you. Even bitter enemies who want nothing more then to see each other dead will stand side by side and work together like they've been doing so all their lives as close comrades. The results of this cooperation tend to be the best physically possible with everyone involved. The effects of this perk will tend to rub off over time if you allow it, encouraging cooperation and discouraging infighting or conflict when there are more serious matters that require everyone to work together. As a final added benefit, casualties always seem to be minimal for any dire situation in which this perk takes effect."
