100,Apprentice,Diabolical,"This option allows you to have an imported Companion or Canon Character take on the mantle of your apprentice or sidekick – a trustworthy and capable brother or sister in arms. They will share your same motivations and morals or leave their own at the door so you always see eye-to-eye when it comes to work, and have a supernaturally effective, instinctive teamwork with you. You will never have to plan beforehand to have your movements and goals coincide perfectly, and you will always be able to anticipate each other’s course of action and attacks – friendly fire doesn’t exist, and you will never trip each other up or get in the other’s way. A Companion taking this puts them into this position."
100,Assistant,Diabolical,"You now have an assistant who is knowledgeable of all that you are – they know the technologies you know, are well versed in whatever school of magitek you might subscribe to, are equally educated in your favored sciences, and are able to begin, continue, and complete any projects that you might undertake with the same eye for detail and diabolical genius that you would. They will share your same morals and motivations or will leave their own morality at the door, but either way they will never disappoint or fail you. With this you can take a break from the lab and know that the mutant chinchillas you were developing will be properly completed, tested, refined, and ready for mass production. They will even move on to the next task at hand if you are not present to instruct them, and they need no supervision to research and develop tech you will find useful. A Companion taking this puts them into this position."
100,Lieutenant,Diabolical,"You have at your disposal a similarly capable leader in your second in-command, possibly an imported Companion or a particularly impressive henchman. This person is expertly trained in management and command, with identical morals and motivations to your own or have left their own at the door, ensuring there is never a conflict of interest and you will always see eye-to-eye when it comes to work. They can plan, strategize, manage, command, and inspire in your same style and similar if not exact skill, and can allow you some well-deserved downtime or let you shift your focus to something else for time while you can remain confident that your operation is being led by a person who is worthy of being called your most trusted and capable lieutenant. A Companion taking this puts them into this position."
400,Picture Of Your True Love,Big Trouble in Little China,"You have a picture of your soulmate, your true love. This can be an existing Companion, or a new one acquired in this Jump. This picture is indestructible, and the relationship you have with your true love will never fade away or degrade. It will only get better and better. Also, in future Jumps, your true love will be imported for free, with your choice of that Jump’s Companion Import option, or with 600cp to spend, including freebies and discounts from their Origin. Your true love does not take up a Companion slot."
400,Retinue,Diabolical,"You are accompanied at nearly all times by a handful of your most powerful bodyguards, trusted advisors, and/or brilliant commanders. They go where you go, even if the invitation is for you ‘to come alone’ their presence will be unquestioned and tactfully tolerated, and are utterly and completely trustworthy. This group allows you to have protection from very nearly any threat upon your person, as they will be targeted first or will sacrifice their lives to save yours without hesitation. However, replacing them is difficult; these are not your standard henchmen. It will require considerable effort and time on your part to find a suitable substitute. They are all extremely skilled at their respective roles – whichever you decide those are - and will assist you with hyper-competence in managing your villainous organization, or any other facet of your life they can reasonably assist with. At almost any time you can summon them to your side with but a thought and they will heed your call, regardless of where they are or what they may be involved in. The only thing that will bar them from your side is death, though if they have to fight through a fortress to get to you, it may take them a while… if they manage to survive it. You may import up to five Companions into these slots, or fill them with five generic henchmen. For these henchmen/Companions, they have a special exception to the perks A Shadow of My Power and Authority Equals Asskicking: they are considered very near the top of your organization for the purposes of sharing your powers and receiving buffs to their abilities, skills, and stats."
400,The Right One,Generic Romantic Story,"Do you have a Soulmate, someone who is a match for you in every way that matters to you. Impossible to describe, since each person is different, that person is the right one for you, though this need not be a romantic thing. Just once, you may designate someone your Soulmate. You may gift any of your perks to this companion, either now or in the future and they may do likewise, though once a perk is gifted, it can’t be given back. They can use any item only you should be allowed to use if you’re willing to allow them to do so. The Right One always imports with you if you want them to, gaining a complementary background and form that works well with yours as well as any freebies needed to survive. This never costs anything. You can give any of your Points you want to the Right One. A pair of companions may purchase this with their own points (each paying half), and from then on, the two of them count as a single companion."
600,In Sickness and in Health,Generic Hentai World,"The end goal of all Romantics is to wed their beloved and spend the rest of their lives together. That means something very different for an immortal jumper than for most other people though. Does your love for your partner, and theirs for you, have what it takes to last for all eternity? What kind of stupid question is that, of course it does! You and your spouse will never grow tired of each others’ presence, and the passing of years will only make you grow more fond of each other. Further, your partner immediately becomes a Companion if they weren’t already. In future jumps you may choose to either pay nothing to import them and donate your own CP to them at a 1:1 ratio or use a jump’s existing import options and gain all related benefits instead. If you successfully complete an Endjump Scenario then Jump-chan will reward your partner with a Spark of their own in honor of your enduring love for each other. This perk can only ever benefit a single person regardless of all other factors."
