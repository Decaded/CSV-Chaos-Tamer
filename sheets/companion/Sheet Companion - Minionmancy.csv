Cost,Perk Name,Source,Description
100,Bind Demons,Runepunk,"You know how to summon and bind demons to your will in the traditional manner. You can further bind demons into objects to set them to work or grant astonishing fairy-tale powers to the items in question, though each demon can do but one job and an item can hold but one captive demon."
100,Noise Creation,The World Ends With You,"You can create and command Noise by binding souls to pins. Not only is this an effective means of erasing Players, you can actually use this to save a dying person- In a way. By binding their soul into a Pin, you can make them into Noise, and they will retain all of their faculties and intelligence. However, they will be unable to speak, and will be relatively weak. If their body is erased, you can just summon them again."
100,Rules Lawyering,Bartimaeus Sequence,"Spirits are treacherous things, cunning and deceitful. You need to be careful in how you give orders to them, as they will hear your orders, and then use their millennia of experience to find some loophole, some trick that will allow them to fuck up your plans while keeping within the letter of your commands. Well, now you’re always two steps ahead of them. You learn how to think in the winding, convoluted ways of spirits, and how to give instructions that cover every little loophole and shore up every possibility. Although sometimes it’s just neater to summon the less problematic ones. Taking fifteen minutes just to order a foliot to run a bath can get tiresome.
(Notes)
Summoning and the various manipulations of essence continue to function as they’re supposed to, regardless of where you go. You might experience some turbulence now and then, as the distance between whichever reality you’re in and the Other Place increases, but it shouldn’t be a serious problem."
100,Saint Gatherer,Faint/Grand Order,"A unique substance to be found in this world, Saint Quartz are powerful multi-coloured crystals that can be attained by accomplishing certain sorts of actions. Completing quests or journeys, making daily significant progress towards your main goals to gain every second day, taking part in important events in the story of the world or forming very close and strong bonds with other people all have a chance or certainty of granting a Saint Quartz. Once obtained, there are three uses for these crystals. One can be used to fully restore your energy and fatigue, one can be used to revive you and a small number of allies from the brink of death to full health again or one can be used to chance the summoning system within the Grand Order system, so long as one has the support of Chaldea. This perk is free for Human Type Jumpers for the duration of the jump but may be kept for future jumps, or bought by Servant Types, for 100CP."
200,A Chest Full of Demons,Legend of Zelda - Minish Cap,"Well, not really, like Vaati and Ganondorf you have an ability to conjure servants to do your whims. Weak soldiers are easy enough to conjure even at the start you could create dozens of Moblins or Octorocks but only six or seven Wallmasters or Darknuts. With time, and as your magical energy and skill grows your skill at summoning will grow to frankly incredible levels with growth stopping around the level where you could conjure an army, hundreds of mooks per summoning and dozens of high tiered monsters summoned if you summon no mooks. Though growth past the point is possible it will take exponentially more time and effort for each additional summoned minion."
200,Enhanced Summoning,Overlord Jumpchain,"All summoned creatures you call forth will be 50% more powerful, stick around for 50% longer if the summon is duration based, and will cost 50% less magic to actually summon. Only works on creatures you summon with magic, creatures you create with magic don’t count. Discounted with Summoning Specialty."
200,Greater Summoner,Legend of Zelda - Hyrule Warriors,"Summoning, the act of bringing forth something or someone from somewhere else. The most powerful being Cia who brought forth entire eras and armies, though more than a bit of an outlier considering her reliance on the Triforce and Gate of Souls for such feats.
Summoning is arguably the most widespread of magic with members of every army having more than a few. Perhaps it’s because it is so valuable in war that it’s fostered among varying militaries.
Summoning, to put it simply, is bringing something from somewhere else to where you are now. The larger and farther away the object, the harder it is to summon. The less familiar you are with an object, the harder it is to summon. Normal summoners within this war are used to summon reinforcements as a result, limited to bringing forth allies one at a time from nearby camps.
You have a bit more skill in the art and can summon several allies at a time or call up objects as large as an elephant, and put them back too."
200,Heart and Soul,Exalted - Infernals,"All Yozi have a fetich-heart, a demon of the Third Circle who acts as the defining soul of their being, more powerful and important than any of their other souls. If these should ever be slain, their Yozi progenitor would find themselves remade. As an Infernal possessing of a soul of your own, you would normally be above such weaknesses.
Yet this state also grants advantages and so you may now invest a greater measure of your might into one of your externalized demonic souls. This will both make them terrifyingly more powerful than most Third Circle Demons and able to channel your own full power for a short time, if you permit them to. Take care though, for if they call on your might too often without taking time to rest, they shall destroy themselves. Unlike the Yozi, the death of your heart soul does not mean your identity is completely remade, as you still have your original soul, though the experience will be extremely painful.
Should you have Descending Hierarchy in addition to this perk, and later learn The Path of a Thousand Whispers, then you may empower two of your souls in this way. Just as the King of Primordials, The Empyreal Chaos, was once flanked by his twin Fetich Souls, so too shall you be flanked by your own."
200,Master of Puppets,Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,"Everyone is born with talent for something, your talent just happened to be making life. When it comes to magic involved in the creation of familiars, even the summoning of them, you’re miles beyond any of your peers. While you are not the best in the world with just this, your raw skill and power with magic still lacking compared to the greats, you’ll find anything in relation to the creation, alteration and maintenance of magical familiars, summons and living creations comes to you with the ease of breathing. You learn far faster, your products are of a vastly higher quality and come with far more efficiency than what your fellow magicians might create. It is even far more cost efficient for you to make them, as you take just a quarter of what others would expend to create the same things.
You have particular talent too in ensuring the loyalty of that you consider a familiar, whether this be designing the minds of creatures you create as easily as you design their bodies or creating lines of spell or rune magic to add to a summoning ritual to ensure much stronger bonds of servitude exist on what you summon. It also happens that you are quite good at creating and overlooking legal contracts, mostly from all the interaction with demons."
200,Names,Runepunk,"You are familiar with the names of a large number of demons, about 40% spread across all five circles, as well as their powers and reputation. Such knowledge updates where applicable in future worlds."
200,Taboo Refinery,The World Ends With You,"You have unlocked the terrible secret of the Taboo Noise- Black-and-Gray Noise that are more powerful and aggressive than regular noise, attacking denizens of the UG indiscriminately. Taboo Noise can only be effectively harmed by someone holding a Light Puck. Combined with Noise Creation, this lets you summon Taboo Noise, and with Noise Form, this lets you make your Noise Form into Taboo Noise, which will boost its power massively."
200,Soul Separation,Valeria Bleach,"Hollows are already such lonely beings. By their very nature, they can’t help but prey on all those around them. But it gets even worse for those who become too strong. Robbed even of the company of fellow monsters, their spiritual pressure lethal in it’s intensity, only a lucky few unlock this ability. You are able to separate your own soul into different independent beings. While they have some aspects of your personality as their own, they are otherwise entirely new life. The power they possess is directed by how much of your own Reiryoku you permanently invest into them, lowering your own maximum but with the potential to combine to your original power at any time. Perhaps one could even train at an accelerated rate through this.
Their loyalty to you is fierce and unquestionable, as is the intimate bond they naturally have. They are a part of you, closer than any lover or friend could hope to be. Is this what those Shinigami experience with their swords? Your ability is not unlike the Zanpakuto, though you lack the additional powers an Asauchi would give, and even when you recombine these other beings you create will not fade. Instead, their voices live on alongside you. It is possible to target specific parts of your soul this way, such as the elements of one race in a hybrid soul."
200,Specific Specialization,Overlord Jumpchain,"You can purchase this perk more than once, each time you do so you can specialize in a specific branch or theme of magic. You will then be capable of spells of greater potency, scope, power, or so forth within that specific theme. The spells and magics you learn via these choices will always be superior than the ones you could learn without them, often being cheaper to cast, more powerful, larger in scope, or so forth. Taking a specialization doesn’t make you worse at things outside of your specialization, it just makes you better at the things you specialize in. Pick from the following list.
Summoning
You are really good at summoning magics. Creatures you call up are more powerful, longer lasting, and often tend to have special abilities they wouldn’t otherwise have. Maybe you called up frost wolves that have a chill aura rather than regular wolves, or maybe that fire elemental you called up can spawn more of itself that will then also fall under your control. This explicitly works with summoning magic you know even outside of this jump, granting your summoned creatures extra strength and abilities thematic with their nature. If you were to purchase this alongside the Augmented Summoning innate talent your magical summons would be fearsome indeed. Why bother dealing with something yourself when you could send a disposable minion to do it for you? The perfect ability for masterminds (or the lazy). Summons made via the Ranked Magic system are perfectly loyal to you unto death, and you’ll find that with this that loyalty applies even to summons via other magic systems.Creatures and beings of godlike power, however, may be able to resist the enforced loyalty clause. Summon Mab or Cthulhu at your own risk. Additionally most summons are temporary, and the enforced loyalty is only in effect while they are serving as your summon. Keep in mind when using summons from other jumps that some summoned creatures have long memories, and may seek you out on their own if they feel you abused your influence over them."
200,Summon,Runepunk,"You have mastered the forbidden rune for summoning without circles, candles or other paraphernalia. All five circles of demons are available to you, and will serve you without question or treachery for one hour when called before vanishing into the ether."
200,Ward’s Maxim,World of Tentacles,"Does nobody besides you read Lovecraft before they start dabbling with eldritch forces anymore?! You’ve learned to never call up anything that you can’t put down and you put that lesson into play by ensuring you’ll never lose control of your creations. Any creatures summoned or created by you as well as any devices you build have a built-in kill switch which you can use to restrain, kill, power off, or otherwise neutralize them at will. The nature of this trigger is up to you as long as the effects are the same, but it can only be exploited by you or those instructed in its use by you. You are also automatically inoculated against any chemical or biological agents you may create."
300,Descending Hierarchy,Exalted - Infernals,"At the center of the hierarchies of the Demon City are the unquestionable, the demons of the Third Circle. These mighty beings emanate from the Yozis themselves, who define the demon realm by their very existence. Third Circle demons are forces of nature, with several terrible and simultaneous bodies. Usually, they are totally immune to death by physical assault; their weaknesses are few.
Some of these Demons Princes live atop great spires, castles and aeries that overlook their fiefdoms of lesser demons. In other cases, these demons are the structures themselves, or the streets, rivers, chasms, and other landmarks seen everywhere in the city. Some rare demons possess even more abstract and ephemeral forms, such as a living emotion or a piece of music. Each of these monumental beings has seven souls, each a Second Circle Demon in their own right.
You can now follow the Yozis example and externalize an aspect of your soul to form the core of a new being. Weaving a chrysalis out of thin air and essence, to incubate a sleeping and inchoate demon of the Third Circle. Depending on how much power it is desired to have, this phase may take anywhere between three weeks or more than two seasons. Once they emerge from this fully formed, they may then themselves form a set of seven demons of the Second Circle as normal. Who may, in turn, create entire races of First Circle demons to serve them.
You may create up to eight of these mighty Demons, before you cannot endure the strain of creating another. However, if one should be destroyed in some way despite their power, you may replace them with another by weaving their chrysalis anew. None of the demons created by you can be more powerful than you in general, for no part can eclipse the whole… But they may outpace you in specific areas and in their own specialties, if you are unskilled there. So it might come to pass that a warrior without compare could create a lower soul that
far surpasses them in sorcery, but never one that could defeat them in single combat. And while Demons created in such a way are not required to obey their creator, they carry an unbreakable tie of loyalty towards them and should their progenitor ever die a final death, they shall perish with you. This influence is mutual however; as you will gain an unbreakable connection to their goals just as they feel loyalty towards you.
Should you ever learn The Path of a Thousand Whispers, the limit on how many Third Circle Demons you may have shall be expanded. So that you may retain a maximum of twenty-three in total, matching the most numerous of Yozi and awarding you eight more than any other Devil Tiger might be able to spawn.
Duality (400 CP)
Thamiel created demonkind by shredding the soul of Sataniel, dividing him into a fractal descending hierarchy, ever decomposing. Now, your soul and power are similarly divisible.
By shedding fragments of yourself, you can give rise to lesser beings. Creating weaker demons bound by the limits of the animal kingdom is a simple matter; you can only excrete a few dozen to start with, but Thamiel created an army of such beings from a single soul, and you may also rise to such heights in time. Greater demons with their own abilities are much harder to create, requiring the investiture of your own power and abilities into them, thereby diluting and dividing your power as an individual.
Slain demons return their essence and power to your greater soul, ensuring no permanent loss save for some stress or trauma."
300,One And The Same,Pathfinder,"As a Summoner, you are intrinsically linked to your Eidolon in ways that most will never truly understand. You fight together, live together, and grow together. However, for you, more than any other Summoner, the last one truly applies. Any strength you gain will be shared with your Eidolon. If you grow stronger, so does it. If your swiftness increases, so shall its. This will apply to both permanent growth and temporary buffs and will also apply in the opposite direction. Furthermore, this will affect any other beings or projections with which you are similarly linked."
300,Reading Rainbow,Soul Eater,"Take a look, it’s in a book, new friends in every library. Books are your friends (and your parent in a way), and with this perk, you should take that literally. You now have the power to turn books, or chapters from them, into living beings based on the book, chapter or even a specific fictional character.
The amount of power and life breathed into your new friend is of course based on the amount of magic that you push into the process, though as a result you’ll of course be unable to make something stronger than yourself. To help a bit, you can use external energy sources to fuel the process"
300,Summoning,Fate/Grand Order,"(Requires Saint Gatherer)
The Summoning System is the mechanism through which the Masters of Chaldea intend to summon Servants to fight for them and Craft Essence to enhance or assist those Servants. It is a randomised system, with more powerful or notable Servants and Essence being harder and harder to get. A single roll of this random mechanism requires a single Saint Quartz and will grant a single result, with no guarantees either way. Servants summoned through this method by you will fight for you, with varying degrees of enthusiasm, but they are not companions nor do they receive any additional benefits like companion Servants bought through this document will. While this system is free for Humans in this jump, it may be bought to keep, even by Servants, for 300CP. In future jumps it will continue to summon Servants, only based off of the world it is currently in, drawing from historical or mythical or fictional or even future beings from that world. It will also continue to summon Craft Essences and such for use. Both these will follow the same rules as they do in this jump."
300,Summoner’s Guard,Fate/Grand Order,"How are you meant to fight alongside your Servant if they’re throwing around all these gigantic explosions? You’ll be able to stick by them with this, though you’ll still want to be wary of the enemy’s blows. You’re unable to be harmed by the attacks or negative effects of anything that you have summoned, whether it’s directed or accidental. Attacks just phase through you, though you may still be at risk due to the damage it does to the environment around you. This only applies to friendly or neutral summons, any being that is hostile to you will be able to harm you even if you’ve summoned them."
300,To Treat With Spirits,Sword & Sorcery,"Of what use is the ability to realize the veil is there if you cannot reach beyond it? You possess that most basic of arcane tricks. You may beckon forth spirits to converse with. These beings' natures are as varied and unique as a man can imagine, and even more so. Still, beings such as they may teach you of the world and places beyond. From arcane secrets, to doors that open only when a desert snake sheds it's skin beneath a desert rain, to insights a human mind would never come to on it's own. The types and strength of spirits you can call forth will grow as you gain in skill and power. But be warned sorcerer. The spirits you may summon may not all be friendly, and should your skill, strength, and above all sense fall short you may find yourself imperiled greatly. You would need to be mighty indeed to treat with gods without being destroyed. But even lesser conjurers may reap the spoils of this talent. A man's place in the world can often be decided by the company he keeps after all."
400,Boogie Manimal,/tg/ Worm,"You are able to produce a strange fog-like substance which you can then shape into creatures, their natures being limited only by your imagination and how you craft them. These are under your mental control, and you can sense everything they do. The more of the fog you invest into a creature, and the longer you take in its creation, the stronger and more powerful it will be. Creatures may have certain abilities of their own based on how you've made them, and at any time you may invest more fog into them to modify or strengthen them further, with no (in theory if maybe not so much in practice) upper limit. Creatures default to a completely loyal if predatory mentality unless you make them otherwise. The fog itself is mostly transparent to you and your creations, and can be pumped out to cover large areas."
400,Come Forth,Cthulhu Saves The World,"The beings inside the Mythos are great and powerful, yes, but they have their flaws. Sort of. The more powerful of these creatures can be bargained with, though you often will find the costs not to your liking. Thanks to tireless research into the Mythos, you have gained the ability to devise summoning rituals for damn near anything. Of course, given that the Cthulhu Mythos is filled with insanity inducing gods, summoning any of them may be a bad plan. Maybe try summoning your lost car keys?"
400,Empower Summoning,Runepunk,"Minions you summon are stronger than they would otherwise be, with 50% more health/resilience, 20% more energy, and a special power that is an expansion or refinement of their base nature or powers."
400,​Gacha​,Generic Isekai,"You can open a menu which allows you to spend mana in order to spin a variety of different Gachas. The different Gachas each have a set price based on the average value of the outcome, and offer different possible rewards, which may be monsters or items from any world you have visited. While the cheapest Gacha may only offer common drops, more expensive Gachas could include a chance to drop rare, unique items or monsters. Gachas which can target past worlds are more expensive than those that don’t, but not unreasonably so, and even some of the cheaper Gacha may offer a small chance of dropping something rare."
400,Mass Buff,GURPS Dungeon Fantasy,"You know the worst thing about having a lot of minions? Protecting them. What’s that you say? They’re supposed to protect you? Well, that’s true, but if you protect them back, they get better at it! But it’s so time consuming... well no more! Henceforth, whenever you cast a spell upon yourself, you may have it propagate to every creature you have summoned! Useful trick, no?"
400,Spawning,The Games We Play,"Like the Goliaths and other larger Grimm, you can spawn lesser Grimm from your body. Beowolves, Nevermores and other similarly weak and numerous Grimm.
Whether this is through Naraka, something related to Malkuth or something else altogether is up to you. Whatever it is, it takes you energy to create these, and you can at most spend three quarters of your total power on creating them, though they’re not reliant on you to exist once created. Still obedient to death and beyond, though.
You can improve on the quality and quantity of the Grimm produced with time and effort, and come to be able to create other, similar beings in future jumps. Get practiced enough and you could create entirely new creatures altogether!
The Grimm, or creatures, you create in such a way are extensions of yourself. You can see through their eyes, hear with their eyes and so on. You can control them directly, if you’d like, but such a thing isn’t exactly easy."
400,Spiritual Guidance,SB Stellaris,"Leaders, advisors, and other people you want can’t die. Instead, they stick around in a ghost form, still able to effectively lead and communicate, but unable to physically affect anything. Their learning ability greatly slows down after death as well.
(Notes)
These apply in some form to any empire, nation, civilization, or organization under your control, even if you don’t Import your Empire into that future Jump. The perks will be adapted as needed to actually be relevant towards any organization they are applied to. The party does directly benefit from effects that affect the people in these organizations."
400,Summoner,Rise Of Legends,"This is perhaps the most famous talent that the Alin are known for; almost every major figure of the Alin has some summoning skills through their magic. You’ve embraced this oldest of traditions, and your skill at wielding this power is extraordinary indeed. Any abilities you use to summon magical beasts or elementals will be twice as effective, with the specific advantages chosen by you at the time of use. The most straight-forward advantage would be to summon twice as many creatures to your side, but you could just as easily choose to strengthen your creations instead, or perhaps grant them some limited magical powers of their own."
400,The Library,Bartimaeus Sequence,"A magician is only really as good as his knowledge. Well, now you’re the best of them, then! You get a full­sized library, containing just about every book you need to go from a complete novice to a Magician of the highest degree. Names of Demons, summoning and binding techniques, the whole nine yards. Not just that, your library also contains books on how to make artefacts like seven league boots, Golems and magical weapons. Mind you, while this gives you the knowledge to make them, doing so is still a very strenuous and draining process, quite possibly even for you.
In future worlds, this library will fill up automatically with the local magical knowledge, and there will always be enough to give you a sound, thorough education, in whatever the subjects may be."
600,Army of the Dead,The Circumstances Leading To Walraute’s Marriage,"Similar to Brynhildr herself, you hold great power over the Einherjar or souls of the dead. You can take in the souls of those you kill or who accept your request to become an Einherjar, placing these souls within your own. You can then summon them out as absolutely loyal soldiers. Their minds will be gone but they will retain all their skill, power and equipment at the time of death. There is no limit to how many souls you may store but the number you can summon is limited by your power, though you have a head start. At the current time you can manage summoning several hundred thousand souls at once, provided you have that many, and you are able to masterfully command all this number at once via mental commands to the Einherjar."
600,Army of the Soul,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,"The reality marble is the manifestation of your soul, the deepest expression of your personal reality projected onto the world around you, granting you new powers and capabilities within that projection and without it. However, you’re something of a special case, as your Reality Marble is not quite the same. Rather than something reflecting your own unique soul, and thus not taking the place of any potentially forming natural Reality marble should you have the potential, is something representing a collective.
You are able to project a vast landscape around you, similar to other reality marbles, that takes you and anyone within a moderate range into a dimension pocket that is difficult, but not impossible, to break out of. Within this world, taking the form of a battlefield such as an empty plain or desert fields, is your army. The army of those beings that have pledged their loyalty to you in battle, even if only for a short time, as that action creates a spiritual replica of that person stored within your soul. This replica is the same as that person at the peak of the time that they served you, with their memories, power, equipment and so on. There is no limit to the replicas that can be stored within your spirit this way and it costs you nothing to do so, each of them acting to your will when you project the Reality Marble. Even outside of the full projection, you are able to summon individuals or small groups of these replicas to aid you in the normal world and can potentially learn to accomplish new things, such as taking on the abilities of those replicas or summoning them in combined forms.
It is costly to fully project and create a dimension pocket, especially to maintain it, but your mana reserves have been increased to allow for easy maintenance of your full Reality Marble for several hours before exhausting yourself. It is less costly to make use of the partial summonings and other lesser abilities described earlier but still notable."
600,Atop the Fourth Wall,Re:Creators,"The Power of the Holopsicon is Altair’s alone, but even a single aspect of its abilities is enough to change the face of worlds. This is that aspect. By breaking through the barrier of worlds, this power gives you the ability to 'summon' a fictional character (known as a Creation) into reality, with some caveats. They have to be very well known. They don’t need to be the icon of their genre, but they should be able to claim a sizable fanbase. A good barometer is if the character is at least well known enough to have merchandise being produced of them and sold on a worldwide basis, though this isn’t literally necessary - just the general level of demand and adoration for the character’s existence. There also is the issue of a world's Restorative Power- Many worlds will naturally resist a Creation if the Creation displays abilities beyond what it is capable of ‘processing’ so to speak. In mundane worlds closer to Re:Creators' earth, magic, extreme super science and psionics will 'test' the fabric of reality and force the hand of Restorative Power. In places where these things already exist and are commonplace, these abilities will be perfectly accepted and normal. If too much stress is put on the world's Restorative Power, it will cause glitches in reality as it tries to process these anomalies and the offending Creation may be destroyed as an attempt to restore order."
600,Binding And Banishing,Diablo 1+2,"The practice of summoning demons for various tasks was once quite common among the mage clans. Eventually forbidden by an edict enforced by an order of assassins, there still exists vast bodies of knowledge on the topic, knowledge which has fallen into your hands. You are a master summoner able to call forth and command all but the mightiest of beings, and your skill extends even further to include ghosts and spirits of all sorts - even angels, if you dare risk the ire of the high heavens.
Only the strongest and most unruly of beings even have a chance to break your bindings or twist the intent of your commands, but you've still taken the precaution of mastering the arts of warding and banishment as well. The weakest of creatures not native to the plane of existence you dwell upon will not be able to approach, let alone attack you, and you can easily restrain or banish large groups of such entities at a time. Great effort will be required to handle stronger beings or hordes of lesser creatures with the same ease, but with careful preparation and barring unforeseen complications, you are very likely to emerge from such contests victorious."
600,Born Anew,Hollow Knight,"The Grimm Troupe’s goals are simple. Maintain the Nightmare Heart through rituals of succession. The act of reincarnation, transferring its essence from host to host. This interests you very much, and after much experimentation and the deaths of more than a few non-sentient bugs, you’ve cracked your own version of this and figured out how to create a suitable body for it at that.
Within fallen kingdoms, one can find Flames, the Flames of a kingdom’s fall. These Flames contain the memories of the kingdom, and can serve as ample fuel for your ritual. By collecting a number of these flames and creating a suitable vessel for them, you’ve skipped a few steps and have essentially created a living phylactery. If you die, your essence will be transferred to the vessel, and you live once again. It might take a little time for your new body to grow back to its full size, but surely that’s worth the cost of cheating death? Not to mention, as long as kingdoms fall, there will always be Flames to take.
(Capstone Boosted - Voidheart)
The void’s insight has allowed you further experimentation with Flames, and further refined the ritual of reincarnation. You have found a way to consume the Flames yourself. While this renders them useless for the ritual, doing this can grant large amounts of information about the area as well as a notable, stacking boost in power in regards to Pyromancies.
Flames burn brighter, longer, and larger with each you consume. A small boost, but with many flames, your power over fire could grow immensely. Of more note is the ritual, which you have streamlined. No longer will you need to wait for the vessel to grow, as it will do so on its own before entering it. If left for long enough, you can simply walk in your new body as if it never changed. In addition, the vessels can be repurposed as servants with their own personalities and a proficiency with pyromancies. Filing them with flame can grant the same boons as if you had."
600,Civic Spiritualism,Civilization,"Perhaps through collective unconsciousness, resonant prayer, or simple miracle , you and your people are able to create or call spirits to aid your efforts. This requires a degree of ritual effort, such as long rituals, or inscribing special runes into a structure­ you know how to do these things thanks to the perk.
Such spirits are usually themed after what their source is­ the spirits of a school are interested in promoting learning, the spread of knowledge and so on. It can be safely assumed that spirits you or your people create will serve in the best interests of their domain, to their knowledge.
Spirits usually try to stay out of sight, and serve as efficient, invisible support staff. Their actions are often subtle, working in small ways that support a greater whole­; a closet might clean itself, or a garden will never have weeds, and so on. These minor feats lead to grander results however, as a group or action that involves a healthy, happy spirit is gifted with good fortune.
If you go somewhere that happens to already have custodial spirits like the ones described, you instead can request their assistance and empower them by strengthening their domains. You may need to research what a native spirit might want or appreciate, though."
600,Craft of Void,Hollow Knight,"Void is a fickle, dangerous substance. Its mere presence can taint the air, but the potential within it is very much worth the risk, as the Pale King knew, and now you as well. You have learned the art of harnessing and creating life from Void, forming servants in molds and shells, able to reform on a whim upon defeat, and serving you to the bitter end. These constructs are often bound and clad in heavy steel armor and are more than intelligent enough to follow any order you give them, and if not, then they can learn.
(Capstone Boosted - Voidheart)
The Void has whispered in your ear, supplanting improvements to your Moulds. Using SOUL as a conduit, you can grant your Moulds a weaker version of one of your perks, at around 50% of it’s normal strength. You can choose the perk at creation, but it cannot be changed afterwards."
600,Fuinjutsu Prodigy,/tg/ Naruto,"You are one of the very few who are talented in the art of Fuinjutsu, an esoteric discipline combining all the complexities of calligraphy and physics. Despite the difficulty in learning fuinjutsu, skilled practitioners find it well worth it. Fuinjutsu, or sealing, is at it's most basic storing something within something else through symbols to be released at another time. More advanced techniques still follow this same principle, but to great effect. Seal masters can seal away the elements, chakra, form summoning contracts, teleport, or even summon and bind souls using these principles. It's only downside is that this art is massively difficult to learn even for the talented, and will take years of intense study to master. You start off knowing how to make the two most basic of seals: The storage seal which allows you to store items in slips of paper much smaller than they are, and the explosive seal which is basically a few glyphs on a piece of paper the size of a greeting card that explodes like a small amount of plastique."
600,Gem Creation,Steven Universe,"You can create life from the lifeless.  This works especially well with gems, though maybe you can figure out other substances that it will work to imbed the energy and life code into.  You will be imbuing the base object with your own energies and the mental coding and concepts needed to promote the growth of sapience and life over a number of sessions or a period of time depending on your available energy source and mental strength.  Once it hits a critical saturation point it will explode fully grown with its base object embedding somewhere on its form.  Since you are doing this by hand with your own power and will, you are able to create a far more customized and unique existence than you would otherwise be able to do using the more industrial and automated gem technology like the kindergarten machines.  While these allow for the creation of large groups at once in an automated way from templates, they rely on those templates to form their creations and drain the planet and surrounding land for their energy.  As you are providing the instructions and power yourself this will be a draining and mentally taxing experience that will prevent you from mass creation initially, though what you can do with practice and time is up to you to find out.
Life form Enhancement (Capstone Boosted - Diamond)
You can imbue part of yourself into another, providing a fraction of your skill and perks onto them while enhancing their physicality and longevity.  This alters the beings physical makeup to be partly gemlike which not only extends their biological life but restores them to peaks physically.  Doing this allows you to provide them with one or two of your own perks or powers to form the basis of their new existence, these abilities will start out weak and grow with them through practice and utilization."
600,Grand Summoning,Fate/Grand Order,"The Throne of Heroes can be quite capricious with those it chooses to release into the hands of a Master. You might aim for a Servant and get them in their elderly years or as a youth, before their great achievements. You might get them sans their most legendary equipment or in a flawed, berserk state. You’ve perfected your rituals however and learnt a method to always summon the greatest possible version of your target, combining their most suitable bodies, minds, equipment and powers for you. You’ll summon your Servant or other summon with their most powerful gear, their fittest and most appropriate physical body, their best abilities and their most suitable mental state. Your summons are effectively working at their peak ability at all times."
600,Grey Knight,Hollow Knight,"You are wholly and utterly unpredictable. Your moves erratic, your attacks so completely off-kilter that it somehow loops back around into something actually effective. You cannot be predicted in any manner, whether by machine or instinct.
In addition, your size and weight has increased to the point where simply impacting the ground can release radial shockwaves that can damage foes. Show them that clumsiness and unpredictability can be just as strong as proper training and clout.
(Capstone Boosted - Voidheart)
The Void that has seeped into your being grants you the gift of companionship, if temporary. You can now conjure or even spit out a series of Void-based constructs in your image, limited in power, but numerous and versatile. Simple creatures which fly, bite and hop at enemies, flying bombs which promptly explode soon after creation or if attacked, flying specters which drain SOUL or other magical resources from enemies, or even calling down a great visage of your face to crush them underneath your graven image."
600,Herald of Unn,Hollow Knight,"Unn thought, and the Greenpath bloomed into existence. Once barren caverns turned into lush greenery teeming with life. But Unn’s power fades. The call of the Mosskin for their creator falls on deaf ears, and they wilt. No longer. You have been granted a measure of the great Unn’s power, the ability to simply will plantlife into existence with naught but thought and a bit of SOUL. You may choose whatever kind of plants you desire to grow, be they simple moss or ivy, to massive trees and great fields of fruit and vegetable alike. You can even choose their colouration, or deem them to shift colours according to season or time of day. Let life grow in your presence, and may the world bloom with everlasting life.
(Capstone Boosted - Voidheart)
The Void is ever malleable, and when combined with the power of life, one can truly embody the great spirit of the Greenpath. With larger exertion of SOUL, you can now form and create Mosskin within your mind and realize them into the real world. Mosskin are very similar to other kinds of bugs, distinguished by their mossy coating and loyalty to their creator. You can shape them as you please, and although their mossy exterior is required, it can be shaped however you wish. They can be anywhere between half the size of a person to thrice one’s height and width, the larger the size, the more SOUL is required. They can also possess the same kind of physical abilities bugs can, such as walking on sheer surfaces and ceilings, or true flight, among other things."
600,Ivory Summoning Horn,Bartimaeus Sequence,"So, you did it. You bound some of the biggest and baddest out there to your will. Now how’re you going to call them when you need them and your friends aren’t around? For your needs, this Ivory Summoning horn. Blow on it, and it makes...no noise at all. Here, that is. In the Other Place... it gets a hold of the essence of everyone you have a sort of ‘tether’ to, and yanks them straight to where you are without the need of long summoning
chants. Be careful, this one still has some of the skin and blood of the last, careless user
sticking to it.
Oh, and don’t try to use it without a pentacle. That was what the Atlanteans did. And the Chinese dudes at Shangri­La. And the guys in Lemuria. And the last owners. (Outside of the jump this will allow you to use any summoning magic you can use by simply blowing on the horn without need of an incantation, gestures or long rituals)"
600,Peacock Miraculous,Miraculous Ladybug,"The power of Emotion. Allows the user to create Sentimonsters from the emotions of others, including your own. Takes the form of a brooch. Kwami is Duusu. Miraculous Tool is a hand fan. A truly detailed Sentimonster could act independently and even replicate the powers of a Miraculous. You can only make one at a time though. A Sentimonster obeys the commands of the one holding its Amok, the item that houses the feather that created it. If a Sentimonster is given its own Amok, it becomes able to operate of its own free will. The user can dismiss an active Sentimonster at will.
(Capstone Boosted - Miraculous Mastery)
Upgrades the user’s abilities in a fashion similar to that of Scarlet Moth’s, allowing the user to create multiple Sentimonsters at once."
600,Summoning,Samurai Jack,"Once per day you can summon a single creature or individual – whom you’ve personally killed – that will remain active and bound to your will until they’re defeated. You can only have one summon active at a time, but you may keep an unlimited collection of creatures and individuals to summon. If you decide to banish your current summon you may resummon it or switch it out with a different summon so long as none of your summons have been defeated in the past 24 hours. (Ex. If you summon one warrior then switch it out but have that new warrior defeated you must wait another 24 hours before you can reuse this power.) With time and continued use you can slowly lower the time it takes to reuse this power. With enough effort you can make it so that you only have to wait a few moments before you’re able to summon something again and with continued practice you’ll be able to increase the limit of active summons up to the point where you can create an entire army."
600,To Call Forth,Sword & Sorcery,"There are foul monsters and beasts in this world that leave mortal men plagued with terror for generations at their merest whisper. It is only fitting such fear should be yours to command. You know rituals and workings to either summon or create the most horrid and fiendish of creatures. From writhing tendril-covered beings that scream madness into the minds of men to engines of muscle and sinew that scythe through steel with their jaws, to stranger still. With care and practice the monsters you might command could be fearsome indeed. Beware that you do not call up that which you cannot put down. Such mistakes are only made once."
300,Elementalism,The Games We Play,"Long ago, the Archangel Keter worked with the Archangel Malkuth on experiments regarding the soul, as well as independent manifestations of them. Malkuth’s experiments resulted in the creation of the Grimm, whereas Keter’s resulted in this, the creations of Elementals.
By offering a contract to the largely impersonal elemental forces that drive creation, you can give them a piece of your soul in exchange for their power. This gives them a human perspective, capable of perceiving the world like you do. And it gives you a faithful companion that can manipulate the element they’re born from, reaching tremendous heights with time, training and effort.
For 200 CP you’ll get the knowledge and skill necessary to cultivate an Elemental Affinity and summon a Basic Elemental of your own. With time and effort you can improve your skill and power, increasing the strength of your Elementals and the distance they can operate from you. They can also be improved beyond Basic, becoming stronger and capable of fusing with Elementals of similar strength to create new kinds.
For an extra 100 CP, for a total of 300, you can have already summoned a Basic Elemental of your chosen Element, also conferring a decent matching Elemental Affinity. This can be purchased multiple times to summon multiple Elementals, each one after this one costing 50 CP.
Refer to the notes for information on the Elementals and their types.
(Notes)
The Elementals that have been observed thus far are Water, Air, Fire, Earth, Lightning and Metal. Once you’re skilled enough, your Elemental Affinity is high enough and your Elementals are strong enough, you may fuse two Elementals of similar strength into a new Element. You don’t have access to the unfused elements while this is happening but you can unfuse them at any time. You may also fuse together 3 or more Elements in varying ways.
Observed fusion elements include Sand (Air/Earth) and Glass (Air/Earth+Fire).
WoG from Ryuugi regarding Elementals : It varies greatly from person to person. Some have minds to the point that they are completely distinct from the person wielding them. Some are seemingly mindless. Some obey orders while others simply do whatever their wielder truly wants, regardless of what they try to tell them to do. Some manifest to their maker's will while other have the ability to manifest themselves as desired. Some take the shapes of things their maker loves or fears or feels strong attachment to--lost lovers, children, and pets, but also, say, a swarm of spiders--while others seem completely unconnected or have no shape at all, simply expressing themselves through their element. Some even act as separate bodies, requiring their maker to 'shift' themselves over to it and control it thereby, leaving their body defenseless during that time. Some Elementals just express themselves through their maker's Auras, whether as just a burning Aura, a Stand, or a coloration of their Semblance.
If you have paid for your Elemental, you may choose how they manifest."
