100,A Place For Everyone,SB Stellaris,"Your citizens and subordinates are happier, and slightly more productive because of that.
Fanatics not only get more happiness, but happiness has even greater effects on citizen productivity."
100,Business as Usual,Warhammer 40k - T’au,"War machines of any appreciable size or complexity cannot exist without economic and civilian infrastructure. You can easily manage such infrastructure to support a war machine, keeping workers on track and productive even as beings that the superstitious would call demons are clawing at the gates of your city. War-time fatigue and loss of morale will not touch those you manage."
100,Cold Crown of Iron,Exalted - Modern Age,"Winter’s Mask Cast Aside claims that the Abyssals causing havoc in Creation are rebels in self-imposed exile from an otherwise peaceful Underworld. That civilized peoples in both worlds will benefit from an alliance against the rogues of their ranks. Whether or not this is actually true is an open question; certainly nothing has ever been heard from those Yozis slain in the primal conflict of times past, nor is there any indication the Abyssals have some sort of unified mission with which to lead their undead armies. Regardless, you have all the skills of a monarch and administrator capable of handling the vast lands of the unquiet dead. Your laws are written harshly but justly, your stentorian tones brook no argument and you dispassionately make good resource allocations even for a community that doesn’t need to eat or breathe. Whatever the truth of those statements, you could well have ruled over a truly benevolent kingdom of the dead before setting your sights for brighter shores."
100,Emperor in Training,Fate/Legends - Empires Of Antiquity,"There is more to the task of ruling than just smacking all the barbarians with a big stick. Rome is a bastion of culture and civilisation, just as much as it is a military empire. Though you are no legendary ruler, you are a capable one with your breadth of skills. You’re a decent military tactician and a competent legion fighter, but you have fairly advanced skills when it comes to administrative tasks, legal ruling, diplomacy, financial matters and actually managing your citizens. You’re also quite good at giving yourself a good public reputation, knowing how to sell yourself to the patricians and the masses, as well as how to appeal to individual political factions in your territory and without. Few men can rule Rome alone but with the right words in the right ears, Rome might just rule itself for you."
100,Executive Vigor,SB Stellaris,"When the party makes a proclamation, not only does that have the normal mundane effects that words have, it has effects beyond that. Proclaim that crime is going to fall and watch criminals decide to stop being criminals. Make a declaration about how “we need more energy” and watch energy production bump up by ten percent suddenly.
There can only be one proclamation active at a time, and it can only be changed once a year. For fanatics, these proclamations are three to four times as strong, and can be changed once every three months."
100,Free​ ​Rule,/tg/ Stellaris,"​Sometimes ruling can get in the way of your fun. As a free spirit that could ruin all of the joys of one’s rule. Luckily, it seems that whenever you wish to take a break and just leave to do something(as long as it isn’t too long) you’ll find everything working in perfect order when you get back to the reins of your empire. Too many of these breaks will ruin this effect.
God​ ​Emperor (/tg/ Stellaris)​ ​(600CP)
You are Emperor. Whether your people call you another title such as “president” “supreme leader”, it doesn’t
matter because the meaning stays the same. Because of this your overall ability to rule is a marvel within itself, you can manage entire planets by yourself with maximum efficiency, calculate complex logistics for your nation on a scale that would require entirely new different branches of Government for others. Furthermore everyone you meet feels a profound sense of awe at your presence feeling as if you are someone to be looked up to, at the very least they will give you the bare minimum respect. Finally, you find that those you inspire always seem to understand exactly what your goals were and are always true to them, never misinterpreting the intent of anything you say or do."
100,I Have An Agenda,SB Stellaris,"You have four agendas, each of which provides a minor bonus. These expire after five years, and one can be replaced every two months. Once replaced or expired, a new random agenda is created.
For example, an agenda to “expand the Empire” would grant construction speed and cost bonuses to the outposts used to claim territory, as well as to the speed of colonization. “Stockpile alloys” would increase alloy production while lowering input materials used for alloys. It would also reduce upkeep on the alloy foundries. “Grow the economy” would increase the build speed and decrease the build cost of economic buildings and infrastructure.
Fanatics receive twelve agendas, and can replace one of them every month."
200,A Talent For Logistics,Generic Military,"When it comes to managing supply convoys you are the secret to a campaign’s success. Your ability to plan routes, organize the workers, meet demands, and change your timetables due to enemy interference could revolutionize the way deliveries are made."
200,Close Enough to the Greater Good,Warhammer 40k - T’au,"The Vespids were brought into the Greater Good mostly because their own culture already resembled the ethos of the T’au. You can now look at and understand foreign ideologies and easily identify which parts will support or hinder your own purposes as well as determine to what degree members of the culture can work with your own, easily identifying potential converts, allies, rivals, and sworn enemies. Moreover, you
can share this knowledge with others so they understand that, for example, sending ambassadors to the Drukhari is not a good idea."
200,Grow Tall,SB Stellaris,"Trying to manage an Empire with a population in the trillions is hard... for other governments. Yours handles the problems related to massive populations with aplomb, not even letting red tape begin to develop.
Your empire loses no efficiency as the population increases, even to stupid levels."
200,Grow Wide,SB Stellaris,"Managing shipments from five thousand mining stations, coordinating supply runs for fifty fleet anchorages, finagling personnel rotations for four thousand research stations, and managing hyperlane allocation for over fifty thousand trade ships across one thousand systems?
According to the Ministry of Transportation official you asked, “easy.” Said official then had to leave to play their matches in the weekly office table tennis tournament. Your empire loses no efficiency as its borders expand, even to stupid levels."
200,Hero of the Masses,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,"Ha! Who says ruling is hard? You don’t even have to do anything and the people are singing your praises! You’re the sort of person that the common folk, the military and all those not in the noble classes will naturally fall in love with, even those of other nations to a lesser extent. Whether it’s earned or not, they see you as a celebrated hero who tirelessly works to both improve their lives and constantly ensure they are happy and entertained. You might even be an incompetent, indulgent lout and the people of your lands just won’t care, not unless you begin to personally punish them in a way they can’t deny is your doing. The armies, even those of noble birth, will share that affinity for you and while they might consider you a poor general, they’ll adore you as a figurehead and hold great respect for you. The actual nobility class won’t feel any different towards you, though the near universal love for your personage from the rest of the empire may make them act with respect anyway. Helpfully, you’re actually rather fantastic when it comes to organising good policies and law, with extensive experience and knowledge on civil matters, and to making and financing grand festivals that remind people why they love you so much."
200,Just in Time,Warhammer 40k - T’au,"The universe is a messy place that cannot be perfectly predicted, so contingencies for changing circumstances are important for administration in all fields. However, the cost with developing and maintaining those contingencies is not zero, and so maintaining an infinite series of contingencies is not rational behavior. You can easily manage large logistical chains to ensure that supplies and goods get where they need to be when they are needed. Moreover, issues such as shaky communication, unreliable transportation, or a less than solid border will be minor inconveniences at best. You also know what level of preparation is responsible planning and what level of preparation is self-defeating paranoia."
200,Policy Goldberg Machine,SB Stellaris,"Policy changes can have major ripple effects. You are now able to easily and accurately predict the ripple effects of any proposed change to law or policy that you read. These predictions can go as small as a single person or drone, but you can stop thinking about it before that level is achieved."
200,The King Is Here,Exalted - Infernals,"Malfeas is the King of the Yozi, and incomparable in his invincible power. Once he was the Infinite Radiant Is, the supernal transcendence of all divinity, the Holy Tyrant, the King of the Primordials. Though he may now be unjustly bound to rage impotently, as he dances and forgets himself, some of that ancient splendor is shown again. Likewise, you will be seen by all as a powerful king, incomparable in your own right... and in anger and hate you will gain an aura of terror, that the weak-willed shall flee before you and the powerful shall be shaken.
Yet when you feel joy and your heart is at peace, you will gain instead an aura of awe and brilliance that all who see you will feel as though your divine majesty is one who should be their king."
300,Mudra of the Ideal Politician,Exalted - Modern,"Of course while celebrity is one thing, turning it to productive ends is another. You’re not just a gracious face in a uniform now, you’re a public speaker on par with the famous Catherine Cainan: A colonel in the Meruvian army with decades of experience. Like her your oration is profound and magnetic enough for the Immaculate Church itself to consider you as a spokesman. You’re an able politician as well, naturally able to sense the moods of crowds and speak concisely yet compellingly such that without even trying you could gain quite the following to grant you high office. You seldom fumble your words to seem like a braggart, but manage to indirectly draw on your experiences and achievements to make yourself out in the best light possible whenever put in the limelight. There’s nothing magical about your gift with words. Save perhaps, the elemental passion in whatever aspect of nature calls to your soul stirring up those around you to listen. As a final bonus, not only is your Exalted beauty exceptional even among your peers but yours is a sharp wit and youthful charm that makes you magnetic beyond the remit of your looks. You could seduce a statistically high and improbable amount of rival operatives with your saucy ways, to your superiors’ exasperation."
400,Golden Age,Fate/Legends - Garden of Avalon,"There are many skills that a king must master to lead his nation into an era of prosperity. He must be an excelling military commander, be able to inspire loyalty in others, have mastery over finances, rule wisely on civil matters and the planning of cities and castles, be an expert in getting others to work as a team and more. Most of all, he must take the long view, thinking beyond not just the next few years but further even than his own reign to truly ensure a golden age. You have all these skills at a fantastic level, more than enough to make you remembered as one of the great kings of history and legend, should you get a handle on the throne. Your best focus is certainly on long term planning, especially on adjusting your kingdom to survive long after your death and adapt to the changing times, such as to adjust to the loss of the age of magic."
400,Hearts and Minds,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,"The Roman Empire is immense and it requires a leader of similarly immense capabilities to properly lead it. At least when it comes to the less military-focused side of ruling a nation like this, you’ll have no problems at all. You have the political skill to very successfully lead the roman empire at it’s height with incredible efficiency, deftly handle the many political factions and the charisma and persuasive skill to be almost worshiped by all, along with excellent perception of others character and motivations. Your natural presence is immense but your actual rhetoric is even more so, being so great that it can be likened to a mind control spell that directly alters the brains and minds of others, even though it is nothing but your overwhelming majesty and brilliant words."
400,The Rules of Kingship,Grant Morrison’s 18 Days,"The art of ruling is as old as the very idea of kings and rulers. To find the best men for a job so you can have wise ministers and brave warriors, to deal out justice and manage economies to bring prosperity, the needs of a people are many, and it takes an immensely clever and capable mind to deal with them all.
One such as yours. Things that would end other kingdoms would be momentary concerns for a kingdom with you at the helm. No matter how bad its state or what troubles befall it, any kingdom that you steward inviolably enjoys untold prosperity and glory, such is your skill and deftness at rulership.
Not only are you extraordinarily talented and skilled in all the ways of kings, from economics, statecraft, justice, diplomacy and all others, you also know the various types of king there can be. There is the ideal king who tries to solve all of his people’s troubles, and the uncaring tyrants who know only to take.
You know when to be which, and how to walk the right paths to find balance not just among the needs of your people, but also between your duties and your pleasures. You know the basic truth of them all, that the needs and demands of the common people know no end, and thus must only be indulged sparingly. You could indulge the worst of your vices without having them harm your kingdom, and deal with the most complex of matters without having to compromise your personal time and amusements."
600,Emperor,Mistborn - Era 1,"Strong leaders are rare, and they are seldom good people. It takes a truly unique blend of confidence, determination, and insight to become a leader history will remember. By birth or experience, you have been granted the wisdom and drive to lead nations and change the world. Where you lead, others will follow. You may adopt Straff’s style of leadership, and inspire through strength, or you may follow Elend’s example, and build loyalty through hope. The journey ahead is perilous, and the weight of the crown immense, but you are one of a rare few who could unite these lands."
600,Icon of The Righteous Many Attitude,Exalted - Modern Age,"So many wish to control the world, that few have given any thought on how to change it for the better. Your resolve is a bonfire that will ignite hope in the hearts of those you strive to defend. When you take a public stand against the problems inherent in the status quo, you ignite a fervent zeal in those who witness you against that which you recognise as causing pointless suffering. Even without any hard evidence you could rally crowds to take a stand against the evils of the world with your sheer rhetoric, but with hard evidence of the Sidereals’ machinations or the Infernals’ treachery your cause will spread across national and social divisions. Should there be no true villain to blame for all the wrongs of the world, you can still make humanity rise up in unity against the broader problems in society you denounce.
Those bolstered by your example find themselves highly resistant to mental influence that would subvert the truth or disrupt their unity, and when the masses march with you directly even soul-twisting mystical corruptions shall find them resistant to their effects. Such movements also take on an orderly character, heeding your guidance for restraint far more keenly than the average violent mob and taking the initiative to organise themselves for the cause. But this is not limited to public speeches: People you personally save don’t just go out of their way to pay you back later on, but powers and rites of the Solar Exalted such as Tiger Warrior Training are much less straining to use on them.
Forging a bond with such individuals and helping them grow as a person could even see them awaken to the use of Essence as a heroic mortal-and over time, begin cultivating the traits of an ideal candidate for Exaltation. And while always subtle, the more people stand with your cause the more society improves. Bureaucracies are just a bit more efficient that they could’ve otherwise been. Poverty decreases, crime quietly fades and opportunities to improve one’s life spring up overnight. By the guiding light of the Solar Exalted, even politicians can be pressured to publicly repent and resign from high office. Beyond your prowess as a warrior alone, in you the world finds a paragon of reform."
600,Industrial Complex,Civilization,"Interdependent systems are a fact of life, and you have a supernal control over them. As long as there is a flow of resources, knowledge/ideas, money or other such things between three or more connected parties, the costs involved are reduced by 10% per ‘stop’ in the logistical chain, to a maximum of 70%. The number of connections can be as many as you can manage or be reasonably involved in.
As an example, if you are making a sword, then it takes 30% less money, time, material and effort, because in this case there were three steps to making the sword. Mining the ore, transporting the ore, and making the sword. The miner received the 30% reduction, as well as the one transporting the material to your forge.
Taxes being taken out or government grants count as ‘one stop’ in this process."
600,King of Man,Seven Deadly Sins,"Much like the Once and Future King himself, you are destined to rule over all of mankind. At least, that is the feeling that human beings get when they look upon you. Even if they’ve already promised their allegiance to another, when a human being sees you, they recognise you as their true, rightful King and know that the only right thing to do would be to follow your orders as if you were their King in oath, instead of just feeling. This is not mind control or domination, just human beings realising that they want to follow you and your kingdom, so they can deny orders that would result in things they absolutely disagree with, at least until you know each other better or change the circumstances. This can be counteracted by other highly charismatic, strongly willed and powerful human leaders as well, competitors for the throne if you will. Unlike them, you possess one
additional ability, the ability to awaken Holy Knight Abilities in your followers. Not all will be strong enough in body and mind to take it but those who are will find themselves with greatly increased physical and magical power, along with possessing an innate magical ability of their own like all Holy Knights."
600,Mudra of Enlightened Preparation,Exalted - Burn Legend,"To capitalise on prior efforts is the core trait of the Tennin’s fighting style. But just as the Tennin of old extended beyond the remit of mere warriors to protect their nations with subtler influence, you too have internalised the principles of preparation to a degree that seems to have pleased the Shinma. When you set about taking advanced preparations to achieve any endgoal, the more effort you take to set it up the more subtle supernatural forces conspire to enhance the success of the endgoal. Subtle trends in fate or causality deflect disruption of your plans, esoteric mystic sigils speed your efforts while you aren’t looking and the very flow of ki seems to be on your side. Perhaps with a sufficiently ambitious and prolonged endgoal, you might even see your Shinma manifesting as directly as possible even with minimal exertion from your ki to assist your various efforts. This can greatly enhance your Devil Judgement Style techniques to the degree of bursting the ki of small armies with relatively similar effort, but truly shines in areas such as statecraft or espionage that require the coordination of many moving parts. May your vigilance watch over the spirit world even without your presence."
600,Prosperity of the Sun,Exalted - Solars,"War and blood does not build a nation, shining wonders do not create happiness in one’s people, and Exaltation does not make one inherently fit as a ruler. You are unique in that you have internalized these truths and fully understand what is needed to create true prosperity in both yourself and your subjects. You understand economics and politics with complete mastery of both, but you also know how to build a lasting nation or organization that can sustain itself without you having to constantly reinforce it with Charms or other abilities. In addition, changes you make in the world...whether building monuments, kingdoms, or slaying a great menace will have a permanent and lasting effect - your dynasty will last for thousands of years beyond your own era, your legend is told for many years to come, and your cities will be full of life even if the world around it should be torn apart. This effect can be mitigated or ‘turned off’ at your leisure if you prefer subtlety or impermanence.
(Capstone Boosted - Unconquered)
Sol Invictus does not need to walk among mortals to fill them with faith, nor does the Daystar need to personally greet every mortal on Creation to give it light. Just like bright light of high noon, you guide those under your gaze. Your subjects and people not only find good reason to be loyal to you by merit alone, but they will feel an encouragement to improve themselves and grow as individuals in a way that fits your ideals, as well as becoming more skilled in their own trades and roles. Should you so wish it, your own skills that you can teach or pass on to others will flow from you to your people without having to speak a word of knowledge to them, and they will steadily become competent in these and use them in ways you would approve of. As the months and years roll by, those who live under your administration will gradually improve their quality of life, as well as corruption and other decaying influences quietly disappearing entirely from society. A kingdom that you rule for a decade will hold some of the best and brightest the whole world has to offer, and while they may still be mortal, your subjects will walk with you in the light."
600,ROMA,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,"It is no ordinary man that can found Rome. It is a man of power, of great fate, of pure purpose, that can accomplish such a deed. A noble beast in human flesh, with a connection to the very land on which his eternal kingdom will reign. When your future people look on you, they’ll see a founder they can worship. You have the physical power to compete with anyone short of Heracles, tearing through mountains like paper and reshaping the landscape with your foot falls. Even whole countries tremble at your hardest blows. Your power is not limited to the purely physical either, as you have an enormously powerful innate ability to create plant life. From raising ordinary plants out of mud, causing gargantuan trees to violently burst from the ground and crush all your foes to even create enormous magical beings that can dwarf castles, you easily bring forth new life. Your magical reserves are great enough to create dozens of such large creatures without rest, though you lack any other magical training. However, your role as a founder is something important in itself. Nations that you found find themselves blessed with good fortune and all those who are born into your nation will look up to you as like a living deity, a beloved grandparent to be respected, emulated and even worshiped.
Even those who are merely distant descendants of those of your nation will feel a strong affinity for you. In return, you have a strange awareness of all of your ‘children’ across the world, telling you their location and their health, as well as the ability to significantly but temporarily increase the power of such children that stay near you."
600,The Greater Good Serves All,Warhammer 40k - T’au,"You and those under your administration or management are preternaturally skilled at ensuring that everyone beneath you finds the perfect place (in career terms as well as in personal terms) to serve the greater whole. Moreover, you are able to ensure that those serving the greater whole find themselves happy and fulfilled while doing so. In addition to resulting in a ridiculously high morale among your population, your economic and cultural output will skyrocket beyond what would ordinarily be possible. Congrats on solving an NP problem optimally and in optimal time."
700,Two Plus Two Equals Five,SB Stellaris,"Your economy is far more productive than expected. One particular type of resource has a +100% boost to yield, two resources have a +50% boost to yield, and four resources have a +25% to yield. These boosts may be applied to any class of resource, like “raw minerals,” “consumer goods,” “rare crystals” or things a bit more abstract like “physics research.” One boost can be swapped with another, or swapped out, once a month.
For an extra 300 CP, all base yields are doubled. This stacks multiplicatively with the boosts mentioned above in this Perk, so the resource with the +100% boost has four times the output it should, and your +50% boosts will have a 3x output."
800,A Friend In Need,SB Stellaris,"This galaxy is not a fun place. Countless catastrophes threaten the lives of billions. Sometimes, those threatened can get away. You are an expert at refugee management, able to take your entire empire’s population in refugees every year, and integrate them into your empire with no problems.
And you don’t just have to passively just let refugees into your territory. You can go out and rescue people from certain demise. And you get a boost to your capabilities used towards the goal of rescuing the helpless, in accordance with how dire the situation is. A planet that’s being starved out, but still has stockpiles? You aren’t getting much. Killer robots made from living metal are descending onto a planet right now? You might get there before you could get a message there. This boost isn’t a guarantee that you’ll succeed, especially with poor planning.
(Notes)
These apply in some form to any empire, nation, civilization, or organization under your control, even if you don’t Import your Empire into that future Jump. The perks will be adapted as needed to actually be relevant towards any organization they are applied to. The party does directly benefit from effects that affect the people in these organizations."
