Cost,Perk Name,Source,Description
0,Leadership,Generic Military,"The ability to keep a cohesive unit or army together, motivated to fight, and willing to follow your orders, and the single most difficult ability for anyone to pin down. Now you have it. You are aware of your unit’s overall health and stamina in order to better look out for them, able to delegate tasks or missions you know they can do, willing to put up with endless amounts of bellyaching without missing real concerns, have a decent grasp of tactics, and when a job needs doing you know how to convince them to do it because thoughtless glory seekers give orders while considerate minds lead. If you’re not an Officer, expect to quickly become the glue that keeps everyone together."
100,A Royal Will,Legend of Zelda - Minish Cap,"As one born to the life of holding all of the people above yourself you have a strong will and can see, objectively, how decisions would affect not only yourself but others under your command."
100,Accepting the Divine,Civilization,"Sometimes you just don’t have time to explain. This perk grants you a catch-all excuse of ‘Mysteries of the gods’ or ‘I’ll explain later’. You can use this effect to ensure someone accomplishes a task you request or uses a tool you’ve provided, and they won’t delay by asking how it works. You will be required to explain properly later, but hopefully by that time, you and your allies have solved the problem."
100,Adviser,Warhammer 40k - T’au,"When giving someone else advice, even in their own areas of expertise or in fields where their own skill and knowledge outstrips your own, you somehow know just what to say to boost their performance or overcome any internal contextual blocks that hinder their performance."
100,Ask How High On The Way Up,SB Stellaris,"Your troops can do the impossible. If you actually did the simulations, you’d find that their shots were doing a bit more damage than the theoretical maximum yield of their weapons. They also shoot straighter than their guns should be capable of, run faster than their legs could carry them, take a few extra hits before dying, and even fire more rounds than they brought bullets.
These buffs are fairly small, but they apply to all armies under your command and all parts of those armies, including tanks, giant monsters, and giant robots."
100,Because I Said So,Generic Parenting,"Do you really need any other explanation? Whether it's an emergency or you just need something done FAST, you can invoke this reason on your child (or a subordinate) to get them to do it. If you need them to do a chore or an unusual task, this will compel them to accomplish the task quickly. This won't let you compel them to hurt themselves or do things they normally would be against, and will be refused in annoyance if you use it too many times. It's good for 'act first, ask questions later' situations, at least."
100,Competence,Diabolical,"Your minions, henchmen, drones, or any other beings – such as Companions - you entrust with a task or duty are not the bumbling buffoons of other villains. No, yours are trained, and intelligent. They are consummate professionals, taking pride in their work and their service to you. They may not be particularly smart or powerful, but they will never be tricked into following the common, disadvantageous tropes of the typical mook. They will not fall for obvious traps, they will not stop to chat with the hero before they eliminate them, they will not pause to ponder an illogical statement or be diverted with a thrown treat or shiny bauble. They can hit what they aim at with their chosen weapon, and will exercise due diligence and appropriate prudence. You can for all intents and purposes, consider them your own personal, professional army with all the discipline and capability that entails."
100,Queen’s Council,A Study In Emerald,"Between Ruler and Ruled, there is no need for words. A form of telepathy, the Queen’s Council is shared between yourself and those who accept you as their ruler or leader, and it is utterly private, as well as permitting communication with those you do not share a common language or even the appropriate mouthparts to converse with."
100,Right Tool for the Job,Warhammer 40k - T’au,"No one excels at everything, and no tool fixes all problems. You can now adequately assess a situation and objectively understand which skillsets or underlings you have will be most effective or least costly to achieve your goals."
100,Road to Glory,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,"No one’s going to be doing much conquering if they don’t know how to swing a blade or direct a squad. You’re not someone that’s going to get a The Great attached to you just yet but you can fight capably with the rank and file if need be, as well as lead small groups of fighters capably and clearly even during a big battle. You’ve got a talent for larger scale strategy but you’ve not had the chance to dig into what you can do there. It shouldn’t take too long to move up in the military ranks though, since you have a knack for looking pretty strong and fearless no matter what you do, which works well when combined with a talent for battle. If you want, you can take about a foot of extra height and some bulging muscles with this too."
100,State of the Union,SB Stellaris,"You know the state of regions and organizations under your nominal control, as if you had constantly already read all the reports that could be collected on them."
100,Tension The Chain of Command,SB Stellaris,"Large military units like entire fleets can be rather unwieldy. For you, not as much. Your OODA loop is smaller than it should be. Commands are relayed down, and critical information is passed up, with greater speed and accuracy.
(Notes)
If you are not in command of a fleet, these are provided to all Empire ships at reduced power."
100,Worth of Time,The Games We Play,"There have been stewards of this world who quite literally let it go to shit because they couldn’t be bothered to interrupt their research. It would be a shame if you were to do the same, wouldn’t it? Good thing you won’t have to.
You find that any and all of your duties that can be dealt with without you directly interacting with other people get done automatically, with every bit the efficiency and quality it would have if you focused on it alone.
This even includes things like scroll calls and other remote communications, with responses taken from the back of your mind. You can observe these in real time if you want, but you don’t need to."
200,A Talent For Strategy,Generic Military,When it comes to large unit maneuvers you are the king in the game of war. Your stratagems are so carefully thought out and laid that you could orchestrate the Normandy Invasion with minimal information from your armchair with a simple map in hand.
200,A Talent For Tactics,Generic Military,When it comes to small unit maneuvers you are a master in the field capable of leading your men in engagements with the enemy. Your tactics could quickly make veterans out of your squad with how effective they are in reducing casualties.
200,Bringer of Fear,Legend of Zelda - Hyrule Warriors,"Individuality is overrated, it’s a commonly held belief among evil overlords and witches. What’s the use of dissenting opinions when you’re always right? Right? You are now able to quash individuality and dissent in those beneath you, through the delicious power of intimidation. Those you can intimidate into following you, or those already following you that are afraid of you, will become surprisingly loyal, due to the consequences.
Even beyond normal intimidation, this perk helps with maintaining the allegiance of all your mooks and minions even if they would ordinarily be the type to drop everything and run if it looks like you would lose."
200,Charge!,Generic MIlitary,"Heroes and their stories aren’t made by just showing up to events but through their determination and grit to overcome an obstacle. When a situation demands you to push beyond a hundred percent you and your unit can mount a charge that breaks through the toughest enemy defenses such as when backed into a corner, when you are of one courageous mind at the height of morale, or pissed off enough to storm the castle."
200,"Defying Physics On Your Orders In Twenty Seconds, General",SB Stellaris,"As long as you don’t betray them, soldiers under your command have unbreakable trust and morale.
(Notes)
If you are not in command of an army, a planet’s defense, or an expeditionary force, these are provided to all Empire armies at reduced power."
200,Down-To-Earth,Generic Space Opera,You are one of the rare persons that actually have an idea what moves the people under your purview. Whenever you are at the helm of a country or organisation big enough for you to normally lose track of those alluded to problems you will receive impulses nudging you towards the correct decision when deliberating policy.
200,Fighting like Dogs,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,"Only those lucky enough to be blessed by the gods get to fight fair wars. For the rest of us, you need to be willing to get down in the dirt to win. You’ve got all sorts of skill and knowledge to trick, hinder and sabotage others though, making such a thing a much easier task. From personal scale stuff that lets you easily pull off false moves in a fight or slip poison into someone’s trick to large scale sabotage to entire armies, you’ve got experience pulling these plots off. Dirty tricks of course include the ability to easily put others off their game with your words, playing on their fears, anxieties and traumas to make them uncertain or even flee outright. You’re good at that too, the fleeing, and even opponents that normally consider themselves much faster and more agile than you might lose you in the dense crowd of a battlefield."
200,First Among Comrades,Gurren Lagann,"You're no Sun Tzu, but you're adept at improvising and adapting to your opponents' battle plans. Where others charge in blindly you can read the ebb and flow of battle, coming up with unorthodox but highly effective ways to engage and defeat the enemy. Moreover, you find it easy to explain your plans thoroughly to the greenest fighting forces."
200,Instinctual Administration,XCOM 2,"You have a knack for accounting and project management. By simply looking at a map or a spreadsheet depicting the assets and projects of your organisation you get a rough idea of their status. Projects over budget, departments underperforming, assets gone missing can be very quickly identified. If a simple solution exists you know it and can quickly implement it, if the missing asset is only missing due to a clerical error you can quickly correct it, if someone's embezzling, with a bit of sleuthing you can pin them down."
200,"Loyalty, Above All",Diabolical,"Your underlings and Companions will be unwaveringly loyal to you, per supernatural means. They will not break under torture, cannot be hacked or brainwashed or reprogrammed, and will never betray you under any circumstances – including negligence, trickery, or subversion. Even the hired help or temporary allies will fall under this aegis, though after their contract or alliance runs out the effect will be decreased and eventually fade away completely. You will also never have to worry about any Starscream-type scenario, and your second-in-command, sidekick(s), and lieutenants will never attempt to overthrow, replace, or otherwise hinder you in any way."
200,Mobility,Warhammer 40k - T’au,"In a world where offensive weapons outstrip defensive abilities, the only credible defense is to not be hit. In all situations, your ability to move and place yourself effectively and stealthily borders on the supernatural. Whether you are side-stepping a thrown rock or pushing battalions of troops out of range of artillery bombardments, it’s almost impossible to stop you, ensnare your movements, or keep a bead on you."
200,Practice Makes Perfect,SB Stellaris,"The more you practice a particular tactic in combat, the better the performance ships under your command are at doing that. If you routinely bombard starbases from outside your range, then your artillery weapons will have increased range and damage. If you commonly have your corvettes practice making intricate maneuvers at close range, the more agile they will become.
If you are not in command of a fleet, then this effect is based on the entire history of the fleet, with reduced effect.
(Notes)
If you are not in command of a fleet, these are provided to all Empire ships at reduced power.
Principle of Hierarchy (Exalted - Infernals) (400 CP)]
The Whispering Flame embodies the perfection of design and order as does no other. Even the limited freedom of choice that had originally been granted would ultimately result in tragedy and imprisonment. As such she pities the world for being less perfect than herself, and imposes her nature upon it as an act of mercy.
Likewise, you may do the same, murmuring the secret name of She Who Lives In Her Name or even your own name should you wish to empower it so. As this name reverberates in all listener's ears, it compels them to accept a place in an order or hierarchy of your making and become loyal drones to follow your directives. Even amongst those that already follow you, you will inspire fanatical loyalty to yourself and any order they are a part of.
Of course, the strong-willed could still resist you even with the power in your name. Yet even then, the power of She Who Dwells Within Her Own Name will not be denied. Every action or ability you bring to bear in order to enforce order and suppress free will shall be enhanced to perfect efficiency and methodical force, though powers of the mind similar to her own benefit from this the most.
Establish Hierarchy. Reinforce Order. Improve Efficiency."
200,The Training of Experts,Frank Herbert’s Dune,"As a scion of a Great House, there’s more than just etiquette and social functions to deal with. To that end, you have been provided with tutors drawn from some of the greatest minds of your time. Not only does this provide you with a well rounded education in all the social and physical sciences, but it provides you with a comprehensive knowledge of tactics, strategy, logistics, leadership, oratory, history... and above all the techniques of personal combat, both political and physical. While you’re certainly not going to be the equal of a Swordmaster of the Ginaz, your training in combat is enough to protect you from all but the best assassins or slave gladiators, and your knowledge of the subtleties of the political arena is enough to guarantee that you won’t fall into the most obvious of traps. Most importantly, however, you have been given training in how to handle the power inherent to your position and social class, in how to wield power as a tool and weapon and shield."
300,Anti Micro Managing,Jurassic World Evolution,"Sometimes common sense isn’t actually common. Sometimes you have seemingly suicidal morons working for you, like when they try to slowly drive a jeep into a sleeping Indominus Rex’s face. And sure, while you could yell at them to stop doing the stupid thing, or taking over yourself, you simply don’t have time for that. Literally, even with all sorts of time manipulation stuff, you still wouldn’t have enough time to counter all stupidity. But now, you don’t have to. Any employee, minion, follower, slave, pack mate, etc that looks up to you for leadership, authority and/or guidance will know what you would do in a situation, and pick whichever is the smarter option for the situation. If you benefit from anything that would affect your decision making process for the better, then they will also benefit from such. Well, as long as they call you boss/leader/teacher/whatever."
300,Groomed,Generic Xianxia,"Organizations are capable of much more than an individual, all other things being equal. You can now harness the potential of any group, company, or country that you lead. You know what your organization can do very well, and you have little problems molding your organization over time into what you wish it to be or persuading members to do things. You are the heir, after all, and you are expected to lead people to greatness - and you can and usually will."
400,And Don’t Make Me Prove It,SB Stellaris,"You’ve got a reputation, and it works for you. Every time you enter combat, the opposing side will get scared and make amateur mistakes. This even works on people trying to ambush you and computer-controlled weapons with no concept of fear. You can choose to suppress this if you want.
(Notes)
If you are not in command of a fleet, these are provided to all Empire ships at reduced
power."
400,Bulwark of Harmony,SB Stellaris,"Defensive wars are so much easier than offensive wars. When fighting an invader inside your territory, or territory that used to be yours, you can fight so much harder. You hit ten times as strong, and can take ten times the beating. Your nerves are unbreakable, and your aim is far better.
(Notes)
These apply in some form to any empire, nation, civilization, or organization under your control, even if you don’t Import your Empire into that future Jump. The perks will be adapted as needed to actually be relevant towards any organization they are applied to. The party does directly benefit from effects that affect the people in these organizations."
400,Defensive Position,Generic Military,"You’re able to situate yourself and your unit in a position from which you cannot be moved by the teams attempting to flush you out. They cannot flank you or make you move to a less defensible position but they can still shoot at you or send a teleporter to wreck your whole day. Either the artillery will get you, they’ll avoid you, or the ammo will have to run out before your group will go down because you were told to hold the line and dammit you’re gonna hold it!"
400,Exploits In Confusion,Generic Military,"Battles are a great big mess. There’s no two ways about it. You might get lost at night and arrive at the wrong position yards from where you were assigned or there might be too much dust in the air to identify whether the guys shooting at you are the enemy or friendlies. Not anymore. The fog of war no longer affects you in a negative fashion but works to your benefit. If you get lost you will always arrive in the best place to harass your foe, such as artillery in the direct line of a tank column or behind enemy lines in a squad to steal and destroy their stuff. This won’t guarantee that your unit won’t come under heavy fire but you will never be in a spot where you get totally wiped out after a day of shelling."
400,Fall Second,Warhammer 40k - T’au,"Logistics and strategic concerns aside, conflicts are won by whoever survives longer than their enemy. You can build an almost unbreakable fortress, but without some means of interdicting your foes or dealing damage to them, all you’ve accomplished is to build a fancy tomb. You (and those under you) excel at hitting targets that will actually hinder your foes, whether they are pill boxes and artillery emplacements on the ground or defense turrets and thrusters on void ships. As such, even if you (or those under you) fall in battle, you can be sure you (or they) won’t have fallen in vain."
400,Fight Like Ten Men,Generic Military,"In war sometimes it takes epic levels of determination to slow the advance of an enemy and in moments when you and your unit are all that stands between your foe and the ill-prepared army or nation behind you, you have the reserves to fight and make it appear as though there were many more soldiers at your side than what few you actually have. The harder you fight, the more forces they’ll think you possess causing your foe to be more cautious and slow their advance. Even by yourself you could fight the enemy as though there were ten of you to hold them off and if they should overrun your position they’ll be shocked to find that you were all that stood against them."
400,Knife to Corruption,SB Stellaris,"By setting a good example at the top, you can prevent corruption. Those beneath you cannot be any more corrupt or criminal than you are."
400,Leader of Men,Frank Herbert’s Dune,"“A world is supported by four things; the learning of the wise, the justice of the great, the prayers of the righteous, and the valor of the brave. But all these are as nothing without a ruler who knows the art of ruling. Make that the science of your tradition.” - Gaius Helen Mohiam. Loyalty. It’s a fickle thing in most worlds, but in the Universe of Dune it is perhaps the most valuable thing imaginable. Knowing who you can trust is vital in a world where traitors are a very significant issue that can undermine Houses, bring down entire Empires, and lay low even a Kwisatz Haderach. You, however, need never fear the traitor’s blade, not now or ever again, for it is within you to instill an unbreakable loyalty in your followers. This loyalty is unshakable by any external force, meaning that none of your followers will ever willingly betray you, and even if you somehow turn them against you, they’ll come to you with their grievances rather than allow them to fester and spread.
Should you drive your followers away, they will walk away, heads high, rather than seek to turn against you. And as an added bonus, you have a talent for seeing the potential in those you command and causing it to flower. Your followers will feel compelled to strive to be the best version of themselves that they can be. Under your capable leadership (assuming you are capable), it might even be true. In any situation where there isn’t a clear chain of command, people not already under your command will tend to defer to your authority, and (in general) most people will assume you have the right to do pretty much anything you want, unless they actively know differently or would object to you doing so enough to actually stand up to you."
400,Master of Assassins,Frank Herbert’s Dune,"The Navigators of the Spacing Guild can see plans within plans within plans, but it takes a true master of the great game to make them. You are one such master, endlessly factoring how to kill or compromise your enemies, protect your allies from misadventures both overt and covert, and designing training programs and tests for assassins and bodyguards alike. Your knowledge of the techniques of assassination is second to none, as is your ability to train up spies, assassins, saboteurs, provocateurs, and protective agents, and those you train seldom miss details or make mistakes... but that barely scratches the surface of your prodigous talents. To you, the plotting of ten-thousand campaigns across hundreds of worlds simultaneously is no more than a warm up exercise, and figuring out contingencies for the contingencies your foes have in place against your contingencies is an amusing past-time. The machinations of lesser minds are all but transparent to you and seldom do you fail to take even the smallest detail that you are aware of into account when making your plans. Further, you have a keen understanding of what details you might be missing and how it might be possible to acquire them. Your tactical brilliance is great enough to out-think a Mentat with decades of experience. If you’re also a Mentat... heaven help your enemies."
400,Natural Leadership,FancyFireDrake RWBY,"Every Team lives and falls by their leadership. It is good, then, that you have a natural knack for guiding and leading your fellow warriors. You quickly grasp the tactical situations you’re in, are equally swift in forming plans to work according to your advantages and counter possible threats. You’re equally aware of the capabilities of your team and are able to properly coordinate them to achieve feats that can give them the upper hand during an encounter."
400,Perception,Warhammer 40k - T’au,"Orkish Barbarians may cry for more “dakka,” and indeed there is a time and place for massive waves of power, but you know that it is better to accomplish your goals with the least amount of force. You can easily identify weaknesses in your foe, whether they are gaps in armor, important lynch pins in a formation of troops, or recognizing fragile morale that would allow you to prevent armed conflict entirely with a simple show of force. Good generals are capable of winning conflicts, but a great general always seems to win effortlessly."
400,Stand and Fight,Fate/Grand Order,"Lead from the front, that’s the motto of a true warrior king. If you couldn’t stand and fight alongside your men, you hardly deserve to lead them. They all agree quite wholeheartedly too. As long as they see you standing up in the front, battling away, they’ll know they can’t give up either. Your will becomes their will in battle, allowing you to support every ally that fights with you at once. As long as your willpower holds out, so will theirs. If you feel no fear, neither will they. If you are inspired to go to the very limits of what you can do, your army will rise up alongside you. So long as you hold out, your army will have to be killed to the last man before they admit defeat. But if you break, so does this protection and they’ll need to rely on their own wills, not that of their King."
400,Tau Memory,Frank Herbert’s Dune,"“There should be a science of discontent. People need hard times and oppression to develop psychic muscles.” -from Collected Sayings of Muad’Dib by the Princess Irulan. The Tau is the Fremen sense of community, their passive, subconscious, telempathic understanding of the needs of the group. Created and maintained by their ritual consumption of the transmuted Water of Life, the Tau focuses and unifies each Sietch like nothing else will. You are now a creature of the Tau, able to tap into this subconscious on a more visceral, more cerebral fashion. This gives you a fundamental sense of any organization or community that has accepted you as a member or leader, as well as an understanding of the capabilities and aptitudes of everyone in your organization. Furthermore, as a leader, you’ll find that all sub-leaders under you intuitively understand the aptitudes and level of talent of all those underneath them. This allows you and your lieutenants to accurately judge your own suitability for each task while factoring in the abilities of your subordinates. Even when you’re not a leader, merely possessing this ability also drastically increases the overall sense of belonging and strengthens the intra-communal group empathy. Two or more allied groups who are linked by one or more individuals who possess this perk will find that inter-group communication is also drastically improved, minimizing discord between the two groups."
400,The Art of Communication,Jurassic World Evolution,"...is the language of leadership. And now, any organization you are a part of will be a paragon of it. All members of any organization you are involved in will be knowledgeable of what the rules and protocols are, who they should go to in just about any situation, where the relevant items are, and so on. If there’s a problem, the people who need to know will be informed quickly and calmly. Functionally, this means the organization will be running smoothly, and any major mistakes will be prevented, while minor ones get quickly caught and resolved."
400,The Resistance,Generic Space Opera,"You may be an outlaw, not because you are a lowlife, but rather the opposite. When opposing an unjust rule you will find yourself capable of great feats of leadership and subterfuge, as well as quickly gathering a following of loyal allies."
400,You’d Have To Be Some Sort of Tactical Genius,SB Stellaris,"Some military theorists talk about a “combat width” when invading planets, where only so many troops can be brought to bear in effective combat. You know that’s bunk.
You can squeeze as many troops as you want into combat, as long as at least one of them would be able to fit. And they’ll all be effective. Invade down a tunnel only ten meters wide with a line of main battle tanks twelve abreast. Storm a bunker with an entire brigade instead of just a fireteam.
(Notes)
If you are not in command of an army, a planet’s defense, or an expeditionary force, these are provided to all Empire armies at reduced power."
600,Art of War,Civilization,"Yours is a culture that has mastered warfare, encapsulating its platonic concepts into an almost always applicable omnibus. In war or combat, you and the forces you lead are never surprised. Further, you may convey a complicated tactical or strategic directive in the span of a few words, usually as some effortlessly quotable phrase.
Men and women under your aegis are objective about their own strengths and weaknesses, with an intuitive understanding of how their comrades compare. The best man for the job will be able to confidently volunteer himself, and his unit will recognize his capability.
Those with lesser capability will have feelings of jealousy and inadequacy turned into a desire for self improvement, and those with greater capacity will have feelings of superiority and pride turned into a desire to instruct."
600,Attack of The Dead Men,Generic Military,"You and your unit will be able to survive a single onslaught once per battle that should have killed you, not once per skirmish. This will protect you from being repeatedly carpet bombed for as long as combat is exchanged until the attacking comes largely to a halt and you’re dug in for the night. You might not be in the best shape afterwards but your adrenalin and intimidation factor will be sky-high enabling you to mount a counter attack and frighten whole battalions into retreating even when you’re coughing your lungs out."
600,Do It For Them,Generic Parenting,"You don’t do all of this to make your ward miserable. You’re doing it because you want them to be ready, and you don’t want the world to hurt or lie to them as it may have done to you. This perk’s ability is twofold – you will understand when you are being too harsh or unforgiving to those you scold or act cruel towards, allowing you to backpedal from doing something you cannot take back. You also gain an incredible boost of willpower in the face of adversity or hardship – especially so if you are doing it for the sake of someone else."
600,Doctrinal Flexibility,Generic Military,"The sad truth of military life is that there is a huge amount of inertia for doing things the ‘good’ old-fashioned way. Even when there are probably ways to improve on how things have always been done. When changes are made, the results are often disastrous in the short term as everyone tries to forget the old and remember the new at the same time. This typically means that things will rapidly revert before any new idea can be fully developed. Your units won’t have that issue. Instead, restructuring forces, implementing new ideas or tactics, even training on new equipment will always go far smoother than it has any right to. The advantages of any new system (if it has any) will be readily apparent to you and those you present them to will understand how best to implement those changes."
600,Dwarf King,Gloryhammer,"The blood of the ancient dwarf kings of Aberdeen flows through your veins. Your leadership skills and charisma are beyond human, making you able to cultivate fanatically loyal followers who will follow you into the jaws of Hell itself. Not only that, but your genius grasp of tactics and strategy mean that you’re able to lead your followers to victory in even the most dire of circumstances.
Cosmic Rage (Capstone Boosted - Cosmic Infinity)
When you personally lead your followers into battle, a great bloodlust descends upon you, making you superhumanly stronger, faster and tougher. The longer the fight, the stronger you become and the thicker the haze of battle lust. Not only that, but followers directly under your personal command also gain the benefits of your cosmic rage, making your unit a veritable force of nature on the battlefield."
600,Genius Tactician,Code Geass,"You are now a verifiable genius with intellect on par with Lelouch vi Britannia and Schneizel el Britannia. Your tactical ability is legendary and you’re guaranteed to be one of the most gifted tactical geniuses in the entire world. When it comes to your plans and orders, whenever someone is following them it guarantees that they’ll do it with 100% efficiency and exactly how you meant it to be executed. When directly overseeing an operation or working within a group, your presence makes people work twice as effectively than before, even when it shouldn’t be possible, and it will do no harm to the ones affected by this ability. With this you can pull off many of the impossible plans pulled off by Zero throughout his many campaigns against Britannia."
600,Glorious Leadership,/tg/ Naruto,"You have a head for strategy, and will notice even the smallest of details. Your plans seem to be almost precognizant, and those that follow you respond to your orders correctly before you are even finished conveying them. Taking this makes you a schemer and tactician to make Machiavelli and Alexander the Great weep bitter tears of humiliation, and everyone will attribute the success of any operation you're part of to you no matter how vain they are. They may say they were crucial to your plans, or that your victory wouldn't have been possible without them, but they will still say victory would've been impossible without you, however grudgingly."
600,King of Conquerors,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,"When the annals of history list out the names of those known as the very greatest minds to ever consider the battlefield, those great conquerors that tamed the world and the race of man, your name will be there even if you didn’t conquer an empire of your own. You’ve got near perfect military skill in tactics and strategy, of such strength and scale as to allow one to conquer an empire across the known world and beyond, further then what nearly anyone else has achieved, in just a decade, at least if you start with a good army. You might have to spend time recruiting and training some men if not but your talents are no less great in that field than they are in commanding a war itself. Not only are your skills capable of turning the tide and pulling out a win against odds tens of times too great for your forces to even survive, those that follow you also become inspired with each win, deepening their loyalty to you, providing opportunities for you and them to meet and strengthen those friendships in person, and steadily growing in their main skills and powers the more you lead them to victory, even eventually reaching beyond the limits of ordinary mortals and into the realm of the magical. Before you and your mighty legions, this world is ripe for the taking."
600,Mobility is King,Generic Military,"Those you lead always seem to be able to move faster than they should be able to. To get into position faster, to retreat in good order, to flank or maneuver… it’s all the same. Distances you travel will seem to fly by and the amount of effort and planning you’ll have to put into any shift in position will be minimal thanks to all the practice and forethought you’ll have already done."
600,Mont’ka and Kauyon,Warhammer 40k - T’au,"The philosophies of the Killing Strike and the Patient Hunter. You embody both of these philosophies and can grant a lesser degree of your mastery to troops under your control.
For Mont’ka, you can handle moving your forces to critical locations of enemy forces and know exactly how much force is necessary to destroy or take such locations with ease, being capable of intrinsically getting an estimate of what ratio of casualty’s enemy troops and your own will suffer. Never will you attack a stronghold and have known defenses or predictable resistance turn a decapitating blow into a brutal slog unless you so wish it.
For Kauyon, you can easily bait and lure enemy forces to critical locations of your own choosing. Whether you wish to split up large brigades of enemy forces to defeat them in detail, or drag a bulky army into a killing field, you will almost always succeed. Battle will happen on your terms, or it will not happen at all.
Moreover, these philosophies carry over to other forms of conflict. For example, in verbal arguments or public debates Mont’ka means knowing when digging in or pushing forward will make your point heard and understood, while Kauyon will allow you to control the flow of a discussion to issues you wish to focus on and away from topics you’d rather not discuss."
600,The High Ground,Generic Military,"Sometimes called the Doctrine of Superiority, in military theory one learns quickly to seize on any advantage, no matter how slight. Often, the greatest advantage is in knowing how to utilize the terrain to maximum effect. You gain a kind of sixth sense that allows you to feel out the terrain of an engagement zone or potential engagement zone, either in person or through maps or pictures or reports, and to figure out how to use it to your advantage… or know how others are almost certainly going to use it. This is also excellent at countering those who already know how to use the terrain against you."
800,Imperial Servant,SB Stellaris,"The party receives three command codes every month, and can store them for later use. Each command code can be expended to massively boost your capability towards a task. This boost only applies when working towards that task, and expires after the task is complete.
The power of the boost is related to the narrowness and definiteness of the task. A command to “conquer the galaxy” would hardly produce a noticeable bonus, while an order to destroy a specific fleet would give an insane bonus towards whatever would help. For example, speed to catch up to it, and firepower to kill it. The boost is also increased if the command code is only used on a smaller group of people, instead of your entire Empire.
(Notes)
These apply in some form to any empire, nation, civilization, or organization under your control, even if you don’t Import your Empire into that future Jump. The perks will be adapted as needed to actually be relevant towards any organization they are applied to. The party does directly benefit from effects that affect the people in these organizations."
