800,[Real Eater],Medaka Box Abnormal,"The most powerful Minus and perhaps the most powerful Abnormality short of the array held by Najimi Ajimu herself…is not quite what you have taken hold of here. The Real Eater you have here is more like a…chibi version of the demon head ability eater that Hansode has.
The power of Real Eater allows you to transmute your head into a large demon head. When you bite down on other beings with that head, or yourself with some contortions of the body, you gain the ability to alter any powers they have. The difference between your power and Hansode’s is that you do not possess truly freeform ability alteration. Instead, you work with the component parts and traits of any power you have access to and any power your target has access to, letting you freely combine powers or individual traits from powers to create new abilities, create upgraded versions of existing powers or add flaws to powers that had none.
Combine a weak power with a very strong one to increase the raw power of the former ability, combine a power with many flaws with another that has no flaws to remove the drawbacks of an ability, even alter the look or source of power of an ability by combining it with an appropriate partner. You can combine traits from multiple sources at once, the only limitation being that you or your target currently possesses an ability with that trait in it. Do note however that what you use as your components will be used up to create the new mix. Changing two powers to create something new will give you the new power at the cost of what you used to make it."
1000,Skill Creation,Medaka Box Abnormal,"For someone who already has so many powers, one might come to think they’d not need any more. But never underestimate the allure of new toys to play with or how happy others are when you share them. Skill Creation is an Abnormality that gives you the power to create powers, within certain limits. The powers you are able to create are outlined by the powers you already have available to you. You are able to use any ability or trait that you have, whether it be a superpower or a magic spell or a personality trait or some physical trait, and use any of the component parts to create your new powers. This way, you can grant copies of your own powers to others, create hybrids of your existing powers for yourself to use or make weaker versions of your powers before granting them to others. You can make as many copies of any power you can create as you desire, it costs nothing and takes nothing more than a thought from you, though having multiples of the same power will not allow you to use more than the effects of one at a time. When it comes to handing powers out to others, you may do so instantly provided you can see all your desired targets presently. This Abnormality also allows you to retake what you have given out even if you cannot see the recipient at the time."
1200,The Triad Prana,Sidekicks,"The Triad Prana as it is called is made up of three separate prana that share a little of each other's functions but each has their own unique capabilities. Only a select few at the top of the world know the true origins of these powerful objects and who has them.
A user of the Prana can sense the superpowers that exist within a person and can gauge a person's strength because of it. Consequently, they can also tell if a person doesn't have superpowers. In addition, they can also detect another prana user if they are in the general vicinity which is around a few miles. In future jumps, you'll be able to tell if a person has something special sealed inside of them, has superpowers, or is powered by something unusual.
Although the prana’s power is absolute it isn’t without downsides. Without all three prana in one person the effects that come with the prana are temporary as they can disappear or weaken at any moment. Only with all three will a person be able to do permanent changes.
You receive a copy of the Prana that you buy that is equally as powerful as the original. The Prana copy you receive cannot be taken from you without your consent. This basically means the prana will be with you forever unless you decide to pass it onto someone else. Your version of the Prana can’t be sensed by holders of the original in-jump Prana’s, though it will work in conjunction with them just fine if you were to somehow get hold of the originals or you gave your Prana to someone else.
One final thing - Prana users tend to be all but immune to the ‘Skills’ of other Supublic’s unless those skills are themselves backed by a Prana. This doesn’t give any increased resistance to just being punched in the face or having someone shoot a Beam Burster at you though.
The First Prana
The First Prana’s main ability is the creation of superpowers. You only need to have a general idea of what you want like healing, pyromancy, or flight and the prana will create it. If you can’t think straight for whatever reason or are feeling lazy the prana will automatically give you the best superpower for whatever situation you happen to be in. If you’re about to be stabbed through the chest it’ll most likely give you teleportation or phasing just as an example. You will never be caught off guard with The First Prana as it will make sure you have the superpower to survive any situation within reason.
These temporary powers can be gifted to others or yourself as a temporary power-up. The powers can be gifted permanently although the catch is that you have to transfer your own superpowers or perks to another person for them to gain it forever. A workaround for the time limit issue is that you can implant your created powers into capes. You could even implant multiple powers into a cape if you have something that is strong enough to handle all that power.
This one is currently owned by the strongest superhero Darkslug. He is actually the original holder of the first prana and is the only person that has ever held all of The Triad Prana.
With all three prana, any and all superpowers you create will be permanent along with the ability to give permanent powers to others continuously as you can restore whatever superpower you happened to give to someone else. In addition to that you can also gift any amount of perks or skills you have to others without having to sacrifice your own.
The Second Prana
The second prana has the ability to amplify, recharge superpowers, control, or mimic the superpowers and super-skills that others possess. The Second Prana can control a superpower by negating it from working in the first place allowing the user to not get caught by surprise. The owner can ‘borrow’ the power of others which is a term for just copying the superpower and any skills that another person has. It is even possible to copy the skills of people stronger than you but it must be within reason. If they dwarf you severely in power then that person’s powers won’t be copied.
The Second Prana is currently owned by Theo, the son of the previous owner, Guardian, Theo's father, who transferred it to him before his demise.
With all three prana, you can permanently amplify all of your allies abilities making them soar to new heights. You’ll be able to recharge your own superpowers instantly using the completed Triad Prana. Any superpowers you copy will also permanently be a part of you instead of just a temporary ability.
The Third Prana
The Third Prana can decrease, steal, and transfer the superpowers of one person into another. Powers and skills taken by The Third Prana can then be transferred to another person or used by yourself if you’re inclined. However, these stolen powers have been noted to weaken or disappear if the gifted power is stressed to the absolute breaking point and beyond. This prana, unlike the second which favors control, is better for outright nullification and weakening of a person’s powers. It’s been noted to even nullify exotic items such as a candle that nullifies superpowers.
The Third Prana is useful for taking everything important to a person. I do mean everything by the way. You don’t have to stop at just their superpowers. You can go further beyond and take what makes a person unique. You can take their very bodies and make it your own by transferring your own mind into their body gaining their powers in the process as well. These powers will be permanently with you even if you leave the body. There may be a lingering consciousness that fights back sometimes upon seeing or hearing important events from their life after you usurped control but all that pales in comparison to the benefits.
This prana is owned by Metheos aka the former superhero Dunkelheit who took control over Theo’s father’s body, Guardian.
With all three prana, any powers and objects you weaken or outright nullify will stay that way unless you revoke the limitation. Any superpowers you transfer will also never weaken or go away but will be forever a part of the person you gave it to. You will never experience any person you take over speaking out or trying to fight for their body back. Once you’re in control it is staying that way. Similarly you are also immune to any method of possession, body snatching/control, etc unless you allow it.
The Triad Prana’s absolute power comes with one final bonus in addition to all of aforementioned benefits. Having all of the Triad Prana will make it so that your abilities, powers, skills, body, and anything else you want can never be sealed, removed, weakened, copied, suppressed, stolen, replicated, or mimicked in any way, shape, or form. Your powers, body, and everything else you have will be forever yours unless you allow them to be used by others."
