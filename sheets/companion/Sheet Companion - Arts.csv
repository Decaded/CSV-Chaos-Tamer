0,Aura,FancyFireDrake RWBY,"(See also: SB RWBY, Generic RWBY, /tg/ RWBY, The Games We Play, etc)
Every living thing, from humans to Faunus and even animals, have a Soul. Only the Creatures of Grimm are soulless and as such can’t make use of this power. For you though? You are now, thanks to the physics of this world, able to use your soul as a powerful tool called Aura. This has a variety of uses.
To begin with Aura at default works as a sort of energy shield against attacks and damage. You won’t suffer direct harm while its active, but you will still feel sensations like pain and heat while your Aura is up. It requires training to always subconsciously have a cloak of Aura on. It can even protect you from climate conditions, like walking through a snowstorm, though particular extreme conditions will damage Aura like combat damage would.
Aura can also be used to amplify your abilities, like your defence and strength making you essentially superhuman. In addition to that just possessing Aura gives you a minor automatic healing, able to fix small wounds like scratches in seconds.
All tools and equipment are capable of being used as conduits for Aura, allowing a user to be capable of sending out crescent shaped energy slashes from their blade for example. Furthermore it can be used to enhance these things, allowing you to, for example, even use a loaf of bread as an effective weapon. Dust usage is also enabled by Aura.
Those already possessing Auras may also unlock someone else’s Aura. Doing so however takes a toll on the user, potentially weakening their own Aura for a while.
Users with particular advanced experience in utilizing Aura may also be capable of other ‘higher-tier’ techniques. Examples would be to use Aura consciously as a shield, create shockwave-like attacks, gain extrasensory perception and even sensing and identifying other people’s Auras.
That being said, Aura alone does not make you invincible. Continued damage or attacks far outweighing your Auras capabilities will be able to eventually break it. Using your Aura repeatedly also puts it at risk of decaying, to the point where the user can be left weakened and without Aura until they are able to rest. Aura being completely depleted is visually represented as a coloured sheen glowing along the length of a person's body or with coloured particles flying off the body, indicating that they can now be physically injured. Aura flickering means it is close to being depleted.
Still it is a versatile tool that has helped humans and faunus alike over the years and now you as well."
0,Basic Ninja Training,/tg/ Naruto,"You know how to use kunai and shuriken, a basic taijutsu style, how to walk on any solid surface regardless of petty gravity, how to walk on water, create a non-physical illusion of yourself, and change places with a previously prepared log or another generic item to dodge attacks. You can also reinforce yourself with chakra, making you significantly faster, stronger and more difficult to hurt, and if you apply yourself, you will be able to keep up with Captain America. You also gain the ability to jump ludicrously far, on the order of dozens of meters. It's all topped off with some serious stealth skills too. As in keep yourself from being spotted while wearing a bright orange jumpsuit and defacing Mount Rushmore levels of stealth.
(Notes)
Yes, you can teach others how to awaken their chakra and how to use it."
0,Keyblade,Kingdom Hearts - Birth By Sleep,"Congratulations! You have been chosen by a mysterious, possibly-sentient weapon known as a Keyblade to be its wielder. As the name implies, in combat, Keyblades are used like swords. Even though most possess no actual cutting edge, Keyblades still make efficient combat weapons, and are shown to be particularly effective weapons against the forces of darkness. The main power of the Keyblade, however, is the ability to seal or open the barriers between worlds, as well as to ""lock"" a world's Keyhole, preventing any unsavoury elements from attacking that world's heart. As an offset of this ability, the Keyblade can also be used to lock or unlock any lock, allowing the user to access any sealed interior, whether it be a locked room, gate, or treasure chest. In addition to its base powers, it is possible to modify a Keyblades appearance and powers by attaching various keychains in the wielder's inventory.
You can customise your Keyblade in the Keyblade Customisation portion of the Kingdom Hearts Supplement. You may also access the Birth By Sleep section of that Customisation section for this and any future Keyblades you acquire."
0,Morphing​,Animorphs,"Your primary tool in the fight against the Yeerks. By touching any living creature with DNA (except plants, for some reason) and focusing on it for a few seconds, you can ‘acquire’ its DNA. Creatures will go docile while acquiring, which makes the process a bit safer when acquiring dangerous beasts. Once an animal has been acquired, it’s DNA is permanently recorded in your own, allowing you to transform into an exact replica of the creature. The process usually takes about two minutes, and because it is based on DNA, you do not gain any non-­genetic aspects of the morphed creature ­ injuries being the prime example. Morphing also gives you all the instincts of the morphed creature, allowing you to use it’s abilities without difficulty, though the instincts can be overwhelming at first.
Oh, and don’t worry about clothes, implants, or other such non­genetic additions. Anything that is closely ­connected enough to you counts as ‘part of you’ as far as morphing is concerned, and will still be there when you morph back. Shoes and non-­skin-tight clothing will be left behind, so wear some spandex under your clothes and you’ll be fine. This only applies to base forms; morphed forms reset to their base after demorphing, and cannot carry even skin-tight clothes or such.
There are two major limitations on morphing. The first is that you cannot go directly from one morph to another; you must return to your base form first. The second is a time limit ­ if you remain in morph for more than approximately two hours, you remain trapped in that morph. Forever."
0,Force Conduit,/tg/ Star Wars Supplement,"After completing any two Star Wars jumps you will gain the ability to grant living things in other universes a connection to the Force. You will have full control over who and what becomes Force sensitive and you can grant powers to either a few individuals or an entire universe if you so choose.
The Force Sensitives you create can start anywhere from beginner to padawan in terms of strength and skill, you'll have full control over how well they're initially able to use the Force and wield a lightsaber. With study and training these individuals will be able to improve themselves potentially becoming just as powerful as you are, or perhaps even more so.
You're free to decide whether or not the people you grant Force Powers to gain Midi-chlorians as well."
0,Lightsaber Crystals,/tg/ Star Wars Supplement,"After becoming a conduit of the Force you'll be able to create synthetic lightsaber crystals in other universes and allow them to grow in caves with strong magical or spiritual connections.
People you grant Force powers to will also be able to create lightsaber crystals."
0,Shinsoo Manipulation,Tower Of God,"Shinsoo is a supernatural energy. It is the basis of all life and energy in this world. In high concentrations it behaves as a liquid and has a palpable weight to it. It's said that one with complete mastery of Shinsoo would be a god-like being of incomprehensible power. Denizens of the tower use it to heal, strengthen themselves, and attack with. Rankers use it to maintain their eternal youth. There are even rumors that the Irregular Enryu is capable of creating life with Shinsoo. Please note that they took centuries and eons to reach these heights of power. You begin able to enhance your physical abilities with it. Fifty percent above a baseline human is
where you start.
(Notes)
Your shinsoo abilities will continue to function normally after this jump ends. You may choose to either
become a living fountain of the stuff or to have all the worlds you visit in the future to be seeded with
shinsoo. Others can be taught the abilities you have learned here, but it's going to take a very, very long
time. Assume that people would react to varying shinsoo levels as if they were using it to accomplish
their own abilities. Most places won't have concentrations of shinsoo dense enough to kill their
inhabitants."
0,Spiral Energy,Gurren Lagann,"A mysterious but incredibly powerful evolutionary force that can be harnessed and manipulated by living beings. Spiral Energy can allow an individual to achieve virtually anything imaginable, but in order to keep things from getting too crazy you'll have to slowly unlock your Spiral powers over time. Initially you'll only have enough power to pilot a Gunmen but with enough time and the right circumstances you can figure out how to generate large powerful drill weapons from your mech that are capable of easily destroying other Gunmen and can cause massive explosions. After a few years of continued use you could potentially learn how to increase your physical abilities, Intelligence, and natural lifespan to superhuman levels. Once you've fully unlocked your Spiral power you'll be able to live for over a thousand years, punch apart small Gunmen with your bare hands, discover and forge incredible technological wonders, and generate drills and other constructs from Spiral Energy without the assistance of a mech.
(Notes)
Regardless of whether or not you decide to go through one of the endgame scenarios, you'll gain the ability to grant one individual in each world you go to a fraction of your Spiral Energy. The person you gift this power to can only improve if your directly train them yourself and the upper limits of their Spiral Powers cannot exceed your own. However, if you decide to go through the Anti-Spiral scenario (Tell Me the Secrets of This World) you will lose the ability to grant others Spiral Energy.
We Will Survive by Any Means Necessary (Scenario Reward)
People around you can awaken their own Spiral Power but they will be bound by the same restrictions as you are. While people who possess Spiral Energy can become incredibly powerful, keep in mind that not everyone can reach their full potential and even if they can they're typically only capable of doing so under extreme circumstances. Animals and artificial organisms can also potentially develop their own Spiral power, but this is extremely rare and difficult and typically only happens if they possess a great amount of willpower and stay in the presence of a strong Spiral user for extended periods of time. Anyone with Spiral Energy could potentially trigger the Spiral Nemesis but they would have to generate universe levels of matter and energy in order to do so.
(Endgame Scenario Reward)
By defeating the Anti-Spirals and keeping reality intact you've proved that Spiral Energy can be used without causing the apocalypse. From now on you will be able to spread Spiral Energy to other universes, granting countless beings the power of evolution. In addition to being able to grant whole universes Spiral Power, you also received your own version of Cathedral Terra, a massively powerful moon sized starship capable of transforming into a similarly powerful Gunmen."
50,Psi Lab,XCOM 2,"A lab that you can use to train psionically gifted individuals how to use their powers. You cannot use
this to bypass the psychic perk, but people in universe that join you can use these facilities to
become more proficient. It takes about 3 months to fully train someone and you can train 2 at a
time.
Psionics (Notes)
In XCOM EU/EW it was a psionic potential malarkey governed by RNG that is supposed to simulate
random genetic drift, in XCOM 2 any rookie can be trained as a psychic. Go with the one that floats
your boat the hardest."
100,Aura,Samurai Deeper Kyo,"Your latent spiritual energies coil around you like a great flame and by unlocking their potential you can use them in various manners. You could learn to do this on your own, which is free to any who have come to this Jump, but if you pay the extra cost you have the swollen lifeforce and experience of a person who has had extensive training in the use of Aura, an equal to someone who has trained eight years in the art.
Greater spiritual energies means that more can flow forth in each attack, meaning greater spiritual attacks. Whilst the amount you have with the freebie could crush a small boulder, if you paid for it you could easily smash aside the boulder and the small house behind it. Though, unless you use an exceedingly blunt manner to create spiritual attacks most are less destructive to the environment and more focused on killing your foe.
Uses of this power are the creation of crushing auras, shattering lesser techniques through sheer pressure of spirit, extending melee attacks dozens of yards, increasing the damage of attacks and using special techniques. Also you gain the ability to project your intent to kill through this aura, manifesting a frightening aura, and with time you may even gain the ability to project other emotions through your aura.
(Notes)
This can be taught to others via training them, but it may take around a decade."
100,Basic Texts,Pale,"A small collection of books that act as a FAQ for the supernatural world, Others, and practice in general, which also contain an Awakening rite and a few basic spells. These books will update in future jumps to contain the equivalent information."
100,Pyromancy,Dark Souls 1,"Pyromancy is an art born in the wake of the great disaster that befell Izalith. One of the Witch’s Daughters of Chaos, Quelana of Izalith, is credited with its birth after fleeing from her chaos consumed home. Pyromancy, like many things, starts with a little fire.
The core of a Pyromancer’s art is the Pyromancy Flame, their focus and source of their power. A Pyromancy Flame is a small fire fostered and grown by a Pyromancer, becoming stronger when fed and able to be split or fractured to share with prospective students.
Compared to other systems in this world, Pyromancy is heavily offense focused, with many different spells focusing on the command of fire, and in some abominable cases, poison. Several utility focused spells that draw out one’s inner power or speak to the inner nature of undead.
Like Sorcery or Miracles, spells must be prepared ahead of time while resting, but can be swapped between any you know freely while resting. Pyromancy is often called primal art due to the practitioners being connected to nature, but this crudeness makes spells a bit slower to cast than other systems.
On purchase, you’re bestowed a ‘Pyromancer’s Flame’ of your own, granted an adept knowledge of the foundation and basics of the art, and know basic Pyromancies such as Fireball and Combustion."
200,Chakra Books,MCU - Part 2,"It can be difficult for those who are unaware of the world around them to grasp that they know nothing. It can also be difficult to show them just how small their worldview has been all this time, or help them. But the first step to learning is awareness. This is a substantial supply of books regarding the body, such as a map of the nervous system, MRIs, and more importantly, chakra points and how to open them. These maps for the body will help bring awareness to would-be students, and how to show them the wonders of the world or themselves. For an additional undiscounted 100CP, you may also gain a substantial collection of spellbooks that will assist in helping you learn the formation of spells, the art of drawing energies to power them, and the basics in casting them. Just be aware that the warning labels come AFTER the spells."
200,Mantra Training and Techniques,Asura’s Wrath,"You have learned or been taught numerous techniques to focus and express your Mantra, rendered as supernatural martial arts and superhuman feats of agility, durability and so on. Meditative Kata can extend your natural lifespan, heal minor wounds and fight off sickness, while strikes and attacks could shatter walls. This increases your maximum Mantra level by 1.
As an added benefit, this perk also allows you to create your own personal Mantra Form. Your first form will take approximately five years of study and meditation to fully construct, but when completed, you will be able to manifest an external mantra interface. To most people, it will look like an ornate halo, evocative of your personality and mantra affinity.
A Mantra Form usually has a core theme, such as improved combat ability, damage resistance, speed or other such boosts. Establishing a form enhances your abilities, even beyond what a given level of Mantra would normally allow. With a mantra form active, you may easily perform superhuman physical, mental and social feats, even before the direct application of Mantra. These stances and techniques however cannot enhance stranger powers such as psychic blasts or arcane magic, short of ensuring you can survive to perform them.
Successfully creating an initial form and manifesting it increases your capacity for Mantra by 1. Subsequent forms and other perks can increase this cap further, to a maximum of 8. You may use any mantra form you know, but you cannot stack them. Creating a new form takes ten years, times the number of forms you have already mastered.
Your halos can be attacked however, and if knocked aside or even destroyed. If that happens, you immediately drop down to Mantra Level 3, and any excess Mantra is wasted.
(Notes)
As long as people have souls, can pray, and can feel emotions, they can provide power for elaborate mantra systems and technology. This includes yourself. By teaching Mantra techniques or utilizing Mantra Technologies in other jumps, you will, at least in a localized area, add Mantra metaphysics to whatever setting you happen to be in. Mantra mechanics will integrate with local metaphysics as best as possible, and a degree of common sense is encouraged.
Master of the Arcane TES - Skyrim) (600 CP)
You are an undisputed master of one of the Schools of Magic - Destruction, Restoration, Conjuration, Enchanting, Alteration or Illusion, are an expert in both it’s underlying principles and practical use and excel at teaching it to others (even those who seem to lack the basic abilities required).
(Notes)
Armsman and Master of the Arcane can be bought multiple times for different weapons and different schools of magic respectively."
200,Mind Over Matter,SB Stellaris,"All members of your Empire are minorly psychic. That’s enough to let them telepathically communicate with each other, for example. Power overwhelming by default this Isn’t.
You could, with just the efforts of your scientists and this perk, make your most powerful psychics capable of “I destroyed the skyscraper with a single blast” levels of power. 98+% of your population will cap out telekinesis with their own strength even with training.
(Notes)
These apply in some form to any empire, nation, civilization, or organization under your control, even if you don’t Import your Empire into that future Jump. The perks will be adapted as needed to actually be relevant towards any organization they are applied to. The party does directly benefit from effects that affect the people in these organizations.
Namer (A Practical Guide To Evil) (600)
Roles. The sign of the gods within creation. Each granted a Name and three Aspects, a Name is a mantle of power, flowing from one potential bearer to the next, and guiding them toward their Fate. A Role is born from belief, from the ruts worn into creation when a story is told again and again, and a Name is a place in the story that is told, a sign that one has adopted their Role.
Of course, as in all things, how something normally occurs is not how it must always occur. With this you find that you have the talent to form these Roles, and bind to them a Name. You just need to focus and dedicate your attention to this for a prolonged period of time, and you find a new name taking shape, with Aspects and powers of its own, and even stories growing around it by themselves.
The effort is considerably lesser if you choose to simply resurrect old Names of this world by granting them to people who would otherwise have fallen short of earning them. This does require them to be at least somewhat fitting and worthy of the Name, even if your intervention lowers the bar considerably.
This also provides you a deeper understanding of how Names work than anyone else on Calrenia except perhaps the Intercessor. You get them, their inner complexities and how to take advantage of them, how to manipulate the actual spiritual and magical substance behind them, meaning that with enough time and effort how to manipulate, empower, depower or even destroy a Name.
(Capstone Boosted - Named)
Unlike others in this world, you have lived a long life before this world, and it shows. Being Named yourself, you can bleed the influence of other stories into this world, be they of this very world or others. Simply put, you can borrow the weight of stories you know of, and create new Names based on them, with powers thematic to and indicative of the characters you create these Names after, and their sheer potency depending on how popular and well-known those stories are in those other worlds.
You also gain the ability to carry your created names with you, as tools to release in any future worlds you visit. Your powers to manipulate names in this way also waxes considerably, allowing you to even affect names in active use, though it would require considerable effort to do so."
200,Rites of Initiation,Cultist Simulator,"What is a pastor without its sheep? A hunter without the hunt? An occultist without its tools? This purchase grants you basic knowledge surrounding the rituals needed for this jump, including the ritual to induct new followers. This includes a general understanding of their inner workings, allowing you to tailor them as you see fit.
You may use this power to induct an individual into the dark side of the world, allowing them to unlock an affinity based on one of the Principles of the Mansus. This affinity will closely match the nature of the new disciple. Those that already possessed an affinity before the rite receive no extra affinity from this perk.
For an additional 200 CP, you may take these rituals to other worlds, allowing you to create a new framework for magic based on the Principles and rituals found in this jump. This framework can interact with existing magical systems, allowing you to use the rituals you are familiar with to tap into the system, or you could have your powers work in an entirely separate manner."
200,Weirding Way,Frank Herbert’s Dune,"“That which submits rules. The willow submits to the wind and prospers until one day it is many willows, a wall against the wind. This is the Willow’s purpose.” - Gaius Helen Mohiam. The Bene Gesserit sisterhood are masters of the fusion of thought and deed, and nowhere is this more evident than in what they call ‘The Weirding Way of Battle’. The weirding way incorporates two essential parts of the BG lore and training into a single unified package. By combining Prana-Bindu, the cornerstone of BG physical training which all adepts, from Acolytes to Holy Sisters to Reverend Mothers, are trained in, and which grants a supreme control over every nerve and muscle in their own body, with Simulflow, the cornerstone of BG mental training, which grants the ability to maintain multiple parallel threads of consciousness at the same time, the Weirding Way is the Duneverse’s unrivaled martial art. You have not only received training in this secretive way, but find that you are a natural at it, able to maintain dozens if not hundreds of parallel thought processes without strain, and able to individually sense and control every nerve, muscle, and organ in your body with a conscious thought. This allows you to push yourself to the very limits of what your body is capable of, to instantly sense anything that might be wrong (and potentially correct it), to staunch bleeding, block pain, and even control your own neuro-chemistry and adrenal load at will. And, as a martial art, the Weirding Way is unrivalled by any purely physical martial art, being able to strike faster and harder and more precisely than anyone untrained in it.
Combining Simulflow with training in analytical methodology and Other Memory was what allowed the Bene Gesserit to compete on more than even footing with the Mentats, and provides a truly frightening degree of intelligence, even in the most average of Bene Gesserit Adepts. Through a combination of ‘Hand and Finger Signals’ and ‘Tactile Encoding Methods’, two people with Simulflow can conduct entire conversations completely undetected... even while carrying on a separate verbal conversation. The BG Adept will also be trained in ‘The Waiting Stance’, which allows one to remain effectively motionless for as long as one needs to, without a trace of boredom or physical discomfort. A BG Adept can also instantly fall asleep or wake up at need. A master of the Weirding Way is also an expert with knife or whip. A BG Adept’s internal biologic control makes them all but immune to mundane poisons and diseases, as well as granting them control over their own menstrual cycle, able to control conception at will, and even choose the sex of the child. You can also store diseases dormantly for later usage or study. A master of the Weirding Way can teach those willing to learn much of the techniques involved, and your version can be taught to members of any biological species."
300,Awaken,JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure,"With quick blows and bursts of Ripple into a person, you can unlock their Hamon potential with relative ease. They’ll need training in it’s use of course, as figuring it out on their own will take a long, long while. Whether you’ll be that teacher or not is entirely up to you and your own skill in it."
300,Synchronicity Event,F.E.A.R.,"Curiouser and curiouser. Due to coming into contact with... well, SOMETHING, your psionic abilities have noticeably increased. Psychic powers you may have had are stronger now, with control and development coming more quickly with practice. There is also a boon to this; by taking a few days to 'attune' a person, you may impart upon them the beginning of psionic abilities of their own. You may only gift one school at a time, and they start at the very beginning; if they are to grow and learn as you have, it would be wise to teach them. On the plus side, they’ll eventually become as strong as you are, so you’ll have quite the pupil on your hands."
400,A Strange Cave,Chronicle,"Oh my, what have you found here? A hole somewhere beyond the reach of curious eyes, it leads to a rather large cave several hundred feet in the earth, where you’ll find a crystal structure the size of a car. Strangely enough, it reacts to the touch of any life forms by changing its colour and emitting complex radio waves, resulting in a moderately large nosebleed and nausea for humans. But those occurrences are just side effects. The actual purpose of the crystal is to give other people the Power perk, with all that entails. After this jump the cave becomes a warehouse attachment, and you may make it appear anywhere you want in future jumps. The crystal will also work on any other lifeforms you might meet in your travels.
Powers (Chronicle)
What would you do if you had the power to do whatever you want, Jumper? No matter what your answer to that question is, you’ll be able to prove it to the world soon enough. Through strange means, you have gained the potential to do great things, though you might not notice it for the first few weeks. But after some time, you will come to realize the existence of what might be described as a new sort of muscle. One that allows you to use a power commonly called telekinesis in fiction. After you first begin to use it, even moving a baseball around for a few seconds will be too much overexertion, the strain making your nose bleed. But like any other muscle, this one can be trained as well. Throughout the course of a few weeks, if you trained regularly, your power would grow by leaps and bounds, allowing you to easily move around cars, fly, or create a protective forcefield around yourself. And just a mere month after that, you would be able to throw around buses like they weighed nothing, easily fly through skyscrapers without harm, and create telekinetic pulses and vibrations to push away dozens of cars or threaten the structural integrity of multiple high-rises. If you kept at it, who knows how much stronger you could become.
If you want to, you may instead gain these powers from a strange crystal, far down a hole in a Seattle forest, perhaps alongside a few others, some teenagers or your companions. That will cause you to develop what could be called a psychic connection: should one of you experience an extreme emotion such as anger or fear, your nose will start bleeding heavily as if you had overused your powers, and you will even start to vaguely hear voices and sounds around them.
Advancement Materials (/tg/ Cradle) (400 CP)Elixirs, Pills, Spirit Fruit, and so on. This is a treasure trove of materials that will take a Copper up to Truegold within a matter of months, though it's uses fall off after that point. The good news is that it restocks every month, and giving it to someone outside of this Jump will allow them to start developing a Core of their own."
400,Bequeathing,Kingdom Hearts - Birth By Sleep,"While it is possible for one to be chosen, seemingly at random, to become the wielder of a Keyblade, the more common method is through a very simple ritual. It has been dressed up over the year, with a poetic oath, and an air of gravitas, but at its heart the process requires only three things. One; a Keyblade wielder on the level of a Master, two; the recipient of the ritual, and three; for the recipient to touch the Keyblade as it is being held by the wielder. Once performed, the ritual bestows the recipient with the potential to one day have their own Keyblade – or to inherit the blade of the wielder, whichever comes first. Now not only can you perform this ritual regardless of your status and skill with a Keyblade, you can ensure that your beneficiaries gain their own Keyblades quickly with only a short period of training, typically done with wooden swords or crude wooden Keyblades."
400,Code of Immortality,Code Geass,"(Requires Geass)
Somehow you’ve managed to get your hands on a Code, not one from in this setting but a completely new one entirely. Since you’re spending CP on this you don’t lose your Geass by taking this perk. With this you, Jumper, become immortal. Like C.C. you recover from any and all bodily damage, it’s impossible for you to retain any sort of brain damage or memory loss as a result of head injuries or a lack of a cranium, and when you regenerate it’s fiat-backed that you are the same you who got injured. Unless your body is completely destroyed on a molecular level, you will always reconstitute yourself over a period of seconds to minutes depending on the severity of the injuries, and always all at once. You will also never age past your prime, nor have a need to eat, drink, or sleep for anything other than pleasure. As a Code Bearer, you have the power to bestow a Geass upon others. You don’t control what Geass someone gets but it’s almost always a different and new expression of it even if it’s really similar to another one, and all Geass you grant upon other have the same stipulations as the ones in-setting. With this Code, you also gain the ability to detect people who are connected to Geass and people who are important to them. You can detect the location of your contractors, even at a distance, and you’re also able to confirm who has a Geass power and who doesn’t, regardless of who granted it to them. When in close proximity to another person, you’re able to afflict them with a hallucinatory experience of chaotic and ominous images, pertaining in part to the memories of the target involved; the content varies with the afflicted. Physical contact, either direct or via a construct the target is controlling, may facilitate the process. Through the power of your Code you also have the ability to telepathically communicate to those nearby you, with it becoming significantly easier to do the larger the connection there is between you and the recipient. Coming with this code is the red bird-like symbol that is found on all Code Bearers in a location of your choosing which glows when utilizing the active powers of your Code. Post-Jump you can elect to not have this mark on your body to no detriment of your Code abilities."
400,Mentat,Frank Herbert’s Dune,"“A process cannot be understood by stopping it. Understanding must move with the flow of the process, must join it and flow with it.” - The First Law of Mentat. A Mentat is often described as a Human Computer, but that’s not quite true. Or rather, it’s not all they are. In addition to having the computational power and memory of a Thinking Machine, that is a fully realized AI, a Mentat was capable of incredible feats of perception, pushing their human senses to the absolute limits. By combining towering intellect with a perfectly indexed and rapidly searchable memory, an astounding ability to process raw data in very short order (imagine being able to watch an entire movie at x100 speed and remember every frame in perfect fidelity), an encyclopedic knowledge of political, economic, and military theory, and, through cultivation of ‘The Naive Mind’, even set aside preconceptions and biases, a Mentat is capable of supralogical theory crafting, strategic and tactical planning in excess of what a Thinking Machine could accomplish. This ability to sift enormous amounts of data in a timely fashion and a deep intuition and insight into the human condition allows a Mentat to chart future consequences without resorting to precognition. Although there are varying levels of intelligence even among the Mentats, Piter Devries is said to be able to out-think one of the Thinking Machines that enslaved humanity before the Butlerian Jihad just as one of those Thinking Machines could out-think a baseline human. Though a Mentat should beware. Even though the Naive Mind promises purely rational processing of data, if the data itself is compromised, so will be the Mentat’s conclusions. Hopefully you, Jumper, will be more considerate of the errors, biases, and contexts in your data than the typical Mentat.
As a Mentat Adept, your baseline abilities are immense, and they can be further enhanced by Sapho juice (an addictive extract of the root of the Ecaz tree) which can double or even triple your already prodigious computational abilities, though repeated use will turn your mouth and lips ruby red. The Spice Melange can be processed to create an effective booster for Sapho Juice, but use of this enhanced Sapho Substitute renders Sapho itself less effective permanently. Mentat training is a form of extreme conditioning that comes with fairly stringent ethical and moral programming to prohibit some more... sociopathic behaviour. Reverend Mothers and Guild Navigators were often trained as Mentats, particularly because all three groups relied upon melange for their enhanced abilities.
There are six ranks of Mentat, though the first three are considered basic training. The lowest rank, Memorizer, are trained to be able to recreate the layout of a city having seen it once for a few seconds, to be able to recreate entire conversations while mimicking the cadence and inflection of each participant, or repeating entire books, errors and all, having seen each page for less than a hundredth of a second. A Processor (the second rank), was trained to take tens of thousands of discrete pieces of information, then combine, divide, sort, and file them with an error rate of less than 00.00015%. The third rank of training is that of the Hypothesist, who were trained to extrapolate as many possible alternative explanations as possible from a specific data set, and then deliver the two most likely hypotheses (with the primary having a likelihood of at least 92% reliability). As a Mentat, you can specialize as a Generalist, a Simulationist, or an Advisor, and train others to be Memorizers, Processors, or Hypothesists.
Mentat Generalist: By eschewing specialization, the Generalist embraces the broad sweep of all that is occuring within their awareness framework. At a general estimate, a Generalist is usually possessed of accurate knowledge of at least 94.75% of everything occurring within their ‘universe’... where universe is defined as the social, economic, political, cultural, climatological, and spiritual realm they reside in. This includes, of course, knowledge of the self, since the Generalist is part of that set of phenomena. This near comprehensive knowledge allows the Generalist to make incredible leaps of logic and insight to intuit the nature of almost any problem placed before them. It does, however, come with a high risk of believing that one possesses all knowledge and thus being blindsided when a hole does appear.
Mentat Simulationist: While most Mentats are experts at plotting and scheming, a Simulationist is specifically trained in running detailed predictions of future events. Freed from the dependence on absolutes, and trained to correct for assumptions hidden in the inferences of others, the Simulationist sees all other beings as sets of behaviour patterns. By running potential future event simulations and factoring in the data sets of all relevant actors, the Simulationist can plot a highly detailed explanation of coming events and plot, at the very least, a dozen plans to deal with every possible outcome of those events, including contingencies for following through on those plans, altering those plans, combining those plans, or actively avoiding any of the previous options.
Mentat Advisor: You’re the equal of Thufir Hawat, famed as one of the finest minds of his time. As such, you have an instinctive ability to locate those who possess the aptitude to be trained as a Mentat and a comprehensive knowledge of the training methods needed to produce Mentats of any of the other ranks or Mentat Agents. You’re also skilled in understanding and intuiting the motivations of individuals that comes close to mind reading, of economic forces that comes close to precognition, and political movements and the intricacies of diplomacy are an open book to you. Less than one in twenty Mentats is an Advisor and they are extremely sought after, with every Great House wanting at least one. When you so desire, you practically radiate an aura of wisdom, confidence, and calm dispassion. Those you offer advice to will instinctively understand the wisdom of your words, though that’s no guarantee they’ll follow that advice."
400,‘One’,Samurai Deeper Kyo,"A simple scroll worn with time that bears a kanji for ‘One’ upon its outward face. Within are a series of writings and depictions of a special type of spiritual energy technique, in which a user refines their own spiritual energy to create a singular power known as ‘One’. The One is able to, according to the scroll, break all natural limits and go beyond even the limits of their own bodies. This seems a bit odd but according to the scroll One is a necessary step for a style of martial arts you’ve never heard about. It is noted upon the scroll that this style may even challenge the Mibu Clan’s legendary Mumyo Jimpuu Ryuu, but that seems a shot in the dark. Should someone achieve One however they will find themselves with a much ‘denser’ spiritual energy able to use less to achieve results that once took half again as much."
400,The Academy,Heaven Will Be Mine,"When it first became clear that the ad-hoc militias once used to neutralize terrestrial Existential Threats would be utterly insuffict in a war against the stars in the sky, the Memorial Foundation NGO made a number of moves to standardize and intensify the recruitment and training of Existential combatants. This high-tech complex exists as a testament to their efforts, then: a replica of one of the various facilities once installed in Earth’s Lagrange points.
Though currently unmanned, in all other respects this institution represents the absolute technical, functional, and conceptual state of the art for its purpose. No matter how straightforward or esoteric the form of warfare in question, all military learning, training, and instruction - even in the principles of Special Relativity and Pilot Interfacing - which takes place on the grounds of this institution and makes use of its resources is maximally effective and quick, up to the absolute limits of possibility. Those who pass through these halls will develop as rapidly and comprehensively as they ever will in the arts of war.
And yet, by the very nature of the impossible things humanity has set out to fight, such a regime is never enough - and solving that problem is the function this place is truly set out to fulfill. For those who make use of this place can push themselves or be pushed... past their limits, learning more and learning faster, reaching excellence and going further beyond. Such unfathomable gains naturally come with a necessary and equal cost to the emotional and mental well-being of those who make use of them, but doesn’t prominence have its price?
These effects - both positive and negative - are magnified further for children over adults, and for the otherwise socioculturally disposable, should they be honed beyond reason in this place.
Special Relativity (Heaven Will Be Mine)
Humans may rule over themselves and each other in a multitude of ways, but there is still only one form of authority in this world, and it is gravity: it is the force that holds people in shape, brings them together, and allows them to act upon each other, just as surely as it does the same for planets and stars.
You see, all kinds of mental, spiritual, cultural, and physical influence are fundamentally just different forms of ‘gravity’, as different expressions of the same fundamental power. Even the figurative gravity that predominates between people and the normal, physical gravity that you are accustomed to are simply two different forms of the same force, as the literal blurs with the metaphorical - and through your realization of this truth, you now share in the nature of this world. All of your vectors of power and influence over other people and the world - physically, socially, and more - are weakly and generally linked with each other, and with your ordinary gravitational pull.
This power changes little-to-nothing on an ordinary human scale, of course, and not least because gravity is the weakest of all the fundamental forces. Humans are small and powerless, and in the vast scope of a human society, any given human is even smaller, and even more powerless. But in the extreme, who knows what could be possible? Perhaps you might drag people into your gravity well with your irresistible attitude, physically crush them under your expectations alone, or bring them into your sway through your simple, massive immensity.
Pilot Interfacing (Heaven Will Be Mine)
When you’ve never personally manned a ship-self, it’s easy to think that ship-selves are mere machines, but in reality, nothing could be further from the truth. By their very nature as mechas, ship-selves are made in the image of humans, and they exist to allow humans to assume their power and stature. If ship-selves are machines, they are also extensions of the people who pilot and build them, and that makes them more and less than any ordinary machine will ever be.
Your internalization of this deceptively simple principle brings multiple benefits. First and foremost, while explicit security systems may still be able to lock you out, and some mecha may be harder to use than others, you’ll never be completely ‘incompatible’ with any mecha that requires any vague, intangible ‘compatibility factor’ - a human being requires no justification to inhabit the human form, nor a person to inhabit a persona.
Secondly, when your level of compatibility or ‘synchronization’ matters (and it does, in this world and in others), you will be able to increase your synchronization with and control over your mecha by ‘aligning your intentions with it’ - by acting through the functions and features of your mecha, fulfilling their purposes, understanding their limitations, and being, even for a short time, the kind of person that your mecha represents, or else by making your mecha into a representation of you. Before a woman can use a sword, she has to first become the kind of person who is willing to cut.
Finally, as an extension of this dialogue between inner and outer self, the control systems for any given mecha you pilot are no longer limited by what they appear to be. Depending on your personal inclinations, some control systems may be more or less difficult or intuitive for you to use and master than others, but no control system will be objectively ‘better’ than any other, nor more objectively limiting. You can tell a love story in any language."
400,The Colony,Heaven Will Be Mine,"For all the good intentions of the Existential Expansion division, its critics were always quick to point out that it was torn between two competing dreams: to export human culture to the rest of the universe, and to import the rest of the universe into human culture. Perhaps this installation fulfills that contradiction, capable of both in its own way.
Put straightly, this is a fully functional and self-contained space colony patterned on the successes of this world’s space program, with everything that implies. Between life support systems, manufacturing and fabrication capabilities, bottle ecology regulation, and gravitational stabilization, it’s fully capable of supporting both a large village or a small town’s worth of people and the society they inevitably create among themselves. Although unable to withstand a sustained assault or sufficiently extreme conditions, its window of operations is still more than wide enough to allow it to survive both the physical vacuum of space and the more metaphysical forms of void that might go hand in hand with it.
Likewise, though many would regard the isolation that surrounds this place to be a thing to overcome, others would see it as a thing to learn from: when a person is closed off from the rest of the world, they can learn both to see from the outside what they’ve left behind and to flourish free of it. Those who immerse themselves in the seclusion of this colony on an extended basis are capable of learning Tidal Sensitivity and similar abilities, and - if the Culture of the colony promotes their flourishing - may even become Human In The Ways We Want To Be.
Tidal Sensitivity (Heaven Will Be Mine)
By definition, everyone in this setting necessarily has some level of ‘tidal sensitivity’ - the ability to sense the pull of gravity as it acts upon them, rather than to merely be acted upon. And for the most part, this is really just a fancy way to talk about ordinary human abilities; it’s your senses of balance, acceleration, and kinetics, and it’s your ability to ‘read’ other people; it’s your ability to tell the difference between who you are on the inside and on the outside, and it’s the ineffable sense that tells you when you’re being watched.
However, in time, it’s possible to take such abilities well above and beyond the ordinary - something that’s probably just as much a matter of character development and insight as it is a matter of training. Should you ever attain this level of tidal sensitivity yourself, you will be able to directly sense gravity, both literally and figuratively; you’ll be able to feel inert mass-energy and the complex dynamics of human agency alike.
This power isn’t ‘true’ telepathy, empathy, or clairvoyance - not any more than what ordinary humans do when they guess what each other are thinking, feeling, and doing - but it doesn’t need to be, because it might as well be. Your intuition and perception will border on a sixth sense, and you will be able to reach out and open your mind and heart to others and the world, even from across great distances.
And at the most exceptional levels of tidal sensitivity, at a peerless level of skill held by only a few, it becomes possible not just to feel the texture and topography of space-time, but to directly read it as a narrative: the collective story told by all storytellers and the narrative spun out of everything that exists. Should you attain such insight, you won’t just feel gravity; you will know it, laid as bare as a heart on a lover’s sleeve or a story written across a friend’s face.
Human In The Ways We Want To Be (Heaven Will Be Mine)
To live in space is to escape from Earth’s gravity, and the kiss of space is liberation from the laws of Earth’s reality. In space, without Earth’s gravity to hold you down, you can do as you like with your body and soul.
Your means may vary depending on how much you’re set in your ways, and on who you are, what you can do, and where you are in life - and it may be terribly hard and painful, to boot - but you’ll always have the ability to become the ‘you’ that you want to be. You might be able to simply grow into yourself as you grow up and become an adult, or you might have to work hard to change all the parts of yourself that seem so horribly fixed, but no matter how you do it, you will find that you can choose your self - your body, soul, heart, mind, and gender - within the normal limits of possibility for your kind and then a bit more. If anything can stop you or drag you back down to who you used to be, it will only be other people, weighing you down and holding you back.
Don’t misunderstand, of course; you won’t be ‘perfect’. You’re only you, and you’ll only ever be you. But what more would you ask for?"
400,Wizard Tower/Academy,Pathfinder,"A tower in the locale of your choosing. Contains living quarters, as well as arcane and alchemical laboratories. Also contains a room in the basement with a calling diagram etched into the floor for all your conjuring needs. For 400 CP, in addition to your tower, you’ve got a college campus where students are taught magic. By default, they’ll learn Pathfinder’s magic, or whatever the local system is. You have full control over who’s admitted, curriculum and other administrative and academic aspects. Additionally, they can perform magical research, but they may require out of pocket funding if you want good results."
600,Beacon of Awakening,nWOD - The Sundered World,"The People have always been here, eking out an existence in this harsh land...but deep in their bones the People know here was once there. There was a time when the world was in perfect balance, when the People could command storms to be calmed, make mountains bow in obeisance and raise vast edifices to the sky. And by some miraculous accident in the chaos of Shattered Time, when you Awoke to the great ember of power which granted you your powers you were also imbued with a fragment of what later men will call a Watchtower’s nature and power.
Your knowledge of the High Speech is complete, greatly diminishing the costs of your spells and improving their durations. More notably, not only can you communicate it to others around you without impediment from the Lie but by explaining magic through the High Speech you may Awaken other human beings as Wise (or Mages, as later generations will call you) with all that entails. As your mystical power grows, in time your speech alone may be able to rouse other innate powers buried but somehow sealed away in other beings and free others from their spiritual link with chaotic forces such as the Abyss that bars most of mankind’s connection to the Supernal Realms. Even if you would not normally be capable of wielding the Arcana as the Wise do, your radiant soul grants you that capacity-and makes you great among them, with all the talent of a certain ruthless kingmaker of the latter days who sacrificed the chivalrous paradise he built to Ascend.
It would be prudent to use this power circumstantially: There are monumentally powerful forces with a vested interest in keeping all of humanity mystically quiescent, which while too grand to care for minor transgressions would likely respond harshly to an attempt to an attempt to mass uplift the People. But even a handful more Wise can mean the difference between life and death for an endangered tribe, and in worlds without the harsh laws of the Exarchs you may be able to grant entire populations of humanity the gift of the Wise."
600,Geass,Code Geass,"You were granted the mystical power of the Power of Kings in your eyes, Geass. Because you’re spending CP on this instead of finding one of the many Code Bearers in-setting to grant you one, much like Charles zi Britannia you have Geass in both eyes and it will never go runaway. Unlike most Geass users you don’t have a Code Bearer who gave you your Geass as it was granted upon you by Jump-chan so you have no obligations to anyone other than the CP you’re paying for it. With this Geass you cannot take the Code of any Code Bearers in-setting. These Geass abilities, as they are the Absolute Power of Kings, are inviolable and can affect any entity within its jurisdiction, though they can be resisted for a time depending on the Geass in question and the target’s willpower against certain concepts, ideals, and actions before ultimately succumbing to the Geass ability and its influence can only be broken under the absolute most extreme of situations. All forms of Geass only affect sapient biological creatures and A.I., anything that can be described as Human (such as a psychic entity made up of Human consciousness), but they cannot affect Code Bearers. Choose one:
(See the jump for the full list of geasa.)
Escafil Device (Animorphs) ​(600 CP)
Also known as the ‘blue cube’ or ‘the morphing cube’, this Andalite device is the source of morphing abilities. Instead of losing it soon after obtaining your powers, you manage to hold on to it (or, if you’re a drop-­in, it just happens to be lying next to you). You won’t have any idea how to use it’s various auxiliary functions, like the on­off switch or the ability to separate it into smaller pieces for easier travel, but using it for it’s primary function is dead simple. Simply have someone press their hand on one of the cube’s faces and focus on it for a few seconds, and they’ll gain the morphing ability. That’s all there is to it."
600,Hard Science,A Certain Scientific Railgun,"You have knowledge of Academy City's science and technology to rival a scientist with a doctorate and several years of experience under his belt. You're much more intelligent, analytical, and can easily keep your cool under pressure and rein in your emotions. You also gain a doctorate's worth of regular scientific knowledge in the discipline of your choice. You know the inner workings of recoil mitigating systems and powered armor, but your true specialty is the Esper creation and development process. Given enough time, you might just figure out a way to get rid of the randomness inherent in the process and give X person Y ability. Training an Esper to help him reach his maximum potential is child's play. You could probably pass as a member of the illustrous and brilliant Kihara family due to your sheer expertise and brilliance. Just that your sense of ethics would give you away, right?"
600,Incubation of the Soul,Madoka Magica - Wraith Timeline,"That’s a fancy way to put it. Though even they don’t completely understand how it works, magic in this world is generated by the power of the soul and intense emotions within sentient beings. Incubators themselves aren’t really capable of such things (most of the time), yet somehow found a way to harness it. Magic can create weapons from thin air, make dimensional spaces, halt the flow of time and even reverse it completely to a predetermined point. It can even create a wish tailored to the words and desires of a user.
That said, this isn’t a free lunch. Magic is the same as any other energy in that an equal amount of power is spent in the end result that was needed for it in the first place. Constant use of Soul Gems makes the user increasingly melancholic and prone to irrational behavior. A world-changing wish takes a ‘cost’ equal to what it created, and could even destroy the one who made the contract entirely if they somehow tried to change the physics of the world. Still, if you have the energy for it, magic can perhaps change the world...or make a very small part of it better, if you heed the costs.
All of this said, you now have an understanding of how to enable other beings to use this magic, and how to create Soul Gems of your own. You can, if you desire, grant the wishes of others through a willing contract...but it won’t be able to escape the equivalent exchange required, and you (or they) should be prepared for the costs and entropic backlash. Or not. It’s not your problem, after all. Though something you should remember is that if you make a contract for a wish with someone, it’s largely out of your hands in both execution and end result. That’s a lesson a certain Incubator learned the hard way...not that he’d remember anything if you asked him.
Strangely, even though a large amount of despair seems to create a larger ‘return’ of energy, anyone who falls to despair while using a Soul Gem or having it shatter just seems to vanish from existence. I wonder why that is...?"
600,Lerasium Bead,Mistborn - Era 1,"Hidden in the Well of Ascension, you’ll find the rarest metal on Scadrial. This God Metal, when burned, imbues the user with the ancient strength of Preservation itself. The user will become a Progenitor Mistborn, with powers several times stronger than the diluted bloodlines of the current age. Alternatively, you may alloy this bead with any allomantic metal, bestowing a single allomantic ability of comparable strength.
If this bead is consumed, stolen, or given away, you will receive another one at the start of your next jump or after ten years pass; whichever comes last. This is a priceless treasure, Jumper. Be careful how you protect it."
600,Lux Aeterna,Princess: the Hopeful,"The battle between hope and despair is neverending, and come what may should you survive it here you’ll be able to continue mastering the power of Light and aiding others with it. But sensing your interdimensional nature, the Light learns of lands beyond this world of darkness where it’s nurturing touch could do much good. With your investment here you may become a beacon for the Light, radiating it into new worlds for others to harness. A novice Prince or Princess could merely cover a county in the Light, but as you grow in power with the Light and similar fonts of positive emotion you may cast a greater light around you. One with the power of a King or Queen could cast the Light over an entire Earth-sized planet. Any who are amenable to the Light’s values may become new Nobility and seek justice on their own terms in the world-although, as the Light’s partner in this you may also direct it to Enlighten specific individuals, though you yourself will have little influence over what Calling they rise to. The Light knows to do no harm above all though, and should you deem it necessary in a new world you may rescind all effects propagated by this perk-save selectively those affecting you alone.
Last but not least, for the gift of bearing the Light to other worlds you gain three blessings. The first, that anywhere you settle in and put a modicum of effort into loving, caring for and generally maintaining or refurbishing in accord with the Light’s values will gradually become a Blessed Place: A land of outstanding beauty in which aesthetic, intellectual or moral excellence (depending on the location’s function) is supported. Some locations may be easier to do this in than others; most prisons may require significant improvements to life quality, while a hospital will qualify simply by you administrating or working in it. Beings touched by the Light feel their sorrows fade away in that location, and based on the location’s function certain positive aspirations and efforts affiliated with it will be bolstered with subtle but profound inspirations-while opposing negative ones blunted in effort. The duration of your stay and the magnitude, necessary risks to self and consistency of the good deeds within will determine the length and intensity of this spread; just arriving you may cover only
a small, well-cared for room but in months a hospital that routinely saves the lives of patients requiring critical surgery could beautify an entire city.
The second is simply a plethora of Wisps shared with you by the Light that shall grow as you master it’s principles; a novice Princess would have the total amount of Wisps as five or six of her peers.
As for the third, while any Queen worthy of her crown would win her power from the adoration of her people the intensity of the Light shining through you allows you to develop a unique Avatar charm based on your understanding and values of the Light’s principles rather than the example blazed by a Queen. Even if you lack the usual mastery of such charms’ users, you may pay the usual costs to undergo a second transformation that grants a great power for the short while representing the fulfilment of your beliefs and ideals. Great changes in character by yourself or significant alterations in perspective may alter this transformation’s aesthetics and powers too. While this power is commensurate with those of the other Queens’, as it is not filtered through their specialities it does not apply the Invocation restrictions theirs does."
600,Satomi,Anthem,"A Satomi is an academy where Cyphers are trained, and also where they undergo Ember exposure therapy to amplify their abilities. And this one’s all yours! It’s on the same level as Esteraat, the premier Satomi in the capital, Antium. It comes with a full staff and is completely self-reliant. Those who study here and complete their studies will gain all the abilities displayed by the Cyphers. Becomes a Warehouse Addon post-Jump, but may optionally be placed in a location of your choosing in every Jump."
600,Scroll of the Perfected Lotus,Exalted - Burn Legend,"Oh? What’s this? A gilded scroll any master would be proud to have in their library, save for the fact that it’s empty within but for a reflective golden sheen. For it reflects not just light, but greatness of spirit. This frankly inexplicable artifact offers you a true miracle: The power to transmit the capacity to learn the ways of the Mugen to fighters in other worlds. The process will still be gruelling; they must train to the limits of any mundane martial art they know with the scroll unfurled before them, though supernatural arts that wield ki or similar innate energies adroitly may take less transcendent mastery. But many in this world would deem that a small price to pay to raise your students to the apex of martial splendour in this world, whether you wish to begin a new generation of Legendary Masters to protect the world with or raise thugs that even the Yama Kings should fear. Perhaps with some feat of mysticism or the ki control of the Mugen themselves, it would be possible to use this scroll as a catalyst to transmit the wisdom of the Mugen on a far greater population at once in order to uplift them.
Murder One Thousand Hells And Topple Their Thrones (Exalted - Burn Legend) (Scenario Reward)
Whichever Exalted martial art you master, you gain three blessings: A unique rite that allows you to replicate your Exalted fighting powers in others while personally sculpting their style, a profound connection with the aspect of the world that enhances your fighting prowess and a means to purify the world with that aspect’s ki - making it baneful to demonic powers and a bounty to those born of the natural order. With great study into this world’s mystic arts, it may be possible to share these blessings with others."
600,Six Powers,One Piece - New World Edition,"A superhuman martial arts style, a master of the style will have the strength of a hundred men. Hardening the body to become iron-like, relaxing the body to act like paper in the wind, poking with the force of a firearm, kicking the ground hard enough to dash at speeds that can’t be tracked, kicking with enough force and precision to turn the air into a blade, and kicking off the air so hard that it gives the illusion of flight. These are the basic powers offered, with time and training allowing the use of combinations of these and even being able to learn a secret Seventh Power.
(Notes)
In future worlds, you can teach others how to use the Six Powers, even if it’s not biologically possible for that world."
600,Social Link,Persona 5,"Do you need help with the issues in your life? You’ll find that it’s important to have good friends, and you’re definitely good at that. You have an easy time making friends with a wide variety of skills, and when you’re in a tough spot, you’ll find that they’re unusually capable of dealing with any issues you have, barring the truly absurd, and as your relationships grow, and they help you with your problems and you with theirs, you gain benefits thematic to each other. If you’re a Shogi Player, they will become better at tactics, a politician might grant you better speaking skills, and a Journalist could grant improved ability to sneak around and avoid security. At the very peak of this ability, you may gain a fairly powerful technique emblematic of each other, assuming they have the capability to use such a thing. It’s great to have people you can count on, isn’t it?
Awakening (Capstone Boosted - “You are a slave. Want emancipation?”)
The Persona is the Mask for an individual to use to face hardship, awakened by stress and Rebellion. With your influence, you can cause people to awaken their Persona by expressing Rebellion against a prominent pressure in their life, whether it be economic issues or a sword against their throat. Like yours, it will begin weak, but grow with time and effort. In time, maybe everyone can reveal their true selves."
600,The Arrowhead,JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure,"The Arrowhead is one of several arrows, their metal taken and forged from an ancient meteorite that crashed into Greenland in 50,000 BC. The Arrowhead is noteable because of a property of the ore it was forged from: The metal is a catalyst for the creation of Stands. As a result, The Arrowhead is capable of awakening the Stand of any living creature it cuts. The artifact itself seeks out those strong of spirit, guided almost magnetically.
Along with creating an initial Stand, the Arrowhead has an added effect based on who is scratched a second time:
If the Stand-User is scratched a 2nd Time: The User is Awakened, taking on a new appearance. Their Stand gains access to a new ability, usually one far more powerful than they had at their start.
If the Stand is scratched: The Stand is completely morphed into a different form, becoming a Requiem Stand. The Requiem’s existing abilities are empowered ten-fold to what they were before.
The Arrowhead will grant a Stand to anything with a soul, be it humanoid or animalistic.
WARNING: Any scratched by the Arrow MUST be strong of spirit, otherwise the Stand manifested WILL kill them one method or another!"

400,Total Concentration Breathing,Kimetsu No Yaiba,"Oh, now it gets interesting. After a certain point, training your body in the classical sense just doesn’t make fighting demons any easier. But! Fret not, because with this, you’re now a practitioner of a Breath Style; at the core of this technique, whatever it happens to be for you, is specialized patterns of breathing combined with precise movements of your blade, evoking something elemental or natural with each technique. At first, this simply makes you a fair fight for your average demon - not the Twelve, certainly, but someone who’s had a few good meals in their lifetime - thanks to your expanded stamina, heavily-oxygenated muscles, and precisely stylized strikes. You’ll never break a blade (or spear, or mace, or whatever else you fight with) because of a bad swing again, and as your lungs grow stronger, so do you. Of course, this baseline assumes you’re practicing an established style...but with an additional purchase of this Perk, you develop you’ll have achieved Pillar-level mastery of something more unique, a signature style of sword-fighting that may very well be yours and yours alone, and by buying this Perk a third time, you are the progenitor and grandmaster of a complete fighting style on par with the Breath of the Sun itself - hell, it may not even be a sword-based fighting style. This will allow you to teach others your style as well, and like the Breath of the Sun, there will be enough material for other skilled fighters to develop their own variations of it."

Easy to learn from, patient study will increase any Bender's skill, though obviously a Novice will benefit far more. They also have another special property which few others know about; if a person who is neither a Bender nor born of any of the four Nations reads the scroll, they will gain the power to Bend that element.
