200,Humanity Really Unchained,Frank Herbert’s Dune,"Your capstone Boosting effects now apply to everyone you have the responsibility for a) ruling, b) raising, c) training, or d) engineering. Getting this requires at least one Capstone boosted by Humanity Unchained."
300,Implanted Relic,/tg/ Symphogear,"Somehow, perhaps through an accident, a relic has become embedded in a part of your body. While this doesn't prevent you from using other relics you will find that your synchronization coefficient with that Relic has increased tenfold, making the blowback from Swan Songs and other exhaustive features far less severe, with Swan Songs only tiring you immensely. This Relic seems to be reacting differently than seen with Human-Relic Fusion Specimen no. 1, Hibiki Tachibana and Gungnir. It seems to be merging with your body far better than Gungnir ever did, not threatening your life and eventually resolving into something similar to what was achieved by Finé herself with the Nehushtan Armor. The Relic that has been implanted is one of the ones associated with your Origin, but once again you may pay 100cp to change it to a different one."
300,Omega-2 Nanite,Reddit Generator Rex,"Among your normal nanites, there is a very special nanite bonded with. You’re the host to a copy of the Omega-1 Nanite, a control nanite capable of controlling other nanites, designed to work as a human-to-machine interface. The Omega-2 Nanite within you grants many benefits. Firstly, the nanites are much more stable and they’ll be much more resistant against external forces trying to control them. Your version of the control nanite also has a self-replicating program, essentially giving a way to create an unlimited supply of nanites to power your abilities and to make experiments if you find a way to remove them. Your body is also enhanced by it, being stronger and much more durable than a normal human, including a healing factor capable of recovering from bullet and knife wounds in seconds. The Omega-2 Nanite can’t be forcibly absorbed from you against your will and, thanks to it, you won’t die or become a statue if your nanites are removed. As a final gift, the Omega-2 Nanite works as a Capstone Booster, amplifying your abilities to a whole new level."
300,Prophecy of the Seraphim,Doom 2016,"Your coming was foretold, wanderer. For whatever reason it may be, the Seraphim of Heaven have seen fit to grant you a blessing, enhancing your capstone perks significantly. Although the UAC and the forces of Hell are now aware of your status, they may not know it's actually YOU that's the one in the prophecy. But depending on your actions, they'll know soon enough. The prophecy states that you will stand to become either the savior or ruiner of Hell, so the choice falls to you."
400,Cosmic Infinity,Gloryhammer,"You have survived the ultimate trials of the Starlords, suffusing your body with astral charge. You can
use this inner fire in short bursts to push your existing abilities to superhuman heights—strike with
enough force to fell a giant, shrug off a blow that would utterly crush a mortal man, cast a spell powerful
enough to affect an entire region, and so on. However, using this ability multiple times in rapid
succession is extremely taxing. Furthermore, this perk acts as a booster for every capstone you obtain."
400,Diamond Authority,Steven Universe,"You are a diamond or the descendant of one, as such you are the peak of gem existence and probably one of the rulers of your kind.  You are also MASSIVE, towering over all other singular gems.  Maybe you are as old as the rest of the diamonds but have been in hibernation or away traveling the cosmos since before the rebellion and Pinks death, maybe you were grown to fill the void left from Pink Diamonds death, or maybe pink tried to secretly grow a companion and left you behind like Spinel as you were either not finished growing or she thought you needed to be hidden from the other diamonds sights?  Whatever the case you potentially wield tremendous power over the homeworld gems.
[You gain a single massively powerful ability in its range and versatility.]
These gems are massive standing around a towering 90 feet in height.  Thankfully they have the ability to alter their height down to a much smaller 6 or 7 feet in size easily.  As a diamond you can choose your full height to be something comparable to the other diamonds and do the same for your smaller size. **THIS ENHANCES ALL GEM PERKS – ENHANCING THEIR POWER AND VERSATILITY.**"
400,Named,A Practical Guide To Evil,"You, among the many mortals in Creation, have been granted a Role in the conflict that rules Creation. Bearing a heroic or villainous Name, you are larger than life, a figure to inspire dread and awe.
While all names are theoretically equal, in the practical sense... well, they’re not. They’re so not. There are Names and Names, if you will.
You may receive a Name of the former kind for free, the kind fit for a supporting member of a Party, or a background character. A villain like the Salutary Alchemist, or a Hero like the Hunter. The groove you fill is yet relatively shallow, and you are unlikely to have the power to reshape cultures around you.
For 400 CP, however, your Name is something that has either been embedded into the heart of a major culture, or has the sheer power and potential to become so very easily. It’s a name like the Grey Pilgrim, the Saint of Swords, the Black Knight or Warlock, a name fit for leaders of parties and major Evil Overlords with lesser Named serving them.
The 400 CP version of the Name is also a capstone booster, meaning that it enhances the various 600 CP perks in a variety of ways listed alongside them."
400,Unconquered,Exalted - Solars,"The ultimate truth of the Sun is that it will always rise again in the morning, and set again in night, then rise again. It is the eternal Daystar, the flame that brings light to all of Creation and banishes the darkness. The Solar Exalted embody this, being able to take any skill and wield it with the light of perfection. Your Exaltation burns bright with this truth, and you now possess a shard of the absolute light belonging to its progenitor that allows it to manifest - your spiritual energies, Essence included, will quickly grow and replenish at a quickened rate, letting you keep up even as other Exalts would have exhausted their resources. Just as well, your light banishes all attempts to erase or deny your existence and that of the area around you - the only things that will alter your body or being, or shape your immediate environment is what you permit, though you and what is around you may still be wounded by force or destruction."
500,Demi-Servant/Pseudo-Servant,Fate/Grand Order,"You are the successful result, the only genuinely successful result, of one of Chaldea’s greatest
experiments. You are either a Demi-Servant or a Pseudo-Servant, depending on your Type. If you are Human Type, this has fused you with a Heroic Spirit to make you a Demi-Servant. If you are a Servant already, you will be fused to a human form that will make you a Pseudo-Servant.
A Demi-Servant is a fusion between a Servant and a modified human that allows the human to make use of the powers, Skills and Noble Phantasms of a Servant they are bonded with. You know and are skilled in the use of all of these abilities and items, though you might not quite know all the tricks as the original did just yet. You gain the Servant Type in addition to your original one, as well as access to the Servant Supplement as described for those of the Servant Origin, with 1000SP and all associated discounts and freebies.
A Pseudo Servant is much the same as a Demi Servant, a Servant is summoned into a human vessel but in this case the Servant is the one who gains control over the body with the human spirit already discarded. In effect, you gain the Human Type, including discounts and freebies, and 1000CP with which to buy perks and items, though none of this extra CP can be converted into SP. You will still be summoned as a Servant by whatever Master you chose, they were the ones to prepare the vessel you now inhabit or to have someone else do it for them. An important note is that Pseudo Servants effectively count as having living bodies, for the purposes of Magical Energy regeneration and any other effect that might care.
Whichever option you have taken, the changed nature, be it Servant or Human, has magnified the powers of certain perks you could take. Any 600cp Origin perk will gain an upgraded form for you if you take them and this perk at once, as described in the Notes section at the bottom of this jump. Taking either of the above options does not lock you out of getting a Servant or Master if you normally would, these are entirely separate from such a thing. You may buy this perk for 200CP instead of 500CP as normal and receive only the Capstone Booster section."
500,"""You are a slave. Want emancipation?”",Persona 5,"So, it seems like you’re a special one. You aren’t one to follow the whims of the powerful because it’s less trouble for you, or go with the flow of society, whether it’s because you want to go against society, or because you want to be the one on top, controlling everyone. Regardless of why, your drive for Rebellion has granted you a great strength of spirit, rendering you extremely resistant to most emotional manipulation, and downright immune to direct forms of mind control. Moreover, your will to stand apart from the crowd combined with a hint of intervention from a higher power has improved various abilities you may possess."
600,Guardian,Rise Of The Guardians,"The Guardians were founded by the Man in the Moon to protect the children of the world. Most of the time, their duties consist of doing what they probably would have done anyway. But occasionally there will come a threat to the children of Earth, and in such times the Guardians are called to defend.
To aid in this, you gain power when protecting others. Be it chasing away a child’s bad dreams or protecting them from the hordes of the Nightmare King himself, you shall never be stronger than when you are defending others, particularly if doing so puts yourself in harm’s way, boosting your power up to five times what it might normally be. This boost becomes even greater the more vulnerable and defenseless whoever you’re protecting is; the more they need your help, the better you’re able to help them.
Additionally, once per Jump or ten years, whichever comes first, if even a single non-follower who believes you exist is in danger, you may come back from the dead to protect them.
If you’re a Spirit, you may Insert into the Jump as a member of the Guardians. Capstone-booster."
600,Humanity Unchained,Frank Herbert’s Dune,"“Greatness is a transitory experience. It is never persistent. It depends in part upon the myth-making imagination of humankind. The person who experiences greatness must have a feeling for the myth he is in. He must reflect what is projected upon him. And he must have a strong sense of the sardonic. This is what uncouples him from belief in his own pretensions. The sardonic is all that permits him to move within himself. Without this quality, even occasional greatness will destroy a man.” -from Collected Sayings of Muad’Dib by the Princess Irulan.
The Dune Saga is, at its base, about humanity surpassing its limitations, becoming more and greater. Humanity for all its myriad of flaws and faults has managed to accomplish much in its existence. Space travel, thinking machines, an empire of many worlds and planets. But to stagnate is to die, for without push there is no progress. One either evolves or one dies, there are no other options, at least not for a mortal race. Of course, there are threats inherent in this, for as one evolves, how human does one remain? And what happens when evolution seems to grind to a halt? What about when there doesn’t seem to be any evolutionary forces in play at all? What keeps the engines of progress turning? Despite these questions, there really does not seem to be any limit to the Human Will or what it can achieve when applied correctly... and that’s what this perk is all about.
First, a guarantee -- you will always remain as human (whatever that means) as you desire to be. That’s the simple bit. Second, a promise that, no matter what you’re seeking to learn, or how you’re seeking to improve yourself, you’ll never stop seeing results, you’ll always find clever new ways to improve by a reasonable amount over a reasonable timeframe. All it takes is you putting in the effort. And third, enough of a willpower boost to ensure that you will never need an external source of conflict to push you to improve yourself or encourage others to improve themselves.
But wait, there’s more. Guarantees are fine and dandy, but a good foundation is also needed. To that end, you’re given a general upgrade that makes you roughly fifty percent stronger than the strongest normal humans, tougher than the toughest normal human, and faster than a normal human can get, with peak human senses and health. After all, this is the far future... there have been some improvements on the genome. A sound body is, of course, wonderful, but a human is more than mere flesh. To that end, you are now a multifaceted genius, at least as smart as any human that has ever lived, and a true renaissance man, being able to apply your intelligence to any field that strikes your fancy. You will never fall into the traps of myopic focus that plague the Tleilax, the Mentat, the Gesserit, the Ixian, the Guildsman, or the Noble Scion, dodging the destructiveness and limitation that comes with specialization at the expense of all else,
But this is Humanity Unchained, freed of all fetters, and so limitations to your body are lifted, both physical and mental. Your learning ability is expanded exponentially, allowing you to discover new modes of thought, new techniques, or simply experience new sensations so much more easily than those around you. You’ll find that it takes you but a single repetition to master any skill that others can teach you, and discovering new depths for yourself will require at least two orders of magnitude less time than it would take a normal genius."
600,A Word to the Wise,Frank Herbert’s Dune,"There are few who would deny that wisdom is an important trait for anyone who hopes to live a long life, especially if that individual is a mercenary (or a Jumper). However, more often than not, wisdom by itself is not enough. There are factors and events that even the wisest sage in the universe could not possibly anticipate, and for those situations, having excellent instincts for risk and the reaction time to make the most of those instincts can cover much of the difference. Your instincts verge on the preternatural, allowing you not merely split seconds of warning when things are going south, but minutes or even hours of slowly mounting unease as looming danger nears. The greater the danger, and the closer it is, the more pressing your sense of unease will become, and the clearer your ‘sense’ of what you’ll need to do to get yourself (and potentially others) out of hot water will be. When you rely upon this sense, you will find that you can survive almost any disaster, as long as you are wise enough to seek a way out rather than stupidly standing in the path of onrushing doom. With your instincts honed to finer than a razors edge, you have been granted reflexes and reaction times that verge on superhuman.
Better Lucky than Wise (Capstone Boosted - Humanity Unchained)
Of course, all the wisdom and instinctive action in the world cannot save you if you are well and truly screwed... and that’s where having Lady Luck firmly on your side pays off. As a Human, you seldom rely upon instinct, of course, but by following the flow of the moment, your ability to survive is magnified many times over, giving you tremendous, noteworthy amounts of Luck. By moving at just the right moment, you’ll be able to dodge otherwise fatal sword strikes from Ginaz Swordsmasters, avoid a Mentat Assassin’s laser, correctly guess sixty-four digit passwords, and find your way blindfolded through randomly shifting minefields. Odds are all now tipped so far in your favour that what should be 1,000,000 to one odds against are now 10 to one in favor."
600,Ancestral Voice,Frank Herbert’s Dune,"You have survived the spice agony and awakened all the knowledge and powers of a full Reverend Mother. What does this mean? Well, in addition to amping up the effectiveness of The Voice, Truthsaying, Simulflow, and Prana-Bindu Control (assuming you have them), as well as allowing you to access The Great Control and Imprinting aspects of The Voice (if you have it), you have all the memories of the Reverend Mother who administered your awakening, as well as all the Reverend Mothers who administered all the awakenings of all the Reverend Mothers before her back to the first. You also have access to all your Female Genetic Ancestral Memories. That’s the memories of every single female ancestor you’ve ever had (though not subject to any traumas, memetic, conceptual, or sensory attacks they may ever have suffered). Each Reverend Mother and each Female Ancestor is persona complete, meaning each of them exists as a kind of ghost within you, one you can talk with, even making a council of multiple memory ghosts to talk to all at once. Combined with Simulflow, you could be having dozens of such conversations as you go about your normal life.
Sure, you could go through the training of a Bene Gesserit Sister or a Sayyadina of the Fremen and unlock all this without paying the points... but there are three advantages to paying for it. 1) surviving the Spice Agony is far from a certainty, and if you have non-togglable poison resistance you can’t even trigger the Spice Agony in the first place. 2) without purchasing this, you are not guaranteed to be immune to Abomination. Buy it for CP and you’ve got a guarantee that you won’t become possessed by one of your own ancestors. 3) without paying for this, you won’t be able to do it in future jumps and you won’t gain the Ancestral Memories of your original Persona. Of course, if you’re Male and don’t have Golden Path, you’re not going to be able to do this naturally anyway without paying for it.
In future jumps, the Ancestral Memories you unlock are tied to the genetic background of whoever you import to in each jump. If you’re a Drop-in, or have Unbeholden active, you don’t have any genetic memories to unlock. Sorry. You may choose not to unlock a given jump identity’s Genetic Memory in future jumps even if you otherwise would have them. The Genetic Memories of all past jump identities that were not Drop-Ins can be unlocked at any time, but once a jump identity’s Genetic Memories have been unlocked, they cannot be relocked. Your original self’s (the pre-jumper you) Genetic Memories are automatically awakened for your core persona (not who you are in this jump).
Note: If you did not get a discount on this [by being a Reverend Mother or Sayyadina Priestess], you will unlock the genetic memories of either the male or female half of your genetic memory, depending on which sex you decided you would count as in this jump.
Living History (Capstone Boosted - Humanity Unchained)
You now have access to all your ancestors, male or female... and to a much greater degree than any mere Reverend Mother or Honored Matre. You can allow yourself to become partly Abomination at any time to take on the persona of any ancestor, including all their skills and behavioural quirks, and just as easily shift out of that state at will. You can also, with effort (and a large dose of spice) go upstream, calling up the memory ghosts of those who died without contributing to the gene pool. The more generations you have to move upstream, the harder it will be, with one generation being taxing, two being hard, three being incredibly hard, and four or more requiring days or weeks of effort. More than seven generations would probably take daily doses of Water of Life or Megaspice."
600,Forbidden Knowledge,Frank Herbert’s Dune,"You have access to the complete record of all human technology ever created, from the workings and intricacies of Holtzman Science to the ability to create No Chambers, Thinking Machines, and Artificial Navigators. From now on, wherever you go, you’ll gain a download of all scientific and technological knowledge ever developed in that universe by a member of your race... no matter how lost or secret it might be. Richesians are masters of miniaturization, and are able to make machines up to a hundred times smaller than they should be without losing any effectiveness. Ixians are experts in non-digital programming, able to create non-computerized machines capable of replicating almost anything a computer can do besides think for itself.
Thinking Machine (Capstone Boosted - Humanity Unchained)
Well, congratulations... you’re not even human anymore. Rather, you’re now a Thinking Machine. Thus, you are an immortal, endlessly upgradable AI in a body that is otherwise equal to that of a member of Humanity Unchained. Your consciousness can be uploaded to new bodies, backed up without fear of corruption, and in general you never have to fear death again, unless those pesky humans decide to try to obliterate you by hunting down every backup and fork of you and destroying them all. They did it once before, after all... and they have precog and Mentats. If you also have Butlerian Understanding, you gain technopathic control over all non-thinking machines with any form of computer inside, no matter how shielded, as long as you have a control-node within a hundred kilometers and the ability to sense the presence of any form of computer circuitry at planetary distances. In space, your ability to control machines is increased to within visual range and within 100,000 kilometers. Taking this Boosted Capstone is optional. With Humanity Really Unchained, your followers may choose to become Thinking Machines, but do not automatically do so."
600,Good Breeding,Frank Herbert’s Dune,"Though times have changed, the concept of pure blood and good breeding among nobility has endured throughout the millennia, reinforced by the often not so subtle hand of the Bene Gesserit (and occasionally tampered with, no doubt, by the Bene Tleilax). Even without the Bene Gesserit Breeding Program, the brutally darwinian selection process of a hundred plus centuries of Wars of Assassins has largely winnowed out all the weaklings. You are the product of these mutually reinforcing pressures, a truly spectacular specimen of Humanity, the refinement of the finest bloodlines distilled and characterised in each generation in a bid to produce the Universe’s Superbeing... and, you know, outdo the other Houses and secure future offspring. Not only are you very nearly genetically perfect, with no area or aspect of human development left untouched by drastic improvement, but you are beyond what the humans of the early twentieth century would consider peak humanity. Your muscles experience a tenth the fatigue a baseline human’s might, your senses are at least twice as sharp, your reaction times untrained are equal to those of seasoned genetically engineered assassins, and your resilience to trauma and disease guarantees that, should you actually suffer a mischief, you’ll recover in short order unless someone actively kills you. And that’s just the physical side. Mentally, you’re smarter than even a thinking machine... what some in earlier times would call a Post Singularity AI, with a near photographic memory and reflexes, allowing you to mimic behaviours and master new techniques with frightening speed. Furthermore, since you’re only a generation or two removed from the first Kwisatz Haderach, your genetics breeds true, meaning that you can pass on all your various gifts and abilities to your children without worrying that you’ll pass on anything bad to them in turn. Non-Human forms will be similarly adjusted from baseline.
Better Breeding (Capstone Boosted - Humanity Unchained)
Oh, sorry, did we say that you were a generation removed from the Kwisatz Haderach? Well you are. In the other direction. While other Scions of Houses Major are content with being the best possible specimens of the Human Race... you’re not so concerned with ‘possible’. Every facet of your biology has been not merely maximized, but dialed past the end of the scale and then tweaked a bit more. Your speed, strength, toughness, resilience, and reaction times are all well into the superhuman range, allowing you to perform feats that should kill a normal human. You could run hundreds of miles through the open desert without protection and be fine, shrug off designer diseases and hard radiation, withstand a hail of bullets or dagger strikes, walk through walls of fire, and catch hypersonic needles out of the air. Your mind too has been enhanced, allowing you to intuitively understand cultures simply by being exposed to them, memorize anything (even physical motions) instantly, suffer absolutely no skill degradation over thousands of years, and learn new languages as fast as you hear them spoken. Your senses are at least an order of magnitude sharper than those of a baseline. Even without Mentat Training or exposure to the Water of Life, your mind is easily powerful enough to begin to unlock the secrets of prescience, giving you glimpses of the future that amount to danger sense... but also include prophetic visions of potential futures that include you or your descendants. In fact, your genetics are so good that even the smallest amount of your genetic material transferred to another living person will see their body begin to improve over time, correcting all manner of genetic or congenital defects."
600,The Jihad,Frank Herbert’s Dune,"“Anger is one thing, violence another.” - Count Hasimir Fenring. Dune is meant, more than anything, as a treatise on the dangers of extreme charisma... at least according to Frank. Nowhere is this more evident than in Muad’dib’s Jihad, an essentially unstoppable holy-war that gained a life of its own and resulted in the deaths of billions as the Fremen took their vengeance upon the Universe that had so long oppressed them. That it also solidified Paul’s position as Emperor was extremely useful to the Atreides, of course, but the cost was something that Paul deeply regretted. For the Fremen, the Jihad was a goal unto itself, an idea laying dormant until the opportunity presented itself. And now, like Paul or Pardot Kynes, both of whom were able to transform Fremen Society almost without effort, you can harness the furious power of this terrible force.
Your charisma is beyond superhuman. Instinctively, you now know how to bend people to any task you dream up for them. People will be willing to live, to die, to kill at your command, and their loyalty will be a terrifying thing, a barely contained fire, a passion to serve you that burns within each and every one of your followers. Your every word will carry praise, insight, or condemnation, and your followers (which you will gather almost without effort) will eagerly record them, pour over them, repeat them as blessings and curses. Perhaps best of all, everyone you lead, everyone who follows your word, will gain an incredible resistance to the charisma of others, as long as those people don’t speak for you... or claim to. You may choose to instill a resistance to your charisma in those you trust.
Speaks to Fishes (Capstone Boosted - Humanity Unchained)
“Life -- all life -- is in the service of life.” - Pardot Kynes. Charisma is a hell of a tool for controlling others, but it pales before that ultimate opiate of the masses... faith. By means of a sense of appropriateness that clues you in to the traditions, cultural elements, and taboos of any culture you encounter, you now have the ability to infiltrate the very cultural zeitgeist, the societal matrix of a community, and install a kind of unshakable faith in you and your ideals. The more time you spend among the people, the more rapidly you can transform entire societies into not just willing followers, but warrior-fanatics. Thankfully... or not... you gain a sense for how your people will interpret your words and deeds. This faith serves as a powerful shield, protecting those who are ‘infected’ with it from all other credos, charismatic manipulation, and even conceptual or existential effects that might harm their psyches."
600,Third Stage,Frank Herbert’s Dune,"As a third stage Navigator, you can now extend any of your senses to the edge of the Known Universe... i.e. all of a Galactic Supercluster, assuming you have enough Spice Gas. Any form of spatial disturbance in the same star system as you, be it teleportation, space warping, or gravitic shifting, will instantly register on your passive senses and you can specifically target any such disturbance anywhere in your active scan basket simply by looking for it. Each form and each point source will have a unique distortion fingerprint that you’ll be able to learn and recognize. Of course, as a third stage Navigator, you’re a giant humanoid blimp-thing that can’t actually survive without the Spice in gas form anymore (at least not until the end of the jump). If you didn’t get a discount on this perk [by being a member of the Spacing Guild], ignore that restriction. If you did get a discount, or just want to look like a disturbing floating fetus, you gain that form as an altform after this jump ends. After the jump ends, your need for spice falls off, allowing you to sense anywhere in your star system that isn’t shielded from precog or clairvoyance even without the spice, but the spice will always boost your powers immensely.
Fourth Stage (Capstone Boosted - Humanity Unchained)
You no longer have need of a Holtzman Drive and there is no limit to how far away your senses can be extended with enough Spice. Simply by focusing on any place in the Universe that you can sense with your Prescience, you can will yourself and anything within a bounded field around you to that location. Yes, this truly is Movement Without Movement. The size of the field is dependent on how much Melange you just took, but none at all will allow you to shift anything within a meter of yourself. A small dose (four grams or so) will increase it by an order of magnitude, and every doubling of the dose will increase it by another order of magnitude. Yes, that means to shift a hundred kilometer long Heighliner, you’ll need to ingest sixty grams of raw spice. You can even, though it won’t be easy, move something you’re in contact with to any other point in the universe you can perceive without moving yourself. If you’re a member of the Spacing Guild (i.e. you got a discount on Third Stage), your form isn’t even vaguely humanoid anymore. You probably look like a giant swollen brain floating in dense spice vapor. You cannot survive outside of the Spice Gas for more than two minutes for the duration of the jump. Afterwards, this becomes an alt-form and you gain the ability to exhale highly concentrated Spice Gas if you bought the Spice Gas Item."
600,Tleilaxu Master,Frank Herbert’s Dune,"Welcome to absolute mastery over the human genome. As a Tleilaxu Master, you’re an unquestioned master of all the biological sciences and can literally play with genes the way a sculptor plays with clay. If it is at all physiologically possible, you can make a custom tailored lifeform that will be able to do it. It might take a while ...it took the actual Masters (all of them) millenia to figure out how to mutate the Worms of Arrakis or to create pseudo-Melange, but you’ll get there eventually. Not only are you such a master, you can do all this without any form of computer assistance, which yes, means you can comprehend and manipulate genetic structures with your mind alone, rendering you immune to all forms of genetic diseases and giving you the ability to read someone’s genome and genetic heritage from just touching them. With a sample of the genes of anyone you can create gholas of them… assuming you have an Axlotl tank... or if you’ve got a womb of your own... I know, Heresy! Your creations will never betray you as long as you don’t treat them like worthless peons. You could even create Face Dancers if you wanted to.
Super Face Dancer (Capstone Boosted - Humanity Unchained)
While technically the Face Dancers were lower down on the Tleilaxu caste system than the Masters, they were far more powerful, since they could (in theory) replace anyone... well, except for a Kwisatz Haderach or a Reverend Mother or a Thinking Machine or a Master or a Mentat or Guildsman... you know… people with mental powers that the Face Dancer didn’t have. But aside from that limitation, and the fact that the Bene Gesserit could always detect a Face Dancer, as long as a Face Dancer wasn’t seen actually transitioning, they could effectively look, act, and sound like any other human, even if that person was notably larger or smaller than the Face Dancer. This impersonation was so good that even genetic or mental scans couldn’t tell the difference, assuming the Face Dancer had time to study the target and gain a sample of their genetics. You’re now a Face Dancer. But not one of those defective ones. You’re a Super Face Dancer. You can’t be told apart from the original by any means, and the shift from one form to another takes you only six seconds rather than upwards of a minute. If you also have Ghola v1, you may now approximate any genetic ability that you’ve seen whoever you’re copying might have. It might not be a perfect copy, and you’ll have to figure out how to use it since you don’t have their memories, but given time and practice, few, if any, will be able to tell you apart from the original. This does not come with the kill switch of the quasi-canonical Super Face Dancers."
600,Mark Of The Divine,Mother of Learning,"This acts as a capstone booster for other perks. Your soul is encased in an indestructible matrix of divine energy. This matrix stabilizes your Mana flow and enhances your Mana Magnitude, doubling it, while allowing you to retain your Shaping Skills in spite of your monstrous reserves. Unlike Zach's, this does not come with a contract attached to it, and you are free to act as you will."
600,Miraculous Mastery,Miraculous Ladybug,"When it comes to your own Miraculous, you are no longer limited to using your ability a single time per transformation, and do not forcibly transform back into your base form after using it. In future Jumps, this perk boosts the effectiveness of magic items when you use them, granting you instant mastery of their use. This perk acts as a booster for any Miraculous bought in the Miraculous Section of this Jump."
