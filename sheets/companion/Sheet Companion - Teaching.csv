100,Learning Is Fun!​,Generic Children’s Television,"Every kid knows school is boring. Homework, tough teachers, tests, bleh. That’s no fun at all! Which is
why they prefer to learn from you. You’ve somehow figured out how to make learning an activity to be enjoyed instead of dreaded. Aside from the obvious help it provides with teaching kids, it also helps to convey information or plans. This is especially useful for Jumpers with a reckless teammate or ally, who’d prefer to charge headfirst into danger rather than strategize."
100,Lesson Plans,Generic Super Academy,"As a teacher you need to teach a class. This is a perfect and full lesson plan for whatever class or classes you want to teach. With tests, quizzes and homework assignments included. By following this lesson plan, you can guarantee that all of your students will pass as long as they put in a minimal amount of effort. You can change this yearly in response to assignment changes, but you will need to actually be teaching a class to use this. If you're not a teacher, these serve as perfect study guides to any class you are attending. Post Jump, you can
turn this into the perfect teaching plan for any material you know."
100,Oral Tradition,Civilization,"The first method of really transferring information from generation to generation was the art of song and storytelling. you gain a knack for the same arts, able to effortlessly compose songlines and legends intended to deliver useful parables about the land, science or other such things.
As long as something is composed as a song (or poem, it just needs that rhythm), you can explain something to someone and they will not forget it­ though this doesn’t necessarily guarantee understanding."
100,Simple Words,Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey,"You possess the ability to reduce the most complex of scientific or mathematical concepts into language the common man can understand. Furthermore, when other experts are in your presence, they too speak in this less jargon-rich way, making them seem more like regular people and less like Ivory Tower Intellectuals or Eggheads."
100,Tabula Rasa,Civilization,"You are akin to an empty vessel­ not ignorant, but unmarked by bias. Previous experience no longer has a negative impact upon your ability to learn. You become aware of any assumptions you make or when you take things as a given. Imagine it like a little voice in your head asking ‘are you sure?’
In general this means you make far fewer mistakes, and your bookkeeping and adherence to procedure is nearly faultless. If you are self­-taught, being informed of a more effective approach means you automatically update your skill to match.
You may also apply this benefit to anyone you teach­ they will never suffer for bad habits of being self-taught and the like."
100,The Joy of Teaching,Generic Super Academy,"You are a brilliant, talented and motivated teacher. Your students will learn and improve at least five times faster than they normally would, and will fully comprehend and retain anything you teach them. You are also excellent at relating to children and teens, you know how to get them to open up to you, and truly excel at getting them to obey you."
200,Constant Companion,Torchlight,"You are good at training companions, be they pets, automatons, or brothers-in-arms. You're about twice as good at teaching them new techniques, new uses for old techniques, and just in general making them better through teaching. In fact, it's possible to teach them things that might normally be outside their usual pay-grade for learning; you could teach a ferret to carry a backpack full of loot, count money, sell items, and even, ""read,"" a list well enough to run to town from the wilderness and do your shopping."
200,Eastern Sage,SB Fullmetal Alchemist,"Legends tell that Amestris learned the art of Alchemy from a philosopher who told the tale of Xerxes’ destruction in a single night. You too share something with this man in that you can teach even the most untalented and thick people arts that should be beyond them considering their knowledge base. You could single handedly bring Alchemy to other worlds, while creating a new era based on its use, and that’s literally too. All you need to do is teach it as if it was a normal subject and a possibility there, and people will develop the capability in other worlds even if they really shouldn’t. You find you can do much the same for your other mystical abilities as well. Only things that would otherwise be teachable, and aren’t the result of special bloodlines or unique cases can be taught."
200,Listen Up!,Mario & Luigi,"You know, as much as we all hate the overly long tutorials, it’s painfully obvious that nobody is going to be able to get anywhere with their new toys and skills if they have no idea how to use them! You have the ability to explain things to people in a way that they can easily understand, and when teaching them how to use abilities or techniques, it’ll be as if they had “Try, Try Again” for the duration of the lesson.
Try, Try Again (Mario & Luigi)
You’re really good at learning how to do stuff. Someone could teach you how to perform a specific technique or move and after just one spar or demonstration, you’d be able to perform it as if you knew it by heart! You have to actually be physically capable of performing the technique/move in order to actually perform it, but hey, you know how the old saying goes!"
200,Repetition is the Mother of...,Mother of Learning,"Your teaching skills are world-class. You could fit an entire month's worth of learning into a single class, and have your students actually learn the material. You also gain the ability to teach through unorthodox methods, such as flicking mana-infused marbles at your students, and have it actually help them learn mana-sensing. It won't make them hate you less, though."
200,Ultimate Teaching,Danganronpa,"Your teaching abilities are incredible. As long as you have the prerequisite knowledge in a subject, you are able to teach it at an incredibly fast rate and students will understand far quicker than they usually would, never misinterpreting your words and always listening to your guidance. Even with these incredible abilities, the stresses of teaching Ultimate students may still overwhelm you from time to time, so make sure to keep an eye on their explosive personalities."
200,"Wax On, Wax Off",Generic Parenting,"Let’s face it, you’ve probably learned a lot of unconventional or at least difficult-to-teach things from your past experiences. Passing those down can be a real challenge...at least, until now. You can now use unconventional training to teach your ward or any student you have things they have the potential for, like waxing a fence or constantly taking a jacket on or off. This won’t actually be any FASTER than if you taught them normally, but it can definitely be a lot safer than handing a magic wand to them and hoping they don’t set the house on fire. As before, you can only teach things that are already POSSIBLE for them to do in the first place: No handing down unique things by making them clean your car. This perk is also effective at tricking people into doing your chores for you. I wonder why?"
300,Actually Teaching,Assassination Classroom,"You have an odd ability to actually teach really well. You can teach any ability you know to the likes of to even Class 3-E. What's so odd about it is the way you can go about it and still pass on the knowledge. For instance Korosensei is able to teach lessons to individual students through assassination attempts. Bitch-Sensei teaches English by teaching seduction and lying skills. You have a similar method, perhaps you can teach someone to throw a fireball by having the student catch it with their bare hands. The methods you use are unorthodox and it’s up to you how you achieve it.
(Word of God)
You can't teach them [something] that is inborn. I know there's a lot of magic that's inborn, but there's a few that aren't. For instance, you can be a D&D Wizard, and teach your students how to be a D&D Wizard. Would this open them up for being taught magic from Harry Potter? Sure. However you can't teach someone to ""be an elf""."
300,The Enlightenment,Civilization,"You gain a complete understanding of the scientific method, and can think in terms of analysis, testing and experimental planning as easily as you can count time to music. When confronted with a problem or task, you can conceive of every possible permutation of variables to test for, as long as there are a finite number of them. I.E. you can’t think of infinite­-variable test­-cases or experiments. You cannot write down or execute these tests any faster than you normally could.
Additionally, you can in a few hours completely convey the foundations of the scientific method to another person, drastically enhancing their ability to observe the world. This does not change their personality on it’s own, but over time they will find their own answers."
400,Bonding By Fire,Generic Parenting,"No, that’s not ‘bonding by a fire’, that’s ‘bonding by fire’. Whether it’s teaching your ward how to fight, work with tools, or even jogging, you become an expert at passing down knowledge via physical activity. You can pass down any sort of athletic or physical style or technique to your ward with incredible effectiveness. This includes any abilities they have the potential for, whether from the world’s logic or your own genes. The downside (for them) is that this speed happens in proportion to how much you make their training as hellish and difficult as possible. To the point of risking permanent damage, which is a loss condition. Try not to push them too hard."
400,Educational Priority,SB Stellaris,"Your citizens are very smart cookies. They can learn twenty times as fast, regardless of what type of learning they are participating in.
(Notes)
These apply in some form to any empire, nation, civilization, or organization under your control, even if you don’t Import your Empire into that future Jump. The perks will be adapted as needed to actually be relevant towards any organization they are applied to. The party does directly benefit from effects that affect the people in these organizations."
400,Fire-Forged Comrades Method,Exalted - Solars,"While a single Solar stands as a point of light against the encroaching darkness that seeks to swallow Creation, a general is nothing without an army. However, the glory days of the First Age are long gone and the former Lords of Creation are hunted as demonic Anathema, and thus no retinue may be easily available to them. But even this can be overcome. You may train effective armies from the ground up in a staggeringly short amount of time, turning a village into an elite fighting force within a week or two, tops. How effective this is depends on how far you spread your efforts… training a single individual will quickly see them become your equal (though obviously without Charms or any other advantages, unless they already have those or you grant them somehow) in combat and strategy, training a small village will create a disciplined squad that will put the veterans of Lookshy to shame, and training an entire country would create a crude but functional army.
Obviously, this can be improved further if you have more time to raise these troops. This can also be applied in training or delegating any sort of organization or group of people - letting you raise ‘troops’ for art galleries or dancing as easily as you could battlefields. In addition to this increase in discipline and competence, they will develop or strengthen a sense of loyalty towards you - those newly blooded generals will lay their lives down for you, and that village will be all too ready to fight for you."
400,Four Legged Scholar,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,"Few monsters are bound to a human lifespan. Most are outright immortal, if not incredibly long lived, and that can often be seen in the sheer breadth of experience most intelligent non-humans possess. But even among immortal beings, you’re a stand out example of a life well learned. You hold very broad knowledge of almost all things in this world. Different magic styles, countless combat techniques, medicine, science, the use of many different weapons and implements, almost any skill that can be named without being unique to an individual or being a special power instead of a skill anyone can learn, as well as having to exist in the time that you take this. While many might consider you a master of these things, you cannot compare to true specialists. While your skill in varying forms of magic is broad and deep, legendary witches like Medea would greatly overshadow you. Your talent for combat with fists and weapons is that of a master to most but only that of a journeyman compared to Achilles or Heracles. If an ordinary master were a ten and these legendary heroes were a hundred with their specialties, you’d be something like a fifty.
However, your true blessing lies in your ability to pass on that which you know. You are a teacher of near-supernatural excellence and should you allow others to learn from you, will be the one to create numerous legendary heroes, very much the equal of Chiron himself in this field. Bringing others to your level of skill, even training their abilities and bodies beyond normal human limits, is quite easy even within just a few years, but you also find yourself able to awaken potential in your students that lets them grow beyond what you can teach with ease, especially once they begin to adventure on their own. Your students, even the rowdiest, find themselves easily falling into the perfect mindset to learn from you and can even retain any natural anger they might have while you teach them."
400,Haptasnytrir Foldardróttinn,Germanic/Norse Mythology,"Like Odin, eternal seeker of knowledge, you have a gift for learning, not simply in a sense of being able to learn faster than most, but by more esoteric means, being able to locate long lost or forbidden knowledge and skills, beings who have refused prior students will never refuse you, instinctively knowing where to go and what to do to acquire more knowledge and exploit it for your advantage. Your learning speed, capacity, and intuition expanded by an order of magnitude and quests to find or locate such things equally shortened.
But what good is knowledge if you can not exploit it, you now possess the ability to teach anybody almost anything, even if they are incapable of using that knowledge. You could teach a mortal how to wield divine power to create life and they would understand exactly how it works and would be capable of doing as such if they gain the ability to wield said divine power. Whenever you teach people anything, you gain power over them and what they have learned, gaining more power over them the more you teach and the more they wield your knowledge and skills. You could teach someone to be a great fisherman, but make it so they could only catch catfish and these restrictions can be selectively applied as they teach others in a chain of learning. You could teach the world magic and runes and make it so those gifts could never be used against you, or that no matter how skilled and knowledgeable they become they are unable to teach anyone these things, their mind becoming momentarily blank. Even a third party observing you or your students would be unable to learn anything without your permission, even something as simple as making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, however this won't stop them from making a PB&J on their own they just won't be able to recall how you made it if they saw you do it, they literally would not, and could not, associate the name of the sandwich with those ingredients. If the knowledge from you is so intrinsic to a person that it is how they make a living or is what they are known for or is used in everyday life you would have the ability to manipulate their fate similar to the Norns with lesser control based on lesser connection of that knowledge, you could manipulate the fates of an entire kingdom, world or further with this. Students under you will be able to learn what you have to teach faster as if their intelligence, talent, capacity, and learning speed was increased by an order of magnitude.
You are a plotter and can easily come up with both direct and indirect ways of obtaining what you want. To your eyes obstacles look like opportunities and challengers like people bearing gifts. Moreover, when seeking something that you cannot obtain or achieve at the moment the steps and measures you must take to accomplish your will naturally fall into place in your mind given a bit of time.
But plans are nothing without the will to see them done. You have that will. Your determination is such that you can ignore or power through anything that would seek to stop you, should you choose to do so. From pain to loss to uncertainty to even the greatest social pressure there is nothing that can deter you from your goals but your own judgement. This will even let you break free from unnatural mental influences with effort
Haunted Printing Press (Generic Xianxia) (600)
Well this is a rather interesting contraption. This ancient screw-press, table and collection of movable type appears to be possessed by the ghost of its creator, a thousand year old inventor who was executed for his “heretical invention”. Now he haunts it eternally, begging for it to be used. Its true use only becomes viable when provided with paper, ink and a manuscript. When these are assembled before the press, the spirit of its inventor will immediately begin working, consuming the manuscript in the process and begin working nonstop to produce as many copies of the manuscript until it has run out of materials.
The Printer however is rather particular and will only create scrolls that have the intention of teaching something to the reader. As such, the manuscript must be written by someone who has extensive knowledge on a given topic, and must be of sufficient length to impart this knowledge.
Should the manuscript be of sufficient length and detail, the printer will edit it in such a way as to maximize its effectiveness when used for training purposes. Anyone who reads the subsequently printed text will receive the equivalent of two years of dedicated, earnest one-on-one training with the manuscript's author, almost as though reading the book substituted for all of the training and repetition that must have been undertaken in those first two years. The printer is an excellent editor and will keep all of your best material unchanged (thus allowing the reader of any text printed herein to gain the benefit of any teaching perks you yourself might possess). Any student may only gain this benefit from any single book that is written once, but the book may be reread to keep the student sharp.
Beware, however, for these benefits apply to ANYONE who reads the book. You could end up handing your enemy the seeds of your own destruction, so use it wisely."
400,Numerologic Sorcerous Tutelage,Exalted - Sidereals,"The Forbidding Manse of Ivy contains one of the largest repositories of magical knowledge in the universe within Department 137. By far the most popular school taught there is the Theanoan. Theano's teachings focused exclusively on numerology and mathematical understanding of the arcane. A student is not considered ready until they have learned to calculate imaginary numbers on an abacus by manipulating non-existent beads. You have received an apprenticeship from an elder Sidereal, who has initiated you into the Terrestrial Circle.
What's more, your understanding of Theaon's secrets is much deeper than any other Exalt's. You may teach whatever magic system you know to anyone, limited only by their understanding of mathematics, condensing your occult understandings down into complex but repeatable equations of mystical significance. You can even teach your magic to people who are normally incompatible with it, such as tutoring a Dragon-Blooded in the Celestial Circle or teaching magic which normally comes only to people with a specific bloodline. However, your student will require much more time and energy to cast such spells, as they must first apply advanced linear algebra transformations to their own numerological representations in order to prove to the universe that they are the kind of being capable of working such magic."
400,Peerless Instructor,The Games We Play,"You are simply a very, very good teacher. You have a deep, wide grasp of techniques, and know just how to teach anything you know to others. Under your tutelage, people improve by leaps and bounds, shattering limits and defying expectations left and right.
Simply put, you’re capable of imparting months and years’ worth of knowledge in mere days and weeks, and that’s if you take things lightly. You also have an instinctive understanding of just what the best way to teach anyone is, an idea of a person’s potential, and most importantly, how to go about making them grow beyond it.
Under your care even the weakest sparks can grow into blazing infernos, so long as you pay even the slightest attention."
400,Perfected Lotus Cultivating Gardener,Exalted - Sidereals,"Supernatural martial arts are the means by which one can grasp power that is normally out of their reach... but not too far out. Mortals can only learn Terrestrial styles, and even the majority of spirits or the Exalted cannot learn Sidereal ones. You can bypass this restriction, opening the entirety of the perfected lotus up to all. You may teach any supernatural combat style to anyone. This doesn't necessarily mean that they'll be able to use what they know, such as a mortal trying to use Sidereal combat Charms without a Sidereal Exaltation to power them or someone learning a style dependent on a special bloodline or feature of anatomy for which they don't possess an equivalent, such as if you taught a goldfish kickboxing."
400,Power of Friendship,Valeria Bleach,"The hero doesn’t fight alone, not these days. There’s no reason that the friends he fights for can’t give it a go themselves to help him out, especially not when they’re in your presence. Your close friends and trusted allies grow stronger alongside you as you fight and continue to adventure, provided they’re joining you in your struggles. To a lesser extent, they can take advantage of the speed at which you grow if they also make efforts to improve, likely to greatly increase their efforts.
What makes you special in particular is the ability to awaken entirely new abilities in those around you, sometimes as a direct result of energy you project and sometimes as a coincidence of being wrapped up in the same schemes you’re trapped in. The result is that normal friends or those too weak to really keep up in the struggles you face are able to develop powers that help bring them nearer your level. They might discover sudden Fullbring heritage to save themselves when you couldn’t reach them or suddenly unlock a supposedly impossible transformation to recover lost power as a Hollow. Once they have their new powers, they’ll be able to progress them as if they were truly inherent abilities."
400,Tenshintai,Valeria Bleach,"Normally, the process of attaining Bankai, the second and final release of a Shinigami’s Zanpaktou, is a long and arduous process. It is said to take a minimum of ten years in order for even the most prodigious to unlock, and a hundred years to master. Some people don’t have time for that. The Tenshintai is a flat, but elaborate doll that is vaguely the height and shape of a man. This device developed by Urahara Kisuke, is used to potentially attain Bankai within three days. A hopeful shinigami must stab the doll with their Zanpaktou, causing it to forcibly manifest their Zanpaktou’s Spirit, which in itself would ordinarily be a difficult task. This manifestation is able to last for three days, during which the Zanpaktou will rigorously test their wielder in a manner befitting the spirit’s character. Should the wielder pass the test, they will attain Bankai, but should they fail to succeed in three days then the Tenshintai will return back to its original shape as the spirit once again goes dormant. It is advised not to attempt the test twice, as there are “dangerous consequences.”
This Tenshintai has expanded functionality beyond Zanpaktou training; allowing for an extreme three day test that can potentially allow the user to awaken other dormant releases or transformations they have the potential for. As with attempts to attain Bankai however, there’s danger to one’s life during the testing period, and potentially lethal consequences to pushing beyond three days of testing."
400,To Train The Faithful,Frank Herbert’s Dune,"“Arrakis teaches the attitude of the knife — chopping off what’s incomplete and saying: ‘Now it’s complete because it’s ended here.’” - from Collected Sayings of Muad’Dib by the Princess Irulan. It is Fremen doctrine that God created Arrakis to train the faithful, to force them to adapt or die. And boy howdy did the Fremen Adapt. Now, you’ve got that same ability, but instead of it taking generations, for you it takes weeks or months. Exposed to any form of survivable hardship, you’ll find yourself physically and mentally changing in a hundred minor ways to maximize your ability to not just survive, but thrive in that environment. Furthermore, none of these changes will be detrimental when you’re not in that environment, meaning that you’ll never hyperspecialize. Furthermore, you now excel at passing on survival traits to others, either through training or through your genome. What qualifies as a survival trait? If it helps one survive, it’s a survival trait. You can teach anyone to do anything you can do, and pass on any abilities you might have to any of your descendants. Passive abilities are much harder to teach, and skills don’t always pass on to later generations intact, but you’ll have significantly better luck than others would be at both. Lastly, since time is of the essence in survival situations, you find that you can teach others at an incredible rate, conveying the equivalent of an advanced academic degree in mere weeks, and what you teach sticks, meaning that your students are unlikely to ever forget your teachings."
600,Best in the Business,/tg/ Worm,"The greatest advantage you could have is having the best and brightest out there on your side, but sometimes that isn't possible. This perk causes everyone working for you to rapidly gain in skill and capability, reaching the levels of a top tier professional in a week or two, and from then on showing noticeable increases over time within the fields they are operating in. Even scraping the bottom of the barrel when it comes to human resources isn't a problem, they'll be the equal of anyone else in the business quickly enough as long as they aren’t just completely incapable of the job, and with sufficient time will make the former best look like amateurs. These effects are less pronounced the less proximity a person has to you on a regular basis, but even those on the fringes of an organization can expect easy competence and to become skilled at what they do."
600,I See Your Potential,Dragon Ball Z,"Your allies and companions may lament that they simply cannot match you. They can’t hope to catch up, to be the behemoth of power and skill you may potentially become...or already are. That fear is now unnecessary. When you train someone in a skill or ability that is possible for your new student to learn, and one you know yourself, you will find that the gap is quickly closed with enough training and effort. As long as you’re personally teaching your student one-on-one, they will quickly race to the heights of skill you yourself currently rest at, able to make a student into a master with enough time. This only works for one particular set of skills (combat, a particular technology or science, knitting, etc.) at a time, but you’ll find the top won’t be so lonely anymore. Be warned, some people who know of this teaching prowess may take advantage of you and work to ulterior motives after learning what you know...use caution when choosing your students.
Jumper Nye the Science Anon​ (Generic Children’s Television (600 CP)
Well, aren’t you clever? You’ve gained a mastery of general science and how to teach it, enough that UNIVERSITIES would be scrambling and fighting each other in order to hire you as a teacher. You stand at the top ranks of your peers...But instead, you choose to teach children. And boy has it paid off. Education rates are rising across the board, due to people, not just children, watching your show. You’re famous, and people look at you with respect and admiration for your humility and kindness. And, as a reward, you become not only an expert teacher, but an expert learner as well. After all, there’s so much more about the world to learn and discover, still. Both teaching and learning a subject, skill, or job now take half as long."
600,King Maker,Fate/Legends - Garden of Avalon,"Your place is not at the forefront of this story but behind the curtain. Yours is the hand that guides the heroes to success, raising farm girls to be kings and serving boys to slay dragons. You are the maker of kings and bringer of heroes and this is only too apparent in how you can guide others. Even should you lack knowledge of the specific path your proteges may wish to pursue, your constant presence and tutelage brings out vastly more potential than should be possible for your students. People discover brand new powers and levels of strength that they did not believe they had and may very well truly lacked before you took charge. Lessons and study that should take half a lifetime can be compressed to just days for even a dull brat to digest. The ones who call you mentor and master are almost assured of becoming legends that are known throughout the world and will continue to be remembered for centuries after they pass. Of course, they also develop a loyal affection for you, even if you are a strange, oft annoying and troublesome teacher to have."
600,Life Will Change,Persona 5,"Do you have a Resolution in your heart? It’s important to grow over time, whether in power or in the heart, and you’ve found that one corresponds to the other rather often for you. Your Persona begins as a much more powerful Awakened Persona based on one of various gods associated with Rebellion, and you’ve become much better at working through your personal issues. As you do so, you’ll find that your Persona will gain new strength, learning new spells and attaining capabilities parameters. Remember that there is always room to grow, and not to become stagnant.
Wake Up, Get Up, Get Out There (Capstone Boosted - ""You are a slave. Want emancipation?”)
What good is being happy if your friends aren’t there with you, growing with you? You find that your close friends benefit from the effects of the baseline perk, though a bit diminished, working through their issues with greater and watching as their Personas (or if they lack one, any personality based supernatural powers, though at a lesser rate) grow, though they must reach their Ultimate Personas on their own. Finally, as you grow in skill and power, you find that they mirror your growth to a degree, as if they were training with you. It’s important to have a proper crew if you want to pull off the heist, after all."
600,Live To Win,Generic Parenting,"You know what the best thing about being a teacher is? It’s knowing that your knowledge and experience will be passed down, entrusted to the next generation. When you teach someone an ability or technique of yours, you also have a unique way of doing so that will also pass down your own experience and control. All the little techniques, all the tricks and stunts you’ve learned will always be included in what you pass down. This only applies to knowledge that you yourself already have and mastered – any obscure ability or untapped potential you’ve never made use of is invalid for this perk. You can also only teach one person at a time using this perk. As stated before, this perk only works on things your student CAN actually learn in the first place, and will take the same amount of time it would take for them to master the basics. The leap in experience will only occur once they’ve FINISHED mastering the basics, coming as a sudden epiphany where it all finally clicks together. Trying to split your teachings to different students will make this perk’s eventual snowball effect stop before it had a chance to begin."
600,Reserve Course,Danganronpa,"Not everyone is capable of attaining an Ultimate title, hence why Hope’s Peak has a reserve course for those who aren’t quite able to achieve greatness. After all, anyone can become good at something with enough time and effort, but no one can ever reach true mastery of a skill if they do not already have the inner potential. From now on, this no longer applies to people you take under your wing. Training in anything that should require innate potential to learn, such as Ultimate abilities or some powers in other settings, can now be compensated for with significant amounts of time and effort.
Over the course of several years, this power will therefore let you help anyone to achieve their dreams through hard work regardless of genetic influences, such as training a tone-deaf student into the Ultimate Musician, turning someone with abnormally low IQ into the Ultimate Chess Player or even transforming a horribly disfigured person into the Ultimate Charmer."
600,That We Achieve Immortality,The Games We Play,"True greatness comes from helping others, nothing encapsulates this more than the ability to awaken another’s Aura. Anyone can theoretically do it, but it’s incredibly exhausting and a bit of a complicated process. You though, you’ve elevated it to an art style. It’s far less exhausting for you and you could probably do it in your sleep if you wanted.
Awakening dozens or hundreds of people a day is easy for you and perhaps one day, with training and effort, you might be able to awaken thousands or more a day. Still, beyond your unusual skill at awakening Aura, you’ve also some kind of ephemeral trait that empowers those you awaken to further heights. Those who you personally awaken will have larger Aura reserves, as well as a greater skill at manipulating their Aura and Semblance. The physical empowerment of their Aura, as well as its defensive abilities, will also be empowered.
But the greatest ability you have, beyond all of that, is the ability to “awaken” any other systems you may possess in other people. Cultivation, chakra, magic, psychic powers, whatever. You can’t awaken any specific abilities, just a general system, but that should be just fine as a base, yes?
Much like all who possess Aura here, those you awaken are also capable of awakening others. Those who are awakened by those you awakened yourself lack this fiat backing in regard to spreading your gifts any further, but that first generation you uplifted will be able to do so without limit, barring the rather steep energy requirements necessary. You may toggle whether or not other people can spread it.
(Notes)
You can only pass on broad systems, not specific abilities. Passing on Naruto-verse Chakra is fine, the Sharingan is not."
600,The Famed Adventurer,Mother of Learning,"Survival. Exploration. Discovery. You are a master at these things, practically stumbling over the remains of ancient civilizations like other people stumble into fast-food joints. This perk enhances your ability to discover ancient ruins, unlock their secrets and take them for your own to world-class levels, while making it look easy to everyone else! Adventure on!
(Capstone Boosted - Mark of the Divine)
Every adventurer needs a party. After all, who's going to carry all the loot? Not you! This causes everyone working for/with you to rapidly gain in skill and capability, reaching the levels of a top tier professional in a short span of time. Even scraping the bottom of the barrel isn't a problem, your companions will be the equal of anyone else in the business quickly enough as long as they aren’t just completely incapable."
600,To Be the Best,Pokemon Anime,"Where others might see a simpering worthless ball of fur and failure, you see diamond in the rough in need of the right hand to bring out their luster. Through encouragement and training you can help someone discover strengths they never imagined were within them; breaking through their perceived limitations, overcoming their failings, and growing in ways that will shatter expectations of them. Why in your hands even a common rattata picked up from the side of the road might one day grow to become a dauntless titan that could give legendaries pause. Of course, such legends aren’t born in a day; but for those with the drive to reach for the stars, the rewards are well worth the work."
600,Trainer of Heroes,Hercules,"Not for you to take the center-stage in smiting monsters and rescuing damsels. Rather, your skills lie more in what comes before. You are a truly unbelievably skilled teacher and trainer of people. You have a grasp on the finer point of the art of passing information on to other people that would be the envy of even the likes of Philoctetes and Chiron, let alone ordinary teachers.
Any subject, skill, technique or ability you know, you know how to teach to others several times as fast as normally possible, to the extent that you can cover decades worth of material in months, years at the most.
The curious part about this is that this is not limited to things that can conventionally be taught.
Even techniques or abilities that require specific biological or magical factors can be taught thus, as you can pass on inferior copies of your own abilities to your students. It takes time for them for these copies to grow into proper abilities and potential, but it happens far more quickly than one would think."
800,Well-Rounded Individual,SB Stellaris,"Your citizens are no Masters of One. They are at minimum, half as competent at any job or position as they would be in the job they are most skilled at. More importantly, they have no limit to how skilled they can be in any profession, meaning that a single individual, if left performing a job for long enough, could be capable of handling the duties of multiple people without a problem. The gain on their skills is linear - reaching higher levels of mastery does not come with diminishing returns.
In addition, they never give up gains in skill that they made.

These apply in some form to any empire, nation, civilization, or organization under your control, even if you don’t Import your Empire into that future Jump. The perks will be adapted as needed to actually be relevant towards any organization they are applied to. The party does directly benefit from effects that affect the people in these organizations.
You Do Your Master Proud (Generic Xianxia) (600)
Many kinds of power in the world can be shared and taught to others, and most don't require any sort of special gift to be made good use of. Even if they don't have much talent, a person who invests the time and effort into learning something can be passable, then able, and then even excel at it. Even magic and the soul can be trained. You, however, you are something else entirely.
You are able to teach any learnable skill you possess, even those that may be supernatural in nature, so long as they can be learned and taught rather than innate. Your students advance in their learning by leaps and bounds in their studies under your personal tutelage, acquiring in months what would take others years to obtain. Your students may as well be legends in the making, such is their progress and the results of their training. By the time they have completed their training, they will be just as competent as you are in these skills and will never forget what you have imparted. Your students do not have to be human to benefit, they just have to be capable of learning."
