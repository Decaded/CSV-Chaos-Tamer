Cost,Perk Name,Source,Description
200,Psychonautics,Unsong,"Like the Right Hand of God and the Drug Lord, you can use psychotropics to expand consciousness in ways that shouldn’t be possible. Mind-altering drugs compounded or administered by you are less addictive and ruinous to body and mind in the long run by orders of magnitude, and your users experience minimal diminishing returns.
In addition, you can also use such drugs to serve as powerful vectors for any other mind-altering abilities you have. If you have any abilities or perks that alter or augment your own personality and outlook, you can even formulate drugs to bestow those abilities on other people."
400,Converting the Normals,The Addams Family,"Those that interact with you over long periods of time seem to become more like you in many ways, adopting your morals and perspective on the world and adapting to your culture while still keeping their unique personalities. Close family and friends especially will come to enjoy many or all of the things that you enjoy.
In addition, you can, over an extended period of time, grant such a person one or more of your personal abilities, such as powers, skills or even perks."
400,Knight Errant,Generic Space Opera,"You have the ability to encode a number of your perks and powers into a seed-organ that can be harvested and used to grant the encoded perks to one other person. Gestating such a seed will require a full month per 100 CP worth of perks, and granting perks in excess of 1000 CP will become arduous enough to carry a significant risk for the life of the recipient. In both cases the undiscounted cost of a perk or power is relevant."
400,Gift From a Wizard,FancyFireDrake RWBY,"Ozma has handed out his fair share of gifts over the lifetimes. The Four Maidens, women with the power to control magic, were made by him, same with the Branwen twins and their power to transform into birds. You are capable of something similar now, and may choose to give someone any power you yourself possess. This does come at a price however, as you won't be able to use this power while it is given away, though you may rescind them at any time unlike Ozma."
400,Ritual Maker,Cultist Simulator,"Hard work pays off, and you, jumper, have spent quite some time studying the occult. With this power you can now create rituals through which others may temporarily access your perks or powers. These rituals can involve anything from chants, to performances, to tools, or even reagents, and if you’ve purchased the Rites of Initiation, you may even require one or more Principles from this world to be invoked using Influences or affinity. All rituals must require at least 10 minutes to prepare and cast, but you can otherwise set the terms and conditions freely. Know that after imbuing any power into a ritual, that specific power will be much weaker for a few days, and unless the ritual has stringent conditions, anyone with the appropriate knowledge may use it."
400,Aura of (Perk),(Diablo 1+2),"You can share the effects of a single perk you possess with others. It will take time and practice for the granted blessing to match the benefit you personally gain from it, as well as to increase the range of this ability. At first reaching only a few meters, in time you can gift a perk to all allies in sight. It will take you about a minute or so to change which perk you have chosen to share."
500,Akuma of Your Own,Exalted - Infernals,"An akuma is a mortal or Exalt who has voluntarily submitted to eternal service to the former masters of Creation. Through the Investiture of Infernal Glory they are transformed into powerful slaves of the Yozi. First they are wracked with agonizing pain as pure vitriol from Hell’s heart pours into their body, warping and reshaping it to suit their soon-to-be patron’s twisted aesthetic. Then their mind is reconfigured and memories are edited, the akuma’s life experiences and memories cut apart and reshaped like the artistry of a demented child. Through a process that takes several hours, their body and mind are twisted to better serve their purpose. Yet, this is only the beginning. What comes after are days filled with further agonies as they suffer the violation of their very soul, while their essence is extracted from them and alloyed with vitriol before being returned to their body. This is also the point where the new servant suffers a total loss of self and free will. They will still be sentient in some fashion, but are now unable to defy the Urge they are now instilled with, and must press on relentlessly and obsessively even if situations change. Until their orders change, either by their patron Yozi directive if they are bound to obey, or the reapplication of this process if they are bound to a task.
Still, they are useful tools with all their power. They retain access to almost everything they had before with the exception of those thing antithetical to the Yozi, gain access to the Charms of their Yozi patron, a demonic inheritance to bolster their immediate usefulness, as well as access to sorcery and martial arts one step above their natural potential. So mortal akuma may become Terrestrial sorcerers, Dragon-Blooded can use Celestial sorcery, and Celestial Akuma may initiate into the Adamant Circle in service to the Yozi.
Something similar lies within your power now, as you may create Akuma of yourself. You may take a victim who offered their body, soul and mind out of their own volition, and invest them with access to all your powers in the same way the Akuma of the Yozi have access to their Charms. Their mind, body, and soul is yours to twist and rewrite as you wish throughout the process, and their newfound Urge shall be yours to compose. At the end of it all, you will have a powerful slave with unfaltering loyalty.
Should you later learn The Song of the Shadow, you and the Demon you assign to learn the Investiture of Infernal Glory may create Akuma of yourself as a whole and Akuma limited to your Devil Tiger Charms interchangeably. Furthermore, your deepened understanding of the process by which you pass on your enlightenment, will allow you to create Akuma that retain their free will in addition to their new Urge. In the same manner as the Green Sun Princes do, as they shall suffer the Torment manifestation of your Devil Tiger."
600,A Shadow of My Power,Diabolical,"Your organization is a reflection of yourself, and perhaps fittingly, those that serve you have a pale, shadowed reflection of your Jumper powers. If you have perks that increase your physical strength, your minions – to include Companions - will all be particularly strong. If you have an ability that increases your intelligence, this will be demonstrated in your henchmen. Magical or otherwise supernatural powers or extremely specific knowledge from other Jumps won’t apply to everyone – most are just grunts after all - but anything that could reasonably be passed down to your own army of darkness and utilized by them is fair game. The higher up someone is in your organization, the more powerful their inherited abilities will be, and the more unbelievable – you can’t gift truly superhuman, supernatural, or magical abilities with this perk alone, but your highest ranks will be awe-inspiring all the same, right up against the border of ‘improbable’ and ‘impossible’. Lieutenants and commanders will be significantly more powerful than their underlings, and your second-in-command will be nearly as powerful as you are. You may choose who this does and does not apply to, and can withdraw your blessing at any time."
600,Authority Equals Asskicking,Diabolical,"Your hierarchy is based on ability, a true meritocracy. The closer to the top of your organization a given individual is, the more individually powerful they will be. This will not confer unreasonably supernatural, superhuman, or otherworldly ability upon your lowest ranks of mooks, but will dramatically increase the abilities they already have, and could possibly push certain traits into the realm of humanly impossible if they are high enough in rank and already have an impressive ability in a certain area. This applies to you as well and will boost your power even beyond your standard level if you have a large enough organization, and will always function to some degree so long as you have any number of underlings subject to your authority; as the head of your organization, your power is well above your second-in-command. Stacks with A Shadow of My Power in a manner of your choosing if you have taken it, and can include sharing wholly supernatural, superhuman, otherworldly, or magical abilities with your minions, to include specifying which ranks certain traits/powers begin to appear at. This also allows A Shadow of My Power to work in reverse, and your minions/companions will share their full powers with YOU."
600,Blood Type +,Generic Military,"You are a universal donor and receiver both with blood and plasma and produce much more lifeblood for such purposes without changes to your diet being required. You could give enough of each for eight guys without keeling over, receiving either from any creature that shares your form, and your blood has no shelf life allowing it to be stored indefinitely even in hot temperatures. You are also able to transfer exact copies of any powers or perks you possess via blood with the exact specifications entirely up to you. Abilities thus given to others will grow over time and with use. Note: Blood transfusion is not the only means to pass on any abilities via blood, if you just want to put a few drops in someone’s drink that works too."
600,Divine Boon,Ars Magica,"You naturally spread your realm’s aura in any territory you control. If you are a magical creature, you spread a magical aura; a divine creature spreads a divine aura, etc. The aura’s strength increases slowly with time, though you may halt its growth or decrease its strength if you wish.
In addition, you gain a boon dependent upon your realm affiliation:
If you are affiliated with the divine, you may bless others with your perks. When you grant a blessing, you choose which perk or perks to give, but these cannot be retracted once given. These blessings start out far weaker than the default perk, but the recipient can improve with practice and effort to be at least as strong as you. Granting such a blessing does not cost you the ability that you grant, but can be exhausting in the case of particularly powerful perks or large numbers of perks."
600,Elite Of The Empire,Generic Space Opera,"Maybe it was cybernetic augmentations, gene-mods and hyper-advanced training, invasive brain-surgery, hormone therapy and harsh mental conditioning, maybe you are just that badass. You are able to perform beyond the peak conceivable for your species, at the very least being able to flip a tank with some effort and outrun a bullet. Furthermore, you are impervious to the ravages of time and resistant to extreme environments, such that you could survive even the vacuum of space for a short time. You also possess a variety of senses that augment your capabilities on the battlefield, are capable to operate on vastly reduced amounts of rest and sustenance, and are incredibly proficient at resisting temptations, impulses, torture, and even attempts at mental manipulation, be they mundane or supernatural in kind. Lastly, your morale is guaranteed to never break, no matter the odds you are facing."
600,Open-Sorcery,Unsong,"The Kabbalah is the birthright of man, given to him by God. It should not be hoarded by elites and whored out for money; not when it might be taken up by the common man, so that he might feed his hungry, warm his cold, and make his sick and broken whole again.
You, then, are a living catalyst of revolution, giving power to the people; you can reach out to and tutor anyone, no matter their former background or level of education. Moreover, with God, all things are possible; with enough time and research, you can always discover and develop secret, hidden methods for initiation into otherwise-unlearnable supernatural abilities. The exact nature of your methods will vary based on what they’re meant to teach.
You are providing the key to an otherwise-locked door and drawing out an otherwise-hidden road to power, not directly bestowing power and skill. There’s no guarantee that your methods will be safe or easy, and they will take some time to see benefits, from weeks to decades depending on how esoteric and hidden the supernatural ability in question is. If your methods get out to the world, there’s no telling who could take advantage of them… but that’s a feature, not a bug, right?
(Notes)
The intended purview and purpose of this perk is really for teaching magic to people, including teaching other people how to access various magic systems, and including other systematized supernatural abilities, like psionics and ki, if you like. But, that already includes various powers and power sources that are actually innate or inherited (like e.g. Potterverse magic). If you want to use this perk to “teach” other unlearnable abilities, like bloodlines, innate magical affinities, or specific superpowers and perks, go ahead.
Basically, this is a broad power sharing perk that uses knowledge as a vector and a medium for the power sharing, but gates that power behind an appropriate process of training and/or study before a student can even get their foot in the door. You can choose the purview of this perk (what abilities you can share/teach) based on what best fits your Jumpchain experience; with God, all things are possible, but God works in mysterious ways, almost as if he were an inane narrative conceit.
The only absolute limit I’ll give is that this perk can’t ever be used to teach any abilities that specifically stem from one’s individuality or personality, like a Semblance/Reality Marble/Classpect/Bankai (or whatever the fuck else you’ve picked up on the jumpchain). If you think it’s appropriate, you can teach someone how to use those abilities in the general sense, but you can’t teach in specific; you can teach someone to acquire a Bankai, but you can’t teach them your Bankai, because they’re not you.
Power​ ​Granting​ ​Deal (Sailor Moon)​ ​(400 CP)
You may grant a portion of your power and some of your powers to up to eight willing people at the same time, if you wish. This power is connected to you, and you may take it back any time you wish. However, your power will decrease the more power you give someone. You may also share your powers or other forms with people, but until you take them back you will lack the power you gave. You may, for example, give someone your fire powers or part of your vast wells of magical power or give your excess energy to someone to empower them."
600,Shard Administration,/tg/ Worm,"With this, you’re certainly overstepping the bounds of your nature. Mentally, you’re at all times perfectly aware of all of your perks, abilities, powers, and the like and their status with no conscious effort or attention needed on your part. This is just a side effect however, what this perk truly enables you to do is package such things together either in part or in whole, with whatever additional limitations you might desire to add in, and then temporarily grant this package to anybody you can directly perceive. You can revoke this at any point, returning these abilities back to you none the worse for wear regardless of what happens or has happened to the host, and this will happen automatically in the event of their death or otherwise permanent incapacitation. This comes along with knowledge of how they used these abilities and any potentially creative uses or new tricks they may have learned using them. You lose the abilities as long as they’re given to another person, but no matter what happens you can never truly lose them permanently or have them damaged.
Skill​ ​Book​ ​Crafting​ ​(Generic Isekai) (400 CP)
With the expenditure of a small amount of mana and a five minute ritual, you can copy any skill known by the target of the ritual, including yourself, into an item, usually a book. Anyone can then use the item to gain that skill at base level, but the item is one-use. The target’s skill is not diminished by the ritual, though it requires you to sit unmoving for its full duration, and some means of designating the target, such as a blood sample or line of sight.
​Skill​ ​Sharing​ ​(Sentient​ ​Item)​ (400 CP)
Whenever you kill something, or, if you are merciful, merely beat them within an inch of their life, you may gain one of their skills for yourself. This may be anything from their Sword Mastery or their Singing. If you did not kill your victim, you may choose whether you steal their skill or merely copy it. This effect can only be used once per individual. You may also temporarily copy every skill and ability you have to a single other person, by touching them. They will have all your powers, and know everything you know about how to use them. This wears off after one day, unless you refresh it."
2000,Lip Service,Medaka Box Abnormal,"With naught but a kiss, you’re able to change someone’s life. You can give a person an ability you possess just by kissing them and, if they agree, even take an ability of theirs in exchange for what you gave them. You can take what you gave back with another kiss, though you can only take back what you gave and if what you gave was lost or modified, it will be lost to you. Through this method anyway. Besides, who doesn’t like an excuse to kiss anyway?"
