0,Blood Echoes,Bloodborne,"Blood Echoes, the lingering wills that continue to writhe within spilled blood. You collect these echoes from any foe you slay, bringing them into your body, but may also find congealed amalgamates of these echoes in pools of cold blood. Enemies with incredible minds or numerous kills will provide more echoes. With these echoes, you can empower various facets of yourself, though each time you do so increases the cost in echoes progressively, no matter how you empowered yourself. Blood Echoes may be freely given to others."
0,Soul Gathering,Demon’s Souls,​To the victor goes the spoils. Whenever you slay someone worthy their soul will be dropped nearby for you to pick up. If they aren’t then the weaker souls are automatically picked up. This perk is not mandatory; should you not take it you will not get any souls when any enemies are slain.
0,Level One,Disgaea 1-D2,"You’ve probably heard some interesting things about this world. Angels that can call down meteors that destroy entire continents, magic that can shatter planets like glass, ice cream that never melts! Some of these may be gross exaggerations, but one thing cannot be denied: This is a place of great heroes and villains, even if they’re just silly parodies more than half of the time.
That said, you can have the flashiest, galaxy-destroying lightshow on the planet and it won’t actually do squat for damage to anyone or anything unless you work for it. (You’ll probably be a hit at parties, though!) This place works on RPG logic, not ‘real’ logic. Most humans, demons, and even Angels don’t really bother improving their potential past what you’d consider common for most ‘mooks’ in stories, but the exceptions to this rule are powerful indeed, and more than likely match up to the legends you hear.
Where do you fit in? Well, that depends. Your true potential from perks and powers from this world depends on one thing: experience. Or, to be more accurate, obscene amounts of level grinding! Every perk and class in here come with a set of powers that all depend on your ‘level’, that is, the amount of skill and training you have, in addition to how many powerful foes you’ve defeated from this point on. You start at Level One – fresh but full of potential, with plenty of room for growth! While your level won’t reflect what you gained before now, things that improve training, learning, and fighting ability can speed up your growth a little for each source of ‘help’ you have, though don’t expect to blaze through levels every five seconds. Early levels involve things you’d see in most ‘low-key’ anime or video games, or what you youngsters call ‘peak human’. And from there, the sky's the limit, but you must work and train hard to hope to match things such as powerful demons or Overlord candidates...or worse, actual Overlords, who may be far beyond you if you don’t dedicate every waking minute to grinding like a madman.
Be warned. However you choose to see how power and people work in this world, it goes both ways: Any peak of power you can obtain using these perks can be obtained by others who are dedicated enough. And mark my words: while the common man, Demon, Angel, and Prinny will never come close to you if you work hard enough, you WILL run into main character material that will kick your butt into next week eventually if you get cocky.
How your abilities will manifest will depend on your Features​, which we will get to later. For now, let’s look at the basics!"
0,Mana Burst,Disgaea 1-D2,"‘Mana’ is the life energy in all things, and is where the source of most power from Angels and Demons comes from. It’s most often used for the incredibly flashy abilities that people throw around like candy in battle. In short, this energy and its use is what powers most special attacks or abilities in this world. Though it’s rare for Humans to be able to use it, choosing that as your Species will give you access to this all the same. You start with a fairly small pool of it, enough to create small bursts of power or strength in your attacks, and the occasional finishing move blast. It will steadily recover with rest or standard RPG item use. As you grow in experience and level, your mana pool will grow a bit larger with you, letting you accomplish greater feats.
Exactly what that manifests as is up to you, but note that mana-effects tend to be biased towards flashy, combat-y things, and doesn’t really wander into the world of the conceptual or utility most of the time...with some exceptions. Raw power is where it’s at, here."
100,Gamer’s Party,The Gamer,"This isn’t a companion option exactly, but you now have access to the Gamer’s party system. Benefits here include being able to see your allies’ health bars, a minimap that marks their location, an inter-party chat system, and being able to grant your teammates lesser versions of the Gamer perks, should you possess them. Of course, the sharing only lasts as long as they remain in the party and you may only Party with a maximum of eight people at a time. You may buy this more than once, increasing the maximum party size by 8 each time. The first purchase of this is free for [Player Two]​."
100,Level Up!,Mario & Luigi,"By taking this perk, your growth now follows that of the level up system used in the M&L series. After winning a battle, you and your party will get exp. After gaining a certain amount of exp, you’ll level up, and gain a boost in stats. But this series also added the ability to let you add a few extra points in a stat of your choosing with each level up. The stats this system follows are health, BP, power, defense, speed, and flex. Health, power, defense, and speed are all self explanatory, BP is another way of saying your energy storage, like mana, and flex is a certain part of your body like a moustache or horns that basically takes the form of a luck stat which will determine your chances at critical hits, item drops, and discounts at shops. Oddly enough, the flex stat is also the only stat that doesn’t increase without the extra points."
100,Rank Up!,Mario & Luigi,"After getting a certain amount of level ups, you’ll eventually get what is called a rank up. These work a little bit differently than level ups. Instead of increasing your stats, it instead allows you to select a rank up bonus, something like giving you more EXP after each battle or reducing the mana cost of your special attacks. Also, it seems there exist shops in this world that offer high quality gear but only sell to those with a high enough rank. Perhaps there will be shops like these in other worlds as well?"
100,Shine Brighter,Paper Mario,"Many heroes have power granted to them, while most sidekicks have to work for it. Luckily there are a few shortcuts out there. There are Shine Sprites, golden entities formed in the sun’s image, and you know the method to improve the racial abilities of yourself and others by channelling their power. This upgrade can be applied twice, each time doubling the powers of the trait affected. Your presence will cause shine sprites to spawn in later worlds you visit, regardless of that you will have to search and collect shine sprites before you can use them."
200,Centaur Heart,Hades,"A large heart-shaped crystal filled with vital power. When it is used, it grants a significant bonus to health and vitality, making the user much harder to injure. It can be used repeatedly, though with some diminishing returns, and it replenishes every three days after use."
200,Soul Growth,Dark Souls 1,"Souls, the lifeblood of the world, the lifeline of the undead. They’re also a vital resource though, especially in the hands of one such as yourself.
On purchase, you are able to use ‘souls’ as a resource while resting near a bonfire or normal fire to develop your soul or the soul of someone resting with you, artificially facilitating growth in any of their basic capabilities. Strength, dexterity, stamina, even intelligence or luck can be enhanced in this manner.
These individual pops of growth matter little individually, but may stack up over time to make someone greater than they ordinarily could be. Initial uses of this ability on someone cost few ‘souls’, but price builds over time no matter how it’s used on the same person.
(Notes)
Most abilities that would require “souls” may also use sufficient amounts of spiritual energy of a
greater cost compared to the cost in souls."
300,Falna,Reddit Danmachi,"The blessings of a god or goddess are given to you. Your abilities, as well as any skills you develop, are portrayed upon your back and your God/Goddess can update them for you. Each level up potentially allows you to gain a developmental ability and gain skills every time you gained a new greater goal, realization, enlightenment or conviction allowing you to potentially gained a new skills based on those.
For 300cp would upgrade the Falna that you received that guaranties that you would gain a developmental ability and skill every time you level up and after this jump the perks, abilities and skills that you gained from the past to the future would be translated and displayed into a skill, magic and developmental ability that you can improve along with the Falna automatically updates periodically. You can also view your Falna in your mind or let others see your back to view your status along with it automatically integrates any existing System that you have access gained all of the advantages and discarding as much weakness and drawbacks as possible.
The one that would give you the Falna is the God/Goddess of the Familia that you choose in the Familia Section and if you are a God/Goddess you can give yourself a Falna even it’s not possible in canon or the companion that took the God/Goddess Origin. After this jump you are given an option on either retaining this System or not and if you choose to abandon this System all the developmental ability, magic and skills that you have would become a perk allowing you to use them without the assistance of the Falna."
300,Ascension,Fate/Grand Order,"Just because a Servant has been summoned, does not mean that they are summoned at their full potential. Each hero has a great deal of power left to unlock and the process of Ascension is the method to do so. By offering up rare materials and a large amount of magical energy in crystallised form, you can force a being to Ascend to the next stage of being for them. This increases their maximum power to allow them to grow more, changes their appearance to show the upgrade and also unlocks a new ability or power for them such as new Skills for Servants. This process can be done many times, even beyond the normal limit of 4 for you, but each one requires progressively more difficult to obtain ingredients and exponentially more massive amounts of magical energy to support the transformation. New abilities are also only obtained at every second Ascension after the first. You can use the Ascension process on yourself or non-Servant beings as well.
Blessed by the Goddess (Legend of Zelda - Breath of the Wild) (600 CP)​
The Goddess is watching, and she is pleased with your achievements. When you manage to defeat a particularly powerful enemy, or when you succeed in traveling through a tough dungeon or labyrinth, you will be gifted with either a Heart Container or Stamina Vessel. Either of these items can be used to improve a person’s health or stamina, though there are limits to how far a person without this perk can be boosted (10x base health level and 3x base stamina). With the perk, the limits are higher, though you will hit a level of diminishing returns eventually."
400,Mirror of Night,Hades,"A large pitch-black mirror that reflects the souls of those who look within. When this has been bonded to you by holding your reflection, you will be able to find drops of raw darkness out in the world, and can use those drops to improve yourself in various ways. How you are able to improve depends on your individual abilities.
(Word of God)
Anyone can use it, but they will have to be shown it for darkness to show up for them, collect their own 'darkness', and their purchases will be separate from yours."
400,Ultra Rank,Paper Mario,"You have been infused with the power of the ultra stone. This allows you to overcome the limitations of the Shine Brighter perk, allowing one to use shine sprites to enhance racial abilities even further. These enhancements can effectively be used infinitely, but they quickly began to produce diminished returns. Regardless, an individual from this world who relies solely on this path to power could keep up with many of the heroes and villains in this realm."
500,Main Character,Disgaea 1-D2,"You’re not just anyone, you’re a protagonist! The star! The shining beacon of hope or despair! The one people constantly complain about on the internet and wish one of your companions took the lead instead! Well, screw them. You’ve even got a unique portrait to show for it. Your weight and importance to this world gives you the ability to unlock the same potential within others – in exchange for a considerable but temporary decrease in your power and energy reserves, you may unlock the potential within others – effectively granting them the Level One perk as well as the free version of Mana Burst. They will have none of the skill or training available from beings in this world – but with a certain handsome Jumper training them hard enough, they can now reach greater heights of skill and power. It doesn’t completely remove their limitations – but that particular ceiling is now much, MUCH higher. This also unlocks the true potential of the various abilities of the realms…"
600,A Falna’s Blessing,Reddit Danmachi,"As a god you have the ability to grant Falna to others individuals that you want with a short ritual allowing them
to improve their basic abilities, gain developmental ability and skills like any other adventurer. Though the rate
of their improvement depends on how diligent and dictated they are. If you are a god your imported companions may start as members of your familia and gained their Falna from you but you must personally update their status if they want to rise up in abilities as they lack the ability to update the Falna themselves during this jump and anyone given a Falna in the future has the ability to automatically updates itself. If you are not a god you still have the ability to grant Falna to others though the gods would question on how you can do it if they catch a wind of it. You can also give yourself a Falna if you want to be an adventurer yourself even you are a god. The Falna that you bestow others and yourself automatically integrates any existing System that you have access gained all of the advantages and discarding as much weakness and drawbacks as possible."
600,​Gamer’s Body,The Gamer,"The counterpoint to Gamer’s Mind, the Gamer’s Body is the physical equivalent. Where Gamer’s Mind prevents things like paralyzing fear and other negative mental effects, Gamer’s Body protects the body. Giving you the body of a videogame character, this  allows you to resist actual physical damage in exchange for using a HP system instead.
Benefits include being completely healed after a good night’s sleep, being utterly resistant to physical damage (except in terms of HP loss), and earning exp whenever you kill something. You can punch something so hard your arm breaks, but two seconds later it will be fine again and you’ll be down some HP. And with the stat points you get upon leveling up, you can just up your strength (or endurance or vitality or dexterity) and make your arm harder to break."
600,Gamer’s Mind,The Gamer,"As an ordinary person dragged into the Abyss, the ability to keep your cool is virtually priceless. With the flip of a mental switch, you can enter a state of mind in which panic, fear, rage, and other extreme emotions cannot exist for more than a few seconds. But order now, and we’ll also throw in immunity to just about every mental effect you can think of. Hypnosis? Immune. Sleep spells? Immune. Perception filters? Immune. Earworms and other memetic hazards? Immune.
In addition, you gain the videogame interface, though this will be less than 100% useful without the other Gamer perks. This also unlocks a quest system, allowing you to gain additional exp for every predesignated action - something like do your homework, go to school, or collect twenty bear asses. Whenever someone has a task for you, a question mark will appear above their head and you’ll receive a pop-up indicating that they have a task for you to perform.
Whenever someone offers you a quest, be it to do the dishes or fetch tofu from the store, you’ll gain a sense of what rewards performing this task will entail, including cash, exp, items, and or relationship status changes. Experience, regardless of whether or not you’re [Player Two]​, can be used to level your mental stats ([INT], [WIS], [LUK]... [Willpower]) if you buy this. The more powerful you are, the more experience it takes to gain a noticeable increase in power, but as you grow more powerful, perhaps you’ll be able to tackle harder quests. If you have Gamer’s Skill or Gamer’s Body, you can also spend experience there."
600,​Gamer’s Skills,The Gamer,"A wizard’s most valuable asset should be his mind and the knowledge contained therein. Whenever you come into contact with a book that contains instructions on how to perform any skill you don’t currently have, you will be given the option to ‘eat it’, thereby imparting you the knowledge you would have gained from reading it front to back, and then contemplating on it for a short time. However, this will only work once per book and will not work for theory texts.
In addition, your skills will level with use, and eventually evolve into better ones at level one hundred. A simple mana chain spell might become far more powerful and versatile, and eventually it may very well rename itself ‘Enkidu’."
600,Inner Self,Demon’s Souls,"Much like the Maiden, you can use the souls of great beasts, heroes, or villains to give others a part of their powers. Beware, though, for the nature of the soul can change the person you are using it on. Weaker souls can only upgrade someone’s abilities. You can use this on yourself."
600,Soulbound Weapon,Dragon Sword,"A longstanding companion, your own “Enkidu”, you are joined by a sentient weapon with a potent and latent power. This weapon is currently slumbering, giving you a basic potential in a Job of your choice, granting the 100-point perks for your chosen Job. As it feeds on conflict and strife, it can ‘level up’ to eventually grant you more and more of a job’s abilities until you reach Mastery of the job. When you reach Mastery in a job, it ‘reproduces’, creating another weakened copy of itself. Occasionally, this copy will mutate into an item that acts as a Soulbound Weapon for a random Job – though a weapon can only reach Mastery once, so its prodigy will have to be the one to birth another Weapon. Truly a unique friend to have."
