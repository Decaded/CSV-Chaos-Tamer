Cost,Perk Name,Source,Description
100,Body Mod Pod,Personal Reality Supplement,Ever wanted to run a Companion or friend through the Body Mod? Now you can. Have fun. This pod is infinitely reusable as long as each person only uses it once. People using this get access to the same Body Mod Supplement as you used. You can’t use this to run yourself through Body Mod again. Anything that lacks a humanoid form can be given one by this machine.
100,Medicine,Battle Angel Alita,"You have the skills of a surgeon, first-responder and pharmacist, all roughly bundled together with a lot of hands-on experience with the worst injuries the wasteland has to offer. Your hands are steady, your focus unperturbed by the sight and stench of gore and viscera, and you have the precise and quick reflexes necessary to swat a fly with a scalpel. You also have a fair bit of experience with slightly inhuman and mutated physiology, and are very quick to pick up on new techniques and tools.
You also have the Medic and Civilian equipment package and one purchase of Money for free."
100,Strange Formula,MCU - Part 1,"This chemical formula is the brainchild of the German scientist Dr. Erskine, and is directly responsible for the
creation of Captain America. As is, this is only the formula, and you must make it yourself... but as a result it could possibly let you modify the serum for other uses. Beware its tendencies to amplify the personality traits of the user, or be prepared to find a way to fix that fact."
200,Adjuster,/tg/ Sekirei,You know how to perform surgery to bolster (150%) or weaken (50%) the natural and inherited abilities and traits of others. Natural limits might be there for a reason though...
200,Extremis Formula,MCU - Part 1,"Another attempt at creating super soldiers, this formula creates a virus that can enhance a person to superhuman strength, reflexes, and endurance. Additionally, normal Extremis users gain the ability to generate extreme amounts of heat through a complex metabolic process, generating heat from their bodies up to several thousand degrees Celsius on any part of the body they desire. When regenerating body parts, the wounds take on the appearance of burning ashes while growing back the lost body part, in a matter of minutes, and cooling into regular skin, flesh, and bone. Be wary however, as this makes you light up on thermal sensors, and should your body heat up too much, you may end up exploding. Keep this in mind."
200,Hollow Queen,Valeria Bleach,"Every hollow is made of hollows, an ever-growing hive of lost souls. For most, this hive eventually condenses into a singular complete being with the transformation into an Arrancar or it tears itself apart if the leading soul cannot maintain their position and devolution begins. You’ve found another way to make use of the souls within, releasing them as new hollows under your command. Formed as either true Hollows from souls you have eaten and contain within or as blank beings from significantly more raw spiritual energy who have intelligence but lack personality, it makes for a quick and easy army if you have the resources to spare. Most of these hollows are not of the Menos class, meaning they are fodder to even decently capable Shinigami, but enough spiritual energy can make it possible to produce Gillian or even higher stages of Hollow. An army of Gillian from nowhere is a serious threat to anything short of a captain."
200,Psychoscope,Prey,"The Psychoscope is an advanced scanning tool developed by Morgan Yu to gather information about the Typhon. It is able to provide an experienced user specialised information about the aliens which can be used to develop new Neuromods. The device was built around the Typhon, though can be used on humans and robots.
It will require an updated if you want to use it to scan new biologist, which can be built with the right skills. A Psychoscope can support 8 chipsets at a time, not including its core scanning hardware and has a stock range of about 10 meters."
200,ADAM Slugs,Bioshock 2,"Ugly as they are, these deep sea slugs glow with the bright red of ADAM in their veins. They naturally produce the raw material, which can be harvested from them and easily refined into the necessary building blocks for Plasmids and Tonics. However, harvesting the slugs directly yields very little ADAM and would require dozens to generate a single new Plasmid. But it is what it is. It’s not like you would implant them in little girls and then harvest their blood for larger amounts of ADAM. That would be monstrous. The slugs come in a small aquarium that won’t need maintenance to keep them alive and will refill to contain six slugs every week. Just keep the lid on. They like to wander."
200,The Next Generation,Seven Deadly Sins,"All Demons may empower others by allowing them to drink the blood running through their bodies, turning them into partial demons named Reactors, though without a strong will or with the command of certain dark spells, they will just twist into terrible demonic wretches that attack all life blindly. You have gained an enhanced form of this blood-linked ability. You may pass on any biological powers, even supernatural biology, to those who drink your blood without the risk of madness or corruption or death. The more they drink, the closer their new powers will be to your own level with them. This even extends to other blood based sharing, removing the risk of sickness, incompatibility or other forms of degradation."
200,Specialized Alchemy (Chimera Alchemy),SB Fullmetal Alchemist,"You’ve spent years studying alchemy, and are probably a State Alchemist. Of course to get to that level, there has to be at least something that distinguishes you from the rest. With this perk, minding the rules and limitations of Alchemy, you too have a specialized focus in your alchemical pursuits. This can be one of the canon ones that your In-Jump origin simply recreated through study, or an entirely new one that’s unseen. Whether it’s the transmutation of Chimera, the creation of flames, transmuting iron and steel weapons and artillery-whatever suits your needs and wouldn’t be too far out of line for the State Alchemists we see in the show. This can be taken more than once."
300,Balance Formula,/tg/ Worm,"Several containers with a strange liquid solution inside, of an element used to stabilize Cauldron vials at the cost of their potential power. These are special though. When mixed in with serum, formulas, or used in any other such procedure meant to grant people powers or enhance them in some manner it will greatly increase the stability and compatibility while ensuring that mutations or other side effects are at worst minor and trivially dealt with, and with minimal loss of power. The containers effectively contain a limitless amount, refilling whenever you wish them to, and will return to you or your warehouse if lost or destroyed."
300,Cybernetics,Battle Angel Alita,"You have a broad theoretical and practical knowledge of cybernetics and related engineering systems, and can recognize most systems with a glance. The most difficult repairs and programming come naturally to you, custom designs and components that would take an entire research team a month can be jotted down in an hour or so of casual work.
The most common form of cyborg in the Scrapyard has an armoured braincase piloting a robotic body, but you’re familiar with the organic-inorganic connection technology and can create partial cybernetics as well as organ replacements for those who do not wish to lose their bodies – in effect, you are fully capable of the design construction and application behind the Transhuman and Motorball cyborg perks.
In addition, you have the Cyber-Doctor equipment package and one purchase of Money for free.
Transhuman (Battle Angel Alita)
You have what amounts to entry-level cyborg systems in the Scrapyard. This can either be a basic full body prosthetic, aesthetically unappealing and lacking in both sensory fidelity (around 70% on a good day) and power (4x as strong, about as fast as a peak human), or a higher quality partial bionic replacement (6x peak human) that leaves the majority of your body alone.
Motorball (Battle Angel Alita)
This represents a professional cyborg chassis, suitable for competition in the various cyborg sports leagues, of which Motorball is only one. Its baselines are vastly superior (~15x peak human) and extremely difficult to control for those who don’t take the time to adapt.
Comes in many different specialisations, which may be retained and adapted to more advanced bodies:
Racing – Has high-speed wheeled feet - up to 250kph. Discount for non-TUNED weapons under 300CP.
Arena – One-on-one combat body, has integrated Heavy Armour and a free non-TUNED weapon under 300CP.
Giant – Much larger than human, strength is doubled and agility halved, free integrated Armour.
With Transhuman: Discount/Free becomes a cost reduction of 300CP for any non-TUNED weapon, which can be split up in 50CP increments, and two purchases of Money. Baseline of 20x peak human."
300,Echoes of the Emerald Forge,Exalted - Modern,"One cannot speak of power without mentioning Malfeas’ impossible emerald heart. A prince among demons and masterful wonder worker you may become even more familiar with later… should you dare. In the past, you had the enviable privilege of being given a masterclass by him in both the combination of modern science with spiritual energy that has allowed the Infernals to make human civilization the dominant power of Creation, and ancient feats of artifice lost to the modern era. With this, you know how to design the geomantic structures for secret prayer mills that feed power to the Yozis-or perhaps, yourself with minor adjustments. Constructing engines that can seal off death-tainted realms of existence or growing a demonic bioweapon are old hat to you. You know how to create many methods of travelling swiftly around the universe similar to the typical means of the Infernal Exalted, encompassing both artifice and sorcery as well as many wondrous marriages of both. But so is the forgotten art of forging demon souls into more archaic weapons and armour, or the schema to recreate monsters of myth long lost to Creation’s memory like Oliphem: A giant of stone and iron who can walk on the sea or sink to its bottom freely and without harm, and has a great light-casting lens in his face that can guide ships or sear enemies. The doomsday devices you could build with this beggar imagination.
Your skill with genetic engineering and human enhancement with divine components is particularly outstanding, and you can singlehandedly perform the process that infuses human embryos with blood cells extracted from imprisoned Elemental Dragons to create new Dragonblooded from birth. Perhaps in time, you’ll discover ways to modify or improve the Terrestrial Exaltation that shall be discovered by you with time and effort. Or apply such modifications to other Exaltations provided you have the correct reagents, rituals and technology.
With some innovation, in time it might even be possible to live up to the Infernal lie of human potential by creating a serum that can turn an adult into a Dragonblood. After all, you already know the foundational theories and proven techniques that can alter Exaltations: To cut away the machine-flesh and divine ichor of Autochthon away and infuse it into a Lunar Exaltation, melding it’s evolutionary potential with the modular mechanism of god-machinery to transform it into an Alchemical Exaltation. Similar procedures and the theoretical framework to tamper with these divine superweapons are known to you, and you have an excellent grounding for altering other Exaltations. Your understanding of the Exaltation’s underlying structure, composition and the crafts with which it can be tampered with is exemplary even for an Infernal.
Last but not least all three circles of sorcery have been drilled into you, including many spells unique to the Yozis themselves. Some of these great powers can create magically reinforced silence that even prevent spoken spells from being cast in their area of influence, and the corruption of lands to favour the Yozis as well as their servants and Total Annihilation: A mere fleck of Ligier’s flame that deals great destruction with green hellfire."
300,Field of Heart-Shaped Herbs,MCU - Part 2,"Out of all the Wakandan secrets that lie within the borders of the reclusive city, this one is the most potent secret of them all. It is also the most dangerous. It is a small but potent field, its soil infused with radiation from the ancient Vibranium meteor when it fell to such an extent that it would affect any plant life growing within it, like these herbs. The herbs are taken and ground up so that it may be imbibed, and when the imbiber is buried under a light covering they will find themselves on a spiritual journey to talk with their ancestors... and then rise a greater warrior. Strength and speed that reaches the lower levels of superhuman, durability to survive explosions with minor injuries. Perfect coordination and balance with agility that far outstrips Olympic athletes. It would not be too farfetched to say that the results of this herb match even the ones derived from the Super Soldier formula that made Captain America... and now you have a small field of these plants. Be very careful. After you leave, this can either be a property or a Warehouse Attachment."
300,Plasmids Are The Paint,Bioshock 2,"ADAM flowed through every vein in Rapture to some degree. Plasmids were a force that could sway the entire
economy with each new formula released. Suchong and Tenenbaum were certainly the two spearheading development, but they were not the only ones. There was an entire field of geneticists tinkering in their labs on how best to mix the human genome like a cocktail. You were one of these minds. You have a decade of practical experience playing and modifying genetics, but are particularly skilled when it comes to creating Plasmids and Tonics. While you are by no means a world-changing genius like the two greats previously mentioned, you are more than capable of creating your own ADAM-based products given a lab and supply of the substance. What you do with this knowledge is entirely up to you."
400,Art of Blood,Mother of Learning,"Most if not all noble houses have either fiddled with it at some point, or married someone who did, in order to gain a fancy, heritable power. This power is now yours; you have comprehensive training, skill, and knowledge of Blood Magic and its applications in creating bloodlines. You can go straight to the heart of the matter and 'build' a new bloodline based on a creature's abilities, devise a ritual to imbue it into yourself or others, and have it become hereditary. You could give rise to an entire new 'noble house' all by yourself. Do take note that this is not without risks or drawbacks, as potent abilities have equally large drawbacks, such as mana requirements; creatures with immensely powerful abilities are, effectively, trapped in high mana environments as they require more mana than their souls produce, and 'starve' otherwise. Giving yourself the power of a dragon is a good way to be unable to leave the Dungeon for longer than a couple of hours."
400,Bio-Injector,Symbiote,"A Bio-Injector is a bio-organic device containing a blank, non-synergized Symbiote, completely lacking in personality; whereas normally, a Bio-Injector would erase its contents upon use, this one is specifically modified to skip this process, rendering it indefinitely reusable, and has had the Berzerker Protocol removed. It also modifies its own programming to the genetic code of whatever it's injected into, allowing you to make Symbiotes of even non-humans, though they do still need the 90% predictive rate typically required of Symbiotes. This is a good thing, though; Symbiotes are AI and, baseline, have a relatively alien mentality, and, without the ability to predict human interactions might take a harmless joke for a serious threat on their host's life and attack the person that made it, potentially killing them. In case it wasn't obvious, people that you turn into the Host of a fully synergized Symbiote pair have the option of becoming a Companion if they're willing to come with you; it should be noted, though, that this 90% predictive rate takes, at minimum, five to eight years, even with the knowledge that it should be predicting its host, and could easily take in excess of a decade, depending on the person in question.
Biotechnology (Battle Angel Alita) (600 CP)There’s really more to cybernetics than just the metal machine. Care has to be taken that the flesh adapts, and there are many lessons to be learned from biological machinery. You’re an expert in the fields of genetics, biophysics, toxicology, neuropharmacology and biochemistry – the causes and effects of human mutation are very familiar to you.
Designer drugs, experimental surgery, toxins, cures – improved soft organs and cutting-edge research into cloned nervous system material, with a laboratory the human body is your masterpiece. You may create a variety of drugs similar to that referenced in the Werewolf perk, or directly induce it and Warped as a permanent mutation.
If you also have the Cybernetics perk, then with a little time and the right equipment – quite difficult to obtain in the Scrapyard – you may also apply the equivalent of the TUNED perk to a subject, and have additional knowledge of weapons engineering to reverse-engineer or independently develop most current weapons systems available in the Scrapyard.
Warped (Battle Angel Alita)The ravages of the wasteland brought mostly radiation poisoning and disease. Those lucky enough to find shelter made it through with minimal genetic damage, and stepped out to reclaim the world from the sickly few who had to survive in the wilds – and so the majority of humanity in this day and age are little different from before the end. But by some tenacious vitality, enough of those damned survivors made it through the fallout and long winter to pass their damage on to a new generation. Over time, the worst of it was bled out – leaving you. Mostly human, but with a few traits that stand out.
You might be almost twice as strong, or fast, or have thick and powerful claws – but it doesn’t compare to the power of a cyborg. The advantage is that you don’t depend on maintenance, and you can actually use your full potential – your brain can keep up perfectly with the speed and power of your body.Werewolf (Battle Angel Alita)A catch-all term for a wide spectrum of biological mutations, originally referring to a mutagenic combat drug that resulted in extreme muscular hypertrophy, accelerated nerve impulses and a rather hirsute appearance. There are still some users of such drugs, where the improved reflexes and relative stealth make up for the accumulating physical damage. In your case, you may be descended from one of the bloodlines that inspired the research, or due to a lucky quirk adapted to the drug. You can switch from a mostly human form, into a large, intimidating warform with less than a minute of concentration. Remaining in either form is effortless – but the actual transformation does heavily strain your system.In human form, you’re six times stronger, three times as fast and heal a thousand times quicker. Your warform triples that – most non-fatal injuries will be completely healed in a few hours, but you require huge amounts of food to maintain it and when pushed your metabolism runs hot enough to burn. You aren’t terribly resistant to damage though – your skin is only as tough as leather. In both forms your senses are at least peak human.
The cosmetics of your condition are up to you. You might have thermal vision, tough scales and snakes for arms, or slow chameleonic skin with tentacles for legs and a cartilaginous skeleton immune to most holds. Whatever the case, some small signs of this will show in your human form, though they can be easily hidden.TUNED (Battle Angel Alita)This is cybertechnology beyond the capabilities of the Scrapyard. Tiphares keeps a very tight lid on anything that challenges their authority, and in reaction to the potential threat of Den and Barjack – more for stirring up the population than out of fear – will eventually dispatch TUNED agents based on Alita’s body and skills. Baselines are around 20x peak human, and they have a discount on the TUNED equipment package.With Motorball: 200CP bonus to spend on Companions. Baseline of 30x peak human."
400,Demigod Atelier,Asura’s Wrath,"You know the secret science of Mantra technology, and can build custom devices that are powered
by prayer or emotion. Further, you can enhance or upgrade items from other jumps to use this same power
source. If you take Cyborg Hindu Godbody, you may construct Demigod cybernetics for other people. After
the jump concludes, you may also build Mantra Reactors.
Demigod Atelier allows you to create any mantra-­powered or integrated device, up to and including
the vast fleets of Shinkoku Tratstrium, the heavenly vessels of the divine armies, and even the anti-­Gohma
platform Brahmastra. The latter however would require millennia of effort, and was never completed even in
the scope of the original setting."
400,Cyborg Hindu Godbody,Asura’s Wrath,"You have a genetically, cybernetically and magically enhanced physiology, and the knowledge to
propagate this technology. Your capacity to wield Mantra is enhanced, both accepting general Mantra as well as your primary association.
This constructed body can heal itself, or be repaired by yourself or others. Your magical physiology is
obvious, but always aesthetically pleasing. You can survive in space without a suit, endure planet­-busting attacks with sufficient Mantra, and are otherwise ageless.
This increases your maximum Mantra Level by 2.
Mantra Reactor (Asura’s Wrath)
The most advanced personal mantra device is installed in your cyborg body, further amplifying your ability to wield Mantra. Assuming you can arrange for it, you are capable of wielding more than a civilization's worth of focused Mantra without hurting yourself.
You gain a new Mantra Form: Mantra [Your Name]. Increases your Maximum Mantra Level by 3."
400,Life Sciences,Valeria Bleach,"Some believe that each species is but a component of a greater whole, that hybrids who draw on multiple sources of power ascend to a higher dimension of existence. How true that is may be unclear but the concepts behind the mixing of the races pays worthy dividends. You’re well versed in the science of species, from simply biological knowledge to a wide variety of ways to combine or infuse their unique powers. The science behind the various methods involved as well as the technology to make it happen feels natural to you, allowing you to rapidly make progress in the field.
You’re able to successfully cross-breed entirely separate species even despite biological incompatibilities. Adding the spiritual nature or make-up of a Hollow into a Shinigami, or vice versa, is a complicated but quite possible process. Analysing and understanding the unique abilities of a newly discovered race is simple, while you even have the potential to find ways to bind unique racial abilities into devices or consumable items. A pill to temporarily hollowfy a Shinigami for anti-Quincy combat, perhaps? The potential of life is limitless, when you have such varieties of life to draw on."
400,Like the Rising Moon,Rise Of The Guardians,"The Guardians, both as a group and as individuals, did not come into being ex nihilo. The group was founded by the Man in the Moon, and its members became Spirits because of the Man in the Moon as well. When you share a goal with someone, you may gradually feed them energy to make them stronger and better able to accomplish the goal. The more they’re devoted to the goal, the faster their growth. Eventually, after enough time has passed, they will evolve into a Spirit, and their growth will have gained enough momentum that even without your influence it will only be a century until they gain the power of a Guardian. This can apply to even the souls of the recently departed, though they will not be able to interact with the world until they are Spirits in full. Usually it would take a few years of regular interaction with a person to get them to the point of evolving into a Spirit; who knows how short it might be if they could be fed energy even when far from you?"
400,Medical and Biological Science,/tg/ Worm,"You know how to cure cancer, AIDS, and pretty much everything else. The working of flesh and bone is casual to you, with even the most difficult procedures capable of being performed half asleep and blind in one eye as easily as you breathe. You're the perfect medic and doctor, but your skills and knowledge extend much further then that. You could create some truly incredible monsters if you wanted to, whether out of whole cloth or test subjects. Let's not even get started on biological warfare. Biology and anything to manipulate or interact with it are all within your capabilities. From genetic engineering, to human enhancement, to even cloning with the
proper samples and resources."
400,Multi-Faceted Exalted Demiurge,Exalted - Alchemicals,"The secrets of the Alchemical Exaltation are granted only to the chosen Demiurges of the Autochthon and no other. Not even the Alchemical Champions or the Solar Host are privy to the secrets of their creation. Normally, in the creation of an Alchemical you need five Demiurges, each privy to merely one-fifth of the Exaltation process and imbued with the Autochthons power bound only to that specific step. Such precautions were taken to prevent the betrayal of his children, such was the Great Maker’s fear, anger and wisdom. You are not from this realm however, and are not at fault for the sins of the mortals, gods, and chosen of Creation.
A mortal mind may only be able to understand one step of the Alchemical Exaltation process but what of the Chosen. They perhaps could understand far more and so you shall. I can grant you a spark of the Autochthons primordial energy with which you can enact the miracle of Alchemical Exaltation. You will be able to understand and initiate the entire process and even innovate on it. If you were to find new Magical Metals in your travels it might be possible to create new castes of Alchemical with their own unique qualities and traits.
It might even be possible to not merely use the soul gems of the dead but to be able to uplift the living like that of other Celestial Exaltations. Sufficiently advanced automatons or heroic individuals will be able to be converted into Alchemicals, however they may not be suitable to all castes, but the invention of instruments to determine their compatibility with a Magical Material would not be difficult given the wisdom that the Autochthon has seen fit to grant you.
(Notes)
With HeavensAnon’s permission, this does connect with capstone boosted Mind of the Sun effectively acting as some notes and advice on how to make Exaltations other than Alchemical."
400,Room of Transformation,Valeria Bleach,"Ordinarily, the process of transforming from a Hollow into an Arrancar is one of extreme risk. The removal of a Hollow’s mask will usually cause their death, but may under rare circumstances allow them to awaken to a minor increase in power and stability of form. The Hogyoku in Aizen’s hands was able to drastically reduce the risks of producing Arrancar, while radically increasing the benefits. In Aizen’s hands, Hollows became far stronger after the transformation, having more of their innate potential unlocked and made available. While you do not have the Hogyoku, you now find yourself in possession of a room with the ability to produce a similar effect. In this room, using a small command device, you may transform Hollows into Arrancar at the same efficiency as the dream stone would, stabilizing their form and unlocking a great deal of strength. This may also be used on other distorted or mutated beings to produce similar results."
400,Scrolls on the Shaman Growth Hormone,Samurai Deeper Kyo,"Within these dozen scrolls is an extensive research into beings who naturally are born with the potential to manipulate spiritual energy innately. Included in these documents is the recipe for Crime Monster and various other experiments on the human anomalies known as Shaman. If you’ve the stomach for it, this research could be used as a springboard into supernatural powers development as well as other subjects."
400,Shards of a Star,Samurai Deeper Kyo,"Where are you getting these? Shards of crystalline material and rough stone, seemingly melded together, in a small bag. These are Shards of a Star that fell upon a Battle of Sekigahara that never happened. They radiate a strange form of energy and if a shard of the crystalline material is inset into the flesh of a human they will slowly become a Kenyo, a monster who gains supernatural powers and a beastial form, over the course of a year or two. What you do with this stuff is up to you. Refills a week after all the material has been used up. Beware Kenyo are highly susceptible to the attraction of evil for reasons unknown."
400,Stone Mask,JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure,"Stone artifacts made from the dawn of man, crafted by the hands of the Pillar-Men who sought ways to protect their people from the sun’s rays. Instead, the Stone Masks were what created the creatures now known as Vampires. The Stone Mask works as follows: while worn, the wearer of the Mask has to stab a victim to obtain warm blood. From there, the blood has to be smeared across the mask’s surface. Tendrils of stone extend
from the mask’s edge at that point, and stab through the skull of the wearer to pierce the brain. From there, the mask’s dark magick twists the body of the wearer into a cruel mockery of both life and death, a twisted predator in human flesh. Mask Vampires are atypical from vampires of other worlds, but are powerful nontheless. What you will do with this twisted instrument even I cannot fathom: Be wary."
400,Theoretical Recreation,Bloodborne,"Great Ones, existences impossible to fully understand in their entirety, at least by the undeveloped human mind. But even for an unenlightened one, a Great One can be studied, researched, understood to some extent. Curious that you seem more apt than most at this.
When it comes to studying the anatomy of the eldritch, the divine, and the otherworldly, you would have few peers even amongst Byrgenwerth’s storied scholars. You have the capacity to study such things, derive more information than most, with less mental deterioration, and push humanity’s limits.
What’s more, the greater you understand the inner workings of such lifeforms, the easier it becomes to replicate notable properties of such things in more familiar, mundane beings. Still, it could take years to begin figuring out how to bring man to the level of Great Ones, if starting from scratch anyways."
400,Yajnatek Mysteries,Grant Morrison’s 18 Days,"In ancient fires, and with flesh screaming, a blood price can be paid to merge body with arcane songs and hammer blows. You know the ancient rituals and mantras involved in making the very greatest works possible, things like the Astras, Celestial Armors or Weapons, or other miraculous crafts. From the sutras needed to get gods to bless things to the exact schematics for the greatest and most terrible weapons, your knowledge could save the world... or cause it to die screaming.
Nor are the Astras the limit of your power. It’s a little known secret that the Superwarriors, the perfect Demigods that stride the world, were engineered in the Second Age, enhanced through genetics, psionic and magical technology, blessed with divine powers and magic, and countless other measures besides. All of these secrets lie within your knowledge now, just waiting to be made reality.
One thing to note, oh Great One. Even the least of the things you know will take tremendous, utterly horrific quantities of time, energy, and personal effort to make, such that even the greatest kingdoms of this era would struggle to put together, barring surprises on your end. And while your knowledge does mean you can make these things, it does not necessarily let you branch out or apply the same principles to other things, being essentially only knowledge."
400,Zoanthrope Awakening,Bloody Roar,"With this, you have a way to not only implant the Zoanthrope gene within any living person safely, but you can awaken it immediately as well due to knowing the required wavelength. Your knowledge of it is extensive to the point of being capable of splicing in any beast you have access to into the Zoanthrope gene, with few consequences."
500,Giver Of Power,Charlotte,"You are exceptionally skilled at creating the event that leads to powers. In this world, that involves having a young child inhale minute particles of the comet Charlotte. In other worlds, you may see new abilities, and learn how to recreate what led up to those people's abilities."
600,Alchemy,With This Ring,"Alchemy, strictly speaking, is the art of using knowledge and preparation to shape the arcane without using your own magic. This is useful for several reasons. Firstly, effects achieved by alchemy are replicable by others: any potion or formula you make can be replicated by anyone else. Secondly, any price for magic is either extracted from the ingredients directly or paid for by the recipient of your work. Thirdly, as it is not limited by a mortal caster’s power: the effects of alchemy can potentially reach godly levels of power. The Garrick Superspeed Formula and its derivatives, the Danner Super-Strength Formula (which has been confirmed to work on all terrestrial mammals and can grant a human strength comparable to the Superman), Lazarus Pits, and more would eventually be within your grasp with this perk.
As an aside, creating a replicable, universally effective alchemical formula without side effects that grants powers on the level of the Garrick Formula would take a B-list DC genius 10 years of research, while finding a way for multiple alchemical formulas to work together simultaneously would take 10(n)2 years of research by the same, where n is the number of formulas you wish to make work together."
600,Argent Cybernetics,/tg/ Doom,"The pinnacle of modern technology, Argent Energy powered Cybernetics can enhance anyone, from a normal human to demons themselves, making them faster, stronger, smarter, and deadlier. Now you too can harness these technological marvels for your own purposes, whether you're upgrading yourself or enhancing others.
(Capstone Boosted - Prophecy of the Seraphim)
You have come far in your studies, and achieved the pinnacle of cybernetic technology. If you so choose, you can have your brain transplanted into a superstrong robotic body, replacing parts of your brain with cybernetics to make you even faster and smarter than before. All cybernetics you create are more effective and energy efficient than before, and you can transplant others into custom made cybernetic bodies as well, if you so choose."
600,Blood Empowerment,Kimetsu No Yaiba,"Oh boy. You really want to go this far, huh? Alright, I won’t stop you. Somehow, you’ve undergone the same level of treatment as Muzan, the First Demon, has; your base power level is equivalent to his, making you a challenging fight for all the Pillars working together, with immense durability, speed, and strength. However, that’s not the only thing about Muzan that sets him apart...namely, he’s the First Demon, and not the Only Demon, for a reason, one you now share - by feeding humans your blood, you make them demons as well, more blood making them more powerful (up to an individual’s limit; more than that, and they explode into giblets). This “power” can be as general or specific as you wish, in that you can choose to simply give them an amount of strength that will manifest as best suited for the individual, or you can grant them specific abilities you have access to; for the duration of this jump, this can only be abilities granted by this jump. While Muzan may not be the only demon capable of doing this, you take this to his level, allowing you to kill any demon you bestow power in this manner when you wish. This might have triggers attached to it as well to activate when you’re not immediately aware of them. Lastly, but certainly not least, you have an additional 3 Demon Blood Arts at your disposal."
600,Cauldron Vials,/tg/ Worm,"A case containing five vials of Cauldron formula. Unlike other formula these have no risk of mutation or death, being perfectly stable. Whoever drinks these is guaranteed to get a power that would be relatively powerful compared to the average parahuman. Aside from the powers suiting their host in some way (more aggressive people getting more aggressive powers for example) these are completely random. These have no effect on you. The case refills itself once a year. Outside the jump these still work despite the lack of shards or entities, simply giving the equivalent of a parahuman power. The case itself is indestructible, and unless purposefully given away will reappear in your warehouse if lost."
600,Evolution of the Soul,Valeria Bleach,"At the heart of all things is the soul, the holy grail from which the world can be manipulated and controlled. To create and alter the soul, and life in general, could be said to be the highest and most worthy form of science. Your knowledge of alteration and even creation of souls or biological life is a match for the greats, men like Urahara and Kurotsuchi. Provided you have the tools, it is entirely possible for you to craft new beings from spirit particles, designed to your specifications down to the molecular level.
Such a project is grand even for you, meaning that lesser modifications or enhancements are quite simple. Giving someone the ability to melt into liquid and reform in a safe location? Rudimentary. Altering the appearance of a Zanpakuto Spirit or potentially even it’s abilities? Possible, enough to offer it as a paid service. New species entirely, such as the Gikon or the Bount, would never be accidental creations but the results of purposeful development in your lab. You’re not all that good at fixing the injured compared to a healer of your level but you’re very much able to make people into terrifyingly powerful bio-spiritual monsters, if they’re not too squeamish.
Though beyond you now, the potential lies even for you to discover the secrets of resurrection, resuscitating lost or mostly destroyed souls and lives even hours after they have passed on. Interfering with the cycle in such a form may bring trouble your way but...the science of the soul calls to you and what greater expression can there be? It’s only natural to progress, as your existing mastery is complemented with the sort of incredible talent that got you here in the first place. Who knows what sort of grand spirits or monsters you might create in time."
600,Flask Plan Data,Medaka Box Abnormal,"The jewel of Hakoniwa Academy or at least what they hope will one day be that jewel. This USB contains all the data so far accumulated by the Flask Plan and a fair bit more on top. A project created in order to one day turn Normals into Abnormals, these are the starting steps towards successfully completing that plan. Given the creators of the plan’s true origins, there’d be no hope of succeeding at all without having this in hand and yet even with it, you’re still in for an arduous road of study, experimentation and a lot of expended resources. But when you’ve managed to bottle the essence of Gods, it’ll all be worth it."
600,Glyph Magic,Thief,"You've been trained in the secret art of glyph magic. By writing it down on a surface you can activate the magic. Eventually your skill might grow to the point where you can ""draw"" in the air. There are Battle Glyphs that are utilized in battle, such as attacking or for defensive purposes like invisibility. Utility Glyphs allow you to augment something, such as augmenting a statue with animation, or closing another glyph. Stationary Glyphs are permanent; they allow things like locking a door, or a chair to the ground, or perhaps even opening a secret door. These are just some of the possibilities that were presented in the games, but perhaps you will find creative uses for all these glyphs. Additionally you’ve been granted the secrets of the transformation glyphs used for “Glyph Enhanced” perk, allowing you to enhance those that serve under you.
Glyph Enhanced (Thief)
You’ve been selected to undergo a special body enhancement. The Keeper Council has given you a very special gift, a transformation. Your bones have been inscribed with a very special Glyph, enhancing your body. Your strength, agility, and endurance has increased to peak human conditions. Your mind has similarly been enhanced, giving you the gift of telepathy. However unless you’re “talking” directly to those without Observant perk, they cannot hear your conversations between those that are similarly enhanced. You’ve been further trained to work in groups of fellow Enforcers, creating a sort of hive mind making escaping or hiding near impossible."
600,Hybrid Biologist,Killing Bites,"Well well. You know your craft well - almost too well, it seems. You know how to create Hybrids - the humans capable of morphing into a half-human, half-animal creature capable of more than either progenitor. Along with this? You know how to biologically place ‘barriers’ within individuals - hiding abilities & properties within a person’s body until such a time as requirements are met. These requirements can be anything from the introduction of a chemical via pill to a simple code phrase.
Imposing (Doom 2016)
Welcome to the ""Big enough to dwarf humans and tear your prey apart with your bare hands if you want to"" club. With this, you grow in both height and physical stature, becoming tougher to take down in the process. This also comes with some inherent status in Hell as being above other, smaller demons, and is complete with a booming demonic voice that can sound exactly as menacing as you want it to."
600,Lord of Hell,Doom 2016,"There IS a place in hell reserved just for you. It's called the throne. Well, one of the thrones, anyways. You'll have to put up with many other contenders, but this is as high in the demonic hierarchy as you can go without seizing all power for yourself. This comes with great status in this world, and even once you leave this place you will maintain an air of authority and power that will be felt by everyone in your presence. As an added bonus, as a Lord of Hell, you more or less get to define what your demonic form looks like, and nobody is going to call you out on it, so have fun! When combined with ""Imposing"", you can become even larger and stronger, a goliath among other demons and rightfully so.
(Capstone Boosted - Prophecy of the Seraphim)
As a Lord of Hell, you are now capable of Ascending others, granting other people powerful demonic forms, the appearance of which is yours to determine, but can only be as powerful as yours is, conferring the ""Imposing"" perk if you have it yourself and so wish to impart it on others. This will not grant you power over them, and every time you do so you will be drained of energy and need to recover for several days before you are at full capacity again. Your demonic form also becomes more imposing and powerful, more beautiful to some, according to your own views on such things."
600,Master of Karma,Lord of Light,"Yours is the greatest mortal station. You are one of the Masters of Karma, with powers greater than any temporal king. With your extensive training and conditioning with the use of the psycho-evaluation tools bestowed upon you by Heaven, you may pry into the minds and deeds of those who come forth for reincarnation – laid back upon the gold-and-samite throne of the machine, their memories and nature are yours to peruse. In addition, you have the great clone-banks and gene-crafters that may shape new and beautiful forms for your petitioners.
Judging from their deeds, you may reincarnate their atman into animal form, or human – or even Godly perfection, though you lack the knowledge of Aspect and Attribute that would let them acquire such powers. It is among your duties to give gifts of grace and strength, and punishments of blindness or epilepsy. Unlike most of your peers, you understand the construction and operation of these heavenly machines well enough that you could create your own given tools and time.
Reincarnation is not traumatic in itself, though the atman takes time to reassert itself – supernatural powers are diminished to near-nothing for some time after rebirth, but always return in full eventually. So long as the brain is alive, reincarnation is almost always successful – brain damage scars the soul, and may prevent successful rebirth.
You have duties and responsibilities, though you may live a princely life, it is at the behest of Heaven that you serve. Never forget your patrons – they do not allow Karma to be the servant of mortal greeds.
After your time upon this world, adjoined to your Warehouse is a lofty vault of marble and gold, within which rests a system of the same powers – a psych-probe throne, eight accelerated-growth clone tanks and life-weaving computer. With artful care, you may even use these machines to imbue greater or stranger shapes upon the life within, but initially they may only create animal, human and godly forms – freely granting Bestial Gifts and Divine Physique.
Bestial Gifts (Lord of Light)
Bestial Gifts - Despite your lowly nature, you have strengths. Some animal traits express themselves strongly in you - be it acute senses, speed, claws and so forth. Those who are not themselves animals, have mutated to express these features and would be well advised to keep them hidden. The Masters of Karma may judge fairly, but the common man can have little mercy. You may take whatever animal features you like - but they are clearly and distinctively animal. If you are an Animal, then of course you have the entire form, for what little it aids you.
Divine Physique (Lord of Light)
The body selected for your enjoyment has been carefully shaped beyond the apex of humanity. Strong, vital and beauteous - it is a form that one could live within for hundreds of years, though at any time you may approach the Masters of Karma for a replacement, should the flames of your divine lifestyle burn it out. Care has been made that it expresses the initial mutations and brain structures to develop Aspect and Attribute - though once they have been induced, they will carry with your soul through whatever form you take.
(Word of God)
>Actually speaking of companions is it possible to give ones gained from after the jump demigod stuff, if so what would you need?
IIRC you get the required equipment installed in the Warehouse post-Jump.
>So basically if we take the demigod import post-LoL companions(a.k.a. ones gained from after that jump) can be upgraded to demigod with the right equipment?
Yeah - it's basically a subtle Mutant Superpower, and a demigod may not be the best at teaching the mental exercises and performing the drug regimen that brings it out to its peak, but they'll have a starting point. You have enough genetics perks and you can do it yourself. (better this than worry too much about in-universe compatibility of powers, which is always a bit of a pain in the ass to think about)."
600,Master Of The Mind,Prey,"The knowledge to create Neuromods. We're not just talking about those hypos with exotic material either, but to be able to create the programs that you upload to the mind itself. With this, all the secrets of the human mind are laid bare to you, if you look at an active neuron you could tell what it's function is in the mind. You can take the scans of the specific skills of anyone and create a new Neuromod suitable for human use. Skills can be recorded through mere observation utilising a device called a Psychoscope, though the skill you wish to collect must be being practiced by the target or be a significant part of their personality. A great musician doesn't need to be composing in order for you to scan him for his musical talent, but if you wanted his ability to cook you'd need to scan him while he was cooking. It has also been demonstrated to be possible to install abilities from alien biology, providing the user has access to sufficient quantities of any special material the ability relies on and they're okay with hybridising their biology with the species."
600,Mind of the Sun,Exalted - Solars,"Many speak of the First Age and its lost wonders, forgotten and quietly waiting for the return of their masters. However, far too many fixate on what was and what could have been, instead of looking towards the future, and you are not one who has time to waste rummaging around old ruins for secrets. Your Exaltation holds many of the lost knowledge of crafting and forging great Artifacts, as well as lost sciences of the First Age such as biogenesis. You begin with the basic knowledge and fluency in Old Realm, as well as mastery of the various sciences and ways of crafting from the First Age, able to forge weapons, warstriders, and other items of legend to add to your own panoply. As a bonus, you know how to substitute magical materials for such items with their mundane equivalents or metals in other worlds - useful in worlds without materials such as orichalum.
(Capstone Boosted - Unconquered)
Contrary to what some of the Solars of the First Age may have believed, the world is not improved by being painted in gold or forged in orichalum. The world is made whole by the sum of its parts, not merely the brightest piece of it. This realization comes with twofold benefits - you are able to attune yourself to any sort of supernatural metal: soulsteel, jade, moonsilver, or even things in other worlds - as though it were orichalum. Just as well, you can easily forge Artifacts with these different metals as well. But this is not all your teachings have discovered - you now understand the necessary principles to build tools and methods that can interact with the higher piece of the soul, even excising a piece of it without killing the subject. In time, you may even find ways to bolster, empower, or strip away elements attached to it, though generating means and power is up to you. If this sounds underwhelming, take note of this - Lytek would likely kill to know what you will eventually set the groundwork for.
(Notes)
Capstone boosted Mind of the Sun lays the groundwork for eventually making Exaltations or
similar of your own, or at least intricate ways of empowering or splitting the soul, though it will
take centuries or even millennia to fully master without ways to shorten that time. If you’re in a
hurry, find their original creator and try to copy their notes, otherwise you will be working largely
from scratch."
600,Mutagenic Mastery,Pathfinder,"Other Alchemist’s work pales at your own. You gain the ability to create horrifying mutagens capable of a wide variety of fantastic effects. Stopping aging, regenerating limbs, transforming yourself into a living mummy, adding extra arms and all sorts of other bizarre effects. If you weren’t already, you’ve become a master of mutagens, here and wherever else; if you’ve seen it done, you could do it yourself, probably better, too!"
600,"Nano-Hollows, Son-in-Law",German Hollow Quest,"There is, within your Warehouse, a massive vat of off green mucus. This is actually a powerful restorative based on microscopic Hollows following the will of those that feed them spiritual energy. These little beings can repair incredible amounts of damage and may have other, grander, uses but the notes on this stuff, found scattered around the floor in it’s immediate area are in a couple of words, a mess. What you currently know about this thing is from a letter, in a vastly different handwriting, to ‘Son-in-Law’ explaining how to use its restorative powers.
With time you’ll discover through the notes that these microscopic Hollows are able to not only regenerate the flesh of those placed within it but also convert spiritual energy into material, though this material in question is only physical to those who are spiritually aware, which then can be worked into shapes you wish.
(Notes)
Allows you to put people in and grant them regeneration if they didn’t have it, can also be used to create spiritual constructs, or even create artificial Fullbringers. Nano-Hollows stay in the vat."
600,Nature of the Soul,With This Ring,"You can now perceive the complex web of identity, emotions, and arcane connections that form a person’s soul. Additionally, you have greater understanding and control of your own soul, granting a slight boost of strength and control of your magic, and a much greater boost in control of any domains or divine magic/abilities you possess. With practice, you can learn to push your soul into mundane or magical artifacts either to siphon strength from them, imbue them with power, make them into a part of your expanded metaphysique for purposes of arcane sympathy or control, or directly struggle against their own power or owner’s power to steal control of the item (though losing such a conquest can have terrible consequences).
Most importantly, you can induce a divine awakening in mortal souls (including your own, if you are not already a New God). While this does nothing on its own, an awakened mortal will, over time, grow into a New God, increasing the strength of their soul and connecting to a Domain relevant to their skills and personality. Awakening a skilled mage could lead to a New God of Magic. Awakening Green Arrow would lead to a New God of Archery. Awakening a veteran Green Lantern could result in a New God of Will. A New God of Archery could fire one arrow and simultaneously hit seven targets around a corner. A New God of Will could match the Guardians of Oa. In addition to granting a domain and increased arcane power, an Awakening will heal most injuries or arcane maladies, and elevate the subject to the ideal status of their species. It will turn white Martians into red Martians and have similar effects on other species with inherent biological or arcane castes. The rate at which a new New God grows into his or her powers can be increased with exposure to raw arcane power. Additionally, while a Fatherbox or sufficiently skilled New God could perform or teach this skill in the Jump, it does so by forcing them to focus on one or a few specific aspects of their being, such as a skill, power, or personality trait, and hinders them in gaining completely new skills or powers unrelated to their domain. Purchasing this skill will allow those you empower to continue to gain new skills/powers/facets of personality without issue and grow the power of their souls without limit."
600,Quintessence,Heaven Will Be Mine,"Lesser scientists may spend years of their lives, charting out the laws of physics and measuring the world in the hopes of understanding it... but even were all the laws of the universe not determined by human authority, it would still be so that humanity was at the center of his own universe, and thus you understand that you cannot know the nature of your universe without first understanding the nature of the people who define it.
You are familiar with the reaches of this deepest discipline, then, the science of the human experience. In theory, if you haven’t already mastered them, you grasp the likes of biology, psychology, sociology, anthropology, and even theology with ease. In practice... the limitless plasticity of humanity is yours to shape in body and mind, through cybernetics, biotechnology, sociocultural engineering, and more. As you close in on the abstract, even the soul itself may one day open before you for you to manipulate, eliminating the last troublesome variables from the human project and making even such paradoxes as Eversion soluble."
600,Spark of Power,MTG Iconics,"A post-Mending Planeswalker Spark? Don’t you already have one of these? It seems you have some spares. This is a Powerstone in a talisman that contains a Planeswalker Spark. When used it releases the Planeswalker Spark and the Spark enters the person who used the Powerstone. The person who receives the Spark gains all the benefits from the Planeswalker Spark perk, a Color origin alignment appropriate to them, discounts based on that origin and 500 CP to spend on perks. This can’t be used to give someone a second Planeswalker Spark as Planeswalkers are unable to use this Powerstone. This Powerstone will generate a new Planeswalker Spark after every jump or every ten years whichever is sooner.
Planeswalker Spark (MTG Iconics)
The post-Mending Planeswalker Spark, not the Jumper Spark. This is the Spark of the MtG universe, and your own Planeswalker Spark has ignited. Due to this your ability to understand and mold Mana becomes incredibly intuitive such that your potential far exceeds all mortal spellcasters. You know the basics of summoning creatures that you have a connection with, creating new creatures from mana, casting spells, and forming contracts with higher powers for boosts to your capabilities. As a new Planeswalker, your current capacity to use Mana starts at 5 motes of Mana before incurring Mana Burn. This will easily grow to 10 motes of Mana within a year and from there, given thorough magical research, you will be able to sustain an additional mote of Mana per year of study. Mana is generated from Lands, of which you can bond to one after half a week. Lastly, as a Planeswalker you can of course travel the multiverse. In a ritual requiring at least three motes of Mana and six hours of mental preparation, you can take with you anything on your person. This can be trained to have a lower cost and mental preparation time. In addition, you can instead Planeswalk instantly when following someone in the immediate wake of an interdimensional jump. When navigating between planes you can either go to a plane randomly or go to a plane you know or one you have seen by visualizing it in your mind. This ability is limited to the local multiverse until you ignite your Jumper Spark.
Alignment (MTG Iconics)
All magic is sorted into one of five Colors to which they are naturally inclined, likewise all mages have a Color to which they are more in tune with than others. For the Color of your origin you gain this perk free. For the Colors allied (adjacent) to your origin’s Color you can gain this perk for 100 CP for the second alignment and 50 CP for the third onward. Lastly for the Colors opposing (opposite) your origin’s Color you can gain this perk for 200 CP for the second alignment and 100 CP for the third onward.
This perk gives you a solid understanding of the fundamentals of this Color, allowing you to easily serve as a peer in a respectable magical academy, start creating your own spells, and more easily form connections to creatures of the same Color without tutelage.
This perk also lets you apply discounts to second Color’s perks for which you have bought alignment in addition to your origin, but does not give you the free 100 CP perks instead counting them as discounted. This can be taken multiple times up the the maximum of five times"
600,The Conduit Gene,Reddit Infamous,"Working with the beast has given you deep insight into how Conduits work, and as such, you have learned how to give people Conduit powers, specifically, the Conduit gene. This is very taxing on you, and it is up to them in order to activate it, but you can make others into Conduits now. Their Conduit powers can mix into their already existing ones or be completely separate, your choice.
The Elixir of Infinitely Ascending Dragon Wave Particle Spiritual Transcendence (Generic Xianxia) (Scenario Reward)
While it could be used to cure any illness, restore youth and ​drastically​ increase one’s spiritual powers, these are trifling uses compared to its more practical function. Its true power comes when it is diluted with another potion, pill, drug or ointment. When this occurs, the benefits granted by the added drug become permanent, and all of their drawbacks are nullified.
For example, adding a medicine that would alleviate pain would result in the drinker never feeling pain again, though they would still be aware of and be able to respond to it accordingly. Furthermore, there is no limit to the number of potions which may be added, allowing you to combine as many potions as you desire into one, making their durations permanent and removing all unwanted side-effects of their use. The only limitation is that the drinker must be able to consume the entire mixture of amalgamated potions at once for it to take full effect."
600,The Power to Share,Valeria Bleach,"Every one hundred years, they say, a special Quincy is born. Born crippled, without their senses and in a fragile state. Born without the ability to make use of the energy around them. In ages past, these poor things were often killed early on in superstitious fear. Their family had no idea of their true potential. But you survived, the true nature of your power slowly restoring and empowering your body, until your wounds disappeared and you regained the Quincy powers that are your birthright.
With a touch and acceptance from each side, you can impart a fragment of your soul to another being. All ailments of the recipient, be they physical or mental or spiritual, will be healed by the process. In return, the fragment would be engraved with all the knowledge, skills and talents of the person who received the fragment. The price? A severe reduction in lifespan for the recipient and on their death, the fragment would return to you with all it has gathered. Not just the mental traits but also the stolen lifespan and even a significant amount of the spiritual energy the host once held. These fragments can only be gathered and absorbed in your sleep, the dead treasures combining into your being once you enter the slumber.
If you go beyond mere contact, and trade a drop of your blood, you can awaken the powers of a
Quincy in another individual. While this only grants the base traits of a pure Quincy, and is quite
incompatible with Hollow Reiryoku, it also binds them to you. Resisting your commands will prove a terrible struggle if bound and you may find a way to sustain your life so long as your bound Quincy remain. Your presence will do them more than enough good to pay recompense, as one who can share as you do will naturally reinforce greatly the speed at which Quincy develop. Both their Quincy powers and spiritually in general.
The final step you have available is to allow Quincy to drink deeply of a cup of your blood, imbued with a significant fraction of your soul. This ritual will inscribe a Letter into their spirit, allowing them to awaken a unique power suited to the Letter and their own personality. The potential for these ‘Schrift’ varies, based half on overall spiritual power and half on affinity for Quincy abilities. While all Schrift start weak and must be developed, some will end as merely a hardening of the skin or manipulation of fire. Others reach a stranger height, even making the imaginary into reality.
There is a downside to your nature. You must continue to share and reclaim from others or else face the prospect of slowly returning to your natural state. Blind, deaf, dumb and helpless in every way. Though it will never kill you, you must always be aware that you rely on the spirits of others to maintain your existence. Hardly fitting for a King.
With time and experimentation, it may be possible to uncover new ways to use this power. Yhwach would eventually create techniques that allowed him to resurrect from death so long as the Quincy bearing his soul fragments still lived, as well as a method to steal back the fragments and Quincy power in general to redistribute as pleased."
600,Wretched Rebirth,Bloodborne,"Every Great One loses its child, and then yearns for a surrogate. The origin of these words is ambiguous, but the truth of them appears to be reality. Perhaps originating in some zealous soul’s desire for ascendance, a ritual built around supplying surrogates was constructed.
With great skill in this ritual, you have the capacity to twist one type of being into being closer in body and mind to another. The first step of this ritual requires the construction of an artificial womb using flesh from the original being’s race, and the secondary being’s race.
The second step is to seal the subject inside of this bag of flesh after filling the warm chamber with plasma; blood cleansed of all impurities. The subject, sealed in this space, melting and reforming, evolving and deforming, until such time that they are released.
The final result gives the reborn subject great abilities based on the sampled being, and renders them to be far more susceptible to other surgeries and experiments relating towards guiding them further.”"
800,Hōgyoku,Valeria Bleach,"The Crumbling Orb at the centre of so much conflict. The magnum opus of both Sosuke Aizen and Kisuke Urahara. Each man wished to find a way to break the boundaries of the spiritual world in some way and, somehow, each found their way to the same creation. A device capable of realising the deepest desires and dreams of those around it. Yet, this tool has a will of it’s own, an intelligence to read the desires of others and serve the one considered it’s master.
Whatever the truth of it’s intelligence, the completed Hōgyoku rests in your palm now, a fusion of two component orbs and incredible power to bind them. It’s power is to manifest dreams as reality, not in a temporary sense or only maintained by focus but as truth. It could break down the barriers between two races to create a new species, awaken powers in those that desperately desire or evolve a man to ever greater levels of power. Indeed, these dreams manifest through evolution, change and growth in those affected.
The orb requires a large amount of Reiryoku to activate, either injected in to activate in regards to a single desire or constantly infused by being near a powerful source, allowing the orb to manifest wishes as it sees fit. However, the orb manifests desires that people are capable of achieving. If one does not have the raw potential or power to achieve something, the Hōgyoku will instead attempt to lead it’s user towards being able to do so. They might be forcibly evolved in stages first to prepare them for the true goal or be guided without realisation towards what is needed to gain the potential for what they desire. The more powerful the user, in raw power and capability overall, the more the Hōgyoku can achieve on it’s own."
900,Karmatron Dynamics,Battle Angel Alita,"The study and prediction of intelligent interaction.
Requires Medicine, Cybernetics and Biotechnology. Discounted for Doctors.
Macro Karmatron Theory – Also known as “psychohistory”, this is the science of human destiny, a mathematical model of sociology. Where an observer has great difficulty in predicting the motion of a single molecule in a gas, Kinetic Theory can predict the mass action of the gas to a high level of accuracy – so too with the behaviour of intelligent beings. Psychohistory allows the long-range prediction and manipulation of the future, provided the population is of sufficient size, without directly infringing on the free will of the individual. Constant revision, surveillance and supercomputer assistance is required, but even with these efforts, sufficiently powerful individuals may emerge who create their own unpredictable karma singularities and throw the entire model into turmoil.
Nano Karmatron Theory – Applied to guided micro- and nano-machines, NKT allows unprecedented control over chaotic systems. Ordinarily it is impossible to create truly advanced nanotechnological systems no matter how sophisticated their base programming – they are extremely sensitive to heat, radiation, computer corruption, unguided self-evolution, rebellion and biomechanical horror. The ordered chaos of NKT makes all of this part of one purposeful design, a vast system marching in unison and self-correcting via its own randomness. It allows for reprogrammable hard nanomachines to be used for anything from industrial manufacture, to cellular surgery, to outright construction of stable nano-cybernetic bodies capable of adaptive reconfiguration and near-perfect biomimicry that still vastly outperform almost all purely mechanical cyborgs.
These Imaginos Bodies are a perfect fusion of the will of the mind and the power of the physical form. However, at least with the current state of Karmatron Dynamics, very few are capable of making the transition successfully – their wills disintegrating their body into a screaming crumble. At the moment, only karmic singularities – individuals of exceptional and unpredictable influence on the destiny of mankind – can be reasonably expected to make the leap into the new flesh.
Their base appearance reflects the self-image of the mind. As the mind reflects upon itself it may learn to change colour and – gradually – shape. Assimilation of cherished weapons, generation of new systems and limbs, intuitive hacking – the full capacity of the Imaginos is limited only by the imagination and will."
1000,Titan Form,Ward,"Much like the Titans that would later show up in the Ward timeline you can take on a gigantic inhuman form heavily influenced by the nature of your powers. In this form you firstly have the equivalent of a medium to high end brute power due to strength and durability even more than what logically comes with such sheer size (though not as much as even a small Endbringer unless you already have good brute powers) and minor regenerative ability. More importantly though when in this form your powers are greatly boosted, with high sechen ranges in every direction possible, meaning your powers operate at not only a noticeably greater scale and potency than usual but with versatility you'd normally consider outside their range in virtually every measure. Using this form in the Jump however or even having this capability will put a huge target on your back in the canon Ward timeline. (This perk can be discounted in exchange for being stuck in this form for the duration of the Jump like a real Titan and taking the drawbacks Inhuman Appearance, Intrusive Thoughts, and Gibberish all at least at 100 CP tier for no points in order to reflect this state.)
Power Hub (Scenario Reward)
No this doesn't make you an entity, I mean I guess you theoretically could take the Titans and their shards as companions if you have some method of doing so, and that would be close, but that's not the intended reward. Instead you gain the power to form networks with willing persons, optionally sharing information, energy, and mentally communicating. More importantly though, you can allow them to benefit from the Titan perk at your discretion, which will be a large boost to their ability in most universes."
