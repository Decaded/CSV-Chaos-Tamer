0,Valkyrie Core & Frame,BAHHSCQ,"All origins possess a Valkyrie Frame with the accompanying core. A Valkyrie Core is capable of storing, integrating, and improving technology and equipment. Its only limitations are storage capacity and complexity both of which grow with hours synced. Your initial storage and complexity is based on your origin with more experienced origins having more. The term Valkyrie Frame usually refers to a core that has integrated a suit of enhanced power armor that has been equipped with thrusters, weapons, and other equipment. Technology foreign to this universe is harder to integrate and upgrade. Post jump this limitation disappears.
Vampire, True- 800
A true lord or lady of the night. At the last desperate moment of your life, the blood offered itself to
you and the contract was made. The blood surged into your body and a new demon rose into the
night. You posses powers that, even as a fledgling newly born, match or surpass those of any
artificial vampire. Your physical abilities match them already and will greatly surpass them once you
begin to feed on the blood of the living. Your regeneration is significantly more potent, even healing
from many of your weaknesses at speed. The weaknesses of artificial vampires have a weaker hold
on you and this will only continue as you age and continue to feed, until many cease to bother you at
all. A similar principle applies to your other abilities, strengthening or even developing new vampiric
powers as your life grows longer. The ability to change your shape, to other people or animals or even swarms of monsters, and
powers of the mind are quick to avail themselves to you. Sight beyond mortal eyes, telepathy, hypnosis and telekinesis are classic traits of the vampiric ruler. Control over the weather or shadows, even dark magics, are all possible developments in time. As are many other powers besides. But your most potent and horrific trait is in the way that you feed on others. Unlike lesser vampires, who can only create ghouls, you are able to devour far more than just a person’s blood. Their very
souls are dragged down into the depths of your own, bound and enslaved until the day you have use
of them. These souls have many uses. Making them part of your legion will confer the knowledge
and powers they possessed to you, allowing you use of them while their soul remains within. They
can also be used as a substitute for your own life, sacrificing a soul to heal from terrible wounds or
fatal blows. The souls can even be unleashed, as loyal familiars, to fight for you in the external world. This action prevents the use of these familiars as healing resources or power sources.
If desired, rather than a vampire of your own making, you can be a child of Alucard instead. True
Vampires can only create more of their kind from virgins of the opposite sex, though this condition
will be taken card of if you choose this option."
50,Juice of Sapho,Frank Herbert’s Dune,"Refined from the roots of the Ecaz Tree, the Juice of Sapho (sa-foo) is used by Mentats to accelerate their thinking. It is a highly addictive Awareness Spectrum Narcotic, meaning that anyone who takes it without being prepared for the effects is going to trip balls so hard they’ll be able to taste math and smell thursday. For those prepared for the effects, it can double or triple your intelligence, processing speed, and sensory sensitivity. It can also be used with Spice to produce much more pronounced effects, but doing so makes the basic Juice less effective in the long run. Prolonged use of the Juice will permanently stain the drinker’s lips and mouth ruby red and may or may not induce bushy eyebrows. You gain enough Juice for five doses a day. You also gain a sample of and the formula for a drug that can be used to wean someone off the Juice and remove the stain, but do not gain a regenerating supply."
100,A Humble Mushroom Farmer,Paper Mario,"The Mushroom Kingdom is a land of many strange and mysterious items. Healing mushrooms, small snowmen that call up blizzards, blocks labelled POW that shake the earth. These items have to come from somewhere, and now you are a source of these objects. You know the arts behind the creation of the various usable items from the paper mario series. Some of these must be grown, others built, and still others prepared through more esoteric means. You also know how to create lil' oink eggs and use them to produce certain items. The ingredients for many of these are rather common in this world, but rarer elsewhere. I'd stock up if I were you.
Artificial Enhancements (Charlotte) (400)
Power enhancing drugs can allow a low-level ability to match up against legitimate threats. Luckily for the people here, you know how to create them. Whilst they'll start off weak, in time you'll figure out how to make truly powerful enhancements."
100,Improved Preservation,Pathfinder,"Alchemists are normally limited in the number of Extracts, Mutagens and Bombs they can keep on hand at any one time. You, however, surpass them in this regard. Your various alchemical creations will never degrade, even when the chemical process that created them dictates they should, allowing you to stockpile an enormous arsenal. Additionally, your mutagens will function on others with the usual effect, but any given individual cannot benefit from more than one mutagen at a time."
100,Spice Cache,Frank Herbert’s Dune,"This is 10 decagrams of Spice (1/10th of a kilogram). It’s worth enough to live on for a decade in this universe. It is worth 5,000,000 Solaris or roughly 50,000,000 Dollars US. You get another 10 decagrams every day, and in other universes, you won’t have to convince people that it really is Melange. It is just as addictive and powerful in other universes as it is here. You also gain a plate of 18 freshly baked Spice Cakes, 24 pieces of Spice Candy, and enough Spice Coffee to make 36 cups every morning. Consuming Melange can slow the aging process drastically, enhance intelligence, reflexes, and general awareness. In large doses it can also counter poisoning. Prolonged use turns the eyes blue on blue and using it to excess generation after generation can lead to profound physical mutations and genetically enhanced psychic powers."
200,Concoct,Runepunk,"You can brew a wide variety of serums to temporarily grant powers such as night vision, increase or decrease a particular attribute, even a mind-control serum. Plus, naturally, a wide range of explosives to suit all your needs."
200,Pharmacist,Generic Xianxia,"The plants and animals of the land can be turned into medicines and food that when eaten allows one to gain strength. With this perk, you can mix the parts of flora and fauna to create such. While they may have side effects, they are never permanently harmful, and they will always make the consumer stronger, though to what extent and for how long depends on the ingredients, process, and your skill. Furthermore your pills, elixirs, potions, and other similar such things made for the purpose of beneficial effects will be strengthened by almost half-again what they would normally be capable of, and if temporary in nature they will even last half-again as long."
200,Pin Creation,The World Ends With You,"You have unlocked the secret of creating pins. You can make custom pins with your own art on them, with the psych of your choice attached to them. You can still only use psychs you have purchased, but the pins you make will invariably be more powerful than anything you can buy."
200,Water of Life,Frank Herbert’s Dune,"The Water of Life starts off as the incredibly toxic bile of a young sandworm that has been drowned. Untreated, even a tiny amount of this substance is lethally poisonous, and there is no antidote. It is said to cause an agonizing death. It can be transmuted by a Bene Gesserit, Sayyadina, or Kwisatz Haderach via a highly risky process called ‘The Spice Agony’. Untreated, the bile is an Awareness Spectrum Narcotic that awakens Genetic Memory and advanced psychic powers in anyone who survives the Spice Agony. The only men who can survive the Spice Agony are Kwisatz Haderachs. Once the bile has been converted into the Water of Life, it becomes a potent narcotic that awakens latent psychic powers at a much lower level... most especially collective empathy, telepathy, and limited prescience.
Those who consume the converted Water of Life find their inhibitions lowered, their stress level drastically eased, and pent-up emotions safely released. When many people consume it in close physical proximity, they may fall into a Spice or Tau Orgy, where wild-dancing and unrestrained sexual activity are common. The Tau is the Fremen concept for ‘oneness of the community and devotion to others’. You gain 20 liters of untreated Water of Life every three months, and 500 liters of treated Water of Life every month. Normally, latent powers awakened by Water of Life fade after the high passes. Yours can be diluted and timedosed so that the high is smaller and more prolonged, thus allowing for training those powers to the point that they can be maintained even once the drug’s effects wear off. Mega-doses of converted water of life may have health risks (and induce Spice Addiction) but may awaken higher tier psychic powers, though not as high as those awakened by Spice Agony. Warning, undergoing Spice Agony while pregnant can cause your daughter to be Pre-Born... i.e. achieve full awareness and unlocking of genetic memory while still inside the womb. This includes gaining genetic memory of the mother. Male children who are not Kwisatz Haderach Potentials will probably be killed by this process. Those trained in the Sayyadina Rites of the Fremen or Bene Gesserit Reverend Mothers can transfer their collective Other Memory (complete with a copy of their own Memory Ghost) to a successor or successors through the Spice Agony. This usually results in the death of the original Sayyadina, who usually only does this when she is about to die. The Sayyadina are the Fremen Priestesses and keepers of the secret lore."
300,Corona Stimulants,/tg/ Worm,"A case containing five small disposable plastic injectors, which when used boost a parahuman’s powers by around fifty percent for several hours. You can only use one every twelve hours, any additional doses resulting in incredibly painful migraines that will leave you effectively helpless for hours. The case replenishes itself every morning. These can potentially boost other powers as well, as long as such powers have some sort of neural/biological basis. Ex: Raildex Esper powers would be viable, your magic would not. Reappears in your warehouse if lost or destroyed. Potentially a very lucrative product, especially among less honest folk."
300,Discovery!,Pathfinder,"Alchemists normally only make a handful of meaningful discoveries in their careers. You, on the other hand, may learn the secrets of any other Alchemist that you come across. Additionally, you’ll learn new alchemical tricks at a much greater rate. Modifying your bombs to release poison instead of exploding? Trivially easy. What about cursing foes instead? Sure. Healing ailments with alchemy is good, but what about infusing actual magic into your regular brews. Or making useful potions permanent? What about reviving the dead? All of that and more are yours. Further, with enough tinkering, I’m sure you could fit other magical effects into your brews."
300,Item Crafting Feats,Pathfinder,"With expenditure of gold and effort, magical items can be crafted by skilled artisans, even if they’re incapable of using the magic in question, though that’ll complicate the matter and risk ruining some materials. But either way, with enough finagling, you can create your own magic items. This will be a small help towards creating an artifact, but is essential to crafting anything vaguely magical. Crafting magical items requires several days' work (at minimum) and sums of gold that’d make most peasants' heads spin, but will cost roughly half of what you’d be able to buy it for at the best of times (assuming you didn’t ruin the materials.) The more powerful the item becomes, the price and time requirement increases exponentially. Items created continue to work in other worlds, but they won’t be replaced if lost or stolen, and consumables created will not restock. 300cp covers every feat you’ll need to make just about anything from this world. You could also create some custom items, with enough experimentation and resources spent."
300,Mysterious Serum,Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha,"Fascinating. These test tubes contain a colorless serum that, when ingested, allow one to ‘awaken’ the Linker Cores of sentient beings, allowing them to naturally use this world’s magic after a little bit of training with it. Note that individuals like Nanoha are exceptions to the rule, and will be in futureworlds as well - unless they had a particular affinity for magic or some way to boost their arcane power, you’re unlikely to find anyone who starts with a Natural Ability higher than A. You receive eight of these, along with the formula on how to create more - though it’s encoded and you’ll have to decipher it. If you have ‘Ancient Knowledge’, you already know how to make more on your own from the get-go. Magical ability growth for individuals outside of this world tend to plateau at S-rank on their own. Bear that in mind.
Device Meister (Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha)
This is the real treasure of the TSAB’s technological capabilities - mixing the use of magic and technology in order to create Devices that can channel the energy outwards. You have a complete knowledge of how to build and maintain Devices, along with how to program AI for said Devices to use. While you can construct most Devices and similar items presented here, the ability to make Unison Devices isn’t included here - you’ll have to learn that one on your own, and many have tried and failed to do so in the past. You could, with some experimentation, combine different magical systems into Devices together, especially with the help of ‘SimilarPrinciples’ to streamline the process… it will take some trial and error, but you could apply these principles and Devices to other systems if you work at it enough."
300,Spice Gas Tanks,Frank Herbert’s Dune,"Would you like enough orange Spice Gas to fill a Guild Heighliner? Then buy this. This is enough to fill all the living and working sections of an oversized Heighliner... and all it holds as well, to one atmosphere. It comes in high tech canisters, each canister large enough to hold a liter of water under standard temperature and pressure, but actually containing enough gas that, were it under standard pressure, it would fill a hundred cubic meters. It restocks once a jump or once every twenty years, whichever comes first. This shit is highly addictive and mutative and easily crosses the blood-brain barrier."
300,Tailor,Kill La Kill,"You have the knowledge of how to safely work with life fibers, and how to make them into clothing that empowers (or inhibits) the wearer. In addition, because you know how Life Fiber uniforms work, you know their weak spots better than anyone."
300,The Arcane Craft,Sword & Sorcery,"As much as you might look down upon brutes and barbarians who know only how to break bone and spill blood, you and the warriors of this land have one thing in common. You require the tools of your trade. You know all the methods and ways to bind arcane and mysterious forces into physical vessels. Rings, staves, talismans, warded stone towers, and even more. These items allow the channeling of such forces to work your will, capturing, bending, and shaping the worlds invisible tides to enable works of sorcery and occult splendor. The strength of these items and their effects rely on your skill, knowledge, and power. Of course, should you yourself be a font of such forces from your varied lives then you would be surely capable of building the focuses and talismans to augment and amplify your power. The world rewards men for diligent labor. It would behoove you to refine this art to get everything you can out of it. This also includes the skill to use such items, even those not made by your hand, should you have the ability to reveal their secrets."
400,Badgesmith,Paper Mario,"There are objects in this world called badges, which when worn are capable of granting new capabilities or modifying existing ones. How these come into being has been a mystery, but not to you. You know how to create badges, although you will only be able to recreate existing ones at first. With time and practice I'm certain you will be able to design new badges all your own."
400,Better Living,Runepunk,"At the end of the day, everything is made of chemicals. You can break down anything for the needed ingredients for your serums, combine elements perfectly on the first try, and easily discover wholly new combinations. You can combine any two or three drugs or serums into a new whole that has all their desirable effects and no unpleasant side-effects."
400,Enchantment,Silmarillion,"The Elves are capable of great works of Enchantment, able to infuse their spirits into things they create and tie into the natural forces of Arda. Rings of power, magical orbs that can see far distance, runes of power crafted alongside the Dwarves. You are an expert on the path of enchantment. Non-weapon enchanted items are your expertise and with enough time and training you could potentially create a ring of power to rival even that of Sauron or craft something in the like of the mighty Silmarils."
400,Iterative Improvement,/tg/ Worm,"Each day you gain a certain amount of charge, which you can spend to effectively “enchant” objects with superpowers. The more charge you invest in a particular object, the more you can improve and expand its abilities. A single day's charge would give an object a minor power, but over time you can increase it with no upper limit beyond your investment. These objects only work for you unless you make it otherwise. As you use your power, experiment with it, and it matures from conflict and experience, the amount of charge you gain per day will increase. You can hold about a month’s worth of charge at any one time, any more will be wasted."
400,Power Ring,With This Ring,"The most powerful weapon in the universe. Pick any canon color of Power Ring save White or Black. Your ring has one full charge, a functional AI, no database, and no Lantern. A Power Ring is a ridiculously useful item: AI capable of no-selling most tech, constructs that can scale up to affect planetary conditions, a nano-fabrication suite, sensors with ridiculously long range, capable of high level biokinesis with the right scans or database, and duplication if provided access to enough power.
Additionally, if a Lantern Corps of the appropriate color exists, they have no knowledge of your ring’s existence. This means that green rings and blue rings do not have Guardian malware and yellow rings do not have Qwardian adware. While using a power ring against an opponent who is more aligned to the appropriate emotion might normally result in your ring being ripped off your finger and stolen, or your ring ripping off your finger as it attempts to reach a more appropriate bearer, rings purchased here will not leave you under their own power. Rings can still be stolen, but if you lose your ring (or it is destroyed) then it (or a replacement) will reappear in your Warehouse in six hours, as will anything you placed in your Ring’s subspace inventory, and any data or macros you downloaded or programmed into your ring. No malware or data placed on your lost or stolen ring by a third party will be included in your new ring. Furthermore, you may purchase multiple rings of the same or different colors. Wielding multiple rings of one color boosts your maximum battery charge.
Each color of ring has the benefits listed previously, and every color ring has further specialized abilities, though listing every potential use of a Power Ring would exceed the capacity of this document.
Red Rings form a corrosive aura and allow their bearers to spew rage plasma, an incredibly caustic substance that burns through almost anything.
Orange Rings are capable of identity theft, which can turn any foe capable of feeling avarice into a persistent orange construct loyal to the ringbearer.
Yellow Rings grow stronger if the bearer inspires fear in others, or if the bearer is surrounded by fear.
Green Lantern Rings form stronger constructs than most other rings and have less mental effect on the wearer than other color rings.
Blue Lantern Rings can strengthen Green Lanterns and weaken Red, Orange, and Yellow Lanterns and their light will heal with far greater speed and efficiency than other rings. They can also slowly recharge from ambient hope without relying on a Lantern
Indigo Lantern Rings can mimic the effects of other rings, are particularly well suited for forming portals and wormholes, and increase the compassion of those exposed to the Indigo Light.
Violet Lantern Rings are immune to the powers of the Orange Light, and can sense and empower love in themselves and others.
Additionally, rings purchased here all contain a macro that allows them to fuse a complete set of seven rings, one of each color listed here, to form a White Power Ring. (This does not come with a MAGA hat.) White Lantern Rings can use all seven previously listed colors and their powers, absorb light/power from other power rings, overpower other rings, and allow the wearer to see and sense souls and life force. They are aligned with the White Light of Life (though “existential joy” would perhaps be a better descriptor of the emotion that empowers them)"
400,Life Fiber Spool,Kill La Kill,"A medium-sized spool of Life Fiber. It's only enough to maybe make a pair of gloves out of, but with the proper knowledge, one could create Goku Uniforms- Or enhance existing articles of clothing to be like Goku Uniforms. One spool of thread is enough to make several one-star outfits, three two-star outfits, or a single three-star outfit, assuming you have the knowledge of how to work with Life Fibers."
500,Elven Enchantment,Lord of the Rings,"You can enchant objects, if you pour energy into them as they are created. Some of your enchantments are useful in battle, such as swords that never dull and bows that always strike true, but most are simply to ease the life of the wearer, such as cloaks that weigh nothing and aid in hiding and water-flasks that never leak. You may also perform great workings, such as the creation of hidden doorways, given time."
500,Valkyrie Core Knowledge,BAHHSCQ,"You understand the science behind Valkyrie Core technology. You’ll be able to replicate aspects of its technology such as the ability to store and modify objects in a pocket dimension or the manifesting of Impeller fields, or the insane processing power of the Core itself. With time and a little work you’ll be able to make new cores."
600,Charged Blade,Valeria Bleach,"An immensely powerful construct resembling a sword. Developed by Urahara in a year’s time under normal circumstances, this sword houses an immense amount of spiritual energy contributed by the captains of the Gotei 13, among other Shinigami. However, despite the form it takes, and the incredible power it houses, this is not a weapon. This is a tool used to bestow the power of a Shinigami to a human, originally used to completely restore a once crippled Ichigo’s powers. A human who was never a Shinigami would not obtain Shikai or Bankai, but would have immense power as a Shinigami bestowed upon them. Someone who was once a Shinigami, but lost their powers, would instantly be returned to their full power and then some. Simply stab the sword in your target of choice, and the sword will break apart and bestow its power unto them. You will obtain a new “Charged Blade” each Jump, and in future worlds it will obtain the additional functionality of being able to restore any kind of lost power that the stabbed individual once had."
600,Fixatives And Formulations,A Study In Emerald,"O, Wonders! Medicinal Miracles! Your skills must hark back to the arts of Alchemy. It would certainly explain the bizarre concoctions you are now able to create. More than just medicine, these creations somehow interact with the mind, body and soul, sometimes tapping into quite supernatural effects. Powders to divide the soul in two; elixirs to restore vigor and life to the elderly and frail as though the Elixir of Youth, and medicines which treat the maladies of the spirit; these and more all lie in your purview to invent, concoct and manufacture wholesale for the public’s consumption.
Forging Face (Heaven Will Be Mine) (600)
Ship-selves are some of the most important features of this setting, and now you have the insight to understand how they work and how they’re built. Tinkering with such machines isn’t just an engineering problem - although if you want to put the elbow grease in, you’ll find the science and engineering quite soluble - rather, each ship-self is a delicate marriage of self, steel, and plastic, and each pilot is a reason to create something unique, a shining variable.
With this understanding, you’re able to adjust and customize all of your creations on every level, from form and fluff to function, and you can also draw genius and creativity from all of these considerations. When you take the time to personalize your creations for the individuals who will use them, you can make leaps of impossible brilliance that you might never otherwise manage, and you can be assured that you’ll be able to make something fitting for them - whether you’re simply building them a giant robot, as is traditional, or some other quixotic and toyetic expression of self."
600,Industry Support,My Hero Academia,"Every hero currently running around out there has a costume of some kind like a full body badge, and equipment that complements their style or Quirk incredibly. Where did you think all that came from?
When it comes to a career in support, it doesn’t matter if no one has heard of you before, you’re easily a top dog in the industry. Costumes and equipment alike are your forte and nobody can deny.
Your costumes are form fitting, flattering, stylish and sturdy, easily standing up to the day in day out beating and stress that those who wear them put them through while keeping them looking amazing.
More importantly, you’re a flat out genius when it comes to this world’s technology, making the various gadgets, machines and equipment that can take an okay Quirk to the next level.
Elemental powers lacking in range or accuracy? You could design tools for that. Super strength, speed or some other physical ability putting stress on your body? You have the solution.
If there’s something someone needs to shore up a power’s strengths or weaknesses, you can probably think up and build something over the weekend. You’ll just need the tools, resources and a healthy dose of imagination."
600,Knowledge is Power,Kamen Rider Neo-Heisei Part 1,"You’ve reached the pinnacle of your understanding of Gaia’s Nature. You can now ‘condense’ information on a single TANGIBLE SUBJECT into a small ribcage-like implement known as a Gaia Memory. The more complete your knowledge of the information on that subject is, the more ‘potent’ that implement becomes. While normally you require a Living Connector to shoot up- I mean USE these Gaia Memories, the ones you make can be freebased-I Mean used directly. When you insert a Gaia Memory into your body, it fills your body with a powerful transformative energy, creating a powerful monstrous ‘shell’ around you! The powers granted by this are often germane to the subject, but they usually aren’t anything world-cracking. The absolute strongest shown is Utopia, which gave powerful telekinetic abilities, but nothing on the level of omnipotence or major reality-bending. Not only that, but unless you have some way of getting absolutely complete knowledge on a subject(like a connection to the True Gaia Memory), you’ll often create incomplete memories that only grant small fractions of their true potential. Still, a Dopant(as the monstrous shell is called) is undefeatable by any mortal weaponry and often a single ‘complete’ Dopant is enough to present a major problem for the Kamen Rider of Fuuto city. With this, you can weaponize the ideas you’ve learned...Truly, Knowledge is Power."
600,Clear Memory,Kamen Rider Neo-Heisei Part 1,"Gaia Memories are truly devious little things when you first find them. For one thing, they need living connectors just to be used at all. When you DO get them jacked in, it’s very quickly clear that they become harmful and addictive, with frequent abusers finding their bodies extremely vulnerable to bursts of supernatural energy like Limit Breaks and Maximum drives...Just ask the Weather dopant. Of course, like any natural resource, it just takes a little brilliance to refine it to your liking. You have the secrets required to take the rough, disgusting T1 Gaia Memories and refine them, creating Memories that are usable without connectors and without the addictive side-effects, though they’ll be limited in power compared to raw Memories. In addition, you now have the skills required to create Memory Drivers, using these refined Memories to transform people into Kamen Riders! Tweaking memories is also within your grasp, though you only have the ability to start adjusting them, with the secrets that lead to the powerful Weather dopant being out of your grasp at the outset. In time, you will be able to adjust them so well. Not only that, but you are able to learn the secrets of how to use Gaia Memories as both power sources and create technology that utilizes or interacts with Gaia Memories such as the Memory Enhancers, the Lost Drivers or the Memory Weapons similar to the Jumper Magnum."
600,Master Chemist,Limitless,"Your knowledge of chemistry is matched only by Apocryphon, the mysterious scientist who wants to give the world a ‘dose of truth’. You can mass produce the unproducible, creating chemical serums that improve the human body far beyond the limits of biology. So long as you can analyze it, you can tweak it, find cheaper alternatives for it, re-engineer it to the point of unrecognizability, get any of the bugs out or add your own. This perk is most effective with chemistry but it also boosts your skill with potion making, and all other alchemical pursuits.
NZT-48 (0-200-300 CP)
You have some pills of NZT-48. This amazing pill lets you easily master many abilities related to the brain, including perfect recall, increased learning speed (fast enough to master the piano in three days), peak human charisma, peak human dexterity and reflexes, hypercompetence, superhuman instincts, peak human sensory absorption, instant analysis, and nigh-unshakable confidence. Unfortunately, the things you learn while using NZT are typically not fully available to you once it wears off.
For free, you receive a replenishing supply, and the formula for, a version that has a few minor, minor side effects during withdrawal or even with continued usage: memory loss, extreme paranoia, blurred vision, hearing difficulties, psychosis, missing time, skin lesions, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and Limp Dick Syndrome. So yeah, there is a trade-off for genius in a pill.
For 200 CP, you can get a replenishing supply of, and the formula for, an injectable substance based on a cyclical enzyme system, partially developed by Piper Baird, that temporarily makes one immune to the side effects... in case you want to control the distribution of NZT. You also have access to a version that grants permanent immunity. If you do not purchase this option, the in-jump version of this cyclical enzyme system will not work in future jumps. The enzymes are free if you have the capstone booster and Master Chemist.
For 300 CP, you have a replenishing supply of, and the formula for, a version of NZT-48 that has no side effects. If you do not purchase this option, you will be unable to upgrade the base version to remove the side effects. This version is free for those who purchase the capstone booster.
For each of these formulas, you may choose to have them work for others or not in future worlds, enabling mass production. However, if they work, others will be able to reverse engineer them so pick your poison. If you choose for them not to work for others, you’ll have to oversee the production personally, but the compounds will be immune to analysis."
600,Memento Of The Soul,Hollow Knight,"Now this is an interesting talent you’ve learned. And a very, very profitable one. You have learned some of the methods behind the creation of Charms. Charms are often formed from the coalescence of the SOUL of a deceased, refined into a trinket. These trinkets can give small powers, larger charms granting more, smaller granting less. These can range from simply moving faster and hitting harder to very unique abilities. By harvesting the SOUL of another, you’ve learned to infuse it into a base, empty charm. The more you put in, the more power the charm possesses, but the more slots it takes up. What you get depends on what you put in. For instance, infusing the SOUL of a flying bug might be able to lower your weight, or grant the ability to glide. It will never give you the whole of an ability, only a facsimile.
(Capstone Boosted - Voidheart)
Your power at manipulating the SOULs of others into trinkets of power is quite versatile. The Void offers a chance to find new sources of power, though. Power from within. Allows you to create Charms from your own SOUL, forming them into Charms resembling some of your capabilities. In addition, you have figured out the secrets behind the creation of Charm Notches, and have increased your personal maximum to 16. The same rules apply, and further info can be found below in the “Memento of the Soul” section of notes."
600,Pagan Science,/tg/ Symphogear,"You've managed to uncover some of the secrets of old, the very same knowledge that underlies 'Sakurai Theory', the theoretical basis of the Symphogear system. With this knowledge, many of the more mysterious functions of the Symphogears become clear. You can repair and install new functions into Symphogears, that manipulate existing features, like forcing a berserk state or tuning it to raise synchronization coefficients. What's more, your glimpses into Sakurai theory indicate some possibilities of inducing Human-Relic fusion, but to complete the theory you'll need an existing test subject…
(Capstone Boosted - Implanted Relic)
Looking through some of the notes made by Finé's reincarnation, you manage to glean the mechanism behind the energy-mass converter used to create the armor of a Symphogear. While you would still need a Relic to make a proper Symphogear, you can use this to store armor and weapons in the form of a small necklace, simply requiring that the user be able to sing the activation song to use."
600,Power Lantern,With This Ring,"Pick any canon color of power ring and receive an appropriately colored Maltusian power source. For most colors, this is a power lantern of the same color, but Indigo users would receive a staff rather than a lantern. If you purchased a Power Ring of the same color as your Lantern, your ring gains a full database of stellar maps and technologies. The database contains an amount of knowledge equivalent to a standard Green Power Ring, with specialized focus depending on its color. Green Rings receive more detailed information about Oa and the surrounding systems. Yellow receive additional information about Qward. Orange Rings are centered around Maltus. All other colors similarly have additional information about the area in which it would normally have been forged.
Furthermore, this Lantern is stable without being connected to a Central Power Battery, and as such cannot be shut off by external manipulation. It is not limited in the number of times it can recharge power rings in a day.
Note: Even Colors that typically do not have individual power sources, such as White Lantern Rings and Black Lantern Rings, can gain a reliable power source here.
If your Lantern is damaged enough to cease functioning or stolen, a replacement will appear in your warehouse in six hours.
Lantern Corps (With This Ring) (Scenario Reward)
As a reward for your work, your Lantern Corps will follow you on your Jumpchain, your own skill manipulating your Light will reach master level (if it isn’t already at that point), and you will gain the abilities and skills necessary to serve as a Clarissi, Illustres, Instructor, or Therapist (or equivalent officer) for your corps or any similar large, superpowered law enforcement organizations."
600,The Nanite Project,Reddit Generator Rex,"You aren’t just one more of the many scientists studying the nanites and the EVOs, but, instead, you’re one of the scientists that directly worked in the Nanite Project. You understand how and why the nanites work and act. You could even create your own nanites, with enough resources and time. You also know how to control other nanites, be using some kind of control interface, like a control nanite, or reprogramming them. If used in the right way, reprogramming the nanites within an EVO could turn them back to their original form, amplify their abilities or even give back their normal appearance to them while maintaining the benefits of being an EVO. Reprogramming the nanites of a normal living being can instead give specific mutations to them, instead of random ones. It’s possible to create other forms of technology using nanites as a basis, like nano-tattoos or human-to-machine interfaces. As a legacy of the Nanite Project, you can find a way to complete the nanites to turn them into a way to end starvation, diseases and even death, but this is a work for many years.
I think it isn’t necessary to say that the Meta-Nanites are beyond your understanding.
(Capstone Boosted - Omega-2 Nanite)
Well, I was wrong, because you weren’t just more one of the responsible for the creation of the nanites, because, instead, you could even say that you were the main responsible for their creation, as the head scientist of the Nanite Project. No one in the entire world understands the nanites better than you. You know the full potential of these microscopic machines and know how to programate them to grant any kind of mutation that was shown in the canon universe. You can build any of the two kind of control nanites, like the Omega Nanite (a human-to-machine interface capable of apparently amplifying an EVO’s abilities and create an unlimited supply of nanites) and the Alpha Nanite (a machine-to-machine interface in the shape of a sentient nanite swarm), with enough resources. You could even program your nanites to just obey you.
Now, let’s talk about the more important part: the Meta-Nanites. Firstly, you learned the main concept behind their working: Nanites specifically created to tap into/contain a portion of the power of cosmic forces (for example, the Dominion Code in the Generator Rex’s world). Post-jump, you can create special nanites to contain or have access to similar forces, like the Phoenix Force, the Speed Force, the Source, the Paths or even magic systems themselves. Unfortunately, unless you have fiat-backed access to these forces, the nanites will be unable to maintain full access to them outside their home universes/dimensions, having just, at least, fiat-backed access to 20% of their full power. These special nanites will be very hard to create, requiring many rare resources and extra study in-jump. Secondly, no, you can’t replicate the Meta-Nanites, because the Dominion Code is fully contained inside the original Meta-Nanites."
800,Divine Skill,Valeria Bleach,"Every single Shinigami who has been raised to the vaunted heights of Squad Zero has accomplished something incredible. Each one is a master of a skill to a level considered impossible to all others, taking something useful but mundane and making it akin to the work of a god. One is a swordsmith, whose works are the Zanpakuto that form the core of Shinigami power. One a seamstress whose ordinary clothes withstand attacks with ease from all but the greatest Captains. The oldest among them is a monk who has given names to all things and controls the very names themselves, giving great power over the world.
While you may not necessarily have been offered a place yet, though also possessing sufficient
power may change this, you have mastered a certain skill or idea to a similar level as the current members. Skills are obvious and described both above and below but ideas are also possible. Ichibe’s title as the one who names others has allowed him to manipulate names as a concept, altering or controlling others through their names. In his sealed form, this is largely limited to an innate knowledge of all names, the ability to draw power from others speaking his name and to lay notably powerful curses or other effects on names that activate when spoken.
Whatever you pick allows for incredible uses and techniques just on it’s own, such as the above techniques described. It’s almost certain that you have also created some great invention connected to your chosen skill, which may have already spread through Soul Society and brought fame to your name. A master of Kido who created stick-shaped implements that allow even a beginner to work powerful magics, a swordmaster whose written lessons have revolutionised Zanjutsu by introducing magical techniques not connected to release forms or kido, perhaps even something like an author whose stories have inspired and directed the afterlife again and again.
However your skill and the accompanying great invention appear, there is a second aspect to this option. Whatever your skill or idea is, it is also linked directly to your Zanpakuto. Releasing your Zanpakuto will greatly expand what you are able to accomplish with your skill. This works in concert with it’s existing abilities, which may alter the form of the blade and the powers to complement each other better. Ichibe’s Shikai, a large brush which could manipulate ink, allowed him to suppress and erase others by covering them, and thus their names, in black ink. His Bankai grew this to the point that he could directly change or give new names to beings, with the properties of their new name becoming true. The most powerful warrior reduced to the strength of a helpless ant, as that is what his name had become. Your Zanpakuto releases will likely be supercharged by this process, greatly improving the existing powers as a result of them combining with such divine skill. It is also worth remembering that these powers are not without limit. The released state of this skill will require your spiritual energy to operate and some uses, though theoretically possible, may be of too great a magnitude to actually work.
Those without a Zanpakuto can eventually unlock independent release states that give access to two increased levels of power with your chosen divine skill. These two release stages will drain your energy similar to a Shikai and Bankai but at least allow access to your full potential."
