0,Aura,RWBY,"Aura is the manifestation of a person’s soul. Now that yours has been unlocked, you can call upon it to protect you, summoning it as a forcefield that cloaks your body. This must be activated manually, but once sufficiently trained, you can keep it on with almost no concentration. It can also heal minor wounds and is used to power your semblance. Your aura grows in proportion to your soul, and your soul grows as you become more powerful. Aura passively increases the physical ability of those who have it, placing them at low superhuman levels. You can channel your aura into weapons and armor to increase their durability and offensive capabilities. With some experimentation, you might even learn to directly enhance your strikes with your aura. Aura is also used to activate Dust, the main energy propellant of Remnant. Lastly, those with aura can also unlock the auras of others with a bit of self-reflection on the nature of their own soul."
0,Basic Training,RWBY,"You have the bare minimum fitness and training to be a student at a combat academy. This isn’t anything super special, but you’ll know how to use dust based weapons as well as dust in it’s basic forms. You also gain training with the weapon that you build in the module below."
0,Spiral Energy,Gurren Lagann,"A mysterious but incredibly powerful evolutionary force that can be harnessed and manipulated by living beings. Spiral Energy can allow an individual to achieve virtually anything imaginable, but in order to keep things from getting too crazy you’ll have to slowly unlock your Spiral powers over time. Initially you’ll only have enough power to pilot a Gunmen but with enough time and the right circumstances you can figure out how to generate large powerful drill weapons from your mech that are capable of easily destroying other Gunmen and can cause massive explosions. After a few years of continued use you could potentially learn how to increase your physical abilities, Intelligence, and natural lifespan to superhuman levels. Once you’ve fully unlocked your Spiral power you’ll be able to live for over a thousand years, punch apart small Gunmen with your bare hands, discover and forge incredible technological wonders, and generate drills and other constructs from Spiral Energy without the assistance of a mech."
0,"This Is, Actually, Rocket Science",Kerbal Space Program,You gain an instinctive grasp and understanding of Delta V and orbital mechanics.
0,Outside Context Problem,Worm,"It’d be boring if you were to just die right at the start so for free you'll have a selective immunity to the powers of a few rather nasty plot device level opponents that by all rights would probably want to kill you right out of the gate. Contessa, Ziz, and Zion's precog doesn't seem to be able to pick you up, instead returning a zero-sum error whenever they try to force the issue. They won't notice this until you garner enough attention for them to try and then they might take further measures to see what the problem is. But at the moment you'll be safe from being instantly killed due to the threat you pose to their plans. This works on all shard/entity derived precog. Your peculiar inter-dimensional nature just messes up their ability to predict you. Coil is an exception due to the weird nature of his power."
100,Mechanic,The Fast and the Furious,"Machines, especially ones that go fast, just speak to you. You have no problem fixing up and tuning any motor vehicle, and can rebuild them after the most devastating crashes. You can keep anything in top condition with just a few simple tools. Of course, you also need to understand the electronics, so hotwiring cars (and sometimes, alarm systems) is not a problem either."
100,Hands Off!,Starcraft II - Nova Covert Ops,"When one is at the forefront of technological development, one sometimes has to watch out for espionage. Why bother developing a revolutionary new weapon system when a Ghost with sticky fingers walks in and takes it? You are able to design, and seamlessly implement security protocols into any technology or equipment you have access to that would limit use to only authorized personnel. You don't even have to go to the extreme of half-breaking it either, that's for neanderthals and inferior scientists."
100,Consummate Knowledge,Ring of Red,"You know everything there is to know about repairing, maintaining, and fueling AFWs. This includes a working knowledge of diesel engines, pneumatic systems, ranged and melee weapon systems, among others."
100,Stylish Mechanic,Gurren Lagann,"In addition to knowing how to repair and create mechanical devices you also have quite a knack at making anything you work on look good. Any time you fix something it'll end up clean and pleasant to look at, and you can easily come up with humorous or awe-inspiring designs for vehicles and devices."
100,Aerospace Engineering Makes Things Go Fast,Kerbal Space Program,"You have an intuitive grasp on the mechanics of wind-flow, material sciences, atmospheric drag, tensile strengths, rocketry, so on and so forth, and how it applies to the art of designing vehicles that traverse the sky and space."
100,Nanite Sciences,Generator Rex,"You possess in depth knowledge of nanite technologies. With sufficient equipment and resources you could produce and control nanite machines, possibly even recreate the nanite event or maybe figure out how to reverse its effects. But that would take a long time of additional study of nanites out in the world, still you might be one of the few who could attempt this endeavor. You possess no knowledge of the meta-nanites, and understanding how they work is beyond your grasp."
100,Chemist,Fallout 4,"Groovy! Knowledge of chemistry has given you the ability to recite the entire periodic table, as well as knowledge of many exciting compounds such as dipotassium phosphate! Oh, and you can also make less exciting things like Stimpacks and Psycho, but why would you do that?"
100,Biocare,Half-Life,"Understanding the nature and health of various animals and plants is second nature to you, even exotic ones. You now have considerable skill in the care of flora and fauna."
100,Efficient Electricity,Generic Video Game Developer,"Energy. Computers, being devices able to calculate AI paths while simultaneously rendering graphics for players to see, use a decent amount of it. Thankfully, you seem to be extra skilled in the area of computer electronics, able to make devices that not only use smaller amounts of energy for the same work, but are also more resilient than the average gaming device, able to handle electrical surges far better than most."
200,Mecha-Shift Engineer,RWBY,"You possess all the engineering knowledge needed to create, maintain, and upgrade the mecha-shift weapons that are used by Huntsmen and Huntresses, and how to apply these design principles to other projects.This translates to the mechanical knowledge to fit large complex machinery into very small forms, as well as machinery that transforms into different shapes like a sniper rifle shifting into a scythe."
200,Insightful Analysis,Freefall,"Whenever you build, invent, scan, design, or perform a major repair on something, you have a clear and accurate understanding of it several decades in advance. The errors, issues, bugs, problems and so on that would be discovered with mass production and mass use of whatever item are clearly understood by you, alongside the fixes and preventative measures that would come into play."
200,"They're Like Legos, Right?",Kerbal Space Program,"There's robust engineering, and then there's modularity. Pick one. Except for you - you seem to have the gift of designing methods that allow for seamless mixing and matching of modular technology that lack none of the parts incompatibility and fragility you'd except from such a design paradigm. While this seems focused on Kerbin technology in specific, a little work should have you applying such a paradigm to all sorts of technologies..."
200,The Conveyors Will Run On Time,Factorio,"Or you could let a computer do all the work. You have the programming skills needed to automate a massive assembly complex, having dozens, even hundreds of disparate machines working smoothly together. Your skill is enough to program 'fuzzy' logic into your machines. This is far from actual sapience, but they will know not to waste energy or compound problems by blindly following irrelevant, contradictory or self-destructive programming. Your defensive systems also work more intelligently, leading targets, prioritizing more dangerous enemies based on the current situation, and not being distracted by decoys."
200,No capes,The Incredibles,"They snag on things, get caught in turbines, generally get in the way, and not many people can even pull the caped look off... Too much trouble to be worth it. And likewise, you can pick up on the weaknesses in designs extremely quickly, able to remove them or simply attempt to cover all your bases when you create something. Never again shall you create a suit that will fall short or hinder the wearer."
200,ARTIFICER,PREY,"Any monkey with a wrench can look up the technical manual and do a repair. Well, maybe not any monkey, but you're certainly a cut above the rest. Any technology you come across that you understand the principles behind can be drastically improved. Either simplifying it to make it easier to fabricate or improving its durability or power output. Weapons, turrets, tools and vehicles can all be improved beyond their base specs."
200,MEDICAL DOCTORATE,PREY,"Talos has no shortage of medical assistance, keeping the crew in top physical condition and studying the effects of Neuromods on the human psyche. Almost everyone in the Neuromod department has some medical background. Now you do too, either through your own education or through Neuromod injection. Basic medical supplies work better in your hands, sutures are guaranteed to hold through everything but the harshest of abuse and wounds cleaned by you never get infected. With more advanced supplies you're on par with the world's best heart surgeons. As a bonus, you can also identify and remove organs from the Typhon that a rich in the exotic material used in making Neuromods."
200,Schematics to Time,Generic Video Game Developer,"Wasted time is a serious problem for just about any company. And while most managers might think it's because John took an extra 5 minutes for lunch, the real time sink is the direction a project ends up going, as sometimes you go down a rabbit hole trying to fix a problem and take a while to get on the right track, such as looking for a bug in the wrong part of the code. But for you, it's different. For you, every time you settle down to work you get on the right track. From looking for bugs in the right section of code to researching the right function for a problem, your work is now more of a straight line, taking no detours and going down no rabbit holes. If you have a problem, you'll always start in the right place."
200,Short Development Time,Generic Video Game Developer,"Working at a smaller game company means that sometimes you get contracted out by a bigger corporation to make a game, and they want it ASAP. Well, at least now you can work fast enough to keep up with the deadlines. Usually, anyway. Either way, expect to do half again as much work as you would normally get done in the same span of time, all without losing any quality to your work!"
250,Techy,Code Geass,"From Knightmares to guns, you know how to build and improve Geass tech."
300,Bio-science,Generic City of Adventure,"You are a medical professional, trained to provide life-saving first-aid and even perform surgery. In less-than-ideal conditions, if you must. You can diagnose common issues, and can keep up with and assist the super-geniuses when they need an extra hand in the lab to help cure the space plague. Your actual qualifications are rather broad and ill-defined, but mainly focus on keeping your fellow heroes in top shape both physically and mentally.
You are the one heroes consult with when it comes to alien parasites, biotechnology, mysterious diseases, biological weapons, and helping new mutants understand their altered bodies. You have several degrees in assorted biochemical fields, and a few more in fields that haven't been named yet. This is enough know-how to make inroads into organic power armor or vast improvements to the human body, but expect concerns that you've turned evil if you start doing so."
300,Panzerkampf,Sabaton,"When it comes to building war machines, yours are top-notch! A gun made by your own hand will never jam, and a tank built by you will never bog down in mud or take damage from an IED. If they want to destroy what you've built, they'd best bring their A-game."
300,Mechanist,Fallout 4,"You know what makes robots tick or beep. Not only can you repair and create them from scratch, but you can also cobble them together, creating some sort of robotic Frankenstein's Monster that's loyal to you and you alone while also incorporating all of the best components of the robots it's made of."
300,Structural Biology,Half-Life,"The anatomy of specimens, both exotic and usual, is key to understanding how they work. You have an instinctive understanding of how living things work, how tough they are, and how interactions between biochemical reactions work."
400,Most Holy Order of the Socket Wrench,The Fast and the Furious,"You are a master mechanic. Repair and upkeep is nice, but you can go beyond the impossible and improve any vehicle. Take a van and make it beat a supercar? Put NOS injectors on a bicycle (and make it work)? How about something challenging? And anything you can build up you can tear down, too. You're a one-man chop shop and wiring a car to explode takes but a few moments and some chicken wire."
400,Info Processing,Starcraft II - Nova Covert Ops,"You are not always stuck in a lab, you are useful in more areas than just that. You can process information, sensor readouts, intercepted communications, and more importantly, you can apply such knowledge. While others would use such data for tactics, you see opportunity for scientific advancement. The more information you have access to, the better opportunities you see for salvageable materials, technologies, or data. And you can use those to relatively quickly implemenopt a usable and useful technology."
400,Making Do With Less,Freefall,"Is your last name Ambrose or perhaps MacGyver? Any time you use materials, they always seem to just work better than they should. Utterly useless scraps become usable if makeshift repairs and construction. Decent stuff is spun into great, great to esoteric, esoteric to outright absurd results. If used on the same thing twice, it won't enhance previously affected pieces further, though newly added bits would be. So long as you already had the skills, you could get a ship space worthy using only the random stuff that a none too knowledgeable thief happened to scrounge together. If you already had a perk that improved the effective quality/usefulness of materials, this would be added on top of that."
400,Super-Max,Generic City of Adventure,"There's not a single revolving door or scrap of cardboard in the defences you construct. Prisons, team headquarters, space outposts...wherever they are, whatever they're for, you can seamlessly integrate magical or super-tech materials into architecture without compromising function, style or habitability. Marble flooring pressure plates? Electronics mixed with clockwork backups to stymie technopaths? Getting the right mix of anti-demon salt mixed with cement to both look good and still keep them out? Easy. Of course, this perk includes enough architectural skill and artistic flair to make your own jumper-buildings look good, even with a giant glowing insignia on one side."
400,This Is How I Want It,Kerbal Space Program,"Your capability of mentally designing items is vastly boosted. It's almost as if you have a mental idea space in the fashion of a construction bay with a lists of parts you have on hand that gives you an idea of what you can build at that moment... actually, that's pretty much what you have. As a bonus, you can mix and match parts in a manner roughly akin to legos, and giving you an idea of what would work and what wouldn't (and how much resources it would take to build). Mind, this doesn't mean that your mental creation will perform successfully, but it will function."
400,Box-tech,Metal Gear Solid,Cardboard boxes that can produce a smoke cloud? Check. Poison Cigars? Check. A mine-detector the size of a Walkman? Check. Building the sort of gadgets that MGS protagonists rely on is your thing.
400,upgrades! Upgrades!! UPGRADES!!!,Red Faction,"You can make it all better. By studying a piece of technology for a short while, you can come up with ways to improve its functions or fix design flaws, though you'll still need the related technical skills to figure out details. In addition, you can use salvaged materials in lieu of fresh parts for this task."
400,Data Compression,Hive Queen Quest,"As an artificial intelligence being able to move, alter, and compress data is something more than a hobby for you, it is a way of life. As such you are so good at compressing data without harming its function that you could fit an entire artificial intelligence onto a pocket calculator if you had too and it would still work! Copying an entire database to fit onto a usb stick? SIMPLE. Be careful however the internal memory basically works as the life span of an AI, when it runs out the AI dies. Besides you never know when someone may catch on to your little tricks..."
400,We Can Copy Nature,Hive Queen Quest,"Nature is a test bed for amazing adaptations, from birds that explode in bone shrapnel upon death to crablike spiders with webs strong enough to capture and contain sea creatures the size of whales. Learning from nature just makes sense! As a scientist it is your job to learn from nature and apply this knowledge for other purposes, via dissection you can find out how a creature works biologically and create a mechanical proxy to do the same. A creature evolved chitinous spines that fire when startled? That could go great on your tanks, this underwater creature has an organ that causes nausea and blackouts? Put that sucker on a gun. Nature is full of innovations, use them well."
400,Miniaturization/Efficiency,Worm,"You can miniaturize anything down to levels that any sane man would consider impossible. A fusion reactor the size of a watch battery would be the absolute minimum of what you are capable of, and you'd be able to make it far smaller than that. Your power also makes you a master of technological efficiency, anything you make needing barely any energy to run compared to what it should and continue to do so for a very long time. These specialties also make you a master of nanotechnology and similar pursuits. Of course you aren't barred from building something big like a giant robot, just that it'll be impossibly efficient and crammed full of more weapons and subsystems then should be possible"
400,Programming and Computer Science,Worm,"Supercomputers are your bread and butter, and Artificial Intelligence is your idea of a PDA. Data, programs, and digital devices are your playthings, not to mention that your understanding of such systems means you can hack anything that could possibly be hacked. There isn't really any limit on the extent you could push computing hardware, and any kind of software you can imagine is within your grasp. Please do note that flaunting this is likely to attract some attention from a few major players in particular. Then again that might not be a bad thing depending on your disposition and plans."
400,Medical and Biological Science,Worm,"You know how to cure cancer, AIDS, and pretty much everything else. The working of flesh and bone is casual to you, with even the most difficult procedures capable of being performed half asleep and blind in one eye as easily as you breath. You're the perfect medic and doctor, but your skills and knowledge extend much further then that. You could create some truly incredible monsters if you wanted to, whether out of whole cloth or test subjects. Lets not even get started on biological warfare. Biology and anything to manipulate or interact with it are all within your capabilities. From genetic engineering, to human enhancement, to even cloning with the proper samples and resources."
400,Reverse Engineering,Worm,"While you still possess an amount of scientific knowledge beyond the curve of modern society, your base technical knowledge is far less than other Tinkers. This is however because your power lets you reverse engineer the principles and workings of anything you can get your hands on, and then apply that knowledge and understanding to your own work. Just seeing a device and watching it function gives you a vague idea as to how it works, and examining something means you can derive the hows and whys as to its functions. This requires time and effort on your part, in addition to the time and resources it'll take to actually implement this new knowledge, but as long as you put in the necessary investment you can always understand virtually any new technology. Your Tinker abilities will continue to expand as you gain access to new technology and knowledge, with potentially no upper limit as long as you can keep gaining samples to work with."
400,Green Machine,Factorio,"You have a knack for wringing every little bit of efficiency out of a system as possible. Your machines produce less pollution, consume less energy, and work just a little bit faster. On a larger scale, you know how to create a well-organized factory complex that makes efficient use of space, your conveyor system minimizes transport time and is free of bottlenecks, and you easily account for future expansion."
400,I used to design for GODS,The Incredibles,"And your skill is a testament to that lofty ideal. Designing things to be bold, dramatic, heroic, and just plain look good is as easy as breathing to you. Now the equal of Edna Mode herself, you'll most likely be asked to design for ""super""models in Milan on a regular basis... but it's just not the same, Dahling. Your real skill lies with the Super fashion after all, and Super Suits is what you excel in. To the point that you could even make people look good in spandex."
400,OVER CLOCKED NEUROLOGY,PREY,"Professor William James of Harvard used to say that the average man develops only ten percent of his latent mental ability. What if you could flip a switch and develop the rest of it in a moment? It's not as simple as a switch, but with the neural reprogramming ability of Neuromods it will feel like it. With this modification you can instead go days without sleep, operating at your peak, which is now far above your baseline. Better still, with this your Psi threshold is increased, meaning that special abilities can be maintained for longer and used more often before you need an injection."
400,Ultra-High Settings,Generic Video Game Developer,"While many may wish they had the beastly computers needed to run games on max settings, many don't. But why should we limit the beauty of your art for such a mundane reason? Your art and animations are such that no matter how hi-res the models or complex the animation it will have a minimal, if any, impact on how well your game runs. This also applies to other items and products you help create, meaning even the shittiest of computers or consoles can run your game at the highest resolution without suffering too much, while products like swords can have designs might seem to hinder a user's ability to swing it when in fact it's just as usable as a normal one."
400,One Hit Wonder,Generic Video Game Developer,"For whatever reason, you have the ability to make some of the best games possible, using your skills to the fullest of their potential. Whatever game you make, and so long as you put in some effort, it will have a quality to it that makes it enjoyable for just about anyone to play, and if it gets big enough in the media and market it could easily be known as one of the best games of the year, and possibly even of all time. And despite the name, this isn't limited to a one-time thing. As a bonus, this is one of several capstone boosters that will boost any 600cp perks you have purchased to even further heights."
500,Commencing Operations,Franken Fran,"As an accomplished surgeon, you know the best ways to cut people up and put them back together with a minimum of fuss and damage.
Cosmetics: Make people look just like their dreams come true. Grecian perfection? Sure! Picasso's Cubism? Take a number! The only limit is your imagination! (No augments apply)
Transplants: Transplant fully functional organs between genders, ages, blood types and species. Biochemical barriers, what's that? Organs must be mostly intact.
Trauma: If they're still warm and bleeding, they ain't dead yet. Not when you get your hands on them. I can't say much for their condition, but they will stabilize.
Disease: You practically write the book on contagions, lord knows how many you've made. Even knowledge of parasites and poisons won't be far from you. A cure is swift to follow.
Mental: Through drugs, surgery, hypnosis and or therapy, the mental scars are as much your domain as anything else. Cure neuroses with year-long processes in mere days or hours, resolve memory loss and even carve personalities and minds to any shape."
600,Swiss Army Engineer,Ring of Red,"Most AFWs are designed by whole teams of engineers spending months, if not years, getting all the complicated systems to work together just right. But you can do it all on your own. You know how to build all AFW types from the ground up and don't have to worry about all the tedious fine-tuning most do. With further research and some time, you're confident that you can incorporate weaponry from other Jumps, albeit in a grungy, era-appropriate way."
600,Always a Bigger Robot,Gurren Lagann,"The design and maintenance of epic machines is your specialty. You can figure out how to build starships measuring several kilometers long or devise a way to make a mountain sized mecha. You'll also have no problems getting past all the laws of physics that should make such creations impossible, perhaps Spiral Energy has something to do with it?"
600,Anti-Nanite Technology,Generator Rex,"You are highly trained in the sciences Providence employs to combat EVO's and nanites. You can build just about any weapon or technology employed by Providence or even the Consortium.
You can build Power Armor that protects from nanites and can go toe to toe with EVOs, heavy mecha chassis with tons of firepower, and even learn how to protect machines from technopathy or nanite infestation.
Note: As per notes, you can't build the meta-nanites either, all of the tech options are empty when it comes to building them."
600,Firestorm,Sabaton,"When someone absolutely, positively needs artillery good enough to reduce the greatest castle to rubble, they come to you and accept no substitutes. You can throw a cannon together from scraps and it will still outperform the best mortars of the age. Moreover, in other worlds, if you can understand the weapon, you can produce something 1.1 times as strong with the items you would find in a rubbish heap, provided they're of equal size to the device they're replicating."
600,A new age of warfare,Metal Gear Solid,"Metal Gear, a weapon capable of bringing an entire nation to its knees (in theory) your engineering talents have extended to the point you can create these war machines, even automate them with AI, provided you have enough time and resources. With box-tech you can also invent things like man-portable railgun and stealth camo."
600,Nano-Technician,Red Faction,"Is it me or does nanomachines not sound like a word anymore? You now have a considerable talent in the field of nanotech. With time and study, you could recreate the Nanoforge, with dedication you could even improve on it. Keep in mind nanotech in this setting is exceptionally hard to work with, but can do anything from fixing a bridge, to disintegrating a starship, to enhancing human abilities."
600,SCIENCE!,Fallout 4,"The secrets of SCIENCE are laid bare before you! You now have the knowledge to build incredibly advanced machinery, given enough time and resources; teleportation devices, working cryogenics chambers, sentient AI, machines capable of cloning or creating living beings, even lasers that are blue instead of red! You can also make pre-war things like Fusion Cores or Laser Rifles easily enough."
600,Biology As A Guideline,Franken Fran,"Grow freaky biological monstrosities like pheromone spewing fungi and living theme park mascots. Modify animals into things from mythology. Graft human heads onto animal bodies and vice versa. Create life! With just this you might not be as good as a Madaraki, maybe a Moreau, but you're a convincing substitute."
600,Legendary Master: Cooking,Rimworld,"You’re an expert culinarian. You could make a dish worthy of kings with nothing more than dried rice and stringy wolf meat. In addition to boosts in production speed and efficiency, you will always be recognized in any future Jumps as a chef of renown. All prepared by you gives a not-insignificant boost to mood, additionally positive effects of any cooking you do are much greater. That muffin baked with trace amounts of healing root? Before it could fix a scratch or two, now it regenerates limbs."
600,Legendary Master: Construction,Rimworld,You're an expert architect capable of realizing truly magnificent and strange buildings. You know exactly how to balance the weight of any given structure to prevent collapse and can utilize even the weakest materials to support whole mountains. You are uniquely capable of reproducing or near reproducing almost any large-scale structure given appropriate resources. If you know how to produce something you innately understand how to build the facilities needed to manufacture/maintain it.
600,Light of Order,Overwatch,"The Vishkar corporation is a corrupt organization controlled by those with no empathy for the common people. They commit murder and corporate espionage while enslaving the poor under the guise of helping them and spreading order. But you must admit, their technology is rather impressive. Focusing primarily on hard-light technology, they used this miraculous invention to create entire cities, which their architects can reshape at-will.
Knowledge of how to create and use this technology is now yours, though the Vishkar corporation will likely not take kindly to this if they learn of it. Not only can you create hard-light technology, but also their other devices, including energy weapons, teleporters, and weapons that utilize soundwaves to heal or damage others."
600,Guardian Angel,Overwatch,"Doctor Angel Zieger, also known as Mercy, was renowned as an unparalleled medical genius even in her teens, being recruited to the medical division of Overwatch before she was even 18 and becoming the head of a hospital even before that. Her medical skills have literally brought the dead back to life and her technology is so advanced that it seems like magic. there is no one in the world able to even compare to her in her area of expertise. No one, that is, save for you.
Your base medical knowledge is encyclopedic, your hands are almost mechanically accurate when performing surgery. Your technology is advanced to almost impossible standards, including things such as a staff that can engage a healing stream to rapidly regen people from a distance. Your knowledge may even allow you to slow the rate of aging."
600,The Flesh is Strong,Hive Queen Quest,"The hive thrives on the strength of its parts, every drone born for a specific job, every life a cog in the mighty machine working for the good of all, all serving the queen. Through long hours of research (and the hard work of your thinkers) you have learned to assimilate not only the tools of nature to add to your drones strength but also the tools of others. With study you can replicate machinery as biotech, studying a vibrating blade powered by servos for instance may allow you to recreate it by growing a chitinous blade powered by micro muscles while studying a ships blink drive may allow you to grow your own out of hundreds of interlocking ""cog"" drones. As a plus should you be a queen you can apply these changes to your children before you lay their egg, altering their form as you see fit to grant them the boons of technology and nature from birth."
600,Anti-Mass Physics,Half-Life,"Knowledge of exotic matter and its properties, as well as its interactions with normal matter. This knowledge gets you into the technological base for the devices found here, such as teleporters, dark matter weapons, and gravity manipulation among other things."
600,Life Shaper,Half-Life,"Your experience with the biotechnology of the world beyond has left you with profound insights. Through specialized bio-implants you now have, you are capable of directing the growth and capabilities of created creatures on a scale from large muscle groups to microcellular structures."
600,Bamboo technology,Factorio,"It's hard enough to build something as complex as a rocket without advanced synthetic materials and rare earth metals for maximum performance. You know how to push the mechanical limits of the most common elements through creative means to construct things far past what should be possible, allowing you to construct high-tech devices with low-tech materials. You could easily build something on par with the main battle tanks of the 21st century with iron plates and cheap plastic, powered by coal. Just don't try to build your rocket out of actual bamboo."
600,Tech Tree,Factorio,"Science is a messy process, requiring the study of dozens of disparate phenomena, looking for patterns, finding ways to use that information to build stuff that incorporates what you've learned, and then mashing it all together to get an 'invention.' Now you can take some of the guesswork out of it. When you desire to build something, you know just what you need to study to make that thing a reality.  Want to get a rocket into orbit? You'll know what factors you need to focus on when working on the math needed and what kinds of materials you have (or don't have) that would be the best fit for the conditions it'll be put through on its journey. If you are completely lacking knowledge of a subject or phenomena, then you'll still know where to start studying to refine the tools that will lead you to a new field of study that will help you make a new set of tools, and so on, and so on. Keep in mind that it may take you a very, very long time to create new fields of SCIENCE entirely on your own."
600,"And Machine Washable, dahling",The Incredibles,"Of course looking good isn't all there is to a good Suit. It also needs to be very sturdy, comfortable, withstand extreme temperatures, be bulletproof, specialized to complement the wearer's powers, and yet breathe like egyptian cotton. Oh, and be machine washable, that's a new feature. So, it's a good thing that you're able to create specialized Super Suits like these for virtually any kind of powers. Suits that stretch with elastic Supers, that go invisible with an invisible Super, and much more. With time you could even find ways to incorporate armor and electronics into your skin-tight suits. It may not be able to do everything... but it can do a hell of a lot more than it should be able to. And of course you also get the ability to create general technology to help out with your work, like high-tech sewing machines, laser turrets built into ceilings, and bulky invisibility generators…"
600,I Save the Best Invention for Myself,The Incredibles,"Not every superhero has powers, you know. You can be super without them. Especially if you're a certified genius, capable of inventing amazing technology and weaponry the likes of which the world has never seen before. You will need considerable resources to create your best work... but countries would pay through the nose to get their hands on even your lesser works, so that's not much of a limit. Soon you may be able to create many great things including but not limited to rocket boots, explosives, death robots, remote drones, actual learning AI, energy prisons, and even harnessing zero-point energy for use in energy rays or to power your creations."
600,"REPAIR, REUSE, RECYCLE",PREY,"Neuromods aren't the only revolutionary technology developed on Talos I. The ability to break down components to their constituent materials and dividing them into 4 categories of materials which can be used by a fabricator to make almost anything. These are divided into Synthetic, Mineral, Organic and Exotic. You know all the ins and outs of this technology, able to make it more precise in dividing up material up to the elemental level or divide new materials at the cost of a little more energy. Scaled up you could use these devices to quickly refine mined material strip mined from a planet and use them to mass produce buildings and vehicles. The energy required to make the item is directly proportional to their complexity and size."
600,MASTER OF THE MIND,PREY,"The knowledge to create Neuromods. We're not just talking about those hypos with exotic material either, but to be able to create the programs that you upload to the mind itself. With this, all the secrets of the human mind are laid bare to you, if you look at an active neuron you could tell what it's function is in the mind. You can take the scans the specific skills of anyone and create a new Neuromod suitable for human use. Skills can be recorded through mere observation utilising a device called a Psychoscope, though the skill you wish to collect must be being practiced by the target or be a significant part of their personality. A great musician doesn't need to be composing in order for you to scan him for his musical talent, but if you wanted his ability to cook you'd need to scan him while he was cooking. It has also been demonstrated to be possible to install abilities from alien biology, providing the user has access to sufficient quantities of any special material the ability relies on and they're okay with hybridising their biology with the species."
600,Lost Art,Generic Video Game Developer,"You are now an expert of the lost art, the art of code efficiency. Any code and software you make will now be far more efficient, using up far less resources for the same results and running significantly faster than most standard code. Your game would normally be 16GB and requires 8GB of RAM? Now it uses half that, at least. Game causing lag and crashing because too much is going on? Not anymore. Whatever you code, it'll run fast, and it'll run well.
Capstone Boost: Not only are your games and programs highly efficient, but your code is also highly modular, meaning that new additions are incredibly easy to implement. Your code is also supernaturally efficient, using significantly less memory and resources than should be possible while maintaining the same results and quality while also making your games even faster."
600,Making Virtual a Reality,Generic Video Game Developer,"First came the controller, then much later motion sensing, and later still Virtual Reality, with the future holding untold possibilities. But not for long. You have the ability to design and create just about any kind of hardware imaginable, with such marvels as game controllers that shape themselves to their user’s hands or real life holodecks being well within your grasp should you have enough time. This works beyond the scope of video game technology, as well, allowing you to make things like computerized fans that turn on above a set temperature, or things like self-driving cars.
Capstone Boost: Quality over quantity is your motto now. Or at least, it should be, considering your devices are a couple steps above the rest. And by couple, I mean more like a few hundred. For whatever reason, any devices or products that you create are made better than the competition, even when extreme measures are taken to save money and resources. Even when using half the material that a device should normally have, at worst it will work just as well as if someone else made it correctly, and when using all the materials required it works so efficiently it seems like the future itself has been imbedded in your devices. Simply put, the stuff you make is a lot better quality than it should be."
1200,"Valuable Memories: Megadei, Memories, Bigs, Chimeras",Big O,"You have knowledge related to any particular concept-the construction of Megadei, the nature of memories, Bigs, or the creation of chimeras. Paradigm will have a vested interest in you, and will protect you and provide you with funds if you work for them."
1600,Parahuman – Tinker,Worm,"It seems that you've triggered, and gained some rather impressive powers.
Powers adapt to whatever capabilities you already have. Taking them into account and ensuring you can use your parahuman abilities in sync with them. Assume any potential incompatibilities are handled appropriately to allow a power to still perform its intended function.
All powers may be toggled on or off, and you understand their nature and how to use them instinctively, if not necessarily all the different ways they could be applied creatively.
Tinker: Whereas other parahumans get the power to do incredible things, Tinkers get the ability to build incredible things. Tinkers essentially have a database of extremely advanced scientific data and technology in their heads, letting them build and create things far ahead of their time. This data follows a certain theme, whether that be bombs, efficiency, vehicles, or otherwise which defines what their power lets them build and work with. Tinkers need resources, time, and effort to do what other parahumans can do casually, but they are incredibly adaptable, able to show up to the next fight able to completely shut down opponents that were untouchable in their last encounter, all because they can build the right tool. Within their specialty a Tinker can build nearly anything they can imagine. Tinker abilities seamlessly integrate any such knowledge of technology and science you possess, meaning you don't have to make any extra effort to use your powers along with any other tech based perks you might have. The knowledge you gain is basically the collected science of hundreds of advanced civilizations within your area of expertise. You don't necessary have the capability to process and sort through it all at once, but your power will continue to feed you data and knowledge relevant to your endeavors and what you're building."
