0,Parautilitarian,Control,"You are now a ‘parautilitarian’, a person with sufficient mental power to be able to link to Objects of Power and utilize their abilities. Even without linking, you will gain a vague empathic sense for the emotions of those around you, and strong but unfocused telekinetics, which can mainly be used to execute a force telekinetic shove or push. Your main ability will be the ability to link to Objects of Power, forming a connection that can allow you to borrow their abilities, which can range from levitation to mind control and more. In future Jumps, objects with strong supernatural powers or links to the combined human subconscious can be treated as Objects of Power and bound for abilities as well. Upon binding an object, you can be transported to a temporary mental space, where you can go through a brief ‘tutorial’ on how to use the object’s power."
0,Force Sensitive,Star Wars - Darth Bane Trilogy,"The Force is what gives a Jedi, or a Sith, his power. It's an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us. It binds the galaxy together.
You are a member of a small percentage of the galactic population that can tap into and utilise the Force to effect the world around you.
Drop-Ins and Soldiers can be Force sensitive, but will begin with no training or awareness of the powers to which they have access."
0,Natural Potential,Lyrical Nanoha,"But at any rate, to help you get a head start in this world, we’re going to grant you a natural A-rank potential. For your purposes, this is going to be virtually identical to your Mage Rank at first, unless you put the training in to improve your prowess. You may purchase to the indicated rank for the point cost listed below. Remember, raw power isn’t everything, skill is just as much the name of the game as anything, but raw power will certainly give you a leg up."
0,Telepathy,Lyrical Nanoha,"Your own magical chat network! You can communicate mentally with a willing subject, even if they otherwise lack the capability and range of this particular magic. You can’t really force them to do anything except listen to you, but this mind-to-mind communication network has a range across dimensions, though you obviously can’t communicate with past jumps or other continuities until you get your Spark. Note that your mental communication can be intercepted like radio transmissions would, and you can be shut out by someone unwilling to listen to you."
0,Shooting-type Spells,Lyrical Nanoha,"The simplest and most common spell used in combat. You focus mana into a sphere or ‘bullet’ and fire it at your opponent. Can be used in various forms - homing bullets, rapid-fire, and so on. The ‘big’ spells tend to fall under Bombardment, so take note of those as well. These can be ‘aimed’ by hand, or ‘guided’ by the right calculations in the spell."
0,Bombardment-type Spells,Lyrical Nanoha,"When someone or something absolutely needs to be blown the hell up befriended. Accept not substitutes. By focusing a large amount of mana into a single point, you may fire a large blast at a target, designed to completely overwhelm them via a show of raw power. These are almost always aimed, but if you can get a bit of skill and power for it, you might find a way to make such destructive spells guided..."
0,Magic-Enhanced Attacks,Lyrical Nanoha,"Need a weapon to hit harder? Need your fist to absolutely break through something? Want to show off to someone? This is where you’ll look. By enhancing your blows or weapon with mana, you can make the blows or strikes inflict more damage, and letting you strike with more force than before."
0,Barriers and Shields,Lyrical Nanoha,"But you can’t just keep slinging offensive spells left and right all day without any kind of defense, right? You can create barriers and shields to reinforce your own defenses, letting you block spells and attacks so long as you utilize them properly. This can be especially draining or fragile against powerful Bombardment spells or worse, though...you might want to consider dodging instead."
0,Capture-type Spells,Lyrical Nanoha,"Finally, there’s these. You can physically restrain a foe with binding spells that inhibit their movement and prevent them from maneuvering, or even create intricate cages of mana that lock said foe in place completely and allow you to capture or interrogate them while they’re stuck in an immobile prison."
0,Attuned,Senki Zesshou Symphogear,"Well, not just anyone can start singing and activate a relic! While there are ways to artificially gain attunement – the LiNKER drug and Human-Relic fusion coming to mind – you're going to gain a high natural level of attunement, allowing you to activate and use a Symphogear without artificially increasing your synchronization coefficient. Be warned though, your synchronization still isn't high enough to completely prevent the backlash from singing your Swan Song."
0,The Song of Your Heart,Senki Zesshou Symphogear,"In addition to an improvement to your singing skills and ability to compose songs you are no longer reliant on your mouth to deliver your songs. You may freely sing and speak simultaneously, as your heart broadcasts your song (plus appropriate musical accompaniment) without necessity for such things as atmosphere, breathing, or instruments. This can be freely toggled but doesn't require further concentration once activated unless you wish to use non-Relic based singing abilities alongside it."
0,Calling Card,Senki Zesshou Symphogear,"You spent a lot of time coming up with your combat techniques. It's only fair to name them! When you make an attack that's above par, time almost seems to freeze for a second, and all those onlooking instinctively recognize the name and intended theme of the technique. This effect can be toggled."
0,The Light of My Soul,Nexusverse - Nexus,"The primary and most utilized source of power in Nexus is the very Light of the Soul itself, appropriately called Light, represented as pinpoints of Light with tiny threads of holding them together spread evenly throughout the body. This power naturally strengthens the body and its functions in its base state. A person is limited to the Light they have on reaching full maturity, around the human equivalent of 25, with the powerconstantly growing at a slow rate up to that point, with it slowing further after puberty. However, this alone would not make Light particularly useful.
There are two ways to manipulate Light. The first focuses the pinpoints into a smaller area to add more power to that area or be able to shift how it manifests. While this shifting takes a bit of concentration and time, it is fairly easy to train to the point where it's near instinctive to shift the pinpoints of Light around.
The second method is the most potent, but also the most time consuming. By looping the strands connecting pinpoints together around a series of pinpoints, it's possible to create a Seed. A Seed will continuously grow brighter over time, creating a small well of power. This is the basis of Seed Sorcery (see below). However, even those that do not use Seed Sorcery will find this useful, as cracking open one of these Seeds gives a boost to the effects of the user's Light based on how strong the Seed is.
Post Jump, you may awaken Light in others, complete a capacity to form Mistlight Manifestations."
0,Mist Collector,Nexusverse - Nexus,"When any creature with Light dies, they leave behind a small echo, a wisp of glittering Mist, colored similarly to the Lenses the individual possessed in life. These wisps are also touched by the memories and emotions of the being's life, altering its properties somewhat. The collection and manipulation of these wisps of Mist are the basis on which Mistlight Manifestations come into existence.
Collecting a wisp of Mist is easy, simply touching it will stabilize it and allow it to be stored indefinitely. But utilizing a single wisp of Mist to create a Mistlight Manifestation will result in a lackluster Manifestation, weak enough that even humans, who lack the reserves of light necessary to become proper hunters, prefer to make at least a few modifications before doing so. To that end, there are three methods of strengthening a wisp.
First is smelting or fusing. Taking two or more wisps of Mist and combining them into a single, new one with the traits of both. This is by far the easiest and fastest method of empowering a wisp of Mist. However, unless you know exactly what your wisps of Mist are and how they'll react, combining them in this way may lead to complications, such as opposing traits canceling out or mutating into a new trait that has a negative impact on the whole.
Second is cultivation. By 'feeding' a wisp of Mist, it is allowed to grow organically and produce new qualities and traits over time. Allowing a wisp of Mist to grow in this way is fairly simple, and with its organic growth it's unlikely to have any complications, but this process is time consuming, potentially taking weeks or months to yield the results on par with smelting or refinement.
Lastly is refinement. This is a rather difficult process that removes unwanted traits from a wisp of Mist, much like cutting and polishing a gem. This process has you excise traits and qualities from a wisp of Mist, allowing the other aspects to grow in strength as a result. This is a quick process and is unlikely to cause any real trouble, but you must be very precise and careful during the process or you may leave behind bits of what you wanted removed.
Additionally, wisps of Mist are useful for another purpose. By binding a wisp to a Seed, it can act as an artificial Lens in the use of Seed Sorcery. Seeds formed with a wisp are, however, slower to grow than those that use your own Lenses. Cracking a Seed with a wisp will often cause the wisp to dissipate, though some Seed Sorcerer's have learned how to reclaim the wisp used for this prior to cracking the Seed."
0,The Spark of Genius,Nexusverse – Betwixt,"Sparks are spiritual seeds of the World Tree, planted within the minds of the people of Betwixt and enhancing the mind of those who benefit from it. The Spark on its own is a form of mental magic that grants you, and anyone else with a Spark, an enhanced ability to learn new things through improving memory, comprehension, and thought speed, equalling roughly three times the norm of someone without a Spark. Thissteadily improves over time as the Spark is nourished and allowed to grow, which is sped up further by actively learning new things and meditating on what you already know.
Additionally, the Spark acts as a buffer against mental influences, protecting the mind and will against any form of mental attack. While not a perfect defense, this buffer is like armor for the mind and takes a concentrated effort to bypass. Combined with other mental defense techniques, it becomes significantly harder for mental influences to take hold on the mind.
Like the World Tree they come from, Sparks produce an energy that can be harnessed. The energy produced by the spark cannot truly affect the world in its raw state, but it can be used as a fuel source for the various technologies of Betwixt and can act as a catalyst to initiate or speed chemical reactions that would otherwise never occur or take a long time to run their course. The stronger the Spark is, the more of this energy is produced.
Post-Jump, you’ll be able to grant a basic form of Spark to others. This also results in them.obtaining a functional biotemplate."
0,Biotemplate,Nexusverse – Betwixt,"An exceedingly useful trait of the Spark is that it, when mixed with natural energy, generates a spiritual structure known as the biotemplate, a sort of blueprint for the physical body represented in spirit. This biotemplate eases body altering techniques and makes enhancements to the body more efficient as it integrates the effects more thoroughly into the body and spirit. The presence of the biotemplate and the development of methods to observe and interact with it after its initial discovery drove the advent of bioenhancement in Betwixt.
Additionally, it was found that the biotemplate could be ‘extended’ into grafted structures, such as cybernetics or artificial organs, to make them a part of the body, to the point that cybernetics will repair themselves if damaged after being incorporated into the biotemplate. This does, however, take upwards of a decade to fully integrate.
While technically the result of possessing a Spark, this structure can be created within someone simply by exposing them to the energy of a Spark without needing to possess their own Spark, thus, you can use this perk to grant someone a biotemplate."
0,Phased,Nexusverse – Betwixt,"A commonly acquired technique that temporarily improves on the Spark in a more direct fashion than simply passive growth, this technique works by focusing the energies of your Spark inward, which then improves on the Spark’s effects, forcing it to enter what is known as a Phase. Phases improve on the benefits the Spark provides and can unlock new abilities within the Spark with each increase in Phase. It is possible to perform this multiple times, gaining additional Phases that further improve on the Spark, however, the cost to enter higher
Phases increases exponentially. Basic Sparks, those provided by the The Spark of Genius perk, are the easiest to increase in phase, with others being more difficult."
0,Weapon Training,The Elder Scrolls - Warriors,"You would be a poor warrior if you were without the proper skills. Not only are you fairly adept with your chosen combat style and in peak physical condition, but you know how to properly maintain your weaponry and armor."
0,Basic Stealth,The Elder Scrolls - Rogues,"Only the worst of thieves have no talent with stealth, and you are far from the worst. Not only are you good at avoiding drawing attention to yourself, but you are also decent at picking locks and pickpocketing. Nowhere near a master, but you certainly can’t go wrong with a few low-stakes targets."
0,Arcane Arts,The Elder Scrolls - Magic,"You would not be much of a mage if you were not trained in the arts of magic, now would you? Thankfully, you are a fully trained mage, knowledgeable in the arcane arts and possessing multiple spells already. Though you have some apprentice level spells from all of the other Schools of Magic, you are quite adept in your chosen specialization."
0,Wonderous Creations,World of Darkness - Genius: The Transgression,"Production of the Manic artifice these are the unique non-repeatable phenomenon that the Genius creates. They are subject to the only internally consistent principles and cause havoc when coming into contact with the mundane mortals who have never felt Inspiration, or another supernatural forces, touch. Havoc is Mania bucking against reality and it’s death throes in one, usually accompanied by an explosive failure in the Wonder. An innate feature of creations that you might wish to note is the fact that they are firmly based upon non-repeatable phenomenon that are internally consistent. The recreation of Wonders is therefore impossible unless you had access to the exact method/blueprints used for the original model."
0,A Prized Aesthetic,World of Darkness - Genius: The Transgression,"Chose a method of building technology, even a fantastic one like post-atomic cyberpunk or dieselpunk, and now you can easily craft Wonder with this aesthetic with little to no effort. This doesn’t make them any better intrinsically, but some aesthetics do certain things better than others. Post-atomic is more rugged and has good energy weapons usually, cyberpunk usually has excellent software and technology compression, dieselpunk usually had a hard line to being the toughest type of technology on the block bar very few, things like that."
100,Aesthetics and Flair,Bayonetta,"A gun isn't quite a gun until it LOOKS good, you know? It's supposed to be classy, make you look amazing just for having it. Likewise, that sword could use a bit of badass styling to it. When you create your weapons, you can make them look DAMNED good even on an off day. Expect any weapon creator to envy you, and those who die by your weapons to count themselves lucky as they perish to such beautiful art."
100,Hammer And Anvil,The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild - TG,"It'd hardly be right to call you a smith if you couldn't even bang out a piece of metal, eh? You're a seasoned blacksmith, able to work metal and create all manner of useful metal objects - horseshoes, charms, and emblems...and of course, weapons and armor. The weapons and armor you create are reliable and easy to make, the kind used by Travelers and Soldiers all around Hyrule."
100,Mist Alchemy,Nexusverse - Nexus,"Mist has more uses than simply being used to create Mistlight Manifestations, the most common form is Mist Alchemy, imbuing Mist into a material to subtly alter its properties. This is a minor boon, imbuing heat aligned Mist into metal might prevent it from forming stress fractures during quenching or remove the need for tempering, while imbuing an herb with life aligned Mist might make it better suited to making a healing poultice. Minor things that, combined together, can provide useful results.
This is commonly used for making simple conveniences or simple tricks, such as pots or pans that more evenly distribute and hold heat or musical instruments that carry their tune farther than normal, rather than proper enhancements. Though medicine enhanced in this way is fairly potent.
As this skill can be learned in jump, this perk allows you to synergize the traits of wisps of Mist used for Mist Alchemy to achieve greater effects and gives you an innate intuition for how a wisp of Mist will affect an object when imbued in various ways. This stacks with the Mist Affinity perk."
100,Harvester,Nexusverse - Nexus,"You know a somewhat uncommon technique known as Harvesting, a process by which someone extracts a wisp of Mist from a still living being. This is not damaging, per se, but can put stress on the mind, body, and Light of the one having this done to them. Fighters will sometimes use this to get an edge if they can find an opening to pull it off. It is possible to pull wisps of Mist from yourself with this technique, but it requires a large amount of focus to accomplish without failing. You are able to reclaim wisps used in Seed Sorcery.
As this technique can be learned in jump, paying for it makes it more effective, reducing the necessary focus and allowing you to use more advanced forms of harvesting, such as causing greater levels of fatigue with each wisp pulled from an individual or to temporarily empower your Light by consuming the resulting wisp of Mist."
100,Spark Technician,Nexusverse – Betwixt,"Sparks are flexible, they can grow and be trained, in much the same way a muscle can. However, they can also be directed into a new form by linking them to a series of related skills. This process opens up new options to the Spark and makes it more suited to the task the linked skills outline, and such Sparks will tend to improve on characteristics that aids the linked skills as well, ranging from the Iron Spark’s improved reaction speed to the Noble Spark’s improved senses. You know the technique to change your spark to one of these Sparks.
Examples of such ‘Tech-Sparks’ include the Iron Spark, which is linked to tactics, weapons handling, and other combat related skills, providing a boon to situational awareness, reaction time, and muscle memory, and the Noble Spark, which is linked to skills such as diplomacy, negotiation, hellstromism, and other skills used to curry favor with others, providing a boost to empathy, attention to detail, and the ability to link information. These qualities increase with the Phase of the Spark. This also comes with basic skill in manipulating the Spark, such as allowing you to create Mixed Sparks or making modified Sparks."
100,Cultivation,Nexusverse – Betwixt,"As one of the keepers of the World Tree and its grove, you are skilled in the care of various plants and fungi and know their basic properties. More so, this gives you the ability to know the right time to harvest, the right methods to use, and the proper storage and preparations to get the most out of your cultivations, and even how to use some of them. This also comes with a knack for taking care of animals and keeping them healthy, with them often being friendlier towards you.
Additionally, you know the basic techniques for manipulating and collecting natural energies, with simple applications to aid the growth and health of plants and animals being the most basic of its uses."
100,Physician,The Elder Scrolls - Rogues,"Everyone can agree that it's always handy to have a potion or two on hand for emergencies, especially if they give you an edge in combat. When they need those kinds of potions, they go to you to supply them, because all beneficial concoctions you create are a quarter more potent, and last nearly twice as long as they otherwise would."
100,Enchanted Sight,The Elder Scrolls - Magic,"Being the skilled enchanter that you are, people often come to you for one of two reasons. To enchant something, or to figure out what something is enchanted with. Thankfully, you are quite good at the latter, capable of figuring out the effects of any magical enchantments with but a glance. This will also help you learn new enchantments without destroying the original item in the process."
100,Mechanist,Final Fantasy VI,"You know how regular technology and magitek function and can repair it if it breaks down. You'll still need the tools and supplies, but at least with this you'll know what you're doing with mechanical technology. This knowledge can be used to build basic examples of it too, but don't expect to be able to copy anything too complex without getting your hands on the blueprints."
100,Inner Linings,Final Fantasy XIV,"A customer came to you one day with a strange request for you to make a leather jacket which would be thinner, enough so that it would take multiple jackets to equal the bulk and weight of a normal jacket. As strange as that request was, when you watched him enchant the various jackets it suddenly made sense. Instead of trying to enchant a single jacket multiple times, he would wear multiple jackets enchanted once. But you can improve on that idea. Instead of attempting to craft multiple thinner jackets, you've opened up inner linings in existing pieces of work. As you predicted, while the ease of stacking enchantments has gone up, the overall durability of the item has dropped by a bit. Perhaps with time and better materials, you could rectify the second point. Having so many inner linings also helps quite a bit when it comes to deeper pockets, which is a nice side effect."
100,Defensive Plating,Final Fantasy XIV,"There's nothing that you can't protect without adding a layer of steel on top. After all, that is the fundamental concept behind armour. The issue is figuring out how to create a layer which can resist any blow - the fabled strongest shield in essence. You're not quite there yet, but you've figured out how to make the lightest shield, while still affording a level of protection.
It does not matter if the client is already wearing armour, or if the castle already has walls, you can forge another layer of protection on top, and they won't even feel it. The weight of armour which you create drops substantially, though the level of protection does not fall equivalently."
100,Extraction Efficiency,Final Fantasy XIV,"Judging from the state of Eorzea, the Carpenters and other tradesmen here have long since improved the efficiency of their resource collecting processes. From the record books, while the presence of Aether has helped a great deal, the harvesting practices put into place played a large part as to why the natural landscape is still the way it is today. Adopting those same practices, you've improved on the harvesting efficiency for all manners of things, not just restricted to trees -but other plant life as well. So at least the plant doesn't simply die off after one round."
100,Composition Analysis,Final Fantasy XIV,"""Before you get to work, you need to know what it is you're dealing with!"" -that was the first lesson you were taught when you started this discipline. Certainly, your mentor was right. Without knowing what you're working with, you're simply courting with catastrophe. With a bit of help from the Aether tools you have, you can discern the properties of any material you're working with -enough to know if there's an occupational hazard involved with handling them. But with sufficient practice and a discerning eye, you can figure out what any item is made up of."
100,Strange Formula,Marvel Cinematic Universe Vol. 1,"This chemical formula is the brainchild of the German scientist Dr. Erskine, and is directly responsible for the creation of Captain America. As is, this is only the formula, and you must make it yourself... but as a result it could possibly let you modify the serum for other uses. Beware its tendencies to amplify the personality traits of the user, or be prepared to find a way to fix that fact."
100,Nitramene,Marvel Cinematic Universe Vol. 1,"The formula for the chemical compound known as Nitramene, this compound has multiple purposes. A typical Nitramene bomb has a blast radius of five hundred yards after which it creates a vacuum that causes an implosion as matter rushes to fill the void that it has created, but a grenade of that size will do considerably less damage. On the other hand, Nitramene also emits low levels of Vita Radiation, which has a specific wavelength that has stabilizing properties."
200,Forceful Engineer,Star Wars - Darth Bane Trilogy,"Force sensitive individuals and species have created wondrous unions of engineering genius and Force energies. Prisons to hold eldritch nightmares, holocrons and seemingly infinite factories that strip entire stars for the resources needed for your unending fleets. You are inspired when it comes to the design of such marvels, even being able to use the Light Side for unseen effects. This brilliance extends beyond the Force into the wider realm of 'Magitek'. The potential trichotomy of Machine, 'Magic' and The Force could give birth to near unimaginable wonders for the inventive mind."
200,Extragalactic Tech,Star Wars - Darth Bane Trilogy,Exo-technology is a field of science that specializes in studying and combining the technologies of various species of the galaxy. Your nature as a Jumper allows you to go beyond merely marrying the design sensibilities of several alien peoples. You easily blend the varying physical laws and examples of causality you've encountered in the creation of any one thing.
200,Talent In The Arts,Dishonored 2,"The spark of inspiration that drives the philosophers of this world tends to manifest into the creative arts as well as the more practical ones – many genii are not just inventors or witches, but artists and musicians as well. Your brilliance in academic topics often bleeds over into artistic ones; a gift for mathematics might make your musical compositions especially melodic or rhythmic, a talent at linguistics and history could make your novels particularly compelling, or a natural knack for medicine and anatomy might give your portraits an incredibly realistic touch. Fame and acclaim for your creative works will last even if they are out-shadowed by your worldly creations."
200,Surgeon,MtG - New Phyrexia,"Incisions, amputations, dissections, grafts, brain excisions, xenotransplantation, phyretic implants... You have a steady hand, and a talent for putting together the abominations of flesh and steel your kind is known for. You know how to perform anaesthesia-less surgery without the patient going into shock, and can keep them alive through all of it, or at least quasi-alive, and your “patients” seem to be able to survive the long term effects of the surgery, as long as they survived the surgery itself."
200,Machinist,Gargoyles,"You are an expert mechanic. You can rebuild and improve a helicopter in 12 hours or create a functional motorcycle from spare parts. If honed, this ability will let you make nearly anything from incredibly advanced robots to nanite swarms in only a few months time."
200,Time to Work,Bayonetta,"You know how to create all kinds of weapons. Miniguns, swords, daggers, rifles, rocket launchers, shotguns, the works. Any mundane weapon is as easy as pie for you to create, and if you put your mind to it you can even alter these creations to have infinite ammo. You are even able to modify other weapons to possess this feature. How? Good question, but is that a secret you really want to share?"
200,Self Stabilizing Spells,Gemcraft Frostborn Wrath,"Gems are a perfect example of self stabilizing spells; other than being shattered, they will continue to merrily blast away at enemies forever with no further input of mana. They even become more stable over time as the spell fine tunes itself. This perk allows you to apply that philosophy to any persistent spell from any magical system. It will necessitate creating a physical anchor for the spell and it will probably be more limited and costly, but its effect will now continue until the physical anchor is shattered"
200,Downsized,Gemcraft Frostborn Wrath,"While gems the size of a room are the most efficient and stable, this perk will give you the skills necessary to create gems that are smaller than that. The strength of a gem relative to its cost scales with its volume, so small gems might seem useless at first glance, but gems effectively do not have an upper bound for how high they can scale. Feel free to make an Orb of Presence fit for a backpack, and carry around a staff with a gem on the top for blasting foes, or launch gem bombs the size of grenades and leave behind gem-wasps the size of flies to distract your foes."
200,Upsized,Gemcraft Frostborn Wrath,"While making gems the size of entire buildings is possible for normal wizards, they usually don't bother, since they have a tendency to cause widespread devastation when they break, and that can endanger the wizard that cast the spells. If you don't mind working around the potentially deadly consequences of summoning huge gems, this perk will give you the skills necessary to scale your gems as large as you want, so long as the entire thing can fit within your spellcasting range. Of course, you will draw a lot of attention doing this."
200,Heretical Adaptation,Senki Zesshou Symphogear,"Symphogears are, in essence, a Relic adapted into a combat system for it's ability to generate massive amounts of energy that can be formatted into a certain kind of matter through a generic mass-energy converter. However, they also have the ability to 'evolve' overtime, gaining additional armor and improvements to features such as onboard thrusters. With a bit of study, it might be possible to apply this adaptive behavior to other materials, encouraging them to improve themselves over time."
200,Mundane Applications,Senki Zesshou Symphogear,"Killing Noise isn't all there is to heretical technology. The same technology that is used to create a Symphogear and it's weapons from energy can also be used to manipulate other forms of energy. Through this it becomes possible to bend light to cloak objects or to keep an object cool in a raging inferno. Aside from the obvious military applications, this makes it possible to convert mundane things like coffee makers or fireplaces to run on the passive Phonic energy that is generated by people."
200,Sparking Innovation,The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild - TG,"The fruits of hard work and study. By studying the arts of the ancient Sheikah, You can now create basic Ancient technology. The chief use of this is that you have the knowledge of creating the blue flame that acts as the energy source for much Sheikah Tech. This Blue Flame can be used to fuel various magitech as Sheikah devices are known to be, and in turn you are capable of creating simple tools such as cameras and recording devices with this level of knowledge. Nothing ground shaking on its own, but it's the base of even greater innovation"
200,Gimmick and Trick,The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild - TG,"Arrows are a vital resource, not in the least because they are simple and easy to adjust. With your help, the humble arrow can go from a projectile to a problem solver! You now know how to make the 'trick' arrows utilized in Hyrule, the elemental arrows of fire, lightning and ice as well as the explosive bomb arrows. If you wished, you could extend this tinkering habit to non-projectiles, allowing you to create gimmick weapons and tools similar to that created by Kilton, proprietor of the Fang and Bone. In addition, if you have Hammer and Anvil, the quality of your crafted items is increased - allowing you to craft weapons of the quality of non-Hylian special weapons such as the Drillshaft or Gerudo Scimitar, or the quality of the weapons used by the Knights of Hyrule."
200,The Maker’s Hands,Nexusverse – D’Void,"One would wonder why a tinker devil works with individual parts when chaos binding would allow them to make the objects they want wholesale, and there is quite a bit of speculation as to exactly why, but the truth of the matter is, they are simply better with things they understand, and what better way to understand something than to make it yourself, directly, slowly, and with care. While a tinker devil does not truly need to build a device or object to gain an understanding of it, it is far easier to do so rather than trying to figure out that which is already built. There is also a connection formed with objects the devil builds themselves that amplifies this effect.
When a tinker devil knows more about an object, physically and metaphysically, they find they are better able to use it and bring out its true potential. A sword that they have studied and come to understand will be better in their hand than an equally potent sword they just picked up. Additionally, when using anything they have personally crafted, this increase is amplified, bringing them twice the benefit they would have received with any other object, even if they are exactly recreating something they have studied, that recreation will benefit more than the original.
Using the Given Shape, Given Purpose perk with this effect sees them compound on each other and make the two effects greater than they otherwise would be."
200,Common Magic,Nexusverse - Nexus,"Light is something everyone has, regardless if they are a fighter or not. As such, even the most common laborer will use it to their advantage. You find your abilities are easier to use when turned towards a profession that doesn't involve fighting. Crafting, farming, construction, cooking, and any other profession is able to benefit from your various abilities with great ease."
200,Heart of Fire,Nexusverse - Nexus,"Fire Elementals possess a form of magic called the Ember. This magic grants incredible resistance, bordering on immunity, to heat and flames, though it does nothing for the pain that heat can cause. However, that is merely a side effect. The true use of Ember is as a form of refinement, materials exposed to ember infused flame have their traits enhanced. Food becomes tastier and more nutritious, metals become more resilient, and potions last longer or have an increased effect. This does, however, require the material to be exposed to flame, so this will not work on certain materials."
200,Spark Infusion,Nexusverse – Betwixt,"You have the ability to create a metaphysical structure within an object that functions similarly to a Spark. It doesn't generate energy of its own, but can accept Spark energy to increase in Phase. Doing so causes the item to become more resilient and better for its intended purpose. A computer, for example, will run faster and better with each phase increase, while a laser etcher might become more precise in its movements or a weapon may gain traits to make it more deadly, like a sharper blade or a higher speed of a projectile.
If you also possess the Spark Technician perk, you can effectively program the Spark you create in the object, adding pseudo-programs that start to define the natural energy within to treat it as if it were alive. This will create a sort of inorganic biotemplate that will actually be able to maintain a logic engine capable of acting as an assist for the user and can give new functions given time and tinkering with the Spark and biotemplate."
200,Medical Training,Nexusverse – Betwixt,"Tenders are more than just caretakers, they are the medics of Betwixt. You are trained in the medical field to a degree that, regardless of body type and unusual anatomy from the various bioenhanced, you can diagnose and treat, if not cure, any issue they might possess. This is not immediate, taking time and a good bit of bedside manner, which you also possess when you want to, for the individual to be fully healed, but you certainly speed the process up. Additionally, you can mix natural energies into your medicines to increase their effects, with herbal remedies getting a far bigger boost. In a pinch, you are a decent field medic and can triage well enough to save lives, if not comfort."
200,Alchemical Sciences,Nexusverse – Betwixt,"One of the more common and basic studies in the Playground is that of materials and how to make them better serve a purpose. You know how to alter the properties of a material, whether that’s chemically, through alloying, or creating a composite. Even further, you know how to catalyze changes within a material using Spark energy to convert it into a magical material. An alloy, for example, will become chemically unique, changing from a simple mix of metals to a new one, such as the mithril favored by the elves. Such changes are, however, complex and require extensive research to create a properly useful metal, as shown with the precise mixing of metals necessary for the creation of mithril, which includes silver, nickel, titanium, chromium, and magnesium, plus several other metals. The more common use is the creation of Energy Crystals, which can store large quantities of Spark energy for use in larger projects.
The Elder Scrolls: 4,400CP"
200,Deadly Architect,The Elder Scrolls - Rogues,"Who says that you need to go to your target, when you can convince them to willingly enter your pre-made deathtrap. Well, convincing them may be a problem, but actually creating a deadly gauntlet of traps is quite easy for you. Your mastery over deadly traps also leads well towards disabling the traps of others."
200,Experimenter,The Elder Scrolls - Rogues,"Alchemy is entirely dependent on the magic within your ingredients and regents, so what are you to do in worlds devoid of magic, crazy as it sounds? If you were worrying, then don't, because you won't have to ever deal with that problem, seeing as you can make your potions and poisons just as effectively when using mundane ingredients from mundane worlds. You can even pass this trait along to any students you have, allowing them to perform your same feats."
200,Eternal Enchanting,The Elder Scrolls - Magic,"One of the limiting factors for enchanting is the need to constantly recharge them. This is especially true for weapons, forcing you to recharge them multiple times a day. Well no more, for you have discovered the secret to solve that particular annoyance. Any enchantments you apply will never run out of charge, being just as effective in a thousand years as it was the day it was made."
200,(Not so) Consistent Technology,World of Darkness - Genius: The Transgression,"The average Genius has an Aesthetic that they fit into, kind of like a genre of legacy. You however, thanks to your many teachers, have a difference of opinion that makes you unique, Wonders built in your Aesthetic don’t just ‘feel’ better but are better and you can switch your Aesthetic when you feel like a different Tech-Genre could be viable. You could have an airship that was built with the hard bulky like of a dieselpunk whilst the insides have the sleek holograms and AR of a cyberpunk."
200,Alchemy,Final Fantasy IV,"A lack of magic makes you no less useful, and you've learned how to make use of the various potions and other items on a grand scale. You can mix together multiple items, compounding their effects. It doesn't create something new, but instead additively combines the source materials into something with as much potency, to the upper limit of five times the strongest of your source materials."
200,Tool King,Final Fantasy VI,"Technical knowledge is one thing, but a little creativity is what makes it really shine. With the right parts, you can make goofy but powerful items with technology and magitek, just through a little tinkering and experimentation. Others see a box of scraps and a jug of chemicals, you see a poison spraying gun that can spread across a battlefield and infect enemies. This can range from the mundane, like a chainsaw, to the ridiculous, like an item that inflicts elemental weaknesses on your foes. It all depends on what you have on hand and what you can think up. In simple terms, you have great skill at converting simple materials into odd but unnaturally effective weapons. Obviously this works better the more advanced the technology you have on hand is, like if you're using actual weaponry or cutting edge machinery as a basis instead of a random pile of rusty junk."
200,"Magitech Augmentation Theories, 14th",Final Fantasy XIV,"The Garlean use of Magitek doesn't just end with automatons. Many of the weapons, armor, and even day to day objects have benefited from the implementation of magitek. Inside this textbook is a collection of theories and applications that have been tested and improved. You could most likely learn from these theories and apply the principles of magitek to any inanimate object. We've seen from live samples that Magitek doesn't just enhance the magical properties of an item it seems to add in neat little quirks like transformation sequences and magic resistant coatings as well. It's likely you could scale this up to high levels with a substantial amount of further analysis."
200,Harmless Extraction,Final Fantasy XIV,"With hempen yarn and animal skins in shorter supply since the catastrophe, you and other craftsmen have had to adapt your practices in order to keep the orders met. Practices to minimize the amount of animals killed, to make the most out of that which you have on hand are all crucial nowadays as resources grow scarcer. While the animals still aren't too comfortable with it, with this magic you can weave together a copy of their skin or wool, while only taking a small portion of what they have. It doesn't really feel right, but at least the animal is still alive! It'll take time, but what you've taken will slowly grow back."
200,Culinary Control,Final Fantasy XIV,"As a chef, you've always known that herbs and spices have their place in making everything nice - and giving foods their specific tastes. But your customers don't seem to care for extra ingredients driving up the costs - and you aren't getting those herbs for free.
Well, a bit of magic won't hurt anyone right? Even without herbs and spices, you can freely shift the taste of your food to something completely unexpected. Of course, that comes with its own side effects...food that you produce amplifies magic when consumed, if only for a short time."
200,Rapid Growth,Final Fantasy XIV,"You can't afford to wait years for a forest to regrow! By the time that forest grows to a state where it's ready for harvest, you won't even need the lumber to build your house anymore! No, in order to make it in time for harvest this season, you're going to need to draw on some more potent forces. It might be a little bit dangerous to use Aether in such a fashion, but by imbuing the saplings with concentrated Aether, you've successfully sped up the growth rate of the trees -to a point where you can harvest them again. Well, unfortunately, the trees did grow a bit bigger than normal, but you expect that's just a normal side effect from using concentrated Aether to grow things."
200,Broadcast Booster,Marvel - The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes,"You've discovered a way to make your signals much more effective and efficient, letting you transmit or receive signals and other methods of transmission, such as radio waves, on a global scale. Call your power armor to your exact location, get five bars wherever you go, or make the ultimate remote control."
200,Biotech,Marvel Cosmic,"There are many fields of scientific and engineering expertise. They are all studied and mastered by assorted scientists across the universe. One of the most versatile and powerful fields is that of biotechnology. You are a veritable god in this field. Force evolve creatures at your whim, uplift entirely new species just because. Feel free to create biological interfaces with mechanical devices. The sky's the limit and flesh is your servant."
200,The Mystic and the Machine,Marvel Cosmic,"The argument between mystics and technology is a faulty one. There is no need to choose one as they enhance and complement one another. Like a certain Mad Titan you have unlocked mastery of combining these two pathways to power. You can always find ways to combine any mystical knowledge you have with any scientific or technical knowledge. This differs from Fine line in that it is all about creating magitech. It also allows you to make a technological version of any magic you know, or a magical version of any technology you can build. All power sources between the two become cross compatible as well. Only fools choose one when they can have both."
200,Dark Sciences,Marvel Cosmic,"Science is a tool like any other but oh how useful of a tool it is. However you rule, however you carry out your conquests, your might is made only mightier by the strength of your dark sciences. You know how to unleash the most destructive aspects of any science or technology you understand. You know how to turn any of your knowledge to evil or destruction. Are you a master of the healing sciences? Well now you know how to create terrible viruses and cancers. Are you a mechanical engineer? The universe has never seen such dastardly torture devices. Every last piece of knowledge you have can be tuned for maximum destruction."
200,Extremis Formula,Marvel Cinematic Universe Vol. 1,"Another attempt at creating super soldiers, this formula creates a virus that can enhance a person to superhuman strength, reflexes, and endurance. Additionally, normal Extremis users gain the ability to generate extreme amounts of heat through a complex metabolic process, generating heat from their bodies up to several thousand degrees Celsius on any part of the body they desire. When regenerating body parts, the wounds take on the appearance of burning ashes while growing back the lost body part, in a matter of minutes, and cooling into regular skin, flesh, and bone. Be wary however, as this makes you light up on thermal sensors, and should your body heat up too much, you may end up exploding. Keep this in mind."
200,They Will Prosper,Marvel Magic,"Being able to make fantastical tech that can compete even with magic is all well and good, but is it really being put to optimal use if you're the only one directly benefiting from using it? You will find you have a knack for scaling personal technology to a larger size. Turn a personal shield into something that can protect an entire city or make your particle gun into a weapon of mass destruction. Of course, just because you can figure out the logistics behind increasing the scale of your technology doesn't mean you actually have the resources to make these plans into a reality -- and you can bet increasing the scale by a large degree will see a comparative increase in the cost of resources."
300,Technical Specialist,Star Wars - Darth Bane Trilogy,"It is arguable that this galaxy has, on the whole, reached a technological plateau. This bar may be relatively high if one was to compare it to that of previous Jumps. Sentient computer systems, widely available commercial FTL, weapons that can scour planets, miraculous medical technology and gravity manipulation to name a few. An extremely comprehensive database of all these discoveries, refined and developed over the course of millennia, will be mentally accessible for you. Should you have the resources and tools on hand, there's no reason you couldn't create almost anything natively produced in this galaxy."
300,Alchemist,Dishonored 2,"Did you study under Hypatia, the famed alchemist of Addermire? Or perhaps you were from Gristol, and were tutored for some time by Sokolov and Joplin, who famously created the cure for the rat plague more than a decade ago? It matters not. Medicine, botany and chemistry is where your talent lies, and while the 'wet sciences' are not as flashy as those of clockworks or galvanics, there is no end to the utility they can be put to.
You are a masterful producer of tinctures and remedies, but also poisons and other chemicals that find use in combat, like gunpowder and the ingredients used in explosive projectiles and the Howlers' bombs. You'll be sure to get a lot of customers, whether for your beneficial concoctions, or your baneful ones. You might even surprise yourself with what your mixtures are capable of."
300,Synchronicity Event,F.E.A.R.,"Curiouser and curiouser. Due to coming into contact with... well, SOMETHING, your psionic abilities have noticeably increased. Psychic powers you may have had are stronger now, with control and development coming more quickly with practice. There is also a boon to this; by taking a few days to 'attune' a person, you may impart upon them the beginning of psionic abilities of their own. You may only gift one school at a time, and they start at the very beginning; if they are to grow and learn as you have, it would be wise to teach them. On the plus side, they'll eventually become as strong as you are, so you'll have quite the pupil on your hands."
300,Shaping Focus,Geneforge,"Rather than regular magic or fighting with your body you excel at creating life. As where others might just put a creation together following the basic design your skill lets you make subtle improvements without even trying. Your creations will always be stronger, and better made, they will be faster stronger and more powerful than otherwise, even more obedient and mentally stable. You will also excel at shaping research and coming up with new or improved creations, such that you will likely outstrip your peers. You will also learn and develop your skills with shaping faster."
300,Crafting,Geneforge,"There are various things that can only be created through the use of essence and hard work. Shaped equipment, puresteel, certain complicated tools and devices, and certain materials used in enchanting. You can work all of them, producing high quality goods from basic ore and hard work."
300,Gadgeteer,DC - Young Justice,"An inventive mind and the know how to make gadgets; though they can't do anything too outside of normal physics, you are perfectly capable of making functional things like grappling hooks, tracking devices, boomerangs that automatically return to you, and trick arrows. In addition to being very cheap to make, any gadgets that you have are almost as intuitive to use as your very limbs, allowing you to use and switch between them easily and without hassle."
300,"Given Shape, Given Purpose",Nexusverse – D’Void,"When shaping an object, either through the use of chaos binding or actually physically working a material, you can impart an intent of purpose into your work. This makes the material used in the shaping far easier to work towards that purpose and enables it to ‘fill in the blanks’ to a degree as it works towards that purpose as well. This can make normally tough materials, such as mithril, as easy to work as iron, or even easier if you are skilled enough, with there even being a case of a man shaping iron like clay with his bare hands using this method.
However, even once done, the object will serve better towards the intended purpose, such as an axe made with the intent to fell trees will cut better on a tree than it would on a shrub or in service as a weapon. This is a fairly permanent affair, even breaking the weapon won’t see this quality fade unless broken down to the point it becomes a new base material, at which point the effect is considerably weakened.
Chaos affected in this way tends to keep the purpose it’s given when used in this way, and if repeatedly given the same purpose can find itself locked into a more permanent form, only a chaos distiller able to break it back down into its base state without the integrated purpose. This can, however, be felt by the binder and is usually only done either in emergencies or when the permanent form is the desired end result."
300,Mechanical Genius,Final Fantasy IV,"Your ability to understand machinery is on a different level entirely. Working with a metal you've never touched to brace a machine? Cakewalk. New attachments on a precariously balanced airship? Might take a day, less with an assistant. You know machines, and exactly how to calibrate them to your exact specifications inherently without needing to actually run the numbers. It just works."
300,Alloy Smith,Marvel - The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes,"Advanced knowledge of chemistry and metallurgy has allowed you to create alloys out of various materials, including metals and chemicals. These new alloys retain all of the properties- including those that are supernatural in nature- of the materials used to make them, allowing you to create truly powerful substances."
300,Blessed by The Gods,Marvel Cinematic Universe Vol. 1,"Asgard is a wondrous place, you know. Existing for thousands of years, with advanced magic and technology that would see them rise to become a city of gods... it is little wonder that they are both feared and praised throughout the Nine Realms. The royalty however, has a penchant for adopting strays if Loki is any indication. You have been likewise adopted by Odin and raised as a member of the royal family to be great like them. Not only have you been augmented by Asgardian magics to a truly attractive state that you would feel qualifies as an appearance booster, but you display a great willpower and determination to see your goals and plans through with a very strong learning aptitude to absorb information like a sponge beyond even Tony Stark as befitting of Odin's adoptive child."
400,Master of Engineering,Dishonored 2,"Within your lofty cranium rests a mind the likes of which only appears once or twice a generation. Ideas dance through your mind like brilliant fireflies, all you have to do is reach out and grasp them. Visions of whirling gears and pumping oil; of lightning bottled in cages of glass and copper; of crystal lenses and formulas that write themselves...the spark of invention drives you to produce marvels ahead of their time - indeed with effects that seem to outstrip the technology of the device itself. Build a combat automaton from cogs and steel, record whole conversations on a single punch card, devise security systems which can recognise specific people, all these and more. If you merely had the funding and the time to refine these visions into physical form, you could unleash your marvels onto the world and you, too, could be spoken of in the same breath as Sokolov, Roseborrow, and Jindosh."
400,Research Matters,MtG - New Phyrexia,"The arcane and the divine are no different from the studies of metal and flesh- as the Core Augur researches them to further what he has called the Great Synthesis, so too do you have gained insights into them, and broadened your horizons. You now find it much easier to combine different fields of study, such as necromancy and divine magic, or pyromancy and phyrexian grafts, into a single project to carry out- something like a corpse animated by white or red mana, or a graft that allows for easy use of pyromancy."
400,"And from Scraps, Perfection",MtG - New Phyrexia,"Some say that there is a point where things become useless, where they can only be discarded-but you know better than that. It is the purpose of the great furnaces to take the cast off metals and slag of New Phyrexia and forge them anew, but imperfect materials lead to imperfect products-and yet, you have learned to remove these imperfections, how to wash away the impurities of flesh and rusted steel, and refine them into the greatest steel and finest ceramics. No matter how bad the materials, you are able to work with them to create things just as good as if using ones in good condition.
All shall be a part of the Great Work, Jumper."
400,Trainwright,Sunless Skies,"This Perk grants you access to all the knowledge necessary for building the sky-riding Locomotives and other steam and piston technology common to this setting, as well as allowing them to work in other Jumps. This means that you can build steam-powered spaceships of your very own! While they have a, at best, distant relationship with the laws of gravity, you’ll want to keep the hatches locked when you depart the atmosphere in a more conventional cosmology. Ofnote is the knowledge to build Transit Relays. Through a combination of hour-looms and sigil-bearing sequencer wheels, certain fractures in the foundations of Heaven can be used to bridge distant points. This technology may or may not be of use to you, depending on local physics and variant applications you can develop."
400,Technosorcery,Gargoyles,Combining magic and technology is a no brainer for you. You can handily blend the two to create amazing effects like broadcasting spells over telephone lines or melding creatures together through sorcerous surgery. Very little in the field of technomagic is beyond your reach with this skill.
400,Unorthodox Parts,Bayonetta,"Most people think of metal carved with tools to create a weapon. You laugh at such simple notions, for you have learned to create weapons out of spiritual entities. Demonic forces make for good parts surprisingly, and can impart unique abilities upon the weapon during its creation. If you study a creature or entity long enough, you just may know how to create a weapon out of their parts too. Naturally the more powerful the creature, the better quality the item."
400,Shipping the Product,F.E.A.R.,"Prototypes are one thing, but what about actually getting the damn thing distributed? An item or weapon doesn't help anyone if it's the only one of its kind. You will find your ability to create has increased dramatically in efficiency, letting you use the materials for three of the same items to actually make five while streamlining production lines rather quickly. As a bonus, logistics have increased enough where your shipped supplies are harder to intercept, keeping any allies you have fresh with resources!"
400,Lathe of Heaven,Chrono Trigger,"We're always going to need weapons, so the way I see it, you might as well get good at making them. Now? You'll be able to give old man Melchior a run for his money. Swords, guns, armor, even sunglasses - if it's worn or wielded, you can make it a masterpiece. You'll also learn how to make use of any material, bringing out its best qualities and minimizing its weaknesses. You could make bone sharper than steel, gold sturdier than titanium, and take a legendary material nobody's ever seen before, and figure out how to forge it, what to alloy it with, and how to craft that alloy into an impossibly sharp sword or some amazing shades."
400,Similar Principles,Lyrical Nanoha,"It’s strange how similar concepts can be between dimensions, no? The line between magic and technology just doesn’t seem as thin as it otherwise should be, especially in your hands. The TSAB system combines both, and while this doesn’t let you start building Devices from the ground up, you understand the principle enough that you can combine magic systems from other worlds with technology. Guns that fire beams of mana, helmets that create a telepathy-based chat network, wristbands that let you form an outfit from thin air...spells can be made into technology much more easily, and the technologies play a bit more nicely with magic in your hands, even if a particular system of magic isn’t fond of being ‘simplified’ by science. How about that?"
400,GemCraft,Gemcraft Frostborn Wrath,"The specialized magic style of this realm, it is an advanced form of metamagic that allows the creation of self-sustaining gems that can create further effects on their own. It allows a wizard to create huge gems formed from pure crystalized mana that can then produce magical effects that do not draw power from the wizard. The gem’s color indicates its abilities, but the effects of the spells are determined by how the gems are mounted. Mountings can alter a gem to provide passive boosts to surrounding gems, area of effect bursts, strong bolts of pure force that can deal incredible damage, and many more effects.
One thing to note about gemcraft is that it scales to extreme heights, since the wizard doesn’t have to chanel the power directly, a sufficient buildup of power allows spells that can only describe their damage in scientific notation. This power is fueled by the self-improving nature of the Orb of Presence as a mana battery and generator. It is certainly possible to cast gemcraft without an orb, but the true heights of power require one in order to avoid burning the wizard to a cinder from over-channeling magic.
The other main consideration is that gemcraft is predominantly a defensive art (in the ‘the best defense is overlapping fields of fire’ sense). Since the easiest size of gem to work with is the size of a large living room and weighs hundreds of tons, moving them conventionally is impractical. While you can reposition them around the battlefield within range of an Orb of Presence, don’t expect to be able to take the fight to the enemy with any degree of ease.
Gemcraft can be taught to anyone that already has a massive pool of mana to work with, although it is quite complex, and requires quite a bit of magic theory background to progress to even the simplest of spells."
400,Very Advanced Science,Senki Zesshou Symphogear,"When it comes to ‘re-engineering’ heretical technology, the Americans have mastered doing it in ways that leave others astounded. Recycling Relics into other forms of technology is nothing new. In fact, it’s the same technique that is used to create Symphogears, but this is on a completely different level. You can alter Relics so that they have completely different functions than what was intended, such as turning an aggressive heretical weapon into a berserker module, or a reflector into a giant laser beam."
400,Implanted Relic,Senki Zesshou Symphogear,"Somehow, perhaps through an accident, a relic has become embedded in a part of your body. While this doesn't prevent you from using other relics you will find that your synchronization coefficient with that Relic has increased tenfold, making the blowback from Swan Songs and other exhaustive features far less severe, with Swan Songs only tiring you immensely. This Relic seems to be reacting differently than seen with Human-Relic Fusion Specimen no. 1, Hibiki Tachibana and Gungnir. It seems to be merging with your body far better than Gungnir ever did, not threatening your life and eventually resolving into something similar to what was achieved by Finé herself with the Nehushtan Armor. The Relic that has been implanted is one of the ones associated with your Origin, but once again you may pay 100cp to change it to a different one.
The Library of Alexandria, lost repository of knowledge. As would be expected of Pagan technology, the Library of Alexandria was never an actual library, instead taking the form of a small fragment of a once massive crystal which is... somewhat awkwardly wedged in the wielder’s chest. Kinky. The gear also seems to insist on projecting glasses as part of it’s armor, which becomes somewhat superfluous in light of it’s abilities.
Alexandria has no weapon generation capabilities. Instead, it draws machinery and electronics – anything more complicated than a light bulb, really – and weaves them into a massive amalgamation of parts and pieces from the absorbed components. Generally the exact specifications are overblown capabilities of the technology absorbed- superheated coils from a toaster, powerful hydraulics from a backhoe, but aren’t as fantastical as other Relics. The exact shape and size varies depending on the Relic’s read of the situation, but the wielder is always encased within a heavily armored shell at it’s core, directly fused into the controls through their Gear.
The Library’s Swan Song allows Alexandria to temporarily assimilate the armaments of other Relics into it’s mechanical titan, haphazardly crossing over discarded weapons from other Symphogears and Relics to create a temporary energy cannon."
400,Hextechnician,Arcane,"Hextech is a bold new field of scientific endeavour, utilising power drawn from magical gemstones to put magic - once the domain only of those born to the power, or having somehow earned it - in the hands of the common man. At least, the common man wealthy enough to pay for it. Its potential is nearly-limitless, from delivering powerful strikes with Atlas Gauntlets to cutting through stone with beams of light to even warping space and time to propel airships far across Runeterra.
You have been extensively-trained in hextech engineering, and are capable both of building all common hextech devices in Piltover-Zaun, and of innovating upon them based on your knowledge of hextech and its principles. True, radical innovations like the Hexcore are somewhat beyond you, but you could approach such creations with a long-enough development scale and enough staff to help you - and ‘conventional’ hextech is nothing to sneeze at.
Moreover, you know how to use existing hex-crystals to produce new ones, albeit not as potent as the original, natural hex-crystals. Thus, you need not worry about your creations running out of power in new worlds."
400,Chemtechnician,Arcane,"Though Piltover has been remade into the hextech City of Progress, Zaun has been left behind. Without the same access to the expensive hexcrystals which make the innovations of Jayce Talis possible, the undercity has had to continue relying on older chemtech, with all its associated volatility and, often, toxicity. Still, chemtech is hardly a worthless line of research, capable of everything from creating powerful fuels for engines and industry, to brewing all kinds of near-magical drugs, potions and concoctions.
You are well-trained as a practitioner of chemtech, able to produce all the common chemicals used in the economy of Zaun, as well as to modify them or innovate new ones given time and space to work in. You know the recipe for Shimmer, and are quite a proficient doctor, able to keep your patients alive (though not necessarily unchanged) far past the point at which mundane medicine would have given up. As well as being able to perform the chemical side of things, you’re also capable of building machines that take advantage of the weird brews and concoctions you can make, like engines which run on artificial fuels, prosthetic arms powered by Shimmer, or suits designed to supplement Shimmer’s body-enhancing properties."
400,Celestial Technology,Darksiders,"Though they are not makers, the angels are a force of creation. This perk grants you their knowledge in supernatural technology they use. Holy armor, lances that shoot beams of light and all manner of technology that repels darkness and creatures of evil. You also become more skilled in the use of holy weapons."
400,It Is Written,The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild - TG,"The use of mystical runes for enchanted effects is well known by those with a passing interest in the magical arts, but...the Sheikah were unique. They were able to create a language from runes that had conditional statements and effects. In short - the Sheikah could program with runes, thus allowing for programs to become spells. You have knowledge of this art as well - You are able to use Runes to code programs such as those used by the Sheikah Slate to perform its functions. This combined with Sparking Innovation would give you the groundwork to create your own variant of the Sheikah Slate with your own round of Runes...though magic doesn't make something simple - you'll need to create the code for these Slates yourself."
400,Fire and Ice,The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild - TG,"The mark of a true journeyman of the trade, you have learned how to infuse elemental properties into the weapons you've forged, as well as create the entirely elemental weapons known as Rods. Though both of these require some 'infused' mystical energy to make, once forged anyone can wield them. In addition, if you have Hammer and Anvil and Gimmick and Trick, your crafting expertise is now such that you could create weapons worthy of the Royalty of Hyrule itself, granted to their guardians or rewarded to those who have shown great skill as a hero - yet nothing quite unique. Not yet."
400,Natural Enchanter,Nexusverse – Betwixt,"As the tenders work the World Tree and its many resources, they begin to learn from it more directly. You’ve learned one of the rarer techniques from it, a process by which you create a seed-like structure of natural energy and plant it into an object, cultivating and directing its growth to create a magical effect within the object. This process is known as Leying.
This natural energy must be nurtured, cultivated, and allowed to mature before its effects manifest, taking days, weeks, months, or even years of being fed or collecting more natural energy to manifest their full power, depending on the strength and complexity of the natural energy structure used. Left to its own, this will result in a somewhat random enchantment or small array of enchantments, however, this process can be directed to instead manifest a specific ability.
Enchantments made in this fashion make the enchanted object better at what it’s meant to do, and while this can be pushed, it cannot run directly counter to its purpose. Making a sword supernaturally sharp is possible, making a sword that won’t kill is not, and making a blanket that harms the one using it is right out."
400,Poisoner,The Elder Scrolls - Rogues,"Potions that heal or enhance are well and good, but people are willing to pay a great deal for various poisons, and yours in particular for good reasons. Your poisons are exceptionally deadly, regardless of their actual effects. Damaging health, paralyzation, weakness to magic, all of them boosted beyond what would normally be possible. It also doesn't help that yours seem to be strangely difficult to cure, requiring an antidote specifically for your brand of poisons. Well, at least you can sell those, too."
400,Magical Architect,The Elder Scrolls - Magic,"It's not just weapons and armor that can be enchanted, but any object you can think of. Even buildings. Especially buildings, as you've no doubt figured out. In addition to being a master architect, you can apply your enchantments onto buildings and other structures. This manifests best when making magical traps for anyone brave or foolish enough to think that trespassing was a good idea."
400,Animunculi Master,The Elder Scrolls - The First Council,"The animunculi created by the dwemer are fascinating things, functioning perfectly fine for almost four millennia with little to no maintenance. And though they require either the presence of the Heart or soul gems embedded into them to function, your animunculi do not require such power sources. In addition, the AI you can grant them are true works of art. Though limited to being animalistic in intelligence at first, they are capable of learning and adapting to various stimuli."
400,"Pankosmoi, the Needle Grail",World of Darkness - Genius: The Transgression,"A pipedream housed inside a house of smoke and mirrors. This is the hidden Axiom. With this the manifestation of a person's Mania could be pushed over the edge and into a real physical law, unique to this power, thus all things that were built by you within this Axiom are now real actualized repeatable phenomena unless you choose not to add in the element of Pankosmoi to the Wonder itself. Now the creation of Wonders is a true reality, a ‘hard science’ if you will. This also stacks with any other engineering or technological knowledge you have, letting you incorporate Wondrous features, such as the non-repeatable phenomena without Havoc or something to that effect, and update other technologies seamlessly into a greater whole of science.
This uniquely affects the capstones of each background (See Notes) as well as provides the following benefited options to all Genius’ Wonders: all of the Genius’ Wonders are immune to the effects of Havoc, the Genius gains the ability to take an impossible fact of the world and create a Bardo with it, and finally the ability to destroy non-sentient matter to harvest massive amounts of Mania from Reality itself."
400,Foundations of Self Discovery,World of Darkness - Genius: The Transgression,"The energy of Mania is now yours to control but you have little or no direction to use it. To do science one has to study but the ways of the mere mortal aren’t going to be enough. However you have all the tools needed in your own mind. Inspired is a name given to you for good reason and you can put this inspiration to good use. By touching upon the raw force of Mania and the collective ideas of people to help supplement this, you can treat yourself as if you had a mentor for purposes of self-teaching instead. At lower Inspiration this covers a small area, perhaps a block or two, but at the height of Inspiration you could easily tap into the latent flow of ideas from an entire city. This ‘Muse’ allows you to tap into the collective experiences of all the humans in the area, allowing you to learn anything that anyone in the area is even slightly skilled at through their experiences, with greater range and more people the pool of skills that can be trained grows. This Muse is a difficult thing, and not at all tame, so tapping too deeply or too often could have... unfortunate consequences."
400,Stress Testing,World of Darkness - Genius: The Transgression,"The working of wonders is an act of Inspiration. It is not so fundamentally buried in the ways of science as to ignore other outlets and some folk in the Hermetic Order of 28 Spheres has turned you to their experiments in this area. With this perk you will be able to find and utilize the Clarke Line, this is in reference to Clarke's Law that states that sufficiently advanced magic is indistinguishable from sufficiently advanced technology, to create technology so close to magic as to count as it. The ‘science’ behind this must still always be consistent internally but it can now benefit from things that would usually only be the prudence of magic, including perks. This means that magic and perks that benefit magic can affect Wonders as if Wonders were magic."
400,Form & Function,Final Fantasy XIV,"A while back, you overheard something your customers had said - about cloth and leather being insufficient to protect them out in the wilderness of Eorzea. You have to admit that they do have a bit of a point. Cloth and leather might be far more comfortable than a suit of plate armor, but functionally they protect substantially less. But maybe if you could use a different material, things might be different?
The principle of this weave is the same as when you made inner linings. But whereas inner linings allowed you to split open layers in order to weave enchantments and magic inside, now you have folded layer upon layer with inlaid crystals to attain a weave that can withstand blows just as well as a suit of plate might. The amount of crystals you need for the process is substantial - but the magic is ultimately necessary, so that you don't leave a single imperfection which may ruin the final product, and also so that it doesn't end up looking bulky and cumbersome.
Objects that you craft with the same principle exhibit durability several times stronger than what you would have expected from an equivalent of similar weight."
400,Crystal Metallurgy,Final Fantasy XIV,"You figure that it would only be a matter of time until somebody attempted to forge a suit of armor out of crystal. Frankly, with the materials available and the tools there, it's more of a surprise that it hasn't happened already. Of course when you actually try it, you'll realize why -the magic surrounding the crystals is simply too strong to be forged using traditional means. But if traditional means won't work, that just tells you that you need to employ more esoteric means of forging. Forging not with traditional fire, but with the concentrated essence of Aether and fire crystals, you can bring to life a suit of armor with crystal alone -retaining its Aether collecting properties, and magnifying the effects of spells all around it. Perhaps with time, you might be able to make golems with this."
400,Material Hybridization,Final Fantasy XIV,"Hybrid materials are the newest and hippest thing to come to Eorzea, since the presence of stolen Garlean magitek technology showed up. Now Alchemists all over Eorzea have been experimenting with this stolen technology, trying to reverse engineer the material and fundamentals behind the creation of such things. A worthy venture, and one from which you've perfected the art of making hybrid materials. Not a matter of making alloys, but making ores and fabrics enchanted with the elements, creating resources fundamentally tied with the Aether. firemetal, watermetal, the hybridization is limited only by the complexity of the element, and the nature of the material. You can't expect to succeed every time, but you'll never succeed if you don't try."
400,Crystal Division,Final Fantasy XIV,"This might not be the wisest thing you could have done, but when you consider how the Crystal gave life to Eorzea and rejuvenates the resources that Adventurers consume, it only made sense that you should graft your plants with Crystals. Unfortunately, that had very bizarre effects which you still can’t properly explain. On the other hand, you did figure out an optimal combination for merging plant and crystal!
It turns out that while replacing the skin of the plant entirely with Crystal doesn’t work out very well, when you try to merge the two with your magic, the Crystal portion will allow the plant to naturally absorb magic and shift their properties slightly depending on what type of magic they are exposed to. It’s best you don’t go about exposing your plants to death magic. Most of the effect is visual in nature; though having fire absorbing trees can be nice.
Marvel: 6,000CP"
400,I am Iron Man,Marvel Cinematic Universe Vol. 1,"You're not the ACTUAL Iron Man, but you could make a fairly decent knock-off. Power armors, sonic cannons, holographic interface, laser weapons, repulsor technology, you have the knowledge to build these things and more. Furthermore, you can think of different upgrades and modifications to adapt to different situations much easier than normal when presented with a problem that's hampered your technological progress."
400,Enlightenment,Marvel Cinematic Universe Vol. 2,"The language of the Mystic Arts is as old as civilization, my friend. The sorcerers of antiquity called the usage of this language ""spells"", but if that word offends your modern sensibility, you can call it 'programs', the source code that shapes reality. Your eyes have been opened, a sight beyond your sight. With it, you may draw from the energies of the Multiverse itself to conjure spells, make magic! This magic is not like the energies of the Asgardians who treat it as another science. No, infinite possibilities exist if you allow yourself to see them, and you are taking the first steps towards those possibilities. It will be an arduous task to move past being a beginner, and no doubt you will be noticed as you pursue your studies. But you have opened your mind... and the wonders of magic will yours to explore."
400,Enhancements,Marvel Cinematic Universe Vol. 2,"Sometimes, people need to be better. Maybe the situation is more than they can handle, maybe they're on Death's door and you need to cheat her out of her prize. The point is, they are inadequate right now and need to be better. You will make them better. Modular technology to create sophisticated power armor, powerful cybernetics to enhance their insides... the knowledge to create them is yours to do as you see fit. Your knowledge even encompasses the first steps needed to understand the various serums that are floating around the world, so that one day you can learn to replicate them... or alter them as needed."
400,Recreation,Marvel Magic,"​Knowledge is power. You know this simple truth. And for you, this is more true than for most. After all, magic, science, it all boils down to knowledge, does it not? All of it requires knowledge and all works are built upon knowledge. You can now gain this knowledge by studying creations, be they magical or mundane. Given time to study an enchantment, magical working, or even technology so advanced as to appear as magic, you can glean knowledge of the principles behind it. This allows you to not only directly recreate the work in question, but also to expand on the knowledge gained from it, potentially unfolding it into an entire field of science or a magical system. Of course, the more advanced or eldritch the knowledge, the more difficult it will be, but given enough time, you can succeed."
500,Enchantment,World of Darkness - Sorcerer,"The sorcery of creating items with magical abilities and properties. Five ranks, top rank cost 500CP. Examples of each rank below.
[1] The Enchanter creates a minor item with limited use only and a tight area of influence. Such as a jacket that works as abnormally good camouflage in a crowd, or glasses that never fog.
[2] The Enchanter creates a more powerful talisman that is noticeable as magic. A flask that blocks three bullets and no more, objects that increase a mundane skill by a noticeable amount when used.
[3] The Enchanter creates a talisman whose function is obviously magical. Shoes that double running speed, a charm that can protect its wearer from magic three times a day.
[4] The Enchanter creates a talisman that is able to defy several of the limitations of the Consensus. Clothing that grant superhumanly impressive but otherwise mundane abilities, a throwing knife that never shall never miss.
[5] The Enchanter creates talisman with almost miraculous powers. A golem, or a ring that hides its user from magical detection."
600,Altered Item Creation,Control,"You have managed to gain one of the greatest secrets that the FBC has been searching after for decades, if not centuries. The method by which Altered Items can be created, and how they can be transformed into Objects of Power. You can construct a ritual, a blending of technology and mysticism that will take an object, and focus belief and thought about the object onto it, bathing it in raw paranatural resonance. Eventually, the item will transform into a true Altered Item, with a strange power somehow linked to its nature and the ideas that people have about it. A postage stamp could gain the capacity to ‘send’ ideas into the heads of those nearby. A traffic cone would give those who approach it a looming sense of danger. A clothes hanger might gain the capacity to cause items to vanish into a ‘storage space’. Once an item has been ‘Altered’, you will then need to take steps to link it to the Astral Plane, forming a channel between the object and the collective unconscious. This is a delicate process that can destroy the object if you are not careful, but once complete, a parautilitarian or similarly psychically empowered individual can connect to the object and borrow its power, gaining some skill such as Telepathy, Danger Sense, or Storage. To start with, it would likely take several weeks of effort to make a single item, but as you explore the process, you can discover shortcuts and improved methods to speed up the process. Altered Items and Objects of Power you create are immune to corruption by the Hiss or similar powers, and while anyone with psychic power can bond with them, you are able to purge bonds you disapprove of, as well as storing them in a space like your Warehouse and still accessing their power."
600,Mad Biologist,Gargoyles,"You know how to make DNA dance like a Las Vegas Showgirl. Whether you want to clone someone, modify a living person's biology, or some combination of the two, it's all in your grasp now. You just need to find the right samples, the right equipment, and it all works out."
600,Devil in the Details,Bayonetta,"A weapon is not a mere tool. It is not some piece of metal or material to be used and abused, to be simply discarded. It is the expression of a self's whims. Their lust. Their views on a battle and their views on death. You must learn a great deal about a person and spend a tremendous amount of time longer than usual to craft their weapon, to say nothing of the absurd material quality required. But if you do... the synergy between weapon and wielder increases their combat prowess and the effectiveness of their powers a significant amount. It might even grant them lesser, beneficial abilities while they wield it, if it's just right..."
600,Feel It Out,F.E.A.R.,"Your ability to understand machines and designs are more than just knowledge, and anyone who follows your work would know this well. You have a subtle psionic ability to 'understand' the machines and items that you physically touch, to the point where you can understand how it might work. More importantly, what you could do to also make it better. Naturally the more complex or esoteric the item is, the more drastically the time needed increases. But the more information you collect the more ideas and methods you can formulate to begin working."
600,Mega Bomb,Chrono Trigger,"Magic and Technology are both capable of some pretty fantastic things. So why not put them together, and see what happens? You now understand the secret to integrating magic seamlessly into your mechanical devices, enabling you to create devices like bombs powered with fire magic or medkits that use healing magic. While initially your devices will be one-shots that rely on a magical charge you have to deliver, in time, you'll learn how to make much more advanced fusions, such machines that run on magical power sources, or automated spellcasting devices. In the end, the only limit is your skill with machinery and magic."
600,Guru,Chrono Trigger,"Back in the glory days of Zeal, Guru was a title reserved only for the most skilled and knowledgeable of their mages and scientists. You might not be there yet, but when I'm done with you, you'll be well on your way to deserving the title. Magic is akin to a science to you, letting you delve into the secrets of sorcery the same way a physicist would unlock the secrets of the atom. This also includes learning how to apply magical knowledge like an engineer does the sciences, letting you come up with breathtaking magical wonders. The Blackbird, the Mammon Machine, the Ocean Palace - who knows what you'll add to that list of legends."
600,Device Meister,Lyrical Nanoha,"This is the real treasure of the TSAB's technological capabilities - mixing the use of magic and technology inorder to create Devices that can channel the energy outwards. You have a complete knowledge of how to build and maintain Devices, along with how to program AI for said Devices to use.
While you can construct most Devices and similar items presented here, the ability to make Unison Devices isn't included here - you'll have to learn that one on your own, and many have tried and failed to do so in the past. You could, with some experimentation, combine different magical systems into Devices together, especially with the help of 'Similar Principles' to streamline the process... it will take some trial and error, but you could apply these principles and Devices to other systems if you work at it enough."
600,In The Blood,Lyrical Nanoha,"That’s the key word, isn’t it? Legacy. You may or may not live forever yourself, but what about your creations? Your marvels? Your progeny? Whether or not you aspire to be a ruler yourself, you will find that there are ways to preserve your best traits, particularly within your own body or those of your descendants. You have learned the art of infusing mana into DNA, letting you create hereditary and unique magical abilities that are passed down from generation to generation, or specific individuals if you can’t be bothered to wait that long. Traits like a specific hair color, eye color, or body type is child’s play to you - and while complicated or powerful abilities may not always descend down the family tree, you could preserve the appearance and base talents of your bloodline for millennia to come. An affinity for a particular element, a talent for a set of skills, or even a unique magical ability tied specifically to the DNA of the user are valid examples for this. Whether you merely wish to experiment with magical DNA or begin a great dynasty, you will find that with the right motivation, your legacy could last forever."
600,Facets of Sockets,Gemcraft Frostborn Wrath,"Gems are both a way of effecting the world and a stable source of power, but they don't actually do anything unless directed. Sockets are the mounting points for gems, and they define how the gem's power is expressed in the world. They don't provide any power, but they provide a path for existing power to flow along in order to achieve specific results. This perk makes you an expert at the types of sockets in the gemcraft world, and also allows you to come up with novel designs in the future. All gemcrafters know how to create Towers, Gem-Traps, Lanterns, Amplifiers, and Pylons, but you can make more efficient versions of them that syphon off some of a gem's spare power to reinforce themselves. Oh, and we'll even toss in Magical Walls for free. Be aware that these structures are made of solidified mana and thus the more of them you have linked to your Orb of Presence (or around your personal fortress) the more building a new one will cost."
600,Pagan Science,Senki Zesshou Symphogear,"You've managed to uncover some of the secrets of old, the very same knowledge that underlies 'Sakurai Theory', the theoretical basis of the Symphogear system. With this knowledge, many of the more mysterious functions of the Symphogears become clear. You can repair and install new functions into Symphogears, that manipulate existing features, like forcing a berserk state or tuning it to raise synchronization coefficients. What's more, your glimpses into Sakurai theory indicate some possibilities of inducing Human-Relic fusion, but to complete the theory you'll need an existing test subject...
Capstone Boost: Looking through some of the notes made by Finé's reincarnation, you manage to glean the mechanism behind the energy-mass converter used to create the armor of a Symphogear. While you would still need a Relic to make a proper Symphogear, you can use this to store armor and weapons in the form of a small necklace, simply requiring that the user be able to sing the activation song to use."
600,Man of Progress,Arcane,"For thousands of years, magic was thought to be the domain of the few privileged to be born with the talent, or willing to mortgage their souls to demons or celestial beings. Now, thanks to Jayce Talis, that power has been democratised - somewhat, at least.
You share the same kind of innovative ability of Jayce and Viktor, able to make scientific leaps and bounds while others creep along at a steady pace behind you. Whatever fields of research you involve yourself in, you’ll find yourself making intuitive leaps, putting together disparate facts and seeing patterns where others only see noise. Besides your personal innovative abilities, you also have a knack for producing designs which can be adapted for mass production with relative ease and whose principles can be easily taught to others, so that you can uplift not only yourself, but those around you as well. Piltover is called the City of Progress, after all.
Your scientific prowess is at its height when you’re working based on some form of inspiration; perhaps trying to imitate some process seen in nature, or replicate spells and magic. Your inventions might not quite work the same as the original, but if you work long and hard enough, almost anything that can be done by natural or supernatural means can be measured, harnessed and controlled through the power of your scientific method."
600,Beyond the Bounds,Arcane,"While Piltover marches on into the future, it sometimes seems that Zaun has been left in the past. Even so, amongst its sunken towers there are those whose minds could outstrip any of the academics of Piltover, if they were only given the chance. Those high-and-mighty scholars might spit on your theories, call you mad or deluded, but you know better. You’re a genius.
You have an incredible talent for invention - not the stable kind that propels society as a whole forwards, but creating things that would be deemed preposterous by most, breaking the seeming bounds of science or crossing disciplines which seem incompatible to achieve the impossible. Machines that bend and twist time, spells that seem to go beyond the rules of magic, drugs which can heal a person from the very verge of death - you might create all of these, if you put your mind to it.
Such creations are generally difficult or near-impossible to replicate on a mass scale, and are often unstable or possess downsides or negative side-effects, but their potency cannot be understated."
600,Maker's Prodigy,Darksiders,"The makers decide to teach you the ways of creation and you may choose to become their pupil, they will teach you how to create magical artifacts, imbue places and objects with power and even how to create magical constructs with sentience. Regardless if you spend the time learning from them or not, you will find you learn future skills related to creation, enchantment and forging will come to you as if they were second nature, waiting to be remembered."
600,Crystal Working,Geneforge,"You intrinsically know how to work crystals and form them into useful magical systems, if you observe such a system you would know how to recreate it, and likely how to make it better. This will work on any magic that you understand, as a bonus you know how to create the intricate crystal systems that are part of the geneforge."
600,Reshaping,Geneforge,"Normally applying shaping magic to a living creature in some way other than an attempt at healing them will cause horrific and rather random results. Though much of shaping was developed by doing this, and carefully studying the results, truly modifying a living being to a great degree is impossible to control without carefully crafted essence, or incredibly complicated equipment such as the geneforge itself. You however have an innate ability to understand what you are doing and control the results."
600,Innate Genetic Understanding,Geneforge,"While all creations are the work of combining magical energy with essence, they still have genetics of their own, exactly as other creatures do. With this skill you have an innate understanding of those genetics, how to modify them for desired effects. You can also come to understand the genetics of creatures as you observe and come to understand them."
600,Atop the World,The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild - TG,"Walk this path carefully. This is the art that both saved, and destroyed Hyrule. You have unlocked knowledge of the greatest force multiplier the Sheikah were ever able to field - Large, walking, warmachines. You have a basic knowledge of the Sheikah’s art of automation and robotics, with this alone giving you the knowledge to craft the small Guardians utilized by Shrines in combat tests, with the right materials. However, with enough resources and development time...you could create constructs that could even rival the 4 great Divine Beasts. This is the pure expression of Power...just remember that Power must be tempered with Wisdom, and wielded with Courage. Power without restraint is the domain of Calamity Ganon, after all."
600,Flesh and Steel,The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild - TG,"Clothes can make the man, you've learned. It might be possible for someone to perform great feats of stealth in bulky plate, but even someone with that kind of skill would be much better served with the appropriate wear, right? And the tales of those with shining and enchanted armor allowing the hero to survive impossible odds are common - the hammer that could forge such a thing is now in your hands. With this skill, you can create armor and accessories(such as rings, jewelry, and armbands) that directly imbue the wearer with supernatural power, physical boosts, and prowess in certain skills. With this, you could create amber earrings that make one tougher, or a suit of armor that allows you to swim faster! In addition, if you have Hammer and Anvil, Gimmick and Trick and Fire and Ice - your weapon crafting skill is among the legendary smiths of old, able to create the kind of weapons only worthy of the 4 Champions of Hyrule itself, matching the mythic weapons of Hyrule such as the sword of Biggoron or the Six Sages!
DC: 2,100CP"
600,Starro-tech Notes,DC - Young Justice,"These notes detail the research Professor Ivo, Brain, and Klarion the Witch Boy took in order to create Starro-tech; a combination of technology, magic, and an ancient alien organism. With time, and some studies of your own, you may be able to apply the principles of Starro-tech to your creations as well, creating technology and creatures that have features of living beings, magic, and technology."
600,Tell me Everything,DC - Superman,"An easy enough thing to say, but human minds have a long way to go before they can understand Kryptonian technology, let alone use or reverse engineer it. Except you, that is. You could spend a few days getting a crash course in technology so alien it comes from entirely different galaxies, and come out of it fully capable of designing your own versions with modifications and improvements. Your mind is a scintillating, brilliant thing moving orders of magnitude faster than anyone else, with a multitasking, research and invention talent that would make you, as a completely normal person, the biggest threat to even a mighty Kryptonian in the fullness of his power. Technology yields up its secrets to every glimpse from you, and there is no tech in the world you cannot at least begin comprehending."
600,Never Underestimate the Power of Computers,DC - Superman,"Nor the power of... well, you. You are a complete and utter savant, a shining genius in the field of computer design and operation. Not only is your talent at hacking and network manipulation such that you could have whole corporations at your mercy twenty minutes after meeting a computer connected to them, you have the design chops to build stupidly, unbelievably advanced computers yourself. In future jumps too, your knowledge of computer software and hardware updates itself to the latest languages and design philosophies, ensuring that you're always capable of designing wonders such as what you can build here.
Nexusverse: 2,300CP"
600,Master of the Forge,The Elder Scrolls - Warriors,"You have reached near the peak of what mortals are capable of when it comes to your craft, capable of making gear so fine that most would consider them the stuff of legends. You are even capable of breaking down and enhancing items that would be considered as indestructible, making them into something even greater than before under your skilled hands."
600,Master of the Craft,The Elder Scrolls - Magic,"Through long study and years of effort, you have become an undisputed master of your craft. In addition to all of your enchantments being five times more potent, you have learned a very valuable, and very difficult technique. You can add new enchantments onto already enchanted items, as well as further enhancing pre-existing enchantments! With your skill, you could even make those vaunted Daedric Artifacts more powerful than they already are."
600,Chief Tonal Architect,The Elder Scrolls - The First Council,"There are few as talented in the art of Tonal Architecture as Kagrenac, the foremost arcane philosopher and magecrafter of the dwemer race. How strange it is, then, that you are every bit his equal. There are few avenues of Tonal Architecture you are not aware of and mastered, from their advanced machinery to the masterful stonemasonry. Indeed, your mastery would allow you to potentially start construction of your own Brass Tower."
600,Striving For Perfection,The Elder Scrolls - The First Council,"This world is imperfect, wild and chaotic, lacking the Anuic order that so many races of mer strive for. But you know that you could do that, make the world as perfect and ordered like clockwork. The longer you work on something, be it a blade or a society, your creation will be more efficient, more optimized, more powerful than it has any right to be. A blade crafted over the course of a month would be peerless, while a city created over the course of centuries would stand for many millennia afterwards without any upkeep.
World of Darkness: 4,600CP"
600,Alchemy,World of Darkness - Sorcerer,"Alchemy - This path allows the sorcerer to create potions, chemicals, and materials with supernatural qualities. Not all users think of themselves as alchemists, and may insist on being referred to as herbalists or simply skilled chemists.
[1] The alchemist may create more advanced versions of mundane chemicals, such as painkillers and glue. They are not overtly supernatural, and can easily be passed off as just a better brand.
[2] All that the first dot offered and more. The alchemist can create short lived steroids and potions that grant mystical senses for short periods.
[3] The alchemist's enhancements can now create mildly superhuman physical abilities and grant low level psychic powers, at least for short periods. They can also create materials and alloys that surpass what should be possible.
[4] More potent versions of what is available at 3 dots.
[5] With great study - or a sample - of a supernatural creature, the alchemist may replicate their various mid-level abilities for short periods. More potent abilities come with side effects.
[6] At this level, an alchemist may create such miracles as the Elixir of Eternal Youth, or even induce an Awakening."
600,A Correlation of Constants Between Physical Reality and Wondrous Artifice Creation,World of Darkness - Genius: The Transgression,"The work of a lifetime transcribed into your mind. The simplistic wish to have something real and valid in one's own hands materialized into a theory, no a Law, which by all rights should not exist as it does. All forms of Mania comes from the unknowable power of Inspiration but if looked at from another angle one can not help but to find themselves gazing backwards, after all even myths and legends usually have a grain of truth to them. Using a method of your own devising you have figured out how to break something down until you find the core idea that made it real in the first place, granting you an astounding ability to understand the working of something through proper physics. You can take any Non-Repeatable Phenomenon and translate it into a Repeatable Phenomena at the cost of exorbitant power and size upgrades. You have also reversed one of the eldest uses of Mania, the ability to power even mundane things as if with electricity, so that you can power your inventions on electricity instead of Mania.
Capstone Boost: This perk evolves on an knowledge based level. Whereas before you could convert the Non-Repeatable into the Repeatable you can now do so for just the replacement of some systems, to compensate for the electricity now needed in place of Mania. In addition to this effect you can create massive generators of Mania which can mine Bardos and other pocket dimensions for their unreal energies (Virtually endless energy but you’ll have to replace burnt out Bardos) and you have a total mastery of the Wonders you create, allowing you to create casual equivalents to any household, military, or social technology on earth with no commitment of Mania whatsoever. Ray guns that hit as hard as the hardest hitting pistol, communications arrays that reach global levels, and even flying cars equal in speed to a jet and maneuverability to the very best helicopter are all examples of technologies that you can produce that are true technology, no longer are they Wonders but now scientific fact."
600,A Master of the Axioms,World of Darkness - Genius: The Transgression,"Axioms are the ‘channels’ of mania that make the most orderly and understandable Wonders happen. The Axioms are not reliable, by any means, let alone consistent. A genius can imagine them as knots of cohesion floating in a vast illuminated sea of Idea, little islands where things almost make sense, though the shoreline shifts fractally with every passing second. Mastering each of the Axioms in turn allows a Genius to gain control of aspects of his own Wondrous works. A master of Axioms can do things beyond the scope of his fellows and has a true grasp of the deeper weirdness that comes with Mania. You have become a master of these powerful foundations. Most look at you in awe but you still feel there is further to go yet.
(See Notes for a full explanation of Axiom and this Capstone, along with it’s boosted effects)
In addition to this mastery of the Axioms allows you to utilize any other engineering or technological knowledge that you have, allowing you to make those types of devices as Wonders as well, enhancing their traits by doing so. Aside from the ability to create wonders from technology your Inspiration also allows you to see how the various technologies could be used together. Though this insight is small and it will take work to realize.
Capstone Boost: You have truly reached the apex of each of the Axioms. This total mastery has effects ranging from atomic bombs the size of decoder rings to time machines able to travel into the future and back again to scanners that can detect something anywhere at any time within the local heat death of the universe to massive scale of cloning. Kill sats able to instantly burning a city to ash and shields strong enough to stop said Kill sat are also things you can build. Incorporation of other engineering and technological perks will no longer true Wonders as the seamless integration gives birth Wonders that need no Mania to survive reality proper.
A master of Apokalypse, the Axiom that best represents discovery, could build a sensory platform capable of probing the truths and contrapositives that underlie material reality to reveal the truth of the world, anywhere within the local solar system. Boosted Mastery includes scanning all of reality for a singular object or scanning alternate dimensions.
An Epikrato, the Axionm of control, master can completely build a wonder to produce one of several results: to make crowds denser or sparser, to bring people or things to the genius through a series of improbably complex coincidences, to produce specific results within a complex unfolding event (that is, to rig elections, trigger riots, and produce other popular mass-events), and to manipulate wealth and the market. Each example is a distinct wonder. Boosted Mastery is a thing of fear, control over the mind can grow to the point where a Genius can completely control the unaware and even create life like hallucinations and sleeper agents tailored to keywords.
A master of Exelixi, Axiom of Healing, can resurrect the dead, at the cost of the Mania having a chance at changing the resurrected, heal even the most grievous wounds and preserve life in an inhospitable environment. Boosted Mastery can create immortality pills able to halt ageing for decades and cure any natural disease with ease, even things like biological faults are able to be healed at this point.
A master of Katastrof, Axiom of destruction, is capable of crafting weapons able to burn out hundreds of yards of area in an instant or vibrating swords able to loosen the molecular structure of object and people, both of which would have a tendency to ‘melt’ before such blade. Bombs that work like short lived low range black holes and rents in space-time in the shape of a sword held in place by a hilt of technology could represent Boosted Master of the Axiom of destruction, weapons at this level easily slay cities.
A master of Prostasia, Axiom of Protection, can shield a football stadium from the strikes of a weapon able to reduce it to a crater. An orbital defense grid able to take the enitry of the planets nuclear arsenal and stand tall is the only example of Boosted Master of Prostasia that comes to mind.
Skafoi’s masters could create vehicles able to travel the eddies of space at speeds around the Speed of Light, masters of this Axiom of travel speak of the ability to travel even the eddies of time but you have yet to reach such theories. Boosted Mastery of the Axiom of Travel grants the individual a firm grasp of space-time travel and the ability to even traverse the flows of time proper.

600,Magitek Mastery,Final Fantasy VI,"In essence, magitek is simply the use of magical energies as a power and fuel source for technology. Your understanding of that outstrips anyone else, and you can now apply this principle to any technology you own.
By altering your devices to use something magical in nature, such as a magicite stone, an enchanted item, or just raw magical energy, you can enhance it in every single way and give it unique properties. A suit of armor would become much harder, lighter, and more agile than before, perhaps even boosting the physical abilities of the wearer in line with the magical power source.
From there, the armor could make more esoteric uses of the magic, such as casting spells on its own based around the sort of magic infused into it automatically or at the wearer's prompting. This isn't some measly effect restricted to the mundane or basic, no, magic can infused into any sort of technological device to enhance its functionality and give it a partially magical nature and powers.
Even life may be infused with magitek technology like this, not only as cybernetics but directly as well. In this situation, it behaves a bit differently. The magic integrates itself into their body, becoming a natural part of them, allowing them access to that magic system and enhancing them physically, but they must grow into it. They start at a much weaker level, where they have to practice and develop their connection to this magic to realize it fully.
There's no upper limit to them beyond what the magic's system is capable of, but it can take time, and you can instead choose to infuse living things with a larger amount of magic to grant them greater magical ability much more quickly. Unfortunately, this can have dangerous side effects, as giving them too much to handle at once can lead to mental instability or even insanity, the severity rapidly scaling upwards the more initial energy put in."
600,Materia Extraction,Final Fantasy XIV,"Your common Adventurer probably has no clue about what Materia even is, but through your trade connections, you've gotten quite a bit of experience firsthand. Materia are crystals - certainly that much is evident - but the Goblin who taught you also told you that Materia is basically the ""memory"" of a piece of equipment.
You weren't aware that equipment could have memories. By slotting in Materia during the refining process or forging process of a piece of equipment, you can ""pass on"" those memories, improving a piece of equipment.
But the Goblin warns you about one thing - taken too far, Materia can give life to things that were intended to be dead. Legends speak of weapons known as the Zodiac Weapons, which became sentient with the accumulation of so many memories. You're not sure how much Materia that would take, but a sentient weapon is an interesting thought."
600,Materia Adaptation,Final Fantasy XIV,"Materia - so ill explained, yet so popular among Adventurers and Crafters alike. Though you understand it to be the ""essence"" of equipment which have seen use and have accumulated a wealth of experience, there are still far too many questions left unanswered.
From your instructor's experience however, just as an individual can be given experience through exposure to the actions of others - the equipment can be bestowed experience with the insertion of Aether.
Your instructor's explanation for this was brief, and perhaps not as concise as you hoped. What you've seen in practice is that any piece of equipment can be infused with experience to create ""Materia"" - allowing them to be turned into a crystal if necessary.
The accumulation of ""Materia"" leads to equipment slowly becoming sentient, but that would require the Materia to be ""slotted"" onto a target piece of equipment and slowly absorbed over time. A Blacksmith could probably perform the slotting process, but with Aether manipulation, you can raise the experience of any equipment, thereby making better ""Materia""."
600,Retro-Engineer,Marvel Cinematic Universe Vol. 1,"Your understanding of technology is so great that you've even learned to get into the basics of tinkering with alien technologies. As long as you take the time to study something and experiment properly, you'll eventually figure out a method for that tech you found. Whether it's taking that weird glowing thing and powering your machines with it, or dismantling an alien robot and putting it into a gun, you'll figure out a use for something as long as you put in time. As a bonus, you're skilled enough in research and experimentation that you're far less likely to break what you're studying on accident.
Capstone Boost: gives you insight into Asgardian theories in using magic in the creation of technology seamlessly, and the utilization of magic in scientific theories and technology. This allows you to make great leaps in using magitech, and eventually learn the inner workings of Asgardian 'technology' to create works like the Bifrost or enchanted weapons that can focus abilities through them."
600,Bring Out Veronica,Marvel Cinematic Universe Vol. 2,"There's always that escalating threat that seems to loom over your head. Always something trying to make sure that you can't rest, lest you be caught unprepared. It's a stressful line of thinking, but that stress will see you through. Looming threats will spark your ingenuity and manufacturing speed tremendously, allowing you to quickly take stock of the situation and use information surrounding said threats to create countermeasures and machines custom-tailored for the situation in a fraction of the time it would normally take. Knowledge of the monster tearing down cities could see you adapting and fielding a custom armor for taking it down, or learning very rapidly from your mistakes in one fight to adapt your technology for the next fight.
Capstone Boost: has shown you how matter can be shaped and wielded with proper application, and so the magic you have found can likewise be shaped. Enchantments are stronger and come much easier, in time allowing you to create great Relics while learning how to mimic the enchantments of others just by studying the bonds of magic."
600,Forgemaster,Marvel Magic,"You are skilled in the art of the forge. You craft weapons and shape armor in the way a master artist plies their trade. Perhaps you trained with a god of the forge or studied under the dwarves of Nidavellir or maybe you've simply honed your skills over lifetime's. Whatever the case, your skill with the forge goes beyond what normal mortals would be able to accomplish. You have the skill to work with metals; though perhaps not the natural hardiness required to survive the conditions needed to forge them. And even were you to only have sub-par mundane materials, you could still craft weapons and armor fit for any king who has ever lived. Further, if you know how to utilize the mystic arts, you will find yourself talented at enchanting your creations with your spells and perhaps you will even be able to forge great and powerful artifacts. But the modern world has largely moved beyond the crude weapons of old and if you wish, you may do so as well. With some effort you would be able to transfer your skills to more advanced components, creating powerful firearms or masterful mechanical vehicles."
600,Artifact Savant,Marvel Magic,"Agomotto, the first Sorcerer Supreme of earth, created many wondrous things still in use all of these millennia later. Perhaps his most notable creation was that of the Three-Fold Path, a system of magic still in widespread use today. But also extremely important were the potent magical artifacts he created, many of which serve invaluable roles as badges of office for the Sorcerer Supreme and tools for the defense of all existence. You understand just how powerful and important such tools can be, for you yourself are a skilled and talented enchanter. You find that imbuing items with powers is a simple matter for you, overlaying nearly any spell or magical ability you know onto some item to more easily invoke it yourself or even to allow others to do so. Though you are not yet as skilled in the creation of such wonders as Agomotto, this may yet change in time. Perhaps you will even find a way to permanently imbue living beings with your magic to grant them great powers of their own."
800,Correspondent,Sunless Skies,"You become a scholar of the mysterious language of the stars, the Correspondence. You can’t claim to be a fluent speaker of the tongue, you still have your eyebrows, but you do know a great many glyphs and their meanings. You even have a grasp of the arcane grammar of the Correspondence, allowing you to chain glyphs together. Writing them down, or speaking them aloud, these glyphs can have profound effects on the world. Usually setting things profoundly on fire, but still, profound. When encountering new sigils, you can glean their meaning, and whether or not their presence has an influence on the surroundings. Alternatively, you gain similar insight into the Discordance, the Correspondence’s chilly opposite used by the sable suns, or you may purchase this perk twice to gain the benefits of both, but only one version may be discounted."
900,Inspiration,World of Darkness - Genius: The Transgression,"Ideas crash like thunder through a genius' life every moment of their lives, barely contained, often barely understood. This is Inspiration, the illumination within, the raw stuff of genius. The greater a genius' Inspiration, the more power of creation and destruction she possesses. But there is a cost. As a genius Inspiration increases, she becomes less able to understand mundane concerns. She struggles to hold onto her Obligation, as people seem more like systems to be explored than individuals with their own lives and concerns. As she becomes almost godlike in her perspective, she must focus to concentrate on the mortal world and its concerns. As your Inspiration grows the buring power of Mania grows with it.
All Genii start with a free purchase of Inspiration, Lemurians get three purchases free. It cost 100 CP to upgrade Inspiration. Your Inspiration can not exceed 10, free purchases included."
1200,Maker,Darksiders,"You gain an alternate form of a maker, broad, Immensely strong and around 12 feet tall. You also gain supernatural powers of creation, able to make impossible things from practically nothing. Though it may take many years of practice, you will be able to master the art of crafting life from clay, Forge magic spells from ideas of the mind, and matter from nothing."
