0,Mica’s Training,Outer Wilds,"You know your way around piloting a spaceship. Nothing special, really — don’t expect to be pulling any high-speed maneuvers, but you can navigate in three dimensional space well enough to travel between planets with relative ease and grace, or use your thruster pack to move around."
0,Gossan’s Training,Outer Wilds,"You’re well-trained in the proper maintenance of the equipment you can acquire here, be it space suits, thruster packs, or even your own spaceship. It’s not going to save you any seats at an engineering college or anything, but you won’t be stranded if your suit tears or your fuel line ruptures."
0,Explain And Identify,Outer Wilds,"The tenets of Nomai philosophy: to seek out and understand. You are granted special insight into the fields of study the Nomai investigated so many years ago, allowing you to eventually replicate the various scientific wonders seen across the planets in this solar system and in the rewards here. Your ability to comprehend, analyze, and extrapolate on data, observations, and scientific knowledge is improved drastically, and the laws of physics that govern the technology from this Jump will remain functional for you and those you teach, seamlessly incorporating into the laws of physics of any future universe you visit."
0,A Stranger Field Of Science,Outer Wilds,"You gain special insight into the unique field of science pioneered by the inhabitants of the Stranger, allowing you to eventually replicate the seemingly miraculous technological developments you will find over the course of your stay in this world. In addition, you will be given a head start by knowing the rough design philosophies behind the foundational pieces of their technology."
0,Prolong,Honor Harrington,"A simple, perfectly medical treatment performed in this world, prolong extends a person’s lifespan dramatically, easily adding multiple centuries. You get a full treatment for free, as well all the knowledge and information you need to start doing it yourself elsewhere.
While in this jump you cannot give prolong treatments to people who are already too old to receive them normally (unless you solve that particular scientific breakthrough yourself, which no one in-setting has), but post-jump you may give them to anyone you like. Note that prolong is designed to work with human and mostly-human genetics, so you’ll still need the relevant scientific chops of your own to adapt it to alien races."
0,"Class & Specializations: Engineer, Mechanic",Mass Effect,"Some races have it better than others in terms of how many options they have available to them. You are permitted to take one class and one specialization for free. You will get enough training in your class to be considered an asset to any team. Not to the point of being a keystone.
You are considered to be to a similar level when it comes to your specialization. Classes are systems in which an individual can have one or two focuses in combat, technology, or biotic talents.
Specializations are various apexes that can be reached. For an additional specialization it will be 100CP if they are in your class, and 200CP if they are not or for a different race. If you take a specialization that doesn't correspond to your class, you will be trained in it, but not have a talent for it. Almost all classes and specializations give you some level of implants. You may forgo these, but that will weaken what you can do. You also get a set of gear per your two choices. You get more depending on further classes or specializations.
Classes have a brief overview but are considered to possess a tested understanding and ability to use all their basic abilities that they'd have access to. Specializations are mostly, if not entirely, covered in the descriptions provided. Your wank may get you some less or more from the fluff in either case. Just get the listed otherwise.
Engineer (Focus: Tech):
Engineers are pure technology specialists. Although they lack the implants that most other classes wield, they make up for it with their high-spec military grade omni-tools, capable of bypassing shields and armor or incapacitating robotic targets and some synthetics. They can deploy combat drones to harass enemies.
Mechanic – A more purely focus Engineer. From fighters and frigates to Mass Effect fields and automated machines, you know your way around and are aside fairly versed in mechanical theory. You might not know how to build something, but you can almost certainly figure it out with time."
0,Single Style: Kalaripayit,GUNNM,"Solid theoretical and practical experience of a single form of personal combat. In the wasteland, what martial arts survive are pragmatic descendants of old world teachings. In the Scrapyard however, there are genuine schools of combat, though they are often overlooked – most human styles are ineffective against the crudest cyborg brawler, and the emphasis is to strike fast and run away faster.
From India, and almost certainly the oldest art still in use. Kalaripayit begins with meditation, massage and yoga to build strength and clear the mind, before progressing to weapons and finally unarmed combat. The most distinctive weapon in use today is the whip-sword, as used by the Grand Champion in the form of his Grind-Cutters. Advanced unarmed techniques focus on striking vital points for healing and killing. Cyborgs who follow this style usually dispense with the boring philosophy and skip to the good stuff."
0,Valkyrie Skill,Battle Action Harem Highschool Side Character Quest,"You have the training and knowledge in the operation of a Valkyrie frame. This includes basic skills such as synching and desynching with a Core, storing items and later expressing them, expressing your Valkyrie Frame and individual components, to more advance skills such as aiming and firing weapons, flying, shaping your Impeller Field, and other essential skills. Your level of skill and knowledge depends on your origin. First years only have relatively basic level knowledge and skills, while Aces have more advance levels reflective of you being a third-year and having actual battlefield experience rather than simulations. Instructors have expert and mastery level knowledge and skill which comes from being a veteran Valkyrie pilot and is required to properly teach cadets."
0,Serene Sinatra,Macross,"You're no slouch in the singing department, that's for sure. You may not be popular idol material, but no one's going to complain if you decide to sing along to a song or randomly bust out a tune with a voice like this. Who knows, maybe you could practice and get a little better?"
0,Basic Training,Macross,"Piloting a Variable Fighter can be pretty complex. There's all kinds of modes and maneuvers to worry about... with this, you won't have to worry so much. You'll know which button does what, and you won't end up turning into a mech when you need a jet. ...but I reserve the right to laugh if you mess up anyway."
0,Guardian Training,Warhammer 40k - Craftworld Eldar,"Everyone serves the military at one point or another. However, Guardians are civilian militia called to put on their war masks for the Craftworld. Basic training includes instruction on how to move and shoot with great accuracy, how to read maps, set up ambushes, and basics of hand to hand combat. Compared to the average Imperial conscript, your basic training is of far better quality, as individuals are valued more alive than dead."
0,Psychic Race,Warhammer 40k - Craftworld Eldar,"All Eldar are psychic, putting them in the low psychic ratings naturally. The benefits include telepathy, limited clairvoyance, and limited telekinesis. Their minds glow bright within the Warp; if a Human Psyker is a flashlight in the dark, an Eldar is a strobe light in the dark. The Path system and their spirit stones keep their souls safe from prying monsters of the warp."
0,Eldar Physiology,Warhammer 40k - Craftworld Eldar,"A quick glance will tell you that an Eldar is much like a human. However they are a genetically engineered race of beings, created to be near perfection. Such must be the case for those forged by the Old Ones to destroy the Necrontyr. Their bodies seem to be stretched, and wiry muscles do not lose tone from lack of use. Their eyes are almond shaped and glimmer like jewels, capturing every available light beam and reflecting it back - not unlike a cat's eyes, which grants them superior senses in low light conditions. Additionally, their ears are incredibly sensitive to sound, vibrations, and temperature changes. Lastly, their reflexes and speed are unmatched by anything the Imperium of Man can muster, save for Officio Assassinorum killers."
0,Call me Mr. Necron,Warhammer 40k - Necrons SB Edition,"One thing you have to admit about the Necrons is, the names are pretty damned cool. Trazyn the Infinite, Imotekh the Stormlord... there’s a panache to them. Now you get your own Necron name, complete with epithet. You may insist everyone use it whenever they address you or refer to you in the future, and people will do so regardless of what it may exactly be. If you ever get tired of it, you can select a new name and epithet and people will start referring to you by that instead. Your name also invokes an emotion of your choice in people, such as awe or fear."
0,Necron Physiology ​,Warhammer 40k - Necrons SB Edition,"The Necrodermis shell that serves as your body may be regarded as a curse by many, but it is not without its upsides. Perhaps the most obvious benefit is that you do not age. Your once pathetic lifespan is now immeasurable. Just as it resists the ravages of time, it is remarkably resilient against damage. Your immaculately constructed shell can take damage comparable to the Artificer Armor of an Astartes, and what few wounds you sustain will be regenerated by Living Metal."
0,Homo Sapiens Rotundus,Warhammer 40k - Squats,"You are a Squat, the most successful  and widespread of the abhuman races. You are short, the average Squat is 1.4 meters tall (4.5 feet) and stocky. Coming from heavy gravity worlds, you are quite strong and resilient and can drink even Space Marines under the table. Unless they’re Space Wolves, then it’s anyone’s game. Also long-lived (2-3 centuries is common) and have a very keen memory and surprisingly nimble fingers on those proportionally huge hands. Your hair is also tougher and faster-growing than baseline humanity. Finally, you have an inborn psychic potential that grows, very slowly, with age."
0,Primarch Physiology,Warhammer 40K - Horus Heresy: The Primarchs,"All the Emperor’s sons have been forged out of both physical matter and pure psychic force. In some, this manifests as incredible psychic talents, in others more esoteric gifts, but all have some things in common. You are to Astartes what Astartes are to children, standing head and shoulders over your fellows and obviously superior in every measurable way. You can hurl around Terminator armoured Astartes like they were children or punch straight through their plating, move far faster than even Astartes sight can follow, and even briefly lift a small Titan under your own power. A breathing apparatus is largely useless for Primarchs, for excepting a few chemical weapons and hellish worlds, a Primarch can breathe just fine in nearly any environment and even fight for hours without air amid the void of space. Not only that, you possess a fairly quick regeneration ability; you will heal from bruises in mere seconds and fully recover cuts down to the bone in minutes for a regular cut to hours for having the flesh entirely stripped off. But it is already extremely difficult to actually wound a Primarch, who is capable of surviving shots from tank cannons, bathing in molten rock, and being shot through the eye with sniper rounds. The average Primarch is also notably extremely resistant to psychic powers – capable of largely shrugging off all but attacks from extremely rare, extremely powerful psykers, though you may lower your resistance if you wish to be easier to affect with psychic powers such as healing and buffs from your allies."
0,Primarch Mentality,Warhammer 40K - Horus Heresy: The Primarchs,"Your mind is every bit as honed as your body. Your towering intellect would be considered genius among the greatest of men, though naturally inferior to the Emperor Himself. At the least, you have perfect eidetic memory (though there are ways to make you forget) and can memorise vast quantities of information far faster than any living human has or ever will. Furthermore, all Primarchs seem remarkably resistant to Chaos corruption and possession; short of directly clutching a Daemon weapon, being wounded by a specific weapon meant to corrupt you personally, or willingly letting the power of Chaos into you, you do not fear the gradual insanity and corruption into darkness lesser men might face. A Primarch naturally has the kind of towering willpower to resist Chaos in general, even the Ruinous Powers must put some serious effort and elaborate plans into luring one over to their side."
0,Psychic Abilities,Warhammer 40K - Horus Heresy: The Primarchs,"You are, even before any other purchases, a very strong psyker. However, your powers most likely manifest as latent abilities you have no particular influence over, and many Primarchs showed an... aversion to psychic powers that further limited their ability to develop them. If you were to deliberately apply yourself, learn to unlock your psychic potential and learn to safely use it, you could easily become an Alpha psyker at the very least. This is your raw potential and barring any other purchases in jump will begin entirely latent and untapped by yourself though it remains entirely possible you can awaken your gifts and reclaim your birthright as a mighty psychic demigod. Constant exposure to the Warp or the gifts of the Dark Gods may even empower you further..."
0,Lingua-Technis,Warhammer 40K - Adeptus Mechanicus,"Known only to the devotees of the Machine God despite the best efforts of outsiders over millennia, the adepts of Mars speak to each other in bursts of binaric code. This allows for a great deal of information to be communicated quickly and discreetly. Even if somehow translated, it is a complex language thick with ancient and arcane terminology that few outsiders could ever hope to make any sense of. This language and your implants allow you to communicate quickly with other adepts, transferring messages and code many times faster than ordinary speech."
100,Weapons,Star Trek: TNG,Knowledge in the operation and repair of personal and mounted weaponry.
100,Medicine,Star Trek: TNG,"Training and knowledge in First-aid, diseases, surgery, anatomy, health and nutrition. You're a fully qualified doctor of the 24th century."
100,Robotics,Star Trek: TNG,"A combined study of mechanical engineering, and computer science. You learn how to make a wide array of machines, and you could even figure out Android or Borg technology if you studied it enough."
100,Physics,Star Trek: TNG,"How the universe works. The law of gravity, the conservation of matter & energy, quantum physics, etc. Remember though, there are dozens of creatures in this universe that defy the laws of human physics, so you may want to try and rewrite a few of these books while you're here."
100,Physical Sciences,Star Trek: TNG,"Understanding of the natural laws which govern the physical world. Biology, chemistry, geology and ecology. Again, you may want to rewrite a few of these books while you're here."
100,Engineering,Star Trek: TNG,"You've been trained in the maintenance and repair of Starships. Not only do you have a significant amount of mechanical and computer knowledge, but you also know a great deal about physics."
100,Bandit Gunsmith,Borderlands,"You have amazing technical insight and when shown a pile of broken weapons or energy shields you can use parts from some to reassemble others into decent condition. Don't expect it to be pretty, but you can nail 15 repeater pistols together to make a functional shotgun, or use bits of five shields to make one that works."
100,Spanner Hand,Revelation Space,"You're very good at fixing things...and, it has to be said, breaking them as well. You've a keen eye for the right places on a machine to do some damage; load-bearing supports, sensor clusters, stress bands in the hull. But the reverse still holds: when it comes to up-armoring something, reinforcing it, and ironing out any weaknesses, you'll find the optimal placement for those, too."
100,4-D ASSEMBLER,The Culture – Minds,"The Involucra were the builders of the Shellworlds, and your civ has a similar affinity for their construction methods. In what most humans think of as reality, these structures appear entirely normal, but to those who can see into hyperspace, they extend out of the skein of the universe into infraspace and ultraspace. 4-D architecture has very unusual properties, as it can be gravitationally self-supporting – they do not crumble under their own gravity, or that of the stellar body they are on – and are also heavily resistant to damage. Another unusual feature is that they also cut off all hostile forms of communication, travel or transport that attempt to pass through their walls – displacement, hyperspace signals, wormholes, even beings recalled or summoned from elsewhere are prevented from passing through the structures’ walls."
100,Hull Architect,Endless Space,"You know how to design ships. From nose to engine, you could draft up a functional space worthy ship. On paper. Putting all the pieces together maybe beyond you, but anyone who puts it together will agree, it's a mighty fine ship."
100,Decadence,Dune,"You have the skills to sacrifice neither form nor function when you design, create, or arrange things, which is especially important in a society whose upper crust values opulence the way this society does --after all, the Emperor's throne is carved out of a single massive gemstone. Whether it's interior decorating, crafting a knife or sword, building furniture or a vehicle... you can make it appeal perfectly to the most crass or the upper crust. You can also figure out the optimal decor for any purpose or environment, which includes the best places to hide discreet surveillance devices."
100,Medicine,GUNNM,"You have the skills of a surgeon, first-responder and pharmacist, all roughly bundled together with a lot of hands-on experience with the worst injuries the wasteland has to offer. Your hands are steady, your focus unperturbed by the sight and stench of gore and viscera, and you have the precise and quick reflexes necessary to swat a fly with a scalpel. You also have a fair bit of experience with slightly inhuman and mutated physiology, and are very quick to pick up on new techniques and tools."
100,Technical Expertise,Generic Cyberpunk,"People use technology every day but that doesn't mean they understand or are skilled with it. You're not one of them. You're a deft hand at working with and understanding technology and machines, picking up anything you need to know to use and work with them easily. Given anything more than just a passing familiarity you'll be a whiz with it, able to work magic when you get your hands on the inner workings of whatever you're dealing with. Whether that's peeling apart computers and piecing hardware back together to make a much better system, tweaking software in ways that make it run like a dream, or working magic in a garage with vehicles that have seen better days nobody can deny you have the talent."
100,The Right Tools,Generic Cyberpunk,"They can be hard to find, but when resources are hoarded and hard to come by you've learned to make do. You can easily improvise for tools and materials you lack by creatively using what you do have, even if that means using scrap to build the tools to build the tools you need. Even if you're lucky enough to have a fully stocked workshop or lab this will come in handy, as you'll be able to do a great deal more with what you have instead of needing to commission or build specialized equipment for every unique little thing. You'll never be empty handed and useless for long."
100,Biohacker,Eclipse Phase,You are skilled in designing genetically modified organisms from existing species. This includes developing Uplifts (if the base species is smart enough) and designing new transgenic morphs and designer organisms.
100,Hard Hat,Eclipse Phase,"You are an expert software engineer, capable of writing programs to carry out complex and interlinked tasks. You could write an AI from scratch (in time) and design simulspaces for the best VR games and sims."
100,Mega-Engineering,Eclipse Phase,"You like to build big things. Spaceships capable of holding thousands of people, space habitats, surface colonies, dams, ocean- spanning bridges, orbital elevators. Knowing how the diverse systems that megastructures need interact with the forces they are under is just as important as how they are arranged."
100,White Hat,Eclipse Phase,"You are an expert at defending your personal WAN or other networks and mesh sites from intrusion, finding backdoors and backtracing the physical location of intruders."
100,Black Hat,Eclipse Phase,"You are an expert at breaking into secure computer networks or mesh sites and wreaking as much havoc as you like. Security AIs are no match for you, but a competent sysadmin can make things very difficult or even impossible for you."
100,Device Engineering,Eclipse Phase,You are an expert at designing and building portable and mobile items from scratch. Anything from a flashlight up to a flying car. You can build items from scrounged materials and put disused materials to new uses without having to disassemble it all the way back to raw materials.
100,MedTech,Eclipse Phase,"You are a medical technician, trained in emergency first aid and field surgery - you know, the kind they used to do before they could just dump the injured in a healing vat and let the nanomachines do the work. You can install and remove over-the-counter cyberware and wetware, and perform reconstructive surgery."
100,Nanotechnician,Eclipse Phase,"You specialise in building things small. You are capable of designing most types of nanotech systems, from flea-sized microbots, free- roaming nanoswarms, internal nanoware for morphs, and the nanofabrication systems that make life in the solar system possible through Fabbers, Makers and Desktop Cornucopia Machines."
100,Bling of War,Macross,"It's one thing to have a weapon or vehicle of mass destruction, capable of rending an entire ground force or a squadron to shame. It's another to make it look so damn good your enemies would not dare get near it if they had a lick of sense. By purchasing this perk, you can design your equipment to look much more stylish and carry a 'theme' you prefer. This can range from the clothes you wear, to the weapons you wield, to even the vehicles you pilot into battle. It's all about style."
100,Wrench Wench,Macross,"Lubricants, fluids, cramped spaces, a lot of things can make a techie experience problems. You're different, you have a job that NEEDS to be done. You keep your skills and fine motor control regardless of working conditions, whether you have to work in a tiny box or if your hands are dripping wet in oil. On the plus side, claustrophobia is something you're immune to now, so no worries about sticking your head inside of a cramped fighter jet to do some gut work on the inside!"
100,Customized Weapons,XCOM,"You know that efficiency is number one, because waste is a thief. You know how to make the best designs better, and will ensure that the equipment in use is ergonomic, streamlined, and efficient."
100,Artistic Architect,Halo - Forerunner Saga,"Forerunner structures are not simple. Even in the worst of times, there is a beauty to their layout. Patterns woven into walls, shining pillars reaching to the sky, and shimmering glass panes adjourning corridors. Forerunners don't just build big. They build artfully. Like so many other Builders, you have an eye, and a hand, for beauty in construction. From the most simple of floors, to the most terrifying of weapons, you can spruce them up so that they are breathtaking to behold."
100,Fun in the Sun,Warhammer 40K - T'au Empire,"Plasma, radiation, and antimatter are all similar in that they relate to exotic and high energy states of matter, whether it is stellar mass or individual particles of subatomic size. You now are a master of T'au technology as it relates to manipulating these high-energy states of matter and the physics that underpin them."
100,Master of Technology,Warhammer 40K - Minor Xenos,"You have the innate understanding of technology shared by all Jokaero. You can modify weapons and armor on the fly in the field with minimal tools, improving or specializing their function as you desire. You can also produce and upgrade many types of rare and powerful technology, miniaturizing weapons like Lascannons into digi-weapons or strengthening Refractor fields immensely. Likewise, these skills of improvement, customization, and miniaturization can apply to other technologies that you personally understand."
100,Plowshares from Swords from Plowshares,Warhammer 40k - Squats,"You might have noticed most of the best Squat vehicles and weapons are repurposed mining and industrial equipment. This is no accident, for not only do such things have to be tough, they are intimately familiar to operators and engineers alike. You have a particular genius for weaponizing civilian technology, and finding constructive industrial uses for weapons."
100,Arts and Craft,Warhammer 40K - Horus Heresy: The Primarchs,"You can craft works of beauty, weave any incredibly intricate designs, coatings of gold, without affecting its usability at all. With this perk you can shift up all the aesthetics of something. Of course, you are also a highly skilled painter, sculptor and artist in general on top of this; only the greatest of mortal artists could hope to match or even exceed any art you pour yourself into."
100,Eternal Edifice,Warhammer 40K - Horus Heresy: The Primarchs,"Nothing you build will surrender to the passage of time; bury it for ten thousand years and it will work just as well as on the day it was forged. Imperial technology was built to last, as yours will be too."
200,Hearthian Engineering,Outer Wilds,"The Hearthians may not be the most scientifically advanced, especially when compared to the Nomai before them, but they are capable of hashing together astoundingly functional construction out of very basic stuff. You gain a similar boost to your ability to creatively apply nearly any technology you can get your hands on — what you can’t reverse engineer to make your own, you can at least take advantage of to improve what you have. Finally, your ability to jury-rig tech out of basic parts is enough to let you make even basic computers out of simple woodwork and gears, let alone what you could make with a more solid technological foundation."
200,"Science!: Mechanics, Medical, Engineering",Transformers,"Your programming is focused on either Mechanics, Medical, or a field of Science (Pick One), this gives you equivalent of a Cybertronian PHD in that field of study. You receive discounts on the other specialties if you choose this again."
200,Infinitely Customizable,Dead Space,"It's not that your guns are bad, by any stretch of the imagination, it's just that they could be so, so much better. And now you can actually do that. In this world, tools and weapons are aided by nano-scale circuitry, which leaves a lot of room for improvement, typically in the form of power nodes being welded into specific places to provide extra power to certain subsystems of the weapon, to increase power output, ammo count/efficiency, and even unlock special abilities, like setting enemies on fire, or exploding violently. As an added benefit, you also get the ability to break weapons and tools down into parts - specifically frames, tools, tips, accessories, and upgrade chips, see the Notes section for more information - and reconfigure them to your liking. You can even upgrade those parts individually using power nodes."
200,Maliwan Intern,Borderlands,"At some point, you got lucky and figured out how Elemental Weapons really work. You know how to use them to best effect, allowing you to set enemies on fire regularly, melt people with acid bullets, and have ALL kinds of shocking adventures with electrical ammo. If you have any technical training, you can even jury-rig ways to apply elemental effects to other weapons, as well."
200,Programmer,Stargate: Atlantis,"You're seriously competent at the art of programming, even to the extent of adapting programs to run on alien computer architecture. You could debug kernel code in your sleep (and maybe you have). If you can (or learn to) read Lantean or Wraith this includes programming in their software languages."
200,Thinking with Portals,Endless Space,"You know how to make interstellar portal arrays! They take a considerable amount of resources to build, have no defensive systems, and need to be linked together, but any system or planet you claim as your own is able to build them, allowing you to instantly travel between systems you have already claimed. Due to exotic (And very, very lethal) radiation produced during each transit, these are unsuited for placement on a colonized world. Atomic weaponry has nothing on these portals' ability to destroy a biosphere. If you take Pocket Portals, you are able to reduce the radiation to background levels, making it safe to install them planetside."
200,Behind the Shadows,Honor Harrington,"There is more to technology than just big booms, you know. Oh yes, you do. You are utterly incredible at all kinds of stealth based technologies. You can build up infrastructure and shipyards in total secrecy, with not a soul becoming aware, and the results tend to be some of the best cloaked and concealed ships and weapons in the galaxy. The spider drive, with all of the supporting tech needed for it, is only one of the examples of what you're capable of with this perk."
200,Powered Productivity,DOOM 3,"Why are there so many excessively high-powered systems employed in the UAC Mars base? Well, at its most basic because it works. Brute force might be lacking in elegance, but there is nonetheless a certain charm to deciphering ancient hieroglyphs with a computer mainframe the size of a ten-story building, or getting started on a terraforming project with what could charitably be called a self-sustaining nuclear fusion system. You're adept at using such immense volumes of raw energy and potential, and can easily find ways to turn challenging but complex problems into well, equally challenging but decidedly simpler problems with a suitable application of raw power. Not only that, but you also possess a high degree of skill in making sure these kinds of energy use don't lead to further problems, like unbalancing the power grid or burning out the circuitry. It might not be pretty, but without asking yourself 'why not try more power?', would the UAC ever have developed such mighty new technologies as the Plasma Rifle or the BFG-9000?"
200,Hellish Advancement,DOOM 3,"The teleportation research in the Delta Labs is arguably the most advanced field of science known to mankind today. With potential applications in everything from aeronautics to personal transportation, both short-range and long-range teleporters represent one of the greatest advances in recent decades and the fact that they operate by tunneling through literal hell is hardly a detriment, is it?
You are a master of using dimensional technologies, especially those relying on less than pleasant realms for their function. From dedicated safety systems to mapping the hellish wastelands of the damned 'by remote' to find the most efficient paths, if it involves alternate realities or physical embodiments of evil you've probably got some ideas on how to make use of your findings. Even better if it involves both."
200,Loaded Up,Generic Cyberpunk,"It's not enough to have what you need locked away back in the workshop, and even when you have time to prepare you often have to pack light. You have a particular genius when it comes to building and working with tools, gadgets, weapons, armor, and other personal scale equipment. Whether it's cramming a computing setup that would take up an entire workstation into something that a hacker can slap onto their arm for on the fly hacking, or taking a normal pistol and modding it until it's more lethal and effective than most military arms, you're able to cram a stupefying amount of effectiveness into easily ported packages. Your creativity, skills, and genius just seem to skyrocket when dealing with things in sizes that would hamper anybody else. Bigger doesn't always mean better, sometimes it just means cumbersome."
200,Neuromancer,Generic Cyberpunk,"You've mastered the arts of interfacing machines and the human mind, able to both design and build things to seamlessly interface with the human nervous system and the actual consciousness housed within it. Building an implant or accessory to let people access the net with just a thought wouldn't be difficult at all, neither would making sure that a cybernetic connects so seamlessly with the user that it feels more natural than their original arm. You've also mastered the use of such a simple if almost magical technology, not just it's construction. Combined with some programming skills, full immersion Virtual Reality would easily be within your grasp. You've bridged the gap between mind and machine, it's up to you to discover where you go with it from here."
200,Blueprint Designer,Eclipse Phase,"In a time when most goods and foodstuffs are produced in fabbers, makers and Desktop Cornucopia Machines, it pays to know how to work them. You have a talent for designing blueprints that are much faster to assemble and far more efficient in their use of raw materials, which means smaller quantities of rare feedstock or raw materials are needed, and thus cheaper.While shaving down the mass of hydrocarbons required for a design doesn’t seem like much, out in the resource-scarce outer system that margin of efficiency can mean the difference between being able to fab up a life-saving device, or not."
200,Finger of Silver,Macross,"While other kids were building tinker-toy creations, you were fiddling with your dad's car and doing a better job than him. By purchasing this, meddling with machines and OverTechnology is as easy as breathing for you. By getting your hands on something, you can easily figure out how it works and how to copy its inner workings, provided that it wasn't just bullshit magic. The more advanced something is, the harder it may be... but with time and effort, you just might succeed."
200,Peak ADVENT Technology,XCOM 2,"Before you defected you were working in some of the most top secret black projects any human had access to. You have an encyclopaedic knowledge of all ADVENT technology, minus some of the genetic manipulation techniques and basically anything that would give away ADVENTs dark secrets.
Halo: 2500CP"
200,Engineer,Halo - UNSC,"Yet by understanding the nature of computer systems, wouldn't it be prudent to understand the technology those systems command? After all, what if you found yourself needing to recalibrate a Magnetic Accelerator Cannon or repair one of the dangerous Shaw-Fujikawa Translight Engines that makes faster-than-light travel possible? What if you found a cache of human weaponry that could be used if someone managed to repair it? While you don't have the skill to create something as complex as a Shaw-Fujikawa Translight Engine, you'll know your way around it just like much of Humanity's 26th Century technology. You might even figure out how to make small improvements to the technology if you had the time to sit down and look it over. Hopefully the Covenant give you that time."
200,Anaheim Degree,Gundam - Universal Century,"You have the knowledge (and the paper to prove it to people and shove in their faces to establish superiority) of how to build MS. It's trickier than it looks, honestly. Weight balances, servo designs, energy reserves- it's all down to a science and you know how to build the basics. Who knows what you can learn from a bit of hands-on training."
200,Material Synthesis Science,Gundam - After Colony,"You know a few things about getting your own materials, but you also have a bit of know-how about how the people here get such quality materials. Normally, you know how to forge, quench and mold materials into more high quality specimens, but you have a specialization in Zero-Gravity Material Synthesis as well-in microgravity conditions, you can create much more effective materials thanks to the limitations of gravity being removed."
200,I like 'Em Big,Gundam - Advanced Generation,"Your pace continues into your preferences in MS design-along with some basic knowledge of 'Right, so I take this bolt out and everything falls to pieces without it. Don't touch it.' in your head, you can make upgrades to Mobile Suits that revolve around extra armoring and utility- making replacement parts cheaper and easier to install, reinforcing plates and glass, and generally making a unit tankier and sturdier."
200,Could Stand To Lose A Few Pounds,Gundam - Advanced Generation,"When it's out in the cold expanses of space (away from that damn plotradiation), nothing counts more to you than having a well-toned machine. With some basic knowledge of 'Alright, I can't make this any thinner or it snaps like stressed knockoff plastic', you can make upgrades to Mobile Suits that shed crucial weight, making them faster, sleeker and more humanlike in motion- cutting what you can and generally making things more able to dodge, bob and weave."
200,Build Something to Do It For You,Warhammer 40K - T'au Empire,"T'au (and most organic species) have limited forms based on the dictates of evolution, meant to operate at the minimum required for its environment rather than the specialized maximum of a machine designed for a purpose. You are now a master of programming the AI and VI systems that the T'au rely on for their industry and war machines, as well as a master of building and designing the drones that supplement their capabilities for the same."
200,Technical Schematics,Warhammer 40K - T'au Empire,"This small database is a well organized, easily searchable, and easily accessible list of detailed schematics and scientific texts covering all machines, tools, and sciences understood by the T'au. It cannot be remotely hacked or externally corrupted by others. During your jump, this database includes all T'au knowledge up to either current 40k canon or all information that would be available to the T'au within the next hundred years without your interference, whichever option includes less advanced technology. After this jump, the schematics are upgraded to include all designs and science your T'au have developed and all designs and science developed in canon by the T'au by the end of the Fifth Sphere Expansion."
200,Primordial Schematics,Warhammer 40k - Necrons SB Edition,"The human world of Cadia was able to stymie the advance of Chaos largely due to the efforts of Necron technology. The mysterious pylons of Cadia acted to reinforce the materium even on the verge of the Eye of Terror. During the Thirteenth Black Crusade, the Archmagos Belisarius Cawl was even able to use them to shrink the largest Warp Storm in the galaxy. The designs behind this priceless technology are now within your possession. Outside of this setting, pylons designed according to the specifications of these schematics will disrupt interdimensional portals and incursions with some fine-tuning."
200,Black Boxing,Warhammer 40k - Squats,"While certain red-robed rats of Mars always trying to get their grubby mechadendrites on your stuff is annoying, messing with them is endlessly entertaining. You can easily tweak your work to be nearly impossible for others to duplicate. If you're feeling particularly spiteful, you can build in some cross-connections so anyone trying will blow themselves up."
200,Fast Service,Warhammer 40k - Squats,"Some might wonder what place a mechanic has on the battlefield, but they clearly never saw a tank take a crippling hit. Fortunately, your skills are such that you can repair many vehicles and devices that would seem at first glance only good for parts, and in a fifth the normal time."
200,Redundant Mechanisms,Warhammer 40K - Horus Heresy: The Primarchs,"It is an unfortunate yet common result of warfare that one’s finest wargear and vehicles is likely to break under the stress of combat. Fortunately, you are far, far better at engineering all your gear and vehicles with specifically redundant mechanisms that will enable them to continue to work surprisingly well even after taking battle damage. The comfortable redundancies you engineer will not affect the operation of the weapon or vehicle either, merely enable them to shrug off a surprising amount of punishment or even be brought back online faster. Despite the name, this also applies to any cybernetics you craft, as well as any biological organisms you design."
200,Lessons of the Laer,Warhammer 40K - Horus Heresy: The Primarchs,"You were able to study the secretive gene-crafting and biological manipulations of the Laer, a mysterious xenos who had such mastery over genetics and flesh-crafting they could biologically engineer each member of their species to be optimised for one role in life from birth. Curiously, this knowledge meshes extremely well with the gene-seed implantation of the Astartes, and you could easily take this knowledge to craft new organs, broaden your potential initiate pool, or reduce rejection rates."
200,Reclaimer,Warhammer 40K - Adeptus Mechanicus,"Rare is the heretek with wealth or connections enough to acquire the resources to pursue innovation without raising suspicion. Most must make do with whatever they can scavenge or build for themselves, and fortune seems to often favor them when harvesting useful components from wrecked machines. More often than not, the most delicate and valuable pieces of technology can be pulled intact from wrecks you find or create."
300,Grease Monkey,Bubblegum Crisis 2032,"What can you fix or build? What CAN'T you fix or build? Nothing, that's what. From hyper-cars to Buma, computers to Hardsuits, with the right tools and enough time and experiments, you can build it all, weaponry included."
300,Escall’s Legacy,Outer Wilds,
300,Analysis,Adventure Time,"You have the skill and insight to make powerful analytical tools. Such tools are capable of showing you the physical makeup of the things you come across, detect magic and alert you to hidden doorways."
300,Holtzman Science,Dune,"History disagrees who the Holtzman effect was discovered by. Norma Cenva, Tio Holtzman, Ibraham Vaughn Holtzman... the important thing is what the Holtzman effect can do. Compact antigravity generators. Personal shields. Instantaneous transport between two points. You know it all, to a level of detail that would make most scientists jealous; while you're not going to be putting a heighliner together alone in ten years, you could easily make a skiff. Somehow, any shields you make aren't affected by lasers the way they are here, but that is not an effect any scientists here can replicate, so best to keep that under your hat. Lasers will cause them to overload and fizzle, though."
300,Suk Doctor,Dune,"Trusted sight unseen with the life of even an Emperor, Suk conditioning cannot be broken -- you will be conditioned to be unable to take a life, though in your case it is limited to actions taken outside of direct combat; the life of a jumper is fraught with danger, after all. In return, you learn every detail that humanity knows about the human body by the time of this jump... and that knowledge goes far deeper than anyone in the present day could even dream. From neurochemistry and pressure points to the fastest way to heal wounds and how to synthesize or improvise for medication, the knowledge is yours."
300,Foraker-Hemphill,Honor Harrington,"The brilliance of the officers and the planners does a lot to help, but in the end what wins wars is the equipment. The best equipment, a lot of it, and built really quickly and cheaply. That is where you come in. You are an innovator almost beyond peer, able to design and build technology literally decades ahead of your competition. Or if not that, you may build at the normal levels, but build it with an unbelievably tiny resource base or build it so quickly that the enemy simply can't believe their eyes.
Your specialization depends upon your faction perk, but at the very least you gain vast knowledge and an in-depth understanding of this universe's tech, enough to be a Jack of All Trades."
300,Spectre,Mass Effect,"Special Tactics and Reconnaissance are agents entrusted with extraordinary authority by the Citadel Council, including the power of life and death over the inhabitants of the galaxy. They form an elite group selected from a number of different species, and their primary responsibility is to preserve galactic stability by whatever means necessary. Though they are generally considered as being above the law and have complete discretion as to the methods used to accomplish their mission, an individual's status as a Spectre can be revoked by the Council in a case of gross misconduct. Having this makes you slightly more permanently charming and intimidating since Spectres are in equal parts romanticized and feared. It also gives you access to training that only Spectres receive. The result being that it gives you a true mastery of your chosen specialization(s). To the same extent as Military Specialization. All of your gear gets upgraded to match your status. You'll be walking around with over ten million credits worth of gear. Only the best of the best. Your exceptional nature acts as a capstone booster for some of the 600CP perks."
300,Cybernetics,GUNNM,"You have a broad theoretical and practical knowledge of cybernetics and related engineering systems, and can recognize most systems with a glance. The most difficult repairs and programming come naturally to you, custom designs and components that would take an entire research team a month can be jotted down in an hour or so of casual work. The most common form of cyborg in the Scrapyard has an armoured braincase piloting a robotic body, but you're familiar with the organic-inorganic connection technology and can create partial cybernetics as well as organ replacements for those who do not wish to lose their bodies in effect, you are fully capable of the design, construction and application behind the Transhuman and Motorball cyborg perks."
300,More With Less,XCOM,"Through careful construction, you can remove unnecessary components and get maximum efficiency into your products. What this means, is that you can create the same quality item while using less resources. Items with which you have a limited supply, such as alien materials, can be stretched farther."
400,Post-Modern Frankenstein,Blade Runner 2049,"Men like you come once every generation at most, so it must be a miracle that two of you are in the world at the same time. You were already a scientific genius but now you've become a creator who could equal Wallace himself in the arts of the body and Stelline in the arts of the mind. You could quite easily create Replicants at the current level of advancement from the ground up and fill their minds with memories near impossible to tell apart from reality, so long as you had the proper equipment. Unlike those two brilliant minds, you'll find yourself always able to improve your knowledge of the body and mind. As long as you put in the time, you'll continue to make advancements no matter the roadblocks of progress you encounter."
400,Master Builder,Transformers,"You've been programmed with mastery of Cybertronian science allowing you to jury-rig any tech you see, as well allowing you to quickly build even the most complex Cybertronian tech within a reasonable time period. Smaller devices are almost instant, larger devices take some time and more components. However with enough material you can build a temporary space bridge. Despite your mastery of Cybertonian science, creation of a Spark and therefore intelligent life, organic or inorganic is beyond you."
400,Modular Designs,Dead Space,"It's always easier to make better things from better materials, and your knowledge of far-future engineering is top-notch, meaning that all of the things you make are all that much better for it. Aside from being able to upgrade parts, tools, and weapons further, and make better base parts for tools and weapons, you can apply the bonuses of Infinitely Customizable to things other than tools and weapons, breaking anything down into classes of modular parts and swapping them around to your heart's content. This nearly obviates every part of the process of retro-fitting older creations with newer parts, aside from the actual manual labor and time."
400,Mechanical Master,Borderlands,"You are a master armsmith and roboticist. You can build and maintain standard weapons and shields with ease, and if you put some effort into understanding it you could probably make E-Tech your bitch. Further, you can make temporary Digistruct items, though they tend to explode after brief use. If you find the right components, you might even be able to modify good stuff into truly unique weapons; some might call them Legendary. Though for some reason they always look kind of pearly."
400,"High-Tech, Meet Low-Tech",Revelation Space,"Beyond the Yellowstone system, technology is often not quite up to speed. More so, in the Post-Melding time. Colonists isolated by lightyears from their nearest neighbors must be ready to handle any failure of their machines, so reliable, low technology is usually more common than quickmatter and full automation. Yet when it comes to merging the two, you have a fascinating ability to keep high-technology devices running by replacing failing systems with low-tech equivalents. Where a space station might have used superconductor radiator panels to manage temperature, you could find a way to replace them with steam cooling; when your shuttles run out of antimatter, you'll find it easy to replace those drives with a fusion torch or even chemical rockets. At the extreme limits of your ability, you might replace a simple but essential computer with a mechanical calculator, crunching out numbers with cogs, punch cards and levers."
400,Chimerical Genius,Revelation Space,"The science of cybernetic augmentation is quite mature in this day and age, and you are at the forefront of combining flesh with machine. The cybernetics you design and install are not only top-of-the-line in terms of their function and performance, but are also very aesthetically pleasing, either matching the contours of the body or in startling contrast. The parts you could build are so durable that they are quite likely to survive long past the person they are attached to: even under such an assault where the flesh is unrecognizable, the chimeric parts you installed would still likely be useable to the degree of being able to install them into another person.
You may not be quite at the notorious level of Dr Trintingent, but if you've been a doctor for long, it's likely you have a small following of fans of your work among the chimeric demographic."
400,Arateus Genetics,Stargate: Atlantis,"You have extensive knowledge of the Arateus bug and its unusual genes, which can be incorporated into human DNA. The sciences of Human/Wraith hybridisation, the retroviruses that can cause or reverse the hybridisation process, and a novice's understanding of their feeding process are yours. This allows you - with the right materials, samples, test subjects and a lab - to create genetic chimeras and bug monsters from Arateus DNA, or cure those who have been transformed thus. Post-jump, you can learn to do the same with other similar biological abominations."
400,Bioweaponry,Stargate: Atlantis,"While a prohibited field of study on Earth, it doesn't seem to bother the IOA or SGC if the research is happening in another galaxy or being used on Wraith (who aren't ""technically"" humans). You have the skill to convert virii or bacterial agents into bioweapons, tinker with their virulence and lethality, and design the all-important delivery devices."
400,COMPUTATIONAL CRYPTID,The Culture – Minds,"The few Returned seem to take pride in making substrate do things it wasn’t meant to, and surely you are no different. You can make use of computational tricks both within your own mind and those of the systems you can access to do the impossible – to run a full Mind on tiny pieces of processing substrate, perform computations that involve seven or eight dimensions in a binary 0/1 environment, and transmit or receive data from within a completely isolated system – including such hyperspatially-solid objects such as Mind substrates, Engines and 4-D structures.
You are the computational equivalent of a ghost or wizard: able to appear within, disappear from, and manipulate the virtual environment in ways non-Sublimed Minds just don’t understand. What you do within a system can still be detected, but how you got in, how you did it, and how you got out remain total mysteries."
400,Seamless Construction,Endless Space,"You might not be able to design the perfect ship, but you certainly could build one that is good enough. Given enough resources and the proper blueprints, you can build ships that would rival that of the Endless, cast as a single, cohesive whole. Even if you build it with mundane methods, it still ends up being nearly perfect, not a single design flaw or construction error in sight. This also applies to things you build that aren't spaceships."
400,Pocket Portals,Endless Space,"Normally, Vaulter portals are huge affairs, too large to build on planets. You know how to micronize them, and create portal systems that you could, in theory, build into a house, or even turn into communication devices. Instant interstellar communications? More powerful than you think. Without Thinking with Portals You can not build portals large enough to pass anything larger than a scout ship through, and even that will be very difficult to squeeze in."
400,Bolthole Protocol,Honor Harrington,"While coming up with unbelievably advanced new designs may not be exactly your forte, what is, is the reverse engineering of the same. You need only spend a few moments working at something to get a basic idea of how it works, and only get faster from there. No matter how advanced or obscure the technology, you can eventually work it out, with a thousandth the time and effort it would take anyone else."
400,Never Goes Out Of Style,Honor Harrington,"Sometimes old technology is not quite as irrelevant as people would like to think it is. Fission can be useful in the far future, and ground combat is never quite completely irrelevant. You have an incredible talent for finding new uses for old technology. Things you build are incredibly robust and resilient, while remaining extremely adaptable and amenable to being modified to suit new purposes. One thing the Graysons excelled in was environmental systems to stave off the harshness of their world's environment. You have an excellent working knowledge of their design, production, and maintenance. One might even develop domed cities."
400,Military Specialization,Mass Effect,"Adept? Soldier? Engineer? It doesn't matter. You're the best of the best. In the case of something like an Engineer, you're only the best of the best that's willing to be risked on the field. While you're still limited by the peak of your body, you're control over your chosen class is at its functional peak. Casually use all of your biotic abilities, shoot a room full of guys before they can draw on you, hack the latest technology with a wave of your hand... You are the very best that you can be. Does not effect specializations. Though this is a hell of a starting base to work off of."
400,Prothean Beacon,Mass Effect,"You somehow managed to use the beacon that helped to propel the asari into the superpower they are today. It contains information on Prothean technology, the Reapers, and instructions relating on how to finish the Crucible, all of which is now burned into your brain (you will never forget it)."
400,The Next Step,DOOM 3,"The UAC is pushing the boundaries of known science, and it's no wonder that a lot of the Mars facilities are dedicated to cutting-edge and somewhat poorly tested technologies. After all, testing how exactly things work is one of the reasons we do science! That said, there's no reason not to push for the best possible results right from the start, and you embody this ideal and then some. You have become highly adept at developing prototype systems incorporating new fields of science, to the point your initial designs are usually as good as (if not better) than those others might come up with after two or three rounds of testing, debugging and fine-tuning. Likewise, you can glean far greater insights from any such development cycles you implement, meaning that this 'head start' is only going to get bigger the more time you put into your R&D."
400,Xenobiologist,DOOM 3,"The denizens of hell are equally terrifying and magnificent, in their own way. You have been extensively trained in the biological sciences, yet even your understanding is merely a starting point for these strange beings. Superhuman strength and resilience, the ability to manifest and control confined plasma charges, teleportation you don't know how they do it. But you will. Your talents grant you immense insight into any biological system, and through study and research, you'll eventually be able to understand even the most bizarre and alien biologies and, with enough skill, even replicate them. Hell is the way forward, and you intend to study it every step of the way."
400,Enhancement Mastery,Battle Action Harem Highschool Side Character Quest,Just by looking at a piece of technology you are able to consider different ways on how it might be improved. Whether its increasing damage for weapons or decreasing power draw for components there is always some way to improve an item. This also improves your Valkyrie's Core innate ability to enhance items.
400,Higgs Knowledge,Battle Action Harem Highschool Side Character Quest,"Higgs particles allow humanity to help build the wonders of the modern age, such as modern archaeologies, thanks to their ability to produce free energy. With this perk gain an understanding of Higgs particles and their potential uses and in no time, you'll be able to build Higgs engines just as good if not better than the ones used by Antagonists. With time and effort you will even discover new uses for Higgs particles."
400,Evolutionary Incentive,Ben 10 0.1,"If you have been paying even the slightest bit of attention, you will notice a lot of powers in this multiverse come from the unique biology of different alien species. So naturally, it makes perfect sense to want to harness it and perhaps play with the mechanics a little bit. You are a master of capturing and manipulating DNA using technology, able to mutate creatures into something new by playing with their genetics like play-doh, giving them new powers or even ironing out things like genetic illnesses or defects. You're better at mixing and matching than making anything from scratch, but eventually you can learn how to recreate certain superpowered genetics from one alien species in another using surgery or even small technological devices. You're not quite making the next Omnitrix with this alone, but this definitely sets the foundation for it."
400,Man and Machine,Generic Cyberpunk,"The line between the two can be blurry in this world, but an engineer of your skills can make it vanish. You're a whiz with cybernetics of all kinds, able to design, build, repair, and even implant them with expert skill. Beyond just making the body embrace these additions as if they were natural if new parts of the whole your expertise allows you to work with and design implants and devices capable of all kinds of things. From in-built cloaking systems, dermal armor able to deflect and ignore military grade arms fire, dash systems, defensive fields, weapons, and much more. You could turn anybody from just another person into a walking example of posthumanity if you had the resources. Your talent in this field ensures you'll be able to adapt any of your technology into some form of useful cybernetic. Who knows where you'll take the field as time goes on."
400,Hand of the Matrix,Generic Cyberpunk,"The vids are full of stories of plucky hackers who are able to work magic with the seas of code that society drowns in. You're not one of them though, you're one of the ones that give megacorps reason to be nervous. Your understanding and mastery of code is enough to design programs that would turn heads, crack systems that those in power spend mountains of cash trying to keep secure, and to make short work of nearly any opposition. If your skills are known by anyone it's either as a digital boogeyman or as a name people are willing to make all kinds of effort to get on their side. The software you could make and the hacks you could pull off are nearly unmatched. It'd take either an equal or a megacorp to give you a challenge. Only something like an advanced AI could claim to be your greater where code is concerned."
400,Ambrosial Artificer,Macross,"So many moving parts, so many pieces to the puzzle. It's so... needless. The other tech teams are complete morons. That's why you've learned how to figure out the optimization of your complex machines like Veritechs. What parts you don't need, you find a way to do away with. What parts you DO need, you can use the now-extra space to improve and bolster their performance. Some will call you mad. But the only madness that will come from your work is the rage of your enemies and rivals."
400,Savvy Sultan,Macross,"When people think of building things, they think of you. Provided you had the resources and the understanding of the technology, you could construct all manners of machines in a fourth of the time it would normally take. By yourself. You're no slouch with any of your tools either, wielding them with the precision of a machine with no loss of speed. Quality and a deadline? No problem."
400,Maniacal Monster,Macross,"Most people know how to optimize their rides. Others know how to optimize their equipment. You? You specialize in optimizing and improving your weapons. Your lust for seeing people bleed has encouraged this habit, this perverse thrill that keeps you going. Studying your own weapons lets you understand how to improve them... studying enemy weapons lets you know how to salvage and grab them for yourself. Who cares if it's organically attached? Taking the time to remove and study it is half the fun. The other half is their screams."
400,Augmentation,Halo - UNSC,"Technology continues to march forward, and Humanity will march with it. Yet is the flesh not also a machine of sorts? You have the brain as a central processing unit, the skeleton as a frame, the stomach as a bio-reactor, the works. Much like machines, the human body can also be upgraded. You understand the intricacies of such procedures, coming with a slew of almost encyclopedic medical and genetic knowledge along with eerie ease on which chemicals can be applied to the human body to augment it. On the plus side, additional skill in surgery could let you perform augmentation procedures yourself. Making your own super-soldiers might make ONI raise an eyebrow at you however, and that could be a bad thing."
400,Exotic Compatibility,Gundam - After Colony,"You have a way of working with quirky and strange materials-in your hands and machinery, it assumes the forging and abilities of plain Iron until you begin building with it. You also can integrate exotic materials into your constructions a lot easier, and if you don't know what a material is or what it can do, you're very good at researching applications and properties of said materials. This research could also go into things such as improving production numbers and similar."
400,We Need Reserves,Gundam - Advanced Generation,"When you're fighting a war, you know what you need- you need troops, you need squadrons; you need a fully-armed army. You can't fight a war without numbers, and so you can modify designs to give you just that-numbers. Your MS production capability will multiply to near 4x levels, with only a negligible decrease in quality. You can also, with time and patience, apply this design philosophy to other products."
400,Special Attention,Gundam - Advanced Generation,"When you're fighting a war, you know what you need- you need guardians, you need shields; you need a well-armed force. You can't fight a war with a thousand scratches, and so you can modify designs to increase individual performance and quality-the biggest boon is that this only negligibly increases production times or costs, at the benefit of having much higher quality Mobile Suits. And you can apply this to other designs as well, with time."
400,Reclamation,Warhammer 40K - Minor Xenos,"Products of psytech engineering, the Jokaero are not limited to physics or their own knowledge base, and now, neither are you. You can repair and reverse engineer an technology that is not black-boxed both physically and psychically. You can repair almost any such device so long as you have at least two thirds of its components present and in conditions better than “melted to complete slag.” You can do this regardless of your familiarity with the device or its function, and you can implement repairs as fast as the item’s creator would be able to do if tools and resources were no object."
400,A World Is A Living Thing,Warhammer 40k - Craftworld Eldar,"Among the Exodites, the Infinity Circuit is known as the World Spirit, and upon the death of an Exodite, this network absorbs their soul, thus keeping them from the clutches of Slaanesh and allowing those still living to commune with them. Now you too bear the knowledge by which one might forge this great and intricate grid of stone circles, obelisks, and menhirs. It will take some time, of course, to cover an entire world - likely more time you will have in a given journey at any rate - but it is entirely possible to produce a smaller version over say, the course of three years, protecting the souls of those within an area about the size of a small township. May the dead know peace at last."
400,Worldsinger,Warhammer 40k - Craftworld Eldar,"The craft of the Bonesinger is mighty indeed, yes but as there are many notes in a song, so are there more uses for music than Wraithbone alone. In the way the Bonesinger shapes Wraithbone with psychic energy and their voice, so do you shape the green and growing things. Vegetation springs from the earth, seemingly from nothing, at the sound of your voice, molding itself to fit your needs. Should you grow hungry, bring forth fruit. Should you grow hot, bring forth shade. Should you grow weary, bring forth a bed of leaves. All these shall heed your song."
400,Bonesinger,Warhammer 40k - Craftworld Eldar,"Dear child, the Eldar do not simply build their wondrous technology. Instead, they rely on the power of song to shape their creations into being. This is a very demanding process, which requires a unique mix of artistic and scientific knowledge. Most importantly of all, a strong mind is necessary for this process. Bonesingers sing a psychic song, and its melodies form a psychoactive material from the warp itself, called Wraithbone. This lightweight material is stronger than titanium but is far more flexible and weighs less. Additionally you can psychically grow crystals that are the basis of their laser & lance technology. You have the knowledge and ability to sing any Eldar technology and any technology you know into being and more than that, eons of experience in doing so. Even so, the more complex an item is, the more time it takes to create said item. A whole choir of Bonesingers is required to create large and complex items such as starships and Eldar Titans unless you are willing to sing alone for years. With enough time, perhaps, you could even sing forth a brand-new Craftworld but how and where would you acquire that much time? Even an Eldar is not immortal."
400,Biotransference Protocols,Warhammer 40k - Necrons SB Edition,"Behold, the designs that were meant to secure the salvation of the Necrontyr, and instead cost them their souls. These schematics contain two things of note: the first is the Necrodermis shells of the Necrons and their constructs, from the lowliest Warriors and Scarabs to the greatest Tomb Sentinels. Secondly, they teach the method of biotransference itself, transitioning an organic mind into a body of metal. Will you use these designs to create a robotic army to put the Men of Iron to shame? Or will you use them to secure immortality?"
400,A Matter of Scale,Warhammer 40k - Squats,"Let others joke about compensating, you know the engineering it takes to make war-machines function. Most devices work best in a narrow range of sizes, too big and they become unwieldy, too small and insufficiently powerful for the job. Either way efficiency drops off sharpy. Not for you. You can scale up weapons to level cities and slay Titans, or miniaturize them almost to the point of digi-weapons with no loss of functionality, and can do this for virtually any technology."
400,Tiny Tools,Warhammer 40K - Horus Heresy: The Primarchs,"You have the ability to miniaturise technology to such an extreme that it would seem that no living human could hand-craft at that scale, let alone a ten-foot tall one. Intricate clockwork on a scale that can scarcely be seen by your own eyes is possible for you. You can somehow use tools on a scale that measure mere microns in diameter; thinner than a single strand of human hair with nothing more than your bare eyes and natural dexterity."
400,Comprehensive Scientific Knowledge,Warhammer 40K - Horus Heresy: The Primarchs,Within your head is every single theoretical and applied scientific theory available to Mankind during the 31st Milennium – this does not include forgotten sciences dating from the Dark Age of Technology nor the Emperor’s knowledge. Perhaps if all else were lost and humanity must rebuild from scratch you could uplift them into a spacefaring civilisation again.
400,Binaric Weaving,Warhammer 40K - Adeptus Mechanicus,"The skills gained during long years plumbing data-vaults as a humble logistican have only improved over time. You excel at writing code, understanding machine-script better than native grammar structures. You can understand simple programs with a mere glance and correct any errors you find within seconds, and scrutinizing longer lines of more complex coding for a single misplaced byte can take mere minutes with your skills. Scrapcode crashes ineffectually against your data-barriers, its transmission doing nothing but opening the offending heretek's systems to a counter-intrusion. Interfacing with a system infested with a daemon or true AI would be unwise, but with your skills emerging unscathed from such an encounter is only highly unlikely rather than completely impossible."
400,Dormancy protocols,Warhammer 40K - Adeptus Mechanicus,"Working with unknown technology can be dangerous, so you have inloaded an obscure set of technical protocols that allows you to isolate the individual functions of a machine. The most aggressive probing will never activate connected systems, no matter how closely interlinked. For example, the auspex and detonation systems of a fusion warhead. This includes security systems, which will not log an abnormality or raise an alarm so long as you return everything you examine to exactly the way you found it."
500,Fleshcrafting,Dune,"The Tleilaxu have thousands of years of knowledge in how to manipulate living forms, whether tinkering with genes outright or through breeding programs, and are able to apply that toward virtually any end with enough time and effort. Using only in-universe tools, you can expect to exercise a great deal of patience in your work, but the abominations that the Tleilaxu keep behind closed doors prove their method. If you were to use more... traditional methods of genetic engineering, coupled with the knowledge given here, you could produce truly remarkable things, whether changing a man into a monster or the pinnacle of human evolution. Even without that, the existence of ghouls (zombie-like killing machines that convert what they kill into more ghouls) and leeches (biological tanks) as well as biomechanical hardware are stark proof of the efficiency of the Tleilaxu gene-forging."
500,Valkyrie Core Knowledge,Battle Action Harem Highschool Side Character Quest,"You understand the science behind Valkyrie Core technology. You'll be able to replicate aspects of its technology such as the ability to store and modify objects in a pocket dimension or the manifesting of Impeller fields, or the insane processing power of the Core itself. With time and a little work you'll be able to make new cores."
500,Touched by the Protoculture,Macross,"The Protoculture were a powerful group, having been the creators of the Zentraedi, and having fought off the Protodeviln in their time. They could terraform entire worlds, traverse the galaxy in seconds, and were the first advanced humanoid civilization to exist... and now in some way, you carry their legacy. Along with the ability to understand a species' culture and the paths they could take for evolution, you now have an understanding of 'Space Fold' technology, which allows faster-than-light communication and the generation of micro-wormholes to traverse space in a much faster method."
600,Brilliant Inventor,Adventure Time,"You are an inspired inventor, capable of creating true scientific wonders. Giant robots and age changes are a foregone conclusion. Things rarely backfire. Rarely."
600,MARAIN DIAGLYPHS,The Culture – Minds,"The language of the Culture is one of its greatest achievements. The characters of Marain are written on a 3x3 grid, but when used by Minds, are capable of encoding information in a fractal-like manner. Anything describable can be written in a single Marain diaglyph, all the way up to the entire universe, with every particle, vector and wave within it. Of course, the time needed to write such a glyph would take as long as the age of the universe itself.
This perk grants you the ability of Culture Minds to express and read data in this way: to describe an entire library of information in one character, to perform a mathematical operation millions of lines long in a single step, or simply to read one character and know immediately and exactly how the described but not-yet- invented musical instrument will sound.
This effect extends to any written system of language you are fluent in, and allows you to express the deeper information to non-Minds – for example if you write “the sun” in reference to a particular sun, the reader would know precisely what “the sun” is – its coordinates, its dimensions, its spectrographic signature and its history, if you chose to encode all that information into the writing."
600,Humanity's Sword,Mass Effect,"Or a dagger in its back. You've found yourself with the knowledge and experience to create nearly all Cerberus troops in addition to the tools you'd need to do so. From the common Assault Trooper to the later seen Adjutants (large zombie cthulhu humanoids). Could be applied to other races to a point. Allows you to create biotics from the bioticly incapable. You'll also find yourself with quite an in-depth knowledge of how indoctrination works. You can only make things that indoctrinate the person if physically implanted into them. You may be able to figure out how Reapers do what they do wirelessly with time. Might even be able to defend against it.
Capstone Boost: Cerberus has made some true wonders. You've found yourself with the knowledge and experience to make things like X1, Randall Ezno, Inali Renata, and the tools you'd need to do so. X1 is a modified krogan that puts the Reaper's own Brutes to shame, and the second and first most implanted and arguably capable soldiers in combat respectively. Whereas before your creations would be little more than husks (in more ways than one), you can let them retain autonomy. With the exceptions of implantation to the level of Adjutants, X1, and Inali Renata. It will leave them mentally damaged. Though what does that matter if you can remote control them from any range using the eezo-assisted technology this gives you the knowledge to make? Perhaps with some trial and error you could knock out the kinks. Again, could be applied to other races to a point."
600,Omnidisciplinary,DOOM 3,"Atomic transmutation. Directed Plasma Containment. Terraforming. V.I. data analysis. Orbital Spaceflight. Energy Weapons. The UAC Mars facility is a melting pot of a vast array of cutting-edge physics, and you've mastered all of them or at least most - the Delta Labs aren't quite your cup of tea. If it involves some sort of high-energy physics, you're all but guaranteed to have a decent understanding of it, and after the fifth PhD you kinda stopped counting. This vast array of knowledge isn't quite enough to (re)build the UAC's science divisions from scratch all on your own, but it's pretty close."
600,Biotechnology,GUNNM,"There's really more to cybernetics than just the metal machine. Care has to be taken that the flesh adapts, and there are many lessons to be learned from biological machinery. You're an expert in the fields of genetics, biophysics, toxicology, neuropharmacology and biochemistry the causes and effects of human mutation are very familiar to you. Designer drugs, experimental surgery, toxins, cures improved soft organs and cutting-edge research into cloned nervous system material, with a laboratory the human body is your masterpiece. You may create a variety of drugs similar to that referenced in the Werewolf perk, or directly induce it and Warped as a permanent mutation. If you also have the Cybernetics perk, then with a little time and the right equipment quite difficult to obtain in the Scrapyard you may also apply the equivalent of the TUNED perk to a subject, and have additional knowledge of weapons engineering to reverse-engineer or independently develop most current weapons systems available in the Scrapyard."
600,Construction,Battle Action Harem Highschool Side Character Quest,"You gain a complete understanding of modern UN technology and how to produce it. This includes everything from standard infantry power armor, to battleships, to even modern archologies. You also gain a large bonus to your Valkyrie's construction ability. With training and the right tools you could construct advanced equipment in your Core's storage space, such as delicate processor chips, or build an entire town in a day like Anna."
600,Garage Spaceship,Ben 10 0.1,"When you spend a lot of time taking cars apart to sell for scrap and parts, you eventually start getting a pretty good idea of how they work and which parts are more important than others. So spaceships work the same way, right? Whether from a hobby or a lifetime of scrapping alien weaponry to sell for some big bucks, you're good at figuring out advanced tech just by taking it apart and getting a good look at its insides. You can even maintain, repair, and eventually build things years ahead of the curve using nothing but common materials you find on 21st Century Earth. When you think about it, a spaceship is just a really big car, right? You can also hack into things with wires or machinery...though it might take a little trial and error to get it right, depending on how advanced it is and how smart you are. Sometimes engineering smarts don't hold up to understanding the super science stuff behind it."
600,Extended Warranty,Ben 10 0.1,"Let's get real for a second: You are a scientist, not a repair monkey. You shouldn't have to teleport all the way from your home planet to fix something one of your assistants managed to break in the time you took your eyes off of them. As a result, your technology is now durable and long-lasting...you can go years without seeing a prototype of your creation before it actually needs you to fix it directly, even the most idiotic and primitive species being able to guesswork how to fix it even if they don't know how it works. Also when I say durable, I mean the universe could collapse into nothingness and that device of yours would still be floating in the empty void that used to be said universe. Point being, technology you create is both insanely durable and is easily maintained. Now maybe you don't have to handle everything yourself."
600,First Thinker,Ben 10 0.1,"Now we're getting somewhere. Among your particular species, you're a revolutionary one-of-a-kind mind that calling you a genius would be severely downplaying your potential impact on the universe. You are a paragon of knowledge and technology among your kind, to the point when they say 'on the shoulders of giants' you are very much that giant. A human at this level could advance the technology level of Earth by a dozen levels in less then a few years, while a Galvan with this level would be one of the few minds Azmuth would call an equal. Whatever the case, you know how to innovate and advance technology light years ahead of the norm, elevating your species potentially millennia ahead of where they are now. Things like faster than light travel, laser weapons, completed starships and techno-organic constructs? For many, those things are groundbreaking and new. For you, they're only the tip of what you can accomplish."
600,Seed of The Singularity,Generic Cyberpunk,"They say that the future begins with an idea, but that's not true. It begins when you make an idea reality. You're not just someone that is content to fiddle the technology that's already there, you're one of the minds that could shatter everything we thought we knew. Your ability to innovate and invent is awe inspiring, doing the work of years in scant months. What you piece together in your lab to test a concept would count as a production model to anyone else, and your actual finalized designs are nothing short of pure brilliance. This applies just as well to actual discovery, burning through fields of testing and examination with incredible speed. Your work alone could build the entire future if you had the resources, and if you can survive the people who would kill for the things you can make."
600,Transhuman Protocols,Generic Cyberpunk,"The things we could do if only every advance wasn't riddled with unseen dangers and hidden consequences. If they're smart they'll listen to you. You can take any technology or procedure that you understand and easily figure out the flaws, pitfalls, drawbacks, and unintended or negative consequences, and as long as you put in the time you'll figure out how to get past them. Whether it's ensuring cybernetic augments don't result in lethal rejection from the body, a gene-modification doesn't make the body eat itself from the inside out with cancer, or that a device to transfer a mind leaves the same person that went in and not just a copy, or just working out the kinks in something you'll find a way. The future is an uphill battle, and there won't be time to make it if you spend it stumbling."
600,An Adaptive Enemy,Eclipse Phase,"You have taken the lesson of the Exurgent Virus to heart, and have made a breakthrough in programming viruses and other malware. By combining your malware with the neural models found in AGIs, you have the knowledge to create adaptive, digital smart viruses with just enough self- awareness to value their own continued survival. These smart-viruses are a head above the usual Kaos AIs, capable of working cooperatively, and in a creative manner, discovering and exploiting new weaknesses in software thrown against them, and overcoming obstacles or setbacks in the way of their high-level goals in unexpected and new ways. Even if they altered their own programming, you always retain Administrator command privileges over them."
600,Genetic Algorithms,Eclipse Phase,"As a product of evolutionary science and genetic modification yourself, you have learned to incorporate genetic algorithms into essentially any software you construct. Genetic software starts out a little clunky depending how good a programmer you are to start with but over time it evolves and improves itself to suit its purpose, whether that's target tracking software that learns to ignore feints and decoys or a word processor that improves its UI and file format to suit its users. The end result, after many iterations, is something exceptionally honed to its purpose, without placing the burden on the programmer to get it perfect the first time. Now take care: The transhuman mind is considered software itself, so tread cautiously should you attempt to blend these algorithms with psychosurgery. Down that path many Exhumans have already tread, and while each one certainly became better suited to their chosen path, I'm not sure how many could really be called successes."
600,Transform And Rise Up!,Macross,"Curious. Very curious. You, my friend, are an oddity in that you remember how the transformation technology of the SDF-1 'Macross' ship worked, and have taken its capabilities to heart. Most importantly, you're able to take the time and make anything up to the size of a semi-truck capable of transforming into a small mech to pilot! Like that helicopter? Make it into a mech! That motorbike of yours is a fond gig for you? Make it your power armor!
Touched By The Protoculture Boost: This perk will now have an effectiveness of up to warships the size of the SDF-1 Macross, albeit this will take a much longer time and much larger resources to accomplish."
600,Transform And Roll Out!,Macross,"Speed. War is all about speed. Quality is a major thing as well, but when it comes down to the wire, it's all about who can mobilize their stuff the fastest. You? You are the currently reigning king of that front. You know JUST how to make machines stay at the top of their game and endure the ravages of time for far longer than normal... which means they're VERY quick to power up and take off, to say nothing of transforming with very little delay. Maybe you'll make Employee of the Month with this!
Touched By The Protoculture Boost: This perk grants greater energy efficiency and output in your technology, along with the ability to streamline your technology-producing ability.
XCOM: 1,200CP"
600,One-Man Assembly Line,XCOM,"You really liked playing with building blocks as a kid. Now that you're all grown up, the world is your playground. Your knowledge of construction and engineering is unprecedented, and making a jet engine from spare parts over a weekend is your idea of fun."
600,Erudition,Halo - UNSC,"Ever since the rise of Dr. Catherine Halsey, many were on the lookout for who might become the next intellectual prodigy. Someone who was able to perform as well as she could, someone who could help turn the tide of the war. With this, that someone is now you. Your cognitive capabilities are on par with the good doctor now, making you exceptionally well-versed in nearly all modern human sciences while holding specialties in at least a few fields. Of course, thanks to that you are also rather exceptional at reverse-engineering technology, which allows you to do such things like obtain working knowledge of the mechanics behind Covenant technology and even begin to understand the 'hows' behind some of the mundane pieces of Forerunner technology currently littering the galaxy. Perhaps you could eventually reclaim them."
600,Lifeshaper,Halo - Forerunner Saga,"The Lifeshaper is the highest rank a Lifeworker can attain, only four people having known gained it. Currently the Lifeshaper is the Librarian, a title well earned. Such was her mastery and understanding of living beings that she could encode compulsions into the DNA of creatures that would continue to push them down specific development paths hundreds of millenia later. Taking this option will get you to her mastery of biology. This would entail general knowledge all things medicinal and living the Forerunners had accumulated, including species creation, evolution and de-evolution. Like the Librarian, making geis that direct species for countless generations would merely be a slight challenge."
600,Master Builder,Halo - Forerunner Saga,"The Master Builder was the most powerful Builder of their rate. They had the most wealth, the most intelligence, and the most political power of any builder. The current Master Builder is Faber. While morally ambiguous, at best, it cannot be denied that Faber was a genius. He was the one to design the Halo array, among other things. Even their use on the San'Shyuum didn't keep him out of power for long. Taking this perk would put you on a similar level as Faber when it comes to understanding Forerunner technology and science. This would include general knowledge of the inner workings of the various great works of engineering of the Forerunners. The megastructures they made. The weapons they created. The technology of the forerunners is waiting to be brought into reality by your hands. While you may not have exact schematics of all of their many devices within your brain, you certainly know enough about how the technology works that it wouldn't take too much effort to recreate most of it.
Gundam: 3,800CP"
600,Blessed Be The Logistics Workers,Gundam - Universal Century,"Everyone talks about the soldiers, the guys that shoot people and get rewarded for it- but who makes sure that the soldiers can soldier? You do, and you’re goddamned good at your job. This makes you into a magnificent MS mechanic, able to not only fix up about anything with the right parts (or almost the right parts) but also lets you modify those machines for specific purposes or increases. In addition, you’re very skilled at logistic work, making sure you get people fed, supplied, armed and upkept when they damn well need it."
600,Build Rome,Gundam - After Colony,"You have a thing about building things-you're damn fast, and you're damn good. They say you can't build 10 Mobile Suits in a week? Hah! You'll build twice that much and you'll build them to last! You simply have utter talent in the way of making things quickly-enough to double production, maybe even triple production if you work at it enough, and they'll come out with no loss of quality. In addition, these constructions will last-barring sudden disaster and similar, they'll easily last several decades of constant abuse, and if they're upkept and repaired they could even last centuries with no troubles."
600,Independent Innovation,Gundam - Advanced Generation,"When it comes down to it, you have to take all the advantages you can get-when you get a chance, you take it. This will help. By analyzing foreign or enemy technology, you can not only pinpoint the pillars of 'Yes, this is why this works like that', but also find out what they were lacking. You might have to change a few parts of the original design, but overall you can improve on your foe's failings from data samples and examples alone. Make your Legilis to the foe's AGE-3.
Warhammer 40k: 10,900CP"
600,Wisdom of the Ancients,Warhammer 40k - Necrons SB Edition,"Necron technology is beyond all contenders, comparable to the greatest sorceries of the organics. To change the molecular composition of objects with specific soundwaves, spread madness through the enemy ranks with swirling mists, and manipulate time itself are but a few examples. True heights reach into unbelievable levels, things that violate all laws of nature and logic. It would take a truly brilliant mind to master all this technology, to understand and improve it. A mind such as yours, for example. You have the skills and raw intelligence needed to unravel the greatest, most advanced technologies of your ilk. Not only can you perfectly build and repair Necron technology, you can also adapt it to all sorts of purposes, come up with new tech on a similar level, and even improve the technology. This talent carries over to all forms of technology in future jumps too."
600,Guildmaster,Warhammer 40k - Squats,"You have risen through the ranks to become the senior most Engineer's Guild member in a Stronghold. There is nothing about Squat or Imperial technology you do not understand in detail, and you're brilliant at adapting the principles of one device to another. You'd stand a good chance of fixing the Golden Throne, if they'd ever let a filthy abhuman into the Imperial Presence."
600,Praetorian of Terra,Warhammer 40K - Horus Heresy: The Primarchs,"You can build the finest fortifications and greatest cities the Imperium may ever know and are so familiar with them you can build them in record time, creating great structures that would take other architects centuries in mere years. A world you truly devote to defending will be utterly impenetrable... as much as any world may be anyway. At the very least, you can make a fortification network that alone would make Cadia of ten thousand years from now look undefended in comparison. From massive orbital fortresses protecting a world like a shell and use incredibly sophisticated near-AI to fight enemy ships without risking a single life, to a mathematically perfect fortress that offers neither cover nor shelter to any attacker. Any enemy would be incredibly foolish to give you enough time to dig in and prepare defences. Furthermore, with knowledge of how to build fortresses comes knowledge of how to knock them down; you are as good at launching sieges as you are preparing for them. You may additionally construct or dismantle orbital plates in record time, vast structures similar to Hive Cities orbiting their patron world, though these are extremely difficult to defend as opposed to orbital fortresses."
600,Perpetual Motion Machines,Warhammer 40K - Horus Heresy: The Primarchs,"Once the holy grail of scientists of Old Terra, now a reality in your hands. You know how to create machinery that runs indefinitely powered by a perpetual motion machine that can be scaled up or down from less than the size of a fingernail to the vast heart of a voidship. These engines will produce a steady amount of power forever, needing no refuelling nor recharging. You can pass this knowledge on to others, though it is unlikely any being with less mechanical skills than the greatest artisans of Mars or the Primarchs themselves could ever truly replicate this; far more likely they would create an engine with such miniature flaws that it would ever-so-slowly lose power over the years."
600,Tech-usurper,Warhammer 40K - Adeptus Mechanicus,"The galaxy is ancient, and uncountable races have risen and fallen. Some leave nothing but piles of dust while others survive long enough to craft incomprehensible works that slumber in deathless sleep long after their creators have vanished. Be it the craft of the most incomprehensible and bizarre xenos, the works of the Eldar, the archaeotech of mankind or yet stranger things, you can stir these mysterious works to action once more. Understanding is not needed, and may never come. But full understanding is not required to bend the technology to your will, to find those places where your own crude tech can burrow into the nerves and spasm the limbs of greater works. In time, you can puzzle out how to control these edifices, to make them function. Not with complete precision, no, but always enough at least to make them advance your goals."
600,Magos Aetheric,Warhammer 40K - Adeptus Mechanicus,"Though feared and maligned, the existence of the Imperium nonetheless depends upon exploiting the immaterium. Understanding it allows for travel, for communication, and to battle the daemonic on even terms. You have come to be one of the very few experts on the subject of the warp, and know how to manipulate it through technology. You can easily craft psy-implants that boost or suppress psychic powers, weaponry incorporating psychic components, or hexagrammatic wards. With enough time and resources you could build or even improve upon existing patterns of gellar field generators, warp drives, and immaterial sensors. You have even made inroads into understanding the genetic influence behind the manifestation of psyker, pariah and navigator abilities. This is not an easy path to tread, for the slightest misstep or moment of carelessness can see you damned, and even with the most exacting precautions it is a road fraught with peril."
600,By the Grace of the Machine God,Warhammer 40K - Adeptus Mechanicus,"By His blessing, let the machine be sanctified. With ritual and prayer, protect His works from corruption and witchery. Raise a bulwark of iron anointed with sacred oil and incense and safeguarded its form and functions from eldritch powers. Be their origin within the material or immaterial, powers that attempt to twist the form or control the functions of your machines will be repulsed. Minor hexes and vexes will be repelled with contemptuous ease, while mightier powers must devote a great deal of power and concentration to overcome this protection. Even then, they will struggle to do so."
600,Centurio Ordinatus,Warhammer 40K - Adeptus Mechanicus,"You have been inducted into the Divisio Militarus, a branch of the adeptus mechanicus dedicated to the construction and operation of the Ordinatus war machines, mighty titan-scale siege weapons of unparalleled power. While the shielding and mobility systems that carry these devices into battle are relatively simple to create, you understand the intricacies of how physics and performance are affected by up-sizing technology. With sufficient data on the function of a humble lasgun or arc rifle to extrapolate from, you could smoothly transition that device to function when a hundred or more times larger - and to be appropriately more powerful than the simple multiplication of its output would suggest. The weapons you create and oversee are fit for a god-machine to wield, and the likes of Nova Cannons and weapons arrays on board the largest ships of the Mechanicus are also within your purview."
800,Skill Plus,Eclipse Phase,"Select one of your skill packages. Instead of having an expert level of knowledge and proficiency, you are considered to be one of the absolute best transhumanity can offer in that particular field. It would take a serious handicap for you to screw up at whatever this skill is. You can purchase this perk multiple times, applying to a different skill package each time."
800,Skill Packages,Eclipse Phase,"A skill package gives you professional levels of proficiency in the main areas, as well as minor proficiency in related areas (fanwank as needed). Eg: it would be safe to assume that someone with the Marksman package could use a tactical network or mapping software to make sure they're in the right position, calculate bullet drop at long range, or identify common guns by sight, in addition to the primary skill of shooting things."
900,Karmatron Dynamics,GUNNM,"Macro Karmatron Theory Also known as psychohistory, this is the science of human destiny, a mathematical model of sociology. Where an observer has great difficulty in predicting the motion of a single molecule in a gas, Kinetic Theory can predict the mass action of the gas to a high level of accuracy so too with the behaviour of intelligent beings.
Psychohistory allows the long-range prediction and manipulation of the future, provided the population is of sufficient size, without directly infringing on the free will of the individual. Constant revision, surveillance and supercomputer assistance is required, but even with these efforts, sufficiently powerful individuals may emerge who create their own unpredictable karma singularities and throw the entire model into turmoil.
Nano Karmatron Theory Applied to guided micro- and nano-machines, NKT allows unprecedented control over chaotic systems. Ordinarily it is impossible to create truly advanced nanotechnological systems no matter how sophisticated their base programming they are extremely sensitive to heat, radiation, computer corruption, unguided self-evolution, rebellion and biomechanical horror. The ordered chaos of NKT makes all of this part of one purposeful design, a vast system marching in unison and self-correcting via its own randomness.
It allows for reprogrammable hard nanomachines to be used for anything from industrial manufacture, to cellular surgery, to outright construction of stable nano-cybernetic bodies capable of adaptive reconfiguration and near-perfect biomimicry that still vastly outperform almost all purely mechanical cyborgs. These Imaginos Bodies are a perfect fusion of the will of the mind and the power of the physical form. However, at least with the current state of Karmatron Dynamics, very few are capable of making the transition successfully their wills disintegrating their body into a screaming crumble.
At the moment, only karmic singularities individuals of exceptional and unpredictable influence on the destiny of mankind can be reasonably expected to make the leap into the new flesh. Their base appearance reflects the self-image of the mind. As the mind reflects upon itself it may learn to change colour and gradually shape. Assimilation of cherished weapons, generation of new systems and limbs, intuitive hacking the full capacity of the Imaginos is limited only by the imagination and will."
