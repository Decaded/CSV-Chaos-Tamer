0,A Memory Of The Face Of Creation,Lords of the Night - Liches,"The power of the Arcane, and the necromantic forces that bolt it to a human soul... the mind was not built to cope with such things. Well, other people's minds might not be. You deal with it fine. In fact, you'll find that you deal with everything fine. Madness just doesn't 'take' when it's you. Your mind refuses to warp, your personality stays stable, and your view of reality matches what you sense and perceive."
0,An Age of Gods,Fate/Legends: Oasis of Fantasy,"The Age of Gods is certainly a time to be alive. Humanity is far from as weak as it will become in the modern era, so you will require a suitable body to these early times. Should you be born later in this world’s life, after the Age of Gods has ended, you will be quite the anomaly. A human with a body from the Age of Gods yet born in the latter ages. You have the physical and mental capabilities that any modern human would believe you are superhuman.
You can tear through the stone or metal of the modern day without much exertion, perhaps even lift a tonne of weight over your head, and certainly outrun any horse. You have magical power unlike what appears to those who use magecraft, as you do not have magic circuits. Instead, through your body runs pure magical energy, allowing you to much more easily manipulate your own energy and that of the world around you. Of course, such a thing requires training to utilise to any real effect but once you have that training, there is no modern mage not considered a freakish prodigy that could level with you. As befits a time of myths and heroes, you will be assured to be at least somewhat attractive and it is possible for your body to grow to somewhat inhuman degrees, though whether that manifests as being eight feet tall and bulging with muscles or the sort of beauty normally seen only in the depictions of fertility goddesses in the temples of Babylon...that’s still to be decided. to deal with them, and makes it easy to see through dishonesty or even martial techniques."
0,Basic Training,Fate/Stay Night,"Everyone has to start somewhere. No matter who you started as in this place, you've got the basic knowledge any magic user has. You know the core arts of Reinforcement, Gradation Air, Hypnosis and Formalcraft at an average level. Reinforcement is the enhancement of the functions of beings or objects through magical energy. You could make yourself as strong and fast as an Olympic athlete or enhance your senses to the best of human ability and so on, or you could increase the sharpness of a sword to cut through steel or the durability of a shield to endure small calibre firearms with ease. Things can only be reinforced so much at a particular skill level before they simply explode from overstuffing. Gradation Air is shaping magical energy into the form of an item, which temporarily becomes real. You could make a sturdy but mundane sword or shield with this, though they would not last more than a few minutes at a time. Hypnosis is the basic form of mind control all Magi learn to use. It can be easily shrugged off by any supernatural being or magic user at this level but manipulating ordinary humans is quite easy and only those with exceptional willpower be able to resist the use of this without magic to back them up. Formalcraft, generally considered magecraft for dummies, is a way for Magi to use the mana in the air, along with sacrifices or ritual preparation, to make casting spells easier or possible at all for those with little personal magical energy. All of these can be improved with time, sometimes to terrifying levels, but it will take effort and time."
0,Basic Training,Fate/Zero,"All magi, all competent magi at least, know the fundamentals of magecraft. Formalcraft, Reinforcement, Gradation Air and Hypnosis. These basic skills are known by all Magi to some level, though only a few make a serious study of any of them, as opposed to focusing on more complicated, more ‘sophisticated’ disciplines. You are skilled in the use of all four basic disciplines for no cost, the equal of an adult magus who completed their training in each area and was notably skilled."
0,Blossoming Sun,Fate/Legends: Land of the Rising Sun,"You had a fortunate birth, whatever you end up being, and find yourself above average for these lands. Japan is not particularly a bastion of mystical heroes in the way of Greece or Britain. Indeed, many of the legends to be found following are made from incredible skill or the command of many soldiers instead of personal feats of might and magic. But even these skillful heroes do tend to stand above the other poppies.
Your body is naturally on the higher end for human fitness, ably competing in modern athletics without any training required. Magically, you possess a number of high quality circuits, equal to the much later coming Tohsaka heir. A prodigy in those times but still notable even a thousand years prior. You lack training for now but magic is not so hidden as it becomes in the modern day, with the presence of spiritual temples and Onmyouji practitioners.
As a quirk of this land, you also have the ability to summon a wide range of aesthetic effects, even when they make no sense. A flurry of cherry blossoms on the wind as you make an entrance, the sun shining down the red rays of a sunset even mid-morning to dramatise your battles. One might claim you’re in some sort of samurai movie, with how many dramatic effects tend to occur around you. As part of this national style, you also have the unique trait of never struggling to draw or sheathe your weapons, no matter how impractically sized they are. The katana and sheath longer than your entire body won’t take anymore time to draw than a reasonably sized weapon. Not that you’re any better at using the weapons, you just won’t look like a tool taking them out."
0,Customer Service,Ravenwood,"You are an exceptionally patient and steady individual, as well as a fair orator. You are also a skilled negotiator, possessed of a natural charisma that makes it easier for you to garner trust. You are completely immune to stage fright and can hold your own in a social environment with large crowds even if you are naturally an introvert, should you need to."
0,Divine Magic/Hieroglyphic Magic,Riordanverse - Kane Chronicles,"Divine words is another term for Egyptian Magic commands. These are also called hieroglyphic spells or Words of Power. They are called 'divine' because they enable the magicians using the commands to wield godly strength and powers. Magicians speak them to create or tweak reality. To use them, no papyrus or other equipment, such as amulets, potions, shabti, and statues are needed."
0,Force of Personality,Ravenwood,"Your core personality is reinforced and you gain an awareness of any influence on your mind beyond completely natural methods, making it difficult for anything to change you from who you are without your consent or desire. This also provides an awareness that gives you insights into others."
0,Ki,Ravenwood,"One of the most overlooked powers in the Demiplane is that of Ki, a power that all living beings possess. Ki is a manifestation of vital essence and stamina that anyone can harness with the right training. For no cost, you have the potential to learn how to utilize Ki, but have no knowledge of how to use it to begin with."
0,Magic Circuits,Fate/Stay Night,"Magic Circuits are the spiritual circuits within the souls of any Magi, though they also form a nervous system-like physical representation on the body. These not only generate prana, the basic magical unit made through the combination of Mana and Od, but are also what allows any Magus to manipulate their energies to cast magic. They vary greatly in number and quality between individuals. Strenuous use of them can cause pain and numbness, whilst any use at all will heat the physical body up.
You begin with an average amount of circuits, 20 in total, but each circuit is of exceedingly high quality, equal to the Circuits of Tohsaka Rin. They will not naturally grow but artificial means to increase them do exist."
0,Magic Circuits,Fate/Zero,"Magic Circuits are the spiritual-physical circuits that lie within all magic using humans. They allow the generation and manipulation of magical energy for Magi. Magic circuits can vary wildly in both quantity and quality between people, though a person with high quantity and/or quality will usually pass those on to any children they have.
You start with 20 circuit, with each one being exceedingly high in quality, equivalent to the Circuits of Tohsaka Rin."
0,Magical Legacy: Alchemy,Fate/Zero,"To be called a real magical lineage, a family needs to have a notable specialisation. Something that separates them from any other family. This is the focus of generations of work, from the head and heir of each family at the very least, and often all other members contribute too. Whether you have a family or not, you have been trained to a level of excellent quality in one magical discipline of your choice. Easily enough to be recognised as an adult magus by the Mages Association, you’ll be notably skilled even among your age peers."
0,Mana Wellspring,Ravenwood,"Every living being, and most undead, has a small reserve of mana to draw on, though maybe not the skill to utilize it normally, you’re no different. You have a bit of mana at your disposal, though lack the training to properly use it. This naturally bolsters your health and makes your healing go more smoothly. If taught the proper methods, Mana can be used to perform thaumaturgy in its various forms. Purchasing any Thaumaturgy perk increases the amount of mana you possess by a quarter its original level."
0,Naturalist,Ravenwood,"You are an adept survivalist, in tune with the natural world to a degree that you are able to go out into near any environment and survive in reasonable comfort. This natural affinity also grants you additional insight into natural beings, allowing you to hunt or tame them with surprising ease."
0,Old Traditions – Greek,Riordanverse - Percy Jackson,"You are knowledgeable in the ways of the ancient civilization corresponding to whatever mythology you're most connected with. You can read their languages, know the proper ways to honor the gods, and have a decent grasp of their mythology. Otherwise unassociated Drop-ins may choose any one ancient culture to know of. You may purchase this multiple times, each time gaining insight into a new culture."
0,Sanwe-Latya,Silmarillion SB,"Meaning ‘thought-opening’, this is a capacity that all thinking beings in Arda possess, from the greatest of the Ainur to the least hobbit. In short, every thinking mind is at least potentially capable of sensing others, and both inserting its thoughts into other minds, and reading the thoughts of others. However, there are many limitations on this process, which prevent every Tom, Dick and Barliman from making use of - or knowing about - this ability (see Notes).
With this you, like every person in this world, gain the latent ability to develop this skill to at least some extent, to contact and read the minds of others and project your thoughts into theirs, whether to communicate or compel. This can be very useful for interpreting thoughts others wish to reveal, and thus in interpreting unfamiliar languages.
Perhaps more importantly, though, you gain the likewise-universal ability to close your own mind, whether to particular individuals or to all. This barrier of ‘unwill’ makes it impossible for even the greatest and most powerful mind in Arda to perceive or alter your thoughts – but you can still be persuaded, intimidated, tortured or tricked into lowering it. By default, the unwill still provides a strong barrier against other means of intrusion from outside this jump (e.g. psychic powers), but is not entirely invulnerable. In future jumps, characters will be able to close their minds against your thought-reading and thought-sending in a similar way, regardless of the local metaphysics, and with time you may be able to teach them to close their minds against similar intrusions by other means."
0,Scowl of Sparta,God of War,"There are times where you are angry, or disappointed. Like, INCREDIBLY angry or disappointed. However, in these times your face may be expressing maximum dissatisfaction but you must scowl HARDER. That's why you can have this, on me. When your face does not match the depth of the emotion you are showing, people can get a really good idea of how far you really feel just by looking at you. As a bonus, this will work for you regardless of what form you may be taking at the moment. DISAPPOINTED."
0,Songs of Power,Silmarillion SB,"In the beginning, Arda’s history was foreshown in the Music of the Ainur, and although it was physically created afterwards, music still holds power within the halls of Ea. Befitting this world shaped by music, you have a talent for song and poetry; you can carry a tune or recite a poem easily, injecting appropriate emotion. Furthermore, you can easily memorise such artworks.
For 400 CP, free to Elves and Maiar and discounted to Men of the West, the power of your music and chanting goes beyond ‘mere’ poetry and song. Through such music, you can perform goetia, the magics of the mind. With a calming song you could quiet wild beasts and befriend furious horses, with an upbeat and merry melody imbue a party with an air of enchantment, wonder and joy, with a quiet rhyme help conceal yourself and others in foliage and shadows, or with a bellicose chant ignite courage in the hearts of your allies and intimidate your foes. Alternatively, you may sing such songs to counter similar enchantments of others; for instance a song of courage and resilience to help another resist the terror-spells of a Nazgul. On your own, the effects you can invoke with this are relatively subtle and will be tiring, but many such chanters together can magnify the effects and reduce the burden upon you, as can magical tools such as Rings of Power.
For 600 CP, free to Maiar and discounted to Elves, your mastery of the music goes still further. No longer limited to affecting minds, emotions and perceptions, your songs and chanting can alter the physical world. A low, whispering tune might call up mists from the ground to cover your passage, while a wild, high chant might conjure storms or send a river raging down from its source. Your music can encourage plants to grow, fires to rise high, or even stone to shiver itself apart. However, such magics are draining to body and spirit, the more so the more overt and grand the effect; a little chant for call light from a staff-tip or conjuring a shroud of mist on a cool night would be quite simple, while shattering stone or calling storms would be extremely exhausting even for even the most powerful of the elves unaided. As with lesser songs, additional singers of similar power, and magical tools can make this easier. Furthermore, these musics alter and command what is already present, rather than calling new things into being.
At a significant cost in exhaustion - even to one bearing a magical tool such as a Great Ring - you can condense such a song or chant into a single note; a Word of Command which takes effect in a moment, such as when Gandalf shattered the bridge of Khazad-Dum, or attempted to hold back the Balrog of Moria behind a sealed door."
0,Strength of Arms,Silmarillion SB,"These early ages of the world are not empty of the struggle against evil, and so it is for the best that you have some skill in the fight, and courage enough to see you through a battle.
For free, you have the skills of a competent warrior with two weapons of your choice and the general skills to don, doff and make use of armour, as well as to ride a horse and fight in formation with others. Furthermore, you will not freeze up in battle or should killing be needed of you, though beyond this your courage will be your own."
0,Traditions,Riordanverse - Kane Chronicles,"You are knowledgeable in the ways of the mythology of the Egyptian pantheon. You can speak Ancient to Modern Egyptian and read the various kinds of hieroglyphics, know the proper ways to honor the gods, and have an encyclopedic grasp of the mythos."
0,Unpredictable,Ravenwood,"You naturally think in two different ways, the norm, and the off the wall. This makes it difficult to predict exactly what you will do and harder for people to read your intentions. This has the added benefit of making you more creative, something that lets you come up with... unique uses for skills you possess."
0,"Vainest, Most Glorious",Exalted – First Age,"In Creation’s most glorious age, who is the most glorious of them all is a debate yet to be decided. Every Exalt is brought to the peak of health and then some upon Exaltation after all, and with all the luxuries and amenities afforded by the First Age some either embark on transhuman paradigms of otherworldly beauty while others perfect themselves into monuments to the human form. Golden gods and goddesses strut their factory-cathedrals like catwalks, while in the deep woodlands creatures as seductive as they are deadly amble in auras of purest silver.
Care to throw your hat in the ring? For free you shall be beautiful as only the Exalted of the First Age can be, your skin cleansed and your hair airbrushed just so that you have all the magnificence due someone of your stature. You are Exalted after all, and part of that uniqueness includes looking the part of a hero."
50,Beniemiya,Fate/Legends: Land of the Rising Sun,"It might just be something in the water, both what you're drinking and what you serve to the guests that adore every meal you make. You're a savant when it comes to making meals, not just limited to Eastern dishes either. With a little experimentation, you can make almost anything into a mouth watering feast for both the taste buds and the eyes. The real problem isn't making a good meal but keeping all these greedy pigs from eating you out of house and home. Don't even try making hamburgers around any blonde ladies, it never ends well. Now, while cooking good food is a prize well worth it, you do also have a more useful aspect here. By channeling magical energy into your tools and ingredients as you work, you're able to 'enchant' the meal with a variety of useful effects. A hearty beef stew that lets a warrior heal their wounds much faster than normal, sugary sweets that give people the speed of the wind, a mighty hamburger that temporarily bulges the muscles to greater heights. Even negative effects are possible, if you want to taint your food that way. They only last for a temporary period and the effects tend to be fairly weak without a lot of mana put in but it makes your food all the more popular."
100,Crazed Physician,Van Helsing,"Amongst the many sciences and paths you know, aside from the usual Ominous Cackling, you... Can actually patch people up easily. As a Crazed Physician, you can use the plainest tools on hand to mend any variety of wounds and injuries. As well, you know the human anatomy down to the last blood vessel, and can learn the anatomy of any other creature you dissect more easily."
100,Creative Leaps,Lords of the Night - Liches,"You might not be as good at putting in the work, or checking all the steps, or keeping up with the research. What you can do, is make wild leaps that are consistent with what you know, jump to simpler solutions, and causally realize more elegant approaches to what seems like complex problems. A smarter mind than yours might figure out what actually has to happen to solve a problem. But seeing that solution, you can jump to how to do the same thing in a tenth as many steps, as you figure out how one action can solve two problems, and set you up to cleanly execute the next step. And your solution will be more robust to boot. You're also more intuitive, able to pick up and realize things without ever knowing why you picked them up or realized them, and more creative in general."
100,Form Equals Function,Generic Enchanter,Your creations have an unusual property that makes them function better when they look good. A sword made of subpar materials and simple craftsmanship but that looks good will work just as well as one made with good materials and decent skill. A more well-made sword made to look just as good would function even better than it otherwise would. This improves upon every quality of the item.
100,Heart's Desire,Warhammer Fantasy - Tomb Kings,"All Necrotects are skilled architects and designers. They wouldn't have the job if they weren't and you're no different. You're gifted with any sort of architecture, trap making or monument designing. What makes you special is that you have a sense for what your customers really want. You can picture in your mind the exact ideal of the thing they're hiring you to build and create it. Closer than any instructions could communicate to you, you understand their wish and you know what it should look like, though the construction of such a thing may yet be beyond your means. Still, if you can carry it out, they'll love you for it, even if it differs from the instructions they said to you."
100,Mastercrafting,Generic Enchanter,"When you make something and actually put a significant effort into it, it just comes out better, as if you had used better quality materials and had better equipment to work with. This improves nearly all aspects of the crafted object, including any supernatural qualities it may possess, as it has the quality of its craftsmanship and materials overcome through skill."
100,Material Refinement,Generic Enchanter,"You are practiced in one of the simplest forms of enchanting. This allows you to draw out some of the innate properties of a material or substance and allow it to project that property in some small fashion, such as the stress relieving qualities of an amethyst necklace. The effects of this are minor on their own, but can be combined with other forms of enchanting to create something more potent."
100,Metal-Worker,Irish Mythology,"Wouldn’t be much of a smith without the basics. You know how to mine, refine and work all forms of metal, and are well-steeled for the hard labor and heat of the forge."
100,Methodical Approach,Lords of the Night - Liches,"Sometimes the best approach is plodding. It's like you have two extra minds. Not creative or innovative like your normal thoughts, but absolutely patient, and never stopping, slowing, or growing bored.
If you need a material with a certain set of properties, they can go over everything you know about material science and systematically work through it until they find such a material. If you need to make a process more efficient, they can systematically go over all possible iterations, checking them one by one, simplifying one way, then another, and another, seeing what works and what doesn't.
You always know how many steps you went up or down on a stairway, how long your stride was, how many windows you passed, and other such points of data. This doesn't give you bottomless memory, but the machine minds in the back of your head miss nothing, and can ponder anything and everything.
They can even outperform a more brilliant mind, because they never dismiss anything and leave no stone unturned, even ones a more intuitive thinker would overlook. They excel at keeping the facts in mind, and only the facts. What they lack in creativity or innovation they make up for in being utterly systematic.
You also find it easier to work methodically through things with your normal thoughts, and when you do you can work with the machine thoughts, using your intuition and creativity to help them overcome problems and find solutions faster.
These extra thought trains always equal your normal ones in raw processing, but are otherwise crippled as described above. However, they will take on weakened shadows of any mental or social enhancing perks you possess.
For example, if you have the Social Intelligence perk, they will pick up on social data, and can work with it despite not being creative or intuitive, processing through such data in bulk to help you solve larger social questions. They won't be as capable as if you focused on those things with your normal thoughts, but their methodical approach means they can handle bigger datasets then you can, and nothing stops you from considering the ideas and thoughts they come up with your normal less restricted thought processes."
100,Nigredo,Lords of the Night - Zombies,"The first step is breaking things down to their basics, before putting them back together. You always understand how far you can atomize knowledge, and are able to source all the bits.
If you're starting an experiment, you can use this to completely break down your starting premise, break down what you think you know, find every source for every one of those bits. You will keep discrete knowledge of what you think every step is doing, what it's checking for. If you get unexpected results, you'll be able to atomize what those results are, what conflicts with what you know, and what doesn't.
This makes you no more right than you were before, but helps immensely in figuring out where you're wrong. Likewise, if you one day discover a source of yours was unreliable, you'll know every bit of information you got from him directly or indirectly, and be able to find every conclusion you're using that he contributed to.
It won't tell you which ones are manipulations, but you'll know that you have a bias because of something he said to you in passing because you'll be able to identify every contributor to your every bias."
100,Nimble Fingers,Irish Mythology,"There is none better for fine detail work than yourself, Your precise and certain hands can make etchings too small to be seen with the unaided eye, and anything you have even a minute to embellish is beautiful to behold."
100,Old Patient Magic,Circle of Magic,"You have learned how to cast charms, wards, and protections over places that grow more and more powerful, stable, and harder to damage with age. A door you reinforced with magic a year ago will be tougher than one you reinforced a day ago, and a scrying mirror you made decades ago will be able to see further than one you made a couple years back. The growth rate may not be much, and it grows slower over time, but it does add up over decades and centuries."
100,Red Arts,Kill 6 Billion Demons,"The Red Art is associated with changing the existing physical universe or non-animate matter. In layman’s terms, it means you can alter non-living matter, and transmute it into anything. However, this transmutation depends on the difference between the two. Iron into gold is easier than salt water into gold, for example. You also can’t make matter from nothing, requiring matter already there."
100,Savant,Generic Exalted,"You're a Savant! This means you've got an incredible insight in crafting all sorts of things, from meals, to clothes, to armor, to weapons, to magical devices, and all sorts of other things besides. Even if you've never done something before so long as it's a skill remotely 'craft like' in nature you'll be able to perform it at the level of a (mortal) master. This just represents innate talent, and if you actually focus on developing such skills the normal way you'll quickly outstrip even the best that a mortal craftsman could accomplish, able to make artwork that speaks to the soul (perhaps literally) or armor and weapons of surpassing quality that look like show-room pieces despite being suitable for combat and also being sturdy and reliable to a frankly unbelievable degree. Purchasing this will even make you substantially better than other Exalted craftsmen, assuming you put in the same amount of effort that they did."
100,Scavenger,Ravenwood,"Sometimes, you do not have the luxury of top of the line equipment and need to rely on what scraps you can salvage. You, however, have an advantage, being able to cobble together scavenged bits into functional equipment that work as well as the real deal. This talent will also inherently improve the durability of such improvised equipment to function even when such materials should not feasible hold up under the strains of use."
100,Shaper,Age of Wonders II,"Stone is a tough servant, resisting most ways to work it by unskilled hands. Under your touch, however, it molds itself eagerly, as if it were unable to wait to become the new shapes you wish for it. You are a gifted artisan with the natural materials of the world, and can build fortifications, buildings, and other creations out of wood, stone, sand, and any other such materials with great ease. Indeed, under your touch the materials you work with seem to become greater, somehow - sand and clay toughen to match granite when building a wall, and a carved wooden blade seems to hold its edge like fine steel once you're finished with it."
100,Spellknight,Ravenwood,"You’ve been trained as a spellknight and have learned how to forcefully swap the state of your mana, calming it to dormant when it was previously active and inciting it to action when it was previously dormant, with only a few moments of focus. With time and training, you can get to the point where your mana is both dormant and active at the same time, allowing you to benefit from both states simultaneously. This has the added benefit of making your dormant mana more effective as well, improving your physical health, resistance to poison and disease, and granting an increased reaction time as your thoughts grow quicker.
If you have at least one Dormant (Magus or Adept) and one Active (Sorcerer or Wizard) methodology, or both Hybrid (Witch and Shaman) methodologies, this perk is discounted."
100,Thaumaturgy – Magus,Ravenwood,"You have studied and learned to use the principles of Manacraft, allowing you to channel your mana in such a way as to enhance your abilities by channeling your mana internally. As a dormant method of thaumaturgy, this allows you to keep the benefits of dormant mana."
100,Thaumaturgy – Shaman,Ravenwood,"You have studied and learned to use the principles of Shamanism, allowing you to tune your mana towards a particular element to infuse it into your spells. While this requires intense concentration, it offers increased flexibility and power to spells using the tuned mana, as well as simple manipulation of the element so attuned."
100,Thaumaturgy – Witch,Ravenwood,"You have studied and learned to use the principles of Witchcraft, allowing you to extract the mana channels from materials to create and cast your spells. While this needs and consumes resources, it is easier to use and requires little investment from the caster, and skilled mages can use it to supplement their more common spells."
100,The Gift,Ars Magica,"The Gift is the ability to use magic; it is necessary cast spells from this world. However, The Gift has a strong emotional effect on people and animals around you which can make it hard to interact with strangers, as they may become suspicious and mistrustful of you. The Gift’s negative effects only occur if you interact with someone. Not talking to anyone wouldn’t alert them to your magical power. This negative effect is removed at the end of this jump."
100,Thrifty,Generic Enchanter,"When making something and don’t have one or more of the appropriate materials, you can figure out substitutes that will be easier to acquire and/or cheaper, at the cost of effectiveness. This will result in what you are making being less effective, but the loss will be less than what it likely should be. With practice, you may even be able to make such substitutions just as potent as what was originally called for."
100,Treasures of Earth,Actraiser,"Worldly pleasures are still pleasures. Just because you cannot take along material goods to the afterlife doesn't make them any less...well, desirable. You're skilled in the manners of jewelry and precious metals, being able to ascertain their validity at a moment's glance and be able to craft beautiful things from gems or gold. You could take a small pile of gold and turn it into a worthy crown with minimal tools, if you wished."
100,Waste Not Want Not,Generic Enchanter,"You get the absolute most out of nearly anything you deal with and never seem to waste any of what you have available. What little waste you do produce, however, can be put to use elsewhere with surprising ease. This is not simply for crafting. You will extract the most nutrients from food you ingest, keep full and hydrated for longer, and get the most out of your time sleeping, making all three more efficient and less necessary in general. Your ability to manage time and space as a resource is similarly astounding."
100,White Arts,Kill 6 Billion Demons,"The White Art is associated with changing the self or the self’s perceptions. In short, you can alter your own body, teleport across the multiverse, aligning your Atum, and so on. This type of the Art is much harder to master, however, making it used only by the most advanced Sorcerers. One other thing: there are rumors that the White Art’s ultimate use is to turn back time. Maybe you’ll see if there are truths to this rumor..."
200,Albedo,Lords of the Night - Zombies,"The counterfeit flame of life burning in the soul of every Alchemical is both gripped by Decay, and yet at the same time burns all the possibilities of Alchemy. This has granted you odd insights into how to break down and reform matter. You can make various alchemical substances, products that have impossible properties. Using sand as a base ingredient, you could smelt it into stone that once it hardens, is highly flammable. Or both pliable yet harder than steel. Such transformations are partly fueled by the flame of false life that burns within you - it is an alchemical flame almost without equal, and when utilized properly it can have incredible properties. You need proper tools to work and transform the materials you're working with. You're alchemically treating the materials, not enchanting them, so you can't simply 'lay' the effect on them. Whatever you end up doing should be something that can be framed as 'material properties' rather than 'enchantments.'"
200,Alchemy,Unmodded Minecraft,"You know Minecraft's alchemy recipes front to back, and understand enough of the theory to begin experimenting with the ingredients of this world and others to make new potions. You'll also occasionally get a little more out of your efforts than expected, sometimes getting a free second potion at the end of the distillation process, and rarely a third."
200,Alchemy/Alkahestry,Full Metal Alchemist,"The art of Alchemy involves many different components, and is part science and part mystical. It involves the law of equivalent exchange, and with that limit in mind, one can comprehend, deconstruct, and reconstruct physical matter into different forms. Amestrian Alchemy involves using the power generated by the Earth’s tectonic shifts to power this transformation, and an alchemical circle to make the change. Alkahestry on the other hand is a more medical, and spiritual form of Alchemy that involves the “Dragon’s Pulse” which is a concept that details the constant pulse of Chi or life energy within the Earth. Unlike Alchemy, it is far better for healing wounds, and can project transmutation across distances. With this perk, you gain a decent understanding of either Alchemy or Alkahestry, enough to be a State Alchemist for the former, with a minor focus on one form of Alchemy, and similar skill for the latter with a minor focus towards either healing or combat. If you pay an extra 100CP discounted to Alchemists, you have instead a similar understanding of both principles due to your Origin studying both, or if you’re a Drop In, due to Jump Shenanigans. Before you think yourself a God capable of deciding life and death with this ability however, you must always ask yourself: “For what can match the value of the human soul?”."
200,And On This Rock,Actraiser,"There is a reason that all the surviving relics of the old world are made of stone. Stone endures. You are remarkably talented with architecture and stone-working, able to find the best marble and rock for your purposes! Freeing your vision from the rock will be a simple matter, and your creations are noticeably sturdy. Your buildings, statues and bridges will all last for ages, surviving even the roughest of natural ravages. The Stone endures, and you can shape it to your will."
200,Arcane Study,Generic Enchanter,"You have figured out how to use any magic system or supernatural power in the process of enchanting, regardless of how seemingly incapable of it they are. You can also imbue spells into object to add new properties to them related to the spell imbued."
200,Architectural Madness,Exalted – The Infernals,"Malfean architecture is unlike anything found in Creation, with endless variety and many oddities. Many techniques that were once burned away by She Who Lives in Her Name have been rediscovered. Foremost in these are the techniques to allow demons to build structures that do not need pillars, arches and other support structures. Buildings hundreds if not thousands of feet high can be built without any apparent load-bearing walls or struts. Windows and doors can be placed anywhere without disrupting the integrity of a building. Of course these techniques work best with the brass and black stone common to Malfeas, even if they work to a lesser extent with other materials. So it is just one more reason most buildings in Malfeas are made of brass and basalt, along with their abundant presence.
Yet many more techniques are used by the artisans and architects of Malfeas, even aside from the omnipresent murals, wall carvings, and other ornamentations. Techniques to create such marvels as buildings that sprout from the ground at unnatural angles and made of polished brass turned a rainbow of colors by a process known only to the most skilled of architects. In many of these techniques you have gained the pinnacle of skill and knowledge, that you might might replicate the Demon City's constructions even in other realms. While you might not have reliable access to the materials common to those in hell, you will be able to substitute many other materials for these in your structures. And as a truly talented architect you will find the design and construction of Manses comes just as easily to you, even gleaning some additional power from the conflux of essence it is build upon if you do use these hellish methods."
200,Automail Mechanic,Full Metal Alchemist,"The world of Fullmetal Alchemist is unique in that even though much of the technology is reminiscent of the early 20th Century, there is a startlingly large difference in prosthetic technology that surpasses even what we have today. These prosthetics are known as Automail, and it takes a specialized engineer to know how to make them. With this perk, not only are you one such Engineer, but you’ve in fact spent years learning the art(unless you’re a Drop In) and have a talent and skill similar to the Rockbells or the best mechanics in Rush Valley."
200,Beauty in the Arts,God of War,"The Greeks and their gods have an eye for the aesthetics of their surroundings. Whether it is the statues around them, or the floors they walk upon, or the things they carry and wield, it is better if it is appealing. Your ability to design any of your crafts has increased with this knowledge, able to appeal to form without sacrificing function. Regardless of what you create, it's going to look good enough that the gods might take notice... might. Whether this is a good thing, or a bad thing is for you to decide."
200,Bioethics,Unsong,"You have a nigh-perfect understanding of the nature of consciousness; not just how existence folds around itself to create awareness, but how awareness itself takes on the subjectivity that seems so ineffable. Valence, qualia, phenomenal experience, pleasure and pain, emotions and values; you know what such things look like from the subjective “inside” and the objective “outside”, and so you have sheared through the hard problem of consciousness entirely.
Of course, merely having this knowledge doesn’t mean you can act on it. But if you have the means to perceive and manipulate the foundations of consciousness — whether that means working with the flesh and blood of the brain, or something even stranger — you will never need “true” telepathy to see and manipulate the mind. Instead, you could directly read and modify the connectome, and so on. The mind is its own palace, and so you can make a Heaven of Hell, a Hell of Heaven, built in concrete, worldly Malkuth."
200,Charm Magic,Riordanverse - Kane Chronicles,"The magic concerned with the enchantment of permanent magical devices and objects, such as a magician’s tools and the ritual implements required for complex and powerful spells( many suchimplements are single use and highly specific) as well as pre-prepared spellcasting."
200,Curse Weaver,Generic Enchanter,"You have the ability to incorporate a downside or negative quality into your creations, creating cursed magic items. More than this, you can tie the curse into another enchantment to enhance the quality of the enchantment. By tying in downsides, you strengthen whatever positives do exist."
200,Demi-Servant/Pseudo Servant,Fate/Grand Order,You may buy this perk for 200CP instead of 500CP as normal and receive only the Capstone Booster section.
200,Demi-Servant/Pseudo Servant,Fate/Stay Night,"Any 600cp perk will gain an upgraded form for you if you take them and this perk at once, as described in the Notes section at the bottom of this jump. You may also purchase this option for 200CP instead, only gaining the effects of the Capstone Booster portion and losing out on everything else, including all Servant/Master benefits and any additional points."
200,Demi-Servant/Pseudo Servant,Fate/Zero,"Any 600cp perk will gain an upgraded form for you if you take them and this perk at once, as described in the Notes section at the bottom of this jump. You may opt into only paying 200CP instead to receive only the effects of the Capstone Booster, giving up any Servant related or Master related boosts. No extra SP or CP, only the boosts to capstones."
200,Demonic Bartender,Exalted – The Infernals,"Demons love their liquor. As water is extremely rare and milk nearly unknown in the demon realm, Hell instead offers a thousand infernal wines, whiskeys, brandies, vodkas and other drinks. Many of them contain other drugs, both natural and supernatural. Some are flat-out toxic to mortals. Still, those Exalts who cultivates an immunity to poison and cast-iron gullet can explore a world of strange intoxicants that range from gut-ripping vileness to soul-shuddering delight.
You’ve gained an understanding on how to create all these brews yourself. How to ferment bone-wine, thanachvil, and gurshant. How to distill liquid emotions and waking dreams derived from Hegra's rains into elixirs. How to bottle the perfect pleasure that is sypax, or the liquid Lethe of final rest elixir... and finally, even the most precious drink in all of Malfeas, chalcanth. chalcanth is the liquefied, distilled essence of a demon. The unfortunate demon is dissolved in pure vitriol while still alive, so that drinking chalcanth is like tasting pure Being to a demon, and grants both Essence and memories to any who drink it. Of course if you'd prefer, it could also be used in forging infernal relics, by far the most common artifacts in hell."
200,Eastern Sage,Full Metal Alchemist,"Legends tell that Amestris learned the art of Alchemy from a philosopher who told the tale of Xerxes’ destruction in a single night. You too share something with this man in that you can teach even the most untalented and thick people arts that should be beyond them considering their knowledge base. You could single handedly bring Alchemy to other worlds, while creating a new era based on its use, and that’s literally too. All you need to do is teach it as if it was a normal subject and a possibility there, and people will develop the capability in other worlds even if they really shouldn’t. You find you can do much the same for your other mystical abilities."
200,Eight-Fold Geomantic Mastery​,Generic Exalted,"You possess the inherent understanding and skill with geomancy and the manipulation of natural energies such that you may now create manses in any area where such a thing could conceivably be created. The stronger the mystic or magical significance of a given place the more powerful the manse that can be built there, but even in the barest and most mystically barren areas you will still be capable of producing, given some time, a manse of the least (1-dot) power. The process of creating a Manse is tremendously faster for you than it would be for others, the necessary geomantic arrays and arrangements seeming to simply leap to your mind with a clarity of insight few if any could match.
The Eight-Fold part of it is that you understand the methods for creating manses aspected towards all five of the elemental essences of fire, earth, wind, water, and wood as well as manses aspected towards solar, lunar, and stellar (sidereal) energies. Given time and effort you may discern methods for creating other types of manse, twisted mockeries of what nature intended, but such insights will take considerable effort, time, and resources to bear fruit. Taking this perk explicitly allows you to create manses even outside of Creation and, indeed, is the only way to create manses outside of Creation."
200,Essencetapping,Aion,"You know the basics of magically extracting valuable materials from your surroundings in a way that won't damage the environment or source. In addition; post-jump, you may use this ability to gather resources native to other settings.
You have mastered extracting all but the most exotic materials, and as an added bonus; you often find rare materials in your endeavours. Also, your post-jump essencetapping will find the occasional Atreian material gathered alongside native ones."
200,Focuses & Channels,Generic Enchanter,"You are skilled in the creation of objects designed to naturally channel and focus supernatural powers through them, making any such power easy to use. The more in line with the supernatural power to be channeled the object is, such as a lantern for fire and light based magics, the better it will channel and focus said abilities. Such a thing can also be tuned to a specific power, making it better for that power, but less useful for others."
200,Geomancy,Generic Enchanter,"You are able to use a form of empowered feng shui to set up a space for a purpose. You can set up a flow of natural energies within an area that make it easier to perform tasks related to the purpose the space was set up to have. This can also allow an area to be enchanted, albeit in a weakened form due to how widespread it is."
200,Gift of Magic,Earthsea,"You have the power to speak or sing the Old Speech with power, and with it to weave magic. This represents only the potential to wield magic, not the knowledge to actually do so. Still, it is a rare gift, and holds the potential for great power, and great harm.
When conversing in the Old Speech, you cannot lie, or even twist the truth. This is the fundamental mechanism of magic: If something is said which is not true, it becomes so. This requires spiritual energy from you; the greater the change the more energy is required.
Commanding something which can move on its own – for instance, calling the true name of an animal to cause it to come to you – is some of the easiest magic, while changing something’s form and substance is much harder. Hardest of all – and perhaps the most terrible – is grasping part of the nature of the world itself; to open doors into death and other such feats. The more a piece of magic goes against the order of the world, the more it demands.
By default, you have a fair pool of this energy, which replenishes with time and rest. Perks which increase your store of spiritual energy likewise increase this pool. It is not directly related to the energy of your body, but if your body or spirit is weakened (e.g. by starvation or disease, or by despair and loss of purpose) so too will be your spiritual energy. Likewise, if you exhaust your energy, your body and spirit may ail and become weaker. This perk gives you enough power to be a strong mage or weatherworker, though not the equal of Ged at first. With time and practice this energy will expand, like exercising a muscle."
200,Growth Curve: Linear,Fate/Grand Order,"Not everyone learns the same way. An oft repeated childhood saying has rather more relevance in this world and for you especially on buying this option. The way and speed you learn has been altered to one of three modes of which you may pick only one. Linear Mode will allow you to always learn at a constant rate. You will learn as fast as at the start as you do during the middle and ending stages of your learning, even if the process would normally slow down greatly in one of these phases. This alteration cannot be changed once picked."
200,Grudge Forged,Fate/Legends: Land of the Rising Sun,"Ibaraki-douji created her favoured bone sword by tearing out the bones of many Oni and setting them into a forge of her own terrible flames for hundreds of days. A way of sword smithing only a demon could manage, a brutal and unrefined method that results in a brutal and unrefined sword. But that sword is powerful, near unbreakable and holds the furious grudges of the Oni sacrificed to make it, giving the weapon a deadly cursed aura. This sort of feat is much more applicable to your skills now, as you find it far easier to turn your own innate abilities to the work of crafting things. A dragon's fire improves the quality of things forged in it, rather than just destroying the entire workshop. Cooling a forged sword in your own Youkai poison will still cool it as if with water but also imbue powerful toxins into the metal itself. You are able to add your abilities in creative ways to your creations without compromising them. Better still, you're very good at focusing what you create to not harm yourself. Using the bones of hundreds of hate-filled demons to create a cursed sword would direct those curses at your enemies, not at the original wielder of the sword. No need to worry about life draining demon blades if you're at the source of them all."
200,Hammer Upon the Wailing Muse,Exalted – The Abyssals,"Much of the Underworld’s economy rests on the production of soulsteel, one of the magical materials, which can only be produced by combining shavings from the walls of the Mouth of Oblivion with the melted corpus of a ghost. Forging soulsteel is difficult for even the best smiths. Soulforging is the process by which the souls of the dead are melted down and then shaped into useful items or are used to produce soulsteel.
First, the corpus of a ghost is carefully heated with soulfire crystals so that it can be reduced to a viscous state without damaging its integrity. Once liquified, the corpus can be smelted with other materials and then worked into any shape appropriate to conventional metalworking. Soulforged items normally have the consistency of mortal steel. However, if the liquified corpus is smelted with molten ore taken from the Labyrinth, the result is soulsteel, one of the magical materials... and the only one that screams when struck with the smith’s hammer.
Proper soulforging is a highly specialized art that requires rarified equipment, access to Labyrinthine materials and a willingness on the part of the soulsmith to condemn another ghost to eternal torment. Understandably, soulforging is a heavily regulated art. But one you have mastered to extent rivaled by only a scant few amongst the dead, able to forge souls into proper soulsteel, combine soulforging with jadecrafting to forge sophisticated artifacts, and having gleaned the secrets of creating Oblivion's panoply, jealously guarded by the Deathlords. Though you would need to delve deep into necromancy to put the latter into actual practise."
200,If You Want It Done Right,Lords of the Night - Liches,"There's people who leech off of other people's efforts. Herd animals, herbivores, the kind of weaklings who fall in line. You aren't one of them. You know the only person whose work you can really trust. A big project can be hard to tackle by yourself. Different resources, different specialities. Even if you know all the different pieces, you might not know how to put all of them together. Even if you know how to put them together, changing tracks and approaches all the time can scuttle your work. There are many extra problems that arise when you go alone, and many problems that are solved simply by having a second pair of hands helping you. None of that applies to you. Unless a problem literally requires a second pair of hands or other such gross physical assets, the work doesn't grow harder for you, simply because you have to do it all yourself. This doesn't make it easier either - if a project requires a thousand man hours of work, then you'll need to put that in. But the lack of help won't make it worse or harder. You can simply do things by yourself, provided you put in the work and the time. And for a lich, whom has all the time in the world? Well, nothing more needs to be said, does it?"
200,Kiln,Ravenwood,"You are what is known as a Kiln, capable of wielding Delfire. Often called scavenger's magic, Delfire is the combination of different forms of magic that has taken on new properties, becoming a small orb surrounded by an oddly colored flame-like aura. This is the source of delfire's name, and they do not emphasize fire over any other element. You are able to store these orbs of delfire within yourself, giving you resistance to disease, poison, curses, and corruption as it is eaten away by the delfire. Additionally, delfire acts as a spell matrix, capable of producing unusual effects when fueled by any type of energy.
If you possess the Natural Magic perk, you may create orbs of Delfire by mixing various energies together."
200,"Lesser Arts: Mending and Breaking, Herbs and Healing",Earthsea,"A wide array of lesser arts are used by petty witches and sorcerers across the isles of Earthsea – and yet, there is plenty of use in such skills. This Perk may be purchased multiple times, each time providing skill in one of the arts described below. Mages gain one Art for free, and a discount on subsequent Arts.
● Mending and Breaking. You know the true names of many common objects – oars, swords, bowls, wheels and so on – and the spell-chants to cause them to join together it broken, to banish rot from them, or to bind things together into new forms such that driftwood and seaweed could serve for a (rather poor) ship. Alternatively, those chants can be reversed to rust blades, shatter wheels and weaken tools to break. With enough power, you could command the stones of a castle wall to un-bind themselves and fall.
● Herbs and Healing. You have learned magic and herbalism together, both what herbs and substances are best for healing, and the names to increase their potency. Under your care the wounded can mend and the sick become well – or, if you so choose, the healthy may ail and die through poisons and the sicknesses you call up. It is possible to directly heal someone through magic, but this requires that you know their true name – and such is the sacredness with which such names are held that even the threat of death may not compel someone to reveal them."
200,Lord Of The Siege,Age of Wonders II,"The earth sings to you, from the dirt and loose soil of farms and grasslands to the rocky depths of the earth below. Why would a stone care if it has been shaped by human hand if it will still listen when you speak? To an Earth Wizard, the greatest city walls are no different from the ground under their feet, and the insights you’ve gained from this perspective are powerful, indeed. You are a master at determining the weak points in any solid structure, allowing you to direct your army to strike enemy fortifications with surgical precision - or shore up your own defenses instead. And should you exert your own power... some Earth Wizards have been known to shatter every gate in an enemy city with but a gesture or mend their walls in between strikes from a cannon’s bombardment, but you could make those shows of power look tame in comparison."
200,Manna of Heaven,Actraiser,"They say one of the greatest miracles of the Master was to create food where there was none, and now you share a similar ability. You can now create delicious food from basic ingredients, and stretch these ingredients well enough that a single loaf of bread might as well be 5. They're also good enough to restore anyone's morale and give them the strength to keep going even when they feel like they're at rock bottom. Feed a village with a basket of bread and fish."
200,Master of Puppets,Fate/Legends: Oasis of Fantasy,"Everyone is born with talent for something, your talent just happened to be making life. When it comes to magic involved in the creation of familiars, even the summoning of them, you’re miles beyond any of your peers. While you are not the best in the world with just this, your raw skill and power with magic still lacking compared to the greats, you’ll find anything in relation to the creation, alteration and maintenance of magical familiars, summons and living creations comes to you with the ease of breathing. You learn far faster, your products are of a vastly higher quality and come with far more efficiency than what your fellow magicians might create. It is even far more cost efficient for you to make them, as you take just a quarter of what others would expend to create the same things.
You have particular talent too in ensuring the loyalty of that you consider a familiar, whether this be designing the minds of creatures you create as easily as you design their bodies or creating lines of spell or rune magic to add to a summoning ritual to ensure much stronger bonds of servitude exist on what you summon. It also happens that you are quite good at creating and overlooking legal contracts, mostly from all the interaction with demons."
200,Memories of the Music: Craftsmanship,Silmarillion SB,"The Ainur listened to and were a part of the music which foresung the world, and through this and the words of Eru know much of the world. Pick a particular concept, from craftsmanship to light to fire to plants to animals to the sky. Concepts should have more a mythic resonance than precise materialism; a concept of ‘spacetime’ or ‘atomic bonds’ doesn’t fit thematically with Tolkien’s work.
Whatever your chosen concept is, you have deep knowledge and understanding of things relating to that concept. A Maia who chose animals intuitively understands the behaviour of beasts, birds, fish and more, while one who chose craftsmanship is a master of everything from architecture to smithcraft to basket-weaving. Additionally, any magical or spiritual abilities you use related to this concept are uplifted in profundity and strength. Exactly what this means in any given case is fluid, but broadly speaking a Maia will have an easier time and get greater results from doing things with their chosen concept.
This perk may be purchased up to 3 times total. If you have the Arisen in Might perk, you may purchase this perk as many times as you wish. If you are not a Maia, this perk instead represents deep tutelage from a Maia, or one of their students in turn."
200,Name-Finder,Earthsea,"You have a talent for uncovering new true names in the Old Speech. This manifests partly as a particular kind of luck, such that you are somewhat more likely to happen upon mages you could persuade or trick into revealing some of their knowledge. However, if you spend enough time with a thing to truly understand it on an intuitive level, you will be able to uncover its true name with some thought and study. This doesn’t apply to the true names of people, but it does to inanimate objects and unique features, like a bay or sea."
200,Named Creations,Generic Enchanter,"When you finish the creation of an object you can choose to give it a name and feed that name a bit of power, turning the name into a promise of sorts. If you do so, the created object will take on some metaphysical properties associated with the name chosen. These names use the innate magic of and what you feed into the creation to generate these properties. Such properties are largely passive in nature. Knowing the name will strengthen the wielder’s ability to connect to the creation and its enchantments granting greater control."
200,Overcharging,Generic Enchanter,"You are able to power an enchantment beyond its normal capacity, and do so safely. When doing so, the enchantment’s effects are enhanced proportional to the excess energy invested into the effect."
200,Plain Magic,Circle of Magic,"​You are adept at stripping the trappings of magic away from the underpinnings and determining the underlying rules that govern any system of magic. Creating new spells is little more than math for you, and you can usually make spells and enchantments more practical... if less showy."
200,Psychonautics,Unsong,"Like the Right Hand of God and the Drug Lord, you can use psychotropics to expand consciousness in ways that shouldn’t be possible. Mind-altering drugs compounded or administered by you are less addictive and ruinous to body and mind in the long run by orders of magnitude, and your users experience minimal diminishing returns.
In addition, you can also use such drugs to serve as powerful vectors for any other mind-altering abilities you have. If you have any abilities or perks that alter or augment your own personality and outlook, you can even formulate drugs to bestow those abilities on other people."
200,Real Research,Lords of the Night - Zombies,"Improving the fundamentals is hard, unrewarding, and necessary. No number of new ninth circle spells will change the world. Casting such creations is more art than science, and limited to an elite few. Making a better Magic Missile can change the world.
You know how to improve things starting at the basics. You could figure out how to improve Magic Missile, a bit. And use that improvement to improve all first circle force spells that throw the force effect. And from there improve all first circle force spells. And from thereall second level force spells... And so on.
You can share the products of your research, too. Some techniques might be easy, maybe a change to the spell itself. Others might be harder, techniques for maximizing what you get out of already built spells.
You could use this to improve anything you understand on a deep technical level.
The perk comes with deep technical knowledge of death, undeath, Negative Energy, and how tainted forces interact with the physical world, and how they can be manipulated to support dark spells and the raising of undead."
200,Relay Artisan,Age of Wonders II,"The knowledge necessary to create the massive structures known as 'Wizard Towers' is not easy to learn, but not especially rare either. Indeed, all Wizards rely on these towers for their abilities - in particular the ability to vastly increase the reach of their magics by channeling their arcane power through gigantic crystalline projectors lining the tower's structure. Smaller, less powerful crystals are occasionally used as well, both as 'Magic Relay' structures at fixed locations and with special equipment used by champions of the various armies. You are a gifted artificer when it comes to creating such relays and projectors. Not only can you create such crystals, but you have mastered the magical theories behind their function to the point you could craft these magical artifacts from other materials such as wood or silver. As your skill increases you'll be able to create more intricate and efficient relays, reducing their size or increasing their range. With practice, you could craft gemstones small enough for a ring's jewel that could let you project your magic within a dozen miles of their location. Once attuned, the connection between a Wizard and the relays you craft cannot be broken, it will continue to function across any distance and even across dimensions so long as the relay remains intact."
200,Rune Carving,Warhammer Fantasy - Tomb Kings,"Necrotects themselves are usually inexperienced in the ways of magic. It's rarely their duty to cast spells or command rituals, yet they are often called upon to inscribe runes on a vast scale or otherwise prepare things for magical means. You're very skilled at creating structures or items that can be channelled or used with magic, even whilst lacking it yourself. If you had a mage or wizard on hand, you'd even be able to work in tandem effortlessly, crafting items or structures suited to that person's magic in particular, working even better for them than anyone else."
200,Savant,Exalted – The Alchemicals,"The Great Maker is undeniably beyond brilliant. His supreme craftsmanship is such that merely being inside their body is enough to spark inspiration. Not merely a learned ability; Savants in Autochthonia are a unique breed, of which Sodalities and some Alchemicals are part of. This breed of individual possesses an exclusive talent for instinctively understanding magical and scientific theory.
This gifts them a particular aptitude to the repair, operation and maintenance of magitech adding on top of whatever skills the user has for determining their ability to attempt this feat. This does not actually aid in the execution of such functions, effectively acting as understanding without skill in creation.
At the 50 CP Tier this is a mere glimpse into the wonders of the Great Maker. Gunzosha Armor, Light Implosion Bows and other such artifacts of power are understandable with a professional education.
At the 100 CP Tier this manifests a moderate understanding of magitech. At this level extremely potent machines like Warstriders or Lightning Ballista can be operated and repaired with even greater ease than the artifacts mentioned in the tier prior.
At the 200 CP Tier one is capable of understanding extremely advanced magitech theory as easily as your average socialite understands basic mathematics. As it stands right now, only such magitech as the Realm Defense Grid is beyond your understanding and even that could be understood with light study."
200,Seals & Restrictions,Generic Enchanter,"You are able to place restrictions or seals on an enchanted object. Restrictions placed simply mean that the enchantment does not function under certain circumstances, such as not being able to use it against a specific target or requiring something of the wielder to use. However, restrictions make the enchantment stronger in situations where it is not restricted.
Seals, on the other hand, cut off part of the power of the enchantment until certain conditions are met, at which point they are released. They allow greater enchantments than could normally be on the object to be placed, sealed off until the wielder can unlock them and take on the burden of keeping the sealed enchantment functioning."
200,Set Bonuses,Generic Enchanter,"You can create and connect several items into a set. Having multiple components of the same set worn or wielded at once improves on each and can cause magical qualities to awaken in them as long as they are worn or wielded in tandem. An example would be a mask, a pair of gloves, a pair of boots, and a cloak that, when worn together, improve the stealth of the wearer considerably, without them even needing to be enchanted."
200,Stacking the Deck,Generic Enchanter,"You know how to get disparate enchantments to work in tandem, even when they really shouldn’t. You could easily create a weapon wreathed in cold flame by combining a freezing and a flame wreathing enchantment on the same weapon even though they’d normally conflict heavily. You find that any magics, energies, enchantments, or anything really that would normally conflict simply don’t when it comes to you and your creations."
200,Statuary Magic,Riordanverse - Kane Chronicles,Statuary Magic is a form of magic used to create perfect shabtis or transporting armies.
200,The Arcane Craft,Sword and Sorcery,"As much as you might look down upon brutes and barbarians who know only how to break bone and spill blood, you and the warriors of this land have one thing in common. You require the tools of your trade. You know all the methods and ways to bind arcane and mysterious forces into physical vessels. Rings, staves, talismans, warded stone towers, and even more. These items allow the channeling of such forces to work your will, capturing, bending, and shaping the worlds invisible tides to enable works of sorcery and occult splendor. The strength of these items and their effects rely on your skill, knowledge, and power. Of course should you yourself be a font of such forces from your varied lives then you would be surely capable of building the focuses and talismans to augment and amplify your power. The world rewards men for diligent labor. It would behoove you to refine this art to get everything you can out of it. This also includes the skill to use such items, even those not made by your hand should you have the ability to reveal their secrets."
200,Time Flies,Lords of the Night - Zombies,"There are many talented old wizards who have devoted decades of work to achieving immortality, and they didn't even start that search until they were already skilled and experienced in their magic. And many of them fall short. You have a single decade. Good thing you can make the most of your time.
Any kind of extended work or project you're working on progresses unnaturally fast. Or at least, your contribution does. Specifically, it goes five times as fast. You can read a book five times as fast, set-up a ritual five times as fast, craft five times as fast, study or do research five times as fast, and so on.
This never works on action or dynamic set pieces. You could do five days of ritual work in a single day, but the high point at the end of the ritual, the part that must not be interrupted least horrible consequences befall everyone? Normal time."
200,Verditius Enchanting,Ars Magica,"You may forge items from raw materials as a part of enchanting the crafted item, and your mundane crafting ability improves your enchanting skill and vice versa. For example, if you are forging a sword, your ability to magically manipulate heat and metal would improve your blacksmithing ability. When enchanting that same sword, your skill in smithing would allow you to create a more potent enchantment. If you were enchanting a wooden staff instead, you would experience a boost based on your woodworking skill. These effects scale with your skill in the relevant field(s) with no upper limit.
When you enchant an item, you may also alter it cosmetically in any way you like, so long as it does not change the physical or magical properties of the item. In addition, when crafting an item, its final form may be impossible to make by mundane means. For example, you may set a gem within wood such that it cannot be removed without breaking the wood, and you may accomplish this without breaking or cutting the wood yourself."
200,Vision of Greatness,Silmarillion SB,"If you so choose, you may make the glory of your spirit manifest, projecting an emotional aura, according to your will and the nature of your spirit. If your spirit is unsullied, you might uplift hearts and minds, kindle courage by your very presence and produce awe and wonder at your beauty and benevolence. If your spirit is dark and bent on dominance and torment, you can provoke despair, terror, obedience and fearful worship. Those who close their minds against you with the unwill are somewhat resistant to this effect, but not immune.
Furthermore, you can cause this effect to linger in your works as well as your presence, according to the intent of those works. If you construct a wall, you might cause it to project a feeling of safety and protectiveness to those behind it, while daunting those who approach it. You might imbue a sword with a power of terror against those who face it, while heartening those on the same side."
200,Wonder Forging Genius,Generic Exalted,"Your crafting abilities need to be seen to be believed. From your hands pour forth miracles given form, works of art of peerless and breathtaking magnificence, works of culinary delight that would leave Emperors sullen at the thought that no other foods could compare, weapons that could last hundreds of years of constant use that would leave men feeling honored to have been slain by them, all these and more take shape under the guidance of your hands. You would be welcomed in any land and by any court for the sheer quality of your work, and you will quickly gain national, if not worldwide, fame for your creations if you bother to advertise them at all.
The least of your creations are superior to anything a mortal master might create, and even the simplest and least adorned of your works will be possessed of unmatched efficiency, resilience, and simple elegance.
Purchased with the Savant perk this is taken to an even grander height, leaving even the crafts of other Exalted looking as pale and shameful imitations by comparison, assuming you put forth the same effort they did in learning your base crafting abilities."
300,Animism,Generic Enchanter,"You are granted the ability to draw out the essence of a creature, be they willing or too helpless to resist, and bind it into an object, imparting qualities of the donor creature to the object. This does not need to be a living creature, the remains of a creature will have some still living essence within it that you may extract and use with this perk and are considered too helpless to resist. An example would be an everburning torch infused with the essence of an ice wolf so the flames may burn with a cold flame that can lash out like a living thing. This also allows you to bind willing or captured spirits into an object, granting qualities associated with the spirit and allowing the object and spirit to reflect on each other.
Taking essence from a creature isn’t damaging to them, but it takes time for their essence to recover enough to be used as a donor again."
300,Ascension,Fate/Grand Order,"Just because a Servant has been summoned, does not mean that they are summoned at their full potential. Each hero has a great deal of power left to unlock and the process of Ascension is the method to do so. By offering up rare materials and a large amount of magical energy in crystallised form, you can force a being to Ascend to the next stage of being for them. This increases their maximum power to allow them to grow more, changes their appearance to show the upgrade and also unlocks a new ability or power for them such as new Skills for Servants. This process can be done many times, even beyond the normal limit of 4 for you, but each one requires progressively more difficult to obtain ingredients and exponentially more massive amounts of magical energy to support the transformation. New abilities are also only obtained at every second Ascension after the first. You can use the Ascension process on yourself or non-Servant beings as well."
300,Deranged Alchemist,Van Helsing,"You have mastered the medieval forerunner of chemistry, and know the transformation of matter via elaborate rituals and mysticism on top of your scientific approach. The greatest secrets of Alchemy still elude you, such as the fabled Panacea, but that can be found in due time. (Hint: Nobody's found it. At all.) However, you are capable of transmutation of many materials (although it requires that said materials be the same base) and can create Homunculi from following Paracelsus' studies into alchemy."
300,Echoes of the Emerald Forge,Exalted – Shards of the Exalted Dream: Modern Age,"One cannot speak of power without mentioning Malfeas’ impossible emerald heart. A prince among demons and masterful wonder worker you may become even more familiar with later...should you dare. In the past, you had the enviable privilege of being given a masterclass by him in both the combination of modern science with spiritual energy that has allowed the Infernals to make human civilisation the dominant power of Creation, and ancient feats of artifice lost to the modern era. With this, you know how to design the geomantic structures for secret prayer mills that feed power to the Yozis-or perhaps, yourself with minor adjustments. Constructing engines that can seal off death-tainted realms of existence or growing a demonic bioweapon are old hat to you. You know how to create many methods of travelling swiftly around the universe similar to the typical means of the Infernal Exalted, encompassing both artifice and sorcery as well as many wondrous marriages of both. But so is the forgotten art of forging demon souls into more archaic weapons and armour, or the schema to recreate monsters of myth long lost to Creation’s memory like Oliphem: A giant of stone and iron who can walk on the sea or sink to its bottom freely and without harm, and has a great light-casting lens in his face that can guide ships or sear enemies. The doomsday devices you could build with this beggar imagination.
Your skill with genetic engineering and human enhancement with divine components is particularly outstanding, and you can singlehandedly perform the process that infuses human embryos with blood cells extracted from imprisoned Elemental Dragons to create new Dragonblooded from birth. Perhaps in time, you’ll discover ways to modify or improve the Terrestrial Exaltation shall be discovered by you with time and effort. Or apply such modifications to other Exaltations provided you have the correct reagents, rituals and technology.
With some innovation, in time it might even be possible to live up to the Infernal lie of human potential by creating a serum that can turn an adult into a Dragonblood. After all, you already know the foundational theories and proven techniques that can alter Exaltations: To cut away the machine-flesh and divine ichor of Autochthon away and infuse it into a Lunar Exaltation, melding it’s evolutionary potential with the modular mechanism of god-machinery to transform it into an Alchemical Exaltation. Similar procedures and the theoretical framework to tamper with these divine superweapons with are known to you, and you have an excellent grounding for altering other Exaltations.
Your understanding of the Exaltation’s underlying structure, composition and the crafts with which it can be tampered with is exemplary even for an Infernal. Last but not least all three circles of sorcery have been drilled into you, including many spells unique to the Yozis themselves. Some of these great powers can create magically reinforced silence that even prevent spoken spells from being cast in their area of influence, and the corruption of lands to favour the Yozis as well as their servants and Total Annihilation: A mere fleck of Ligier’s flame that deals great destruction with green hellfire."
300,Fate Finds You Interesting,Riordanverse - Percy Jackson,
300,Infusion,Generic Enchanter,"You have the ability to infuse raw power into an object, either as it is being made or one that already exists, and cause it to develop and express magical qualities. The more power is put into this process the greater the magical qualities that will emerge as a result. However, the effect generated is semi-random, suited to the target object but otherwise unpredictable, and can only be slightly directed if the power is flowed into the object during its creation. An object can benefit from this a limited number of times and handle a limited amount of power before it cannot hold more and crumbles. The better the quality of the object, the more it can handle. It is possible you could learn to direct this power with time and practice, but such a thing will likely take years, or possibly decades, of practice even for those that learn at accelerated rates."
300,Lifeless Desecration of Circuitry,Exalted – Shards of the Exalted Dream: Modern Age,"A lifeless machine of cold calculation and heartless programming is not so different from the undead the Abyssals readily rule over. And while some of your peers may prefer the gritty, blood-splattered good old ways of cursing a man, that revelation has given you a twisted gift for wielding the powers of death against technology. You now have capacity to innovate any power governing death or necromancy to also be able to hijack technology. Anything that enhances their powers shall equally enhance these new skills’ effectiveness against networks and subsystems of all kinds. The implications of being able to set up computer networks between Creation and the Underworld are astounding; coupled with your native capacity for creating artifacts and feats such as transmitting souls across databases or extending the effects of curses globally could soon be within your reach. Or you could just scare people with a spooky apparition of your face on their computer screen after hacking them. No seriously, that’s something the more tech-savvy Abyssals have already achieved on their own."
300,Living Magic,Generic Enchanter,"Your enchantments can be imbued with a semblance of life, gaining the ability to adapt, grow, learn, and evolve over time and with use. It becomes possible for the limits of the enchantments to be pushed and prodded, loosening the limits over time and possibly opening up new abilities as the enchantment is pushed more and more. A simple magic lighter that doesn’t need fuel might just be pushed to the point it can create massive conflagrations with this alone, given decades of use and pushing the limits."
300,Playing with Dolls,Fate/Legends: Land of the Rising Sun,"Ever have the ninja pushed for more tricks and tools to keep them ahead of their foes. It's only logical that their desires for a greater advantage over the raw power of the samurai would lead to such advancements in technology. The Danzou puppet is the culmination of incredible science and magic coming together as one, creating an artificial lifeform filled with the experiences and skills of many great ninja, equipped with advanced technology and powerful magic. It's also something you have the knowledge to make and more besides.
You have the training in various disciplines to create advanced puppet bodies like this, as well as the weaponry and technology that Danzou makes use of in that body, even things like missiles. This covers both ordinary scientific knowledge and occult magecraft focused towards artificial bodies like this. It's quite possible to turn an existing person into one of these puppets, albeit more difficult than making it from scratch.
One of the more impressive parts of this field is the techniques that allow for the recording and uploading of knowledge or skills that people possess. With a willing or incapacitated subject, you know how to examine what they know and copy it over to another person. Your studies in this field have also helped you realize how to capably combine magic with technology, creating things where the two work together to support and enhance both sides' effects instead of interfering. While you can't alter the basic metaphysics behind things such as mystery, you do know how to work it to your advantage."
300,Remembrance,Generic Enchanter,"You can impart a memory of a skill or ability you yourself, or another willing participant, possesses, into an object you are crafting. Doing so causes the object to impart some of that skill or ability to the holder of the object. Crafting a sword imparted with your memory of your time training and fighting with the sword would allow the next wielder to use it with a degree of skill, even if they had never held a sword before.
You can also use this to create ‘skill books’ that carry any learnable skill you can teach and can teach it as if you had given someone a dedicated year of study under your tutelage with that skill. You can set the number of charges on a skill book as well as if they recharge over time if you want to set a limit on how readily available such a thing is."
300,Soulbinding,Generic Enchanter,"You have the ability to incorporate a piece of a person’s soul into an object you create in order to bind the object to that individual. Such an object cannot harm the individual whose soul is incorporated, will return to them when called, is perfectly suited for the individual, and gains strength as the soulbound individual grows and performs great deeds. When the original wielder dies, the object may accept a new wielder, taking and incorporating a sliver of the new wielder’s soul in the process, starting the process anew."
300,Soulforge,Generic Enchanter,"You have learned much about how the soul works and can create enchanted objects designed to reside within the soul and provide their benefit without being immediately obvious. Such things as a gem coated in ice that grants the ability to spread frost and rime across the user’s body to form an armor of ice or an athame that allows the user to absorb the blood they spill and turn it into healing for themselves or others they touch. A soul can contain only a few such objects, but they cannot be stolen and do not need to be held, wielded, or worn, making them much easier to carry and conceal.
You also gain the ability to craft the soul of a creature into a physical object, replacing the materials normally required with the soul of the creature. The stronger the creature was in life, the stronger the soul, the more material it can substitute for, and it may even possess unique properties based on the creature the soul came from."
300,Student of Autochthon,Exalted – First Age,"Let us be perfectly clear on one point. If you wish merely to be an engineer who works with divine components or a miraculous craftsman, your innate qualifications as an Exalted are more than sufficient to justify such advantages in your past. This is not for the average demigod craftsman who merely wishes to study at leading academies in the First Age, mentor under other Exalted who have built floating palaces and square circles, oh no.
With this, at some point in your life you undertook a comprehensive apprenticeship with Autochthon, the Primordial who built the paradigm of technology and artifice into the fabric of the universe itself at the dawn of time.
Among other things your knowledge of Primordial metaphysics and spiritual makeup is nearly unrivalled among the Chosen, and you know more than anyone about the weaknesses of your ancient enemies...as well as how one might emulate or take advantage of their imprisoned selves, like how to transform the Silver Forest’s fetich into an Essence-magnifying mirror. This includes a great deal of insight into the nature of the soul and it’s derivatives, and how one might tamper with or alter it into something fundamentally different. Your true genius lies in the emergent field of Shaping technology: Magitech dedicated to directly alter reality. By now, many Exalted take for granted the engines that shape more of Creation from the Wyld-but you could build one capable of constructing a custom-tailored paradise from it instead, or given more time and resources build weapons powerful enough to wipe the stars from the sky. And while nobody has figured out how to fully harness the power of a protoshinmaic vortex or fully stabilise a Vault of Woven Dreams into an recursive pocket reality, for you it’s only a matter of time to succeed in those accomplishments. Your Charms may make you formidable, but your mind and it’s knowledge is a miracle in its own right."
300,That Undefinable Thing,Tales of Symphonia,"Even if you can't describe it, you can still manipulate it. You can now make physical tools and containers for souls, as well as gaining the knowledge of how to use the soul as a power source for magic, machinery, and living bodies. Given proper resources (raw souls), you can create Exspheres and Key Crests which can then power the things mentioned in your place. Anything powered by their user's soul is known intimately to them, inhabited by the soul the same way a body is inhabited by a soul. It becomes in all ways an extension of the self, for good or ill. While the soul is infinite, it can be diminished and grown. Take care."
300,Upgrade,Generic Enchanter,"You have the ability to focus on a target in order to perceive each and every quality of that target listed within your mind without the flow of information overwhelming you. Each and every one of these qualities can have power funneled into them in order to improve on them, proportional to the amount of power invested into the improvement. However, the greater the quality already is and the more the target has been upgraded already, the more energy intensive it is to improve on the quality. This does not impart any skills or improve on a skill, but can be used on any other quality of the target. You are a viable target for this effect."
400,Alchemical Knowledge​,The Witcher Novels,"Alchemy is a key part of a Witcher’s toolset; witchers are masters of crafting not only potions to further enhance their superhuman abilities but also bombs, weapon oils and other chemical contraptions. In future worlds you will be just as capable at creating analogies of these mixtures as you are at creating those found within this world. Just remember that certain alchemical creations are ​not for the consumption of the standard populace. Who knows if that poor woman will be cured of her ailment by the use of a witcher’s brew; she might get better, or ​much worse."
400,And Yet It Moves,Unsong,"Lesser kabbalists may speak and write the Names of God to work miracles, but such wonders are as transient sparks in the night.
You can create lasting miracles; by expanding any Names you know into extended prayers, magic squares, word squares, and similar constructions, you can work them into artifacts. This is not easy — it takes an intelligent expert to write a prayer that will do what he wants, especially for complex and/or industrial applications, and only more so for longer Names — but it does allow the effects of the Name to be deployed in a controlled manner, repeatedly or continuously.
This ability doesn’t just apply to the Names of God, if you know them, but also to all forms of magic and spellcasting you know with verbal, written, and/or linguistic components."
400,Blood of Gold,Full Metal Alchemist,"You’re one of the few people that have a talent for Alchemy that can almost be described as simply genius. Like the Elric Brothers, you are the kind of Alchemical prodigy that learns and understands Alchemy like it’s a second Nature. You draw perfect transmutation circles, learn alchemical knowledge adults need months for when you were a child, and could even teach yourself basic alchemy through nothing but books and studying. You also gain a similar talent to other scientific fields of study."
400,Brews and Engines,Silmarillion SB,"Perhaps from the tutelage of Sauron, orcs have a strange affinity with artifice. They don’t make the beautiful and enchanted artefacts of the elves, but their crafts are nonetheless effective. You are now skilled in all manner of orc-crafts, from their crude but effective metallurgy to their stoneworking to their brewery. Under your direction, ugly but effective fortifications can be quickly reared from the earth, and engines built to help great smitheries pound out blade after blade. You know how to build siege-engines and mechanisms of war that seem more like moving fortresses than mere assault equipment, as well as how to organise farmland, mines and tributary caravans to feed and equip great hordes – though with little regard for the ones who grow the food itself, unless you work in their concerns as well. Overall, your skills are well-suited to outfitting large groups quickly - but with enough time and workers, you could raise a fortress to equal Angband, equip your armies in.
Finally, you have skill in the alchemies of orc-kind. You can produce a wide variety of medicines, brews and poisons with potent effects. From salves which cause wounds to quickly heal, though with scarring, to deadly poisons to liquors which banish pain and give bursts of energy and vitality to the drinker, you are capable of making all manner of useful potions and poultices."
400,Captivator,Kill 6 Billion Demons,"Unbound Devils, for as dangerous as they are, are used to fuel and enhance many kinds of machinery, like Prime Angel Shells or Airship engines. You are skilled in this area, being able to bind Devils or other eldritch beings into objects, and have then enhance said object."
400,Citrinitas,Lords of the Night - Zombies,"You can now create alchemical engines like your own Kindling flame, a physical transformation that establishes an immaterial alchemical flame inside something that then fuels further transformations. This can be used to create constructs or solid state systems that behave like mechanical systems. Yes, there are mechanical computers, and yes, such systems can be impossibly good - the alchemical equivalent of a clockwork soldier. This perk explicitly plays well with other creation and crafting abilities you have, including Albedo. The Alchemical Flames these engines are built out of are fueled by Silver, Gold, and the very fires of life. Corpus works too. It may be possible to work with other supernatural fuels, but unless it's something like the power cosmic or Quintessence, it will require significant work to adapt."
400,Crested,Fate/Grand Order,"The Magic Crest, to the ordinary magus, is the crystallization of all their bloodline has worked for. A sigil formed of magic circuits that collects all their knowledge and spells into one person who acts as the bloodline heir. But the truth is a lot more sinister. Of all the magic crests in the world, 72 of them are in fact Demon Gods in sleep, placed there by a Beast named Goetia in preparation for a great plan. You know how to perform this same act, turning living beings into Magic Crests that can be passed down through family lines before activating at your whim, converting the holder back into the original being or releasing that being separate from the holder once more. During the time that they serve as Magic Crests, they can provide magical circuits equal in power to whatever magical power they had originally and prevent their holders from committing suicide, rendering them unable of consciously carrying out such acts."
400,Death Begets Pain Begets Creation,Exalted – The Abyssals,"The Essence of the Neverborn can harness the miracle of death to reactivate once-living organs with a hungry animation. A bloodless heart beats. A disembodied hand grasps and claws. Neglected corpses rise from their graves, craving the flesh of the living. Such reanimated creations are not restricted to the narrow medical patterns of life. A living being with no heart in her chest falls limp and useless, but the same creature reanimated can move and fight and kill. So made independent from the biological weaknesses of life, undead are not restricted to living or even organic parts. An iron ribcage is stronger than a bone one. In these violent times, swords are often more useful than hands to wield them.
From this understanding comes the field of building and maintaining creatures, built of dead and inorganic parts, the art and science called necrotech. Craftsmen who study and perfect necrotech are known as necrosurgeons. Knowledge lies at the heart of necrotech.
Necrosurgeons must learn through observation and experimentation. They make progress through scientific investigation and deduction. Yet necrotech is also the highest of arts. When mortals run in panic from the spiked monstrosity with a hundred screaming faces, they know the glory of the Void. For this reason, most necrosurgeons take great pride in the hideous beauty of their creations.
As an expert necrosurgeon, you have a firm grasp of the science of necrotech, and the mundane skills in medicine and crafting that underlie it. You may create meat puppets and bonestriders, yoroi ogres and exoskeletons of bone and metal, and you could just as easily practise more standard medicine or forge weaponry. But you have a possibly even greater mastery of necrotech as an art, allowing you to create things of macabre beauty and exquisite hideousness. Delicate constructs of bone-clockwork, beautiful youths perfectly preserved and turned into bladed weapon-champions, or the horrific mother of suffering. Whether you wish to evoke beauty or horror, you have the skills to do both. And the aptitude to apply this slant of the gothic and the horrific to all your other creations besides."
400,Divine Child – Hephaestus,Riordanverse - Percy Jackson,"You are the direct child of a god of your associated pantheon and gain various benefits from this. You gain lesser manifestations of your parent's domains as well as generally being better than an ordinary mortal. You may take most any god as your parent but to take one of the heads of a pantheon as a parent you must take the ""Fate finds you interesting"" drawback receiving no points for it (you can also do this with a lesser god to get greater powers). Generally this will give you insight into and some control over your divine parent's domains, a son of Poseidon for example can control water and ships, talk to horses, cause minor earthquakes and is empowered within water."
400,Doctor of Death,Fate/Legends: Oasis of Fantasy,"The techniques of the Hashashin leaders are sourced through the modification of their own beings. The body and even the mind or spirit becomes subject to all kinds of gruesome experiments in their pursuit of power and the ability to deal death on a higher level. Beyond just knowing one of their techniques, you are aware of the methods to create such techniques, though your studies have taught you the general tools and processes rather than the specific methods to the powers of the Hashashin. You have the skill and ability to mould the bodies, minds and spirits of other beings in order to grant special abilities. This can be as simple as grafting the limbs of demons to human bodies and having them work to as complex as separating out the alternate personalities within a madman’s head to allow him to summon them as separate beings in reality.
Your skills with the alteration of the form also extend to other uses, such as practical healing and medicine, brainwashing or therapy, even creating your own monsters instead of altering the bodies of existing beasts. Most bodies however, have a limit on what you can do with them. As impressive as what you can do is, a human body can rarely take more than one or two major alterations before it ceases to function properly. Perhaps in time you could discover how to extend those mortal limitations."
400,Doors that lead elsewhere,Dungeon Keeper,"Magically speaking, here and there are rather relative concepts, so why not take the easy route and build a dungeon that's here, there, and a little bit of somewhere else? While one cannot breach hellish boundaries with mere stonework, an auspicious floorplan can evoke the environments of other worlds through well-established principles of magical sympathy. If built precisely, the barriers between dimensions can become thin indeed within your dungeon, making summoning, teleportation and other exercises in dimensional manipulation almost effortless...and much more hazardous for your enemies, their own such spells at the risk of going awry in the worst ways and possibly drawing the ire of things best left undisturbed."
400,Emotional Storms,Exalted – The Infernals,"Most forms of precipitation and rain in the Demon City derive from the Yozi called Hegra, the Typhoon of Nightmares. She collects the constant fog of dreams that rises from Creation and condenses them into her clouds, to dispense them to the rest of the Demon City.
Sometimes, she lashes the terrain beneath her with cold sweat from victims of night terrors. Sometimes, she sends erotic cloudbursts or blizzards of fancy. Anyone who touches her rain and snow, sleet and hail feels the emotions and perceives the visions of Creation’s dreamers.
So too, may you now infuse your works with emotion and dreams, that all who drink from your hand, all who look upon your works, all who read you writing, all who hear your voice and more besides are affected by the emotions you choose to infuse. Delirious passions, mad fear, and ever-changing visions are yours to grant to all you wish. Such is the strength of these moods and visions that you could drive mortals mad with them, if you are not careful. Though those of stronger make, like demons, will delight in them and revel in the exquisite experience."
400,Gifts of Yavanna,Silmarillion SB,"Though the Noldor are acknowledged as the greatest craftsmen amongst the elves, the Sindar have their own skills. The Noldor may have learned from Aulë in Valinor, but the Sindar spent many long years learning the secrets of his spouse’s creations.
You are a master of all manner of crafts and trades which deal with the natural world and the products thereof; you are a master farmer and cultivator, a herbalist, husbandman and carpenter. You can build wondrous things of wood and weave magnificent tapestries or clothes from plant or animal fibres. Furthermore, you have the skill to ensure that what you build exists in harmony with the natural world, enhancing and beautifying it, rather than destroying it. You can cultivate groves of fruiting trees and sunny glades of grain without having to clear the forests to make way for ‘productive’ land, build cities into the crowns of great trees to fill the canopy with light and song without disrupting the paths of animals across the forest floor, or build sanitation systems that make use of the roots of plants and beds of marsh-plants to purify and make use of waste. Part of this includes making it so that your creations can visibly blend into the natural world, often making it difficult to tell where nature ends and craft begins - or to find you or your people, if they don’t want to be found.
Furthermore, your understanding of the natural world enhances any use of magic with regards to animals, plants or the wilderness. Your Sanwe-Latya allows you to communicate with, understand and tame animals, while your Songs of Power can easily lay enchantments on your lands, such as causing animals to avoid your grain-glades, the stars to glimmer like jewels in the branches, or causing trees to grow as you would wish them to."
400,Golemancy,Unmodded Minecraft,"You've made inroads into the practice of creating golems, since the usual 'pumpkin on a T-body of iron blocks' won't work after you leave this jump. You aren't limited to working with iron, or even bipedal humanoid forms, and with time and effort you might discover how to program your creations with far more complex commands then 'wander around and punch these things.'"
400,Hermetic Alchemy,Ars Magica,"You may extract vis from magical auras, with the amount collected proportional to your magical ability and the strength of the aura. You may only extract vim vis this way, useful for metamagic or any spells that affect other magics directly, such as dispel or counterspell effects.
Hermetic mages are trained in this technique, and instead gain the knowledge of how to extract vis of any type from a magical aura. They also gain the ability to create automated magical devices that extract vis with minimal maintenance."
400,Lack of Materials,God of War,"Times are tough in this land. Forces beyond knowing, monsters that roam the lands, and gods who are as petty as they are powerful. With chaos such as this, there are times you may not be able to get everything that you need. But you've learned to make do. You can get the most out of your materials, using two bars of metal where you might need four, or three hides when you need six. Of course, if you DO have all the materials required you can use them to make your creations more effective in quality and capability as well. So maybe it doesn't hurt to put the extra mile in."
400,Legacy,Ravenwood,"In this strange plane of existence, things sometimes take on traits they were never meant to take, a spark of something greater. You gain the ability to imbue a spark within an object, even immaterial ones such as songs, that allow it to build up, or awaken, a legacy. If such an item is used for a feat, it will gain a property based on that feat. A pair of boots used to run the length of a country to bring important news may gain a property to increase the speed of the one wearing them in some minor way. A shield used to block the fire breath of a dragon may develop the power to resist flames, and impart that resistance to its wielder. Even simply using the item for its intended purpose will make it ever so slightly better for that purpose, such as a sword growing sharper or armor growing more durable, though it could take years to accumulate a noticeable effect in this way. These legacy abilities may be fairly weak on their own, but they stack up over time, with greater feats giving greater improvements (Note: You are not required to perform said feats. Anyone using the item may build on the legacy abilities). Using this ability on an item that has already accomplished great feats grants these same abilities, only stronger based on the time since those feats were performed, retroactively."
400,Magical Specializations,Riordanverse - Kane Chronicles,"The true worth of every magician is their path specialization. You have come to possess knowledge, you have a few years of training in a path specialization of your choice, enough to make you an expert though you are still many years from being a master. A list of canon specializations will be at the notes section at the bottom of the jump. This perk can be taken multiple times."
400,Master of Craft,Silmarillion SB,"Of all the peoples of Middle-Earth besides (maybe) the Noldor, the dwarves are most renowned for their crafts. With this perk, you become a master of two of the following crafts. This perk may be purchased multiple times.
Smithing: You are a master smith, able to forge arms, armour and other things of metal that, although not magical, could stand as prizes of a king’s collection both for their beauty and their function. Armour you forge fits close and protects its wearer, while at the same time making them a figure of terror and awe on the battlefield. An axe wrought under your hand will cleave a thousand orc-necks before it chips. Were you to raise an iron-banded gate, the stone around it would fall before it shattered, save before black spells of ruin.
Delving: You are a master miner and delver, able both to hunt out and extract veins of valuable ores, minerals and gems, and to build great subterranean constructions. You know how to build underground halls and tunnels so they won’t collapse, how to keep flooding and lack of air from being problems, and how to plan ahead for new expansions. This is the art which opened the vast halls of Moria and Erebor, andwhich formed the foundation of the wealth of the dwarves.
Masonry: You are a sculptor, an architect and a mason, with the knowledge and skill to raise great fortresses, to turn loose stone into sturdy fortifications and to build statues which proclaim the eternal glory of your people like stone giants hewn from the very mountainside. A fortress built with your skill and under your direction - and in the proper place - would break armies like a rock breaks waves.
Engineering: A wide-reaching skillset, you possess the knowledge of the mechanical wonders of the dwarves, from wind-up toys and mechanical harps to the great water-wheels which drive hammers larger than a man, or the devices which can open a dwarf-hold’s doors with the lightest touch or hold them shut against a thousand hands. Fireworks, gear-assemblies and more are within your knowledge."
400,Multi-Faceted Exalted Demiurge,Exalted – The Alchemicals,"The secrets of the Alchemical Exaltation are granted only to the chosen Demiurges of the Autochthon and no other. Not even the Alchemical Champions or the Solar Host are privy to the secrets of their creation. Normally, in the creation of an Alchemical you need five Demiurges, each privy to merely one-fifth of the Exaltation process and imbued with the Autochthons power bound only to that specific step. Such precautions were taken to prevent the betrayal of his children, such was the Great Maker’s fear, anger and wisdom. You are not from this realm however, and are not at fault for the sins of the mortals, gods, and chosen of Creation.
A mortal mind may only be able to understand one step of the Alchemical Exaltation process but what of the Chosen. They perhaps could understand far more and so you shall. I can grant you a spark of the Autochthons primordial energy with which you can enact the miracle of Alchemical Exaltation. You will be able to understand and initiate the entire process and even innovate on it. If you were to find new Magical Metals in your travels it might be possible to create new castes of Alchemical with their own unique qualities and traits.
It might even be possible to not merely use the soul gems of the dead but to be able touplift the living like that of other Celestial Exaltations. Sufficiently advanced automatons or heroic individuals will be able to be converted into Alchemicals, however they may not be suitable to all castes, but the invention of instruments to determine their compatibility with a Magical Material would not be difficult given the wisdom that the Autochthon has seen fit to grant you.
Note: this does connect with capstone boosted Mind of the Sun effectively acting as some notes and advice on how to make Exaltations other than Alchemical."
400,My Home is my Castle,Fate/Zero,"Every wizard has their towers. And a tower is nothing without proper fortifications. When it comes to shields, wards, forts, walls or any other sort of purely defensive magic, you’re the best around. Your spells are stronger, cheaper, faster to cast and best of all, they stick around quite a lot longer than they normally would. But stationary fortifications are where you truly come into your own. As long as the spells do not move from their position, such as by being cast on a person or item, but instead on a castle or home, all the previous effects will be far greater in nature. Simple shield spells will deflect high powered rifles with ease, you’ll be able to cast tens where you could only cast a half dozen, incantations would take a fraction of the time and your work would almost last till it was destroyed in combat, at the very least surviving dozens of times longer than normal."
400,Natural Magic,Ravenwood,"People are not the only things afflicted with the corruptive influence of the Demiplane, the trees, the stone, the metal, everything possesses some degree of taint from this cursed plane of existence. And now you can use that to your advantage. You possess an innate understanding towards the mystical properties of nearly all materials within (and outside) the Demiplane, and how to shape them. By cutting gems, forming metal, grinding stone, and putting all the disparate pieces together, you can create artificial spell matrices that naturally generate and collect magical energies and can shape them into spell effects. While not often the prettiest things around, these artifacts are capable of granting magic to even the uninitiated. However, it takes precise craftsmanship and extensive design periods to make even basic items.
This perk also extends to the creation of potions. These are much simpler to create compared to artifacts, requiring only the right herbs, water, and a catalyst of magical energy, which can be provided by even the most basic of spell matrices. Additionally, any similar skills in future jumps, can be replicated with study using this perk."
400,Onmyouji,Fate/Legends: Land of the Rising Sun,"Among the most structured and ancient styles of magic in Japan is the Onmoyuji’s work. This Japanese magecraft is a mix of science and occultism, containing both many ordinary spellworkings but focusing primarily on working with tools and charms. Most famous are the paper charms and familiars that a Onymouji can easily create, imbuing them with magic long term to achieve a wide variety of goals. Wards, enchantment or cursing of others, creating powerful Shikigami warriors and more. You are a master of these arts, with a above average amount of magical energy to channel into them. However, an Onmyouji finds that raw power is worth less than skill and materials, as you can potentially do battle and seal even a great youkai like Tamamo no Mae despite lacking in power with the right set up. Onmyoudo performs superbly well with preparation, seeing rituals of incredible power becoming much easier than many other magecraft forms.
In particular, you are familiar with the secret technique of Life Continuation. With this, you are able to engrave your very being onto your Shikigami, making them as much a part of you as your original body. Your human form being destroyed hardly matters when a thousand paper familiars hold your essence still, allowing you to control them all at once."
400,Renewal,Age of Wonders II,"Wounds can be mended, cities can be rebuilt. Even the lands tainted by death magics or burnt by fire can be restored, seeded with crops and forests until life flourishes anew. Life magic embodies this ideal, holding the power to endure, to undo all harms and ease all woes. Your spells and abilities are infused with this power, and it is impossible to corrupt or twist them against their purpose. Furthermore, although your magics are now more difficult to suppress or destroy, if your enchantments are only partially broken they will slowly restore themselves to their full potential, their own magical natures healing as surely as more physical wounds."
400,Rune-Scribe,Earthsea,"You have learned not only the letters of the runic alphabet used in the Archipelago, but also the True Runes of the Old Speech. With this, you can anchor your spells to last for far, far longer, endowing objects with blessings and supernatural properties which last indefinitely, or until the rune is broken. Even then, such magic can be repaired if the runes are repaired.
Beyond this jump, this Perk allows you to use any verbal or vocal magic with writing as well; you’ll have to discover the right characters and symbols to use, but once you do a new world of possibilities will be open to you."
400,Runes,Viking Saga,"You may use runes to empower objects and create strange and wonderful effects. They are an alphabet that when combined creates their effects, your skill at carving them increases their power and ability."
400,Shatterglass,Circle of Magic,"Magic is a rare and complex thing. One that happens in a flash, and then disappears forever. It is for this reason that mages enchant objects, storing their spells in a tangible container for later use. You have learned this technique, but have also improved upon it. With your understanding of magic and cooperation with others, you are able to store spells and mystical phenomena for later use. Using a prepared portion of your mages kit, you may store any spell you can cast within it ahead of time, and unleash it later, discharging and releasing the spell into the world, leaving the prepared object inert. Additionally by working your magic in concert with other mages, you are similarly able to store the spells they may cast as well, though this requires a good deal more time and effort on the part of both parties."
400,"Shipwright, Seawright",Silmarillion SB,"The Teleri have dwelt long upon the shores of the great sea, and learned much of its lore.
You are a master shipwright, able to build seagoing vessels whose beauty and grace alone would see them labelled ‘magic’ by most men. They will fly before the wind like birds of the storm, dance over roiling wave-tops and pass without fear through all but the most terrible storms while carrying heavy loads. Above and beyond this ‘mere’ excellence of craft, you know how to weave spells and enchantments into such vessels so that no wind may break their mast, that no rock may shatter the hull, that even the slightest breeze will send them flying fast over the waves, that they may pass unseen by enemy eyes, concealed by fog and rain, while to friends they come like shining stars upon the sea. With enough time and effort, you could build a ship the equal of Vingilot - though the hallowing of it would be beyond you with only this perk.
As well as the arts of ship-building, you are also a master of architecture, particularly buildings of grace and beauty, and structures designed to be built along the sea-shore and to work with water. You could build sea-walls that no wave could ever topple, and hidden havens that an enemy would have to search for years to find, let alone to conquer (so long as there are those willing to defend them, of course). You know spells you can lay into these foundations to hide from evil, and to help give freedom and escape to those within. In a well-ruled city you constructed in this way, none could ever feel constrained or bound against their will, and trade would flow like the very winds of the sea, enriching all."
400,Spiritual Doctor,Fate/Stay Night,"You have gained a Sorcery Trait, a unique aspect or ability of magecraft, known as Spiritual Healing. With this, one can perform surgery on mental or spiritual wounds as if they were physical injuries, using skill in magic and magical energy to heal them. This could allow the user to bring back the mind of someone who has gone insane or to heal damaged Magic Circuits. Beyond just healing, it is possible to use this trait to do other surgical actions, such as transplanting numerous Magic Circuits relatively safely or taking out Command Seals from a Master's body/soul and implanting them in another person. An esoteric technique such as this however, is extremely costly and requires great skill in medical techniques in the first place. Whilst you will never lose this Sorcery Trait from overuse like other users, you will need greater and greater amounts of skill the stranger or more dangerous the surgery you are performing with it."
400,Swordsmith,Fate/Legends: Land of the Rising Sun,"What else shows the spirit of the Japanese but the famed katana blade? Such a central part of their mythos as to have the most famous craftsmen become like heroes themselves. No matter how great, they do not remember the makers of armor or shields like they do artisans of the blade. On the level of legends like Masamune and Muramasa, you are one of these legendary swordsmiths. Even in an ordinary forge with ordinary metals, you can smith katana of a supernatural quality. Edges that split magical steel and blades that don't shatter after a thousand strikes on rock. Often, these even have magical effects if you intend them, such as sharpening as they drink more blood or cutting at a much greater distance than just the physical blade.
Should you have access to tools, materials and even magic of a greater level, you will be able to create far greater weapons. Weapons that bring ruin to armies, that cut castles in two with a single slash, fiery tools that send billowing tides of flame to swallow whole forests. When truly inspired, you can even create things on a divine level, the stuff of legends that only a divinity could normally craft. A sword that splits the fabric of reality itself in two, perhaps.
With time, your talents may be able to be applied to any form of blade, not just Japanese swords. Should you gain magic of your own, you will see that imbuing those effects into your weapons is effortless, even magnifying the potency of your spells greatly beyond what you would normally be able to cast if you place them into the form of a sword."
400,Synergy,Ravenwood,"Wandering the world as you do, you pick up a lot of skills out of curiosity, necessity, or simply through being exposed to it often enough, skills that are often incredibly varied. With such a wide array of skills, finding those that work together could be a difficult prospect, but for you, it just doesn’t seem to be an issue. You have an uncanny ability to get your various powers, abilities, and skills to work together near seamlessly. This would even work for normally incompatible abilities, rare as such things are in this world.
Additionally, with a great deal of effort, it is possible to well and truly combine your abilities and skills to develop something new and greater. This is most effective when combining different energies, creating something with the best qualities of each energy incorporated, though weaknesses not directly countered by another energy are maintained, with the added benefit that the energy is generally stronger, however, it is even possible to, for example, combine several languages into one with supernatural qualities.
This similarly works on your equipment, allowing you to combine their effects with each other and your own abilities and allowing them to work together even when they wouldn’t be able to normally."
400,Technomancer,Kill 6 Billion Demons,"Sometimes, but rarely, magic is used to enhance technology. You possess this odd skill, and with it, you can make some magical technology, like the Glyphosphere of Mammon’s design."
400,The Curving Stream,Age of Wonders II,"Many other Wizards can simply focus on one purpose and need not worry about the nature of their magics. Life Wizards are dedicated to protection, Fire Wizards cause destruction wherever they lay their eyes, and a Death Wizard’s seemingly endless focus on corruption is all well and good - but the power of Water is different. The same rains that batter your foes and flood their lands can nourish your crops and cleanse your allies’ wounds. Transforming your forces to a watery form protects them from harm - while liquefying your enemies leaves terrible wounds. What matters to one who wields the power of Water is not the ‘how?’, it’s the ‘why?’ – making this form of magic surprisingly versatile. Your powers are infused with your very intent – allowing your magics to understand their purpose and easily shift focus depending on changing circumstances. You will never harm a friend with a wayward blast of cold, nor will your forces find hindrance in the flooded marshes that trapped your foes not minutes before their arrival."
400,The Family Art: Alchemy,Fate/Stay Night,"The true wealth of every Magus family is their magecraft specialisation. The discipline of magecraft that they have spent generations researching, studying, experimenting on and utilising. It's your inheritance or perhaps, your spoils of war or thievery. However you came to possess the knowledge, you have a few decades of training in a magic specialisation of your choice, enough to make you an expert, if human, user of the art, something along the lines of Rin with her gems, though you are still many years from being a master."
400,The Flock's Fleece,Actraiser,"Men and women have not wandered the wilds naked since the long-gone days of the Garden. Whether they knew it or not, the act of clothing oneself is one that at once protects and isolates. A shirt or a robe is a metaphorical armor against the elements, against shame and against the prying eyes of others. You are such a skilled craftsman that you can take the 'metaphorical' part out of the equation. You're a one-person clothing creator and tailor, able to take the raw materials of silk, cotton, wool and hide...and then with almost no tools produce wondrous clothing, fitted just right for anyone who dares try the garments on. They're protective vestments against the harsh elements, able to keep people in comfortable condition be they in the deserts of Kasandora or the icy plains of Northwall. Not only that, but people who wear them find that they'll be kept safer from the claws of beasts or the swords of their enemies, acting as a light chain-mail mesh despite being soft and maneuverable fabric."
400,Tree-Herds,Silmarillion SB,"The ents are named ‘shepherds of the trees’, and you more than live up to that name. In a process half-magic, half-gardening, you can shape lands and ecosystems, working wood and water, stick and stone to create new landscapes. Given an empty plain and long enough, you could grow a forest as dense and strong as Fangorn, or enrich the earth to make it as bountiful as the Shire. This expertise extends from growing living things into transforming the landscape; redirecting rivers, moving hills and other such grand projects.
Or, if you are roused to anger, the use of the environment in war: Directing rivers to wash away cities, preparing cliffs for rock-falls and similar. If you are an ent, your great strength will be very useful in such grand projects, but even if you are not, you still maintain the skill to direct many people together to accomplish similar results.
More than these mundane aspects, however, you also know the secrets of brewing ent-draughts; concentrating the spiritual power of growing things deep in the earth into blessed waters with potent virtues of growth and flourishing. Brewing such draughts requires that you shape landscapes to purpose, it takes time for the power to gather, and it can only be done in intensely verdant lands. Once the labour is complete, though, there will come forth springs of these potent waters, able to give especial strength, vitality, growth and endurance to those who drink them, and to sustain people even without ordinary food."
400,Unconquered,Exalted – The Solars,"The ultimate truth of the Sun is that it will always rise again in the morning, and set again in night, then rise again. It is the eternal Daystar, the flame that brings light to all of Creation and banishes the darkness. The Solar Exalted embody this, being able to take any skill and wield it with the light of perfection. Your Exaltation burns bright with this truth, and you now possess a shard of the absolute light belonging to its progenitor that allows it to manifest - your spiritual energies, Essence included, will quickly grow and replenish at a quickened rate, letting you keep up even as other Exalts would have exhausted their resources. Just as well, your light banishes all attempts to erase or deny your existence and that of the area around you - the only things that will alter your body or being, or shape your immediate environment is what you permit, though you and what is around you may still be wounded by force or destruction."
400,Vitriolic Craftsman,Exalted – The Infernals,"The artifacts of Malfeas differ on a fundamental level from those of Creation, and as such Infernal artisans have devised many techniques to create these infernal relics. The making of such artifacts requires the pure form of the dark and acrid liquid known as vitriol, and the binding of demons into these relics, dissolving their forms and integrating their still-living Essences into their creation.
Under an infernal artisan’s ministrations, pure vitriol serves as a catalyst. Objects bathed in it are seared free of weakness, making them as strong as any of Creation’s magical materials; component parts flow together and intermingle, amalgamating into a unified whole. Where an artificer in Creation would spend months carving and shaping an artifact’s components, his Malfean counterpart immerses them in vitriol and guides their slow, inextricable melding.Then, one slowly integrates the dissolved form of a living demon, known as Chalcanth or Azoth depending on their power, into the device’s nascent structure. A demon must be of sufficient stature to match the power of a relic in order to bond with it, and likewise must its nature also accord with the relic’s function if the procedure is to succeed.
Now you too will join the ranks of hell's greatest artisans, with knowledge and skill that encompasses vitriol itself, the acids and catalysts derived from it and its use in the crafting of infernal relics. Your knowledge encompasses much understanding of demonic Essence, as well as the instinctive ability to use the appropriate mundane crafts to use together with vitriol as the catalyst. Bonding the Chalcanth to a Brass blade of your own design shall be a labor almost considered easy to an craftsman of your skill. Likewise the arts of demonic magitechnology and the creation and modification of life through vitalizing essence are known and practised by you, though their applications are somewhat more complex.
As one of Hell’s master artisans you may even surpass the limitations of the dull and feeble demonic essence contained within your creations, to instill them with a demonic will as a true Hellforged wonder with its own intellect and awakened essence."
400,Worker of Wonders,Irish Mythology,"You can work more than mere metal. Jewels, cloth and rare materials. You could string a rainbow, or sharpen a fair maiden’s sigh until it could literally cut to the heart of a man through any armor, weave a cloak from shadows and other miraculous crafts."
500,Demiurge,Kill 6 Billion Demons,"There are currently 8 Demiurges in the entire multiverse: Allison, and the Seven. Well, it looks like there are now 9, with you getting in. This power manifests as a glowing white dot on your forehead. While it can be covered, it otherwise can’t be hidden or gotten rid of. At will, you may also manifest a halo above your head, and beyond having to look kinda like a halo, you get to choose how it looks. This power, access to the Key of Kings, grants you many abilities. First, you are able to do stuff like summon phantasms of gods to fight for you, have clones made up of white energy split from your body and attack your enemies, teleport, and more. Additionally, you know one of the words of the Seven Part Name, YISUN’s true name. By saying this word, you damage reality itself, and even killing those of weak will. Finally, you can also loan some of your power to your followers. How strong these powers you give them depends on how much power of your own you sacrifice, but these blessings can be pulled back to you at no cost, and making your power whole again. You can also make your Emissaries, the people who have been granted power by you, have their mind twisted to your goals, though those with strong will can fight against this, even defeat your corruption. The Key you get is equal to Allison’s/Zoss’s, though you have to learn how to use it. The downside to this power, is that anyone that sees your Key and knows what it is, they probably want to steal it for themselves. And if it is taken out of your head, you fall unconscious and take a ton of damage and pain, regardless of any power you have. Post-jump, you may choose to hide the Key, revealing no outward signs of it."
500,Of the Elder Blood,The Witcher Novels,"It appears that you are an unaccounted for relative of Ciri, by way of Laura Dorren, being an active carrier of the Elder Blood, as it seems that you can travel in the local multiverse; from shifting through time and space to crossing through worlds like stepping through a door, though your control over your ability is rather crude and in dire need of training before it becomes useful. But be wary, refining such a gift is a dangerous process, for the worlds are filled not just with wonders but horrors as well - how else do you think the monsters that witchers hunt appeared, other than when the worlds collided long ago?"
500,Titan's Blood,God of War,"What a curious thing you are, to have become such a thing. One of your ancestors was a Titan, a primordial being of great power and ability that was responsible with shaping the world as it is. You are not full-blooded, but the effects have been prevalent on you nonetheless; your size may be increased up to fifteen meters in height, with your strength as such that you could throw pieces of buildings one-handed at your enemies. You may also choose one Titan you are a descendent from, gaining aesthetic appearance changes similar to them. But more importantly, you may relax yourself and 'commune' with the world and nature around you; by opening your mind to the world you can learn about it and its secrets quite quickly, along with finding what is the largest threat to the balance of nature. You are of the planet, child. It is your birthright to know these things."
500,Unliving Transition,Ravenwood,"There is a bit of an oddity for those that come to the Demiplane while on the brink of death, returning to health and becoming something between alive, dead, and undead. These individuals are rare, infused with excesses in vital essence and an efficient life force, rendering them ageless as simply living doesn’t seem to cause their life force to reduce in any way. Such individuals are known as the unliving, and you count yourself among their number.
The benefits of this state grant you improved stamina, an immunity to poison and disease, and removes your need to eat, drink, sleep, and breathe, though you may still indulge in such if you choose to do so. Indulging in such things has the benefit of regenerating your life force. While this won’t expand how much life force you have, it will allow you to recover lost life force, up to the most you’ve had in your lifetime, and will do so fairly quickly. A week of eating, drinking, sleeping, and breathing like a normal person could regenerate nearly a month’s worth of life force.
Finally, this perk acts as a capstone booster for any 600cp perks, the benefits in the notes section."
600,A Price to be Paid,Dungeon Keeper Ami,"The dark gods accept only sacrifices as currency and do not suffer failure well, though sometimes failure is inevitable. As such you may find yourself running afoul of them in your time here, fear not jumper for the price of lives and souls demanded upon you need not be paid in full. With this you can take the life energies of others sucking away their very vitality, this is completely harmless in small amounts and even a large draw is more likely to put the target to sleep than kill them. The energy gained in this way has many uses as it is refined life energy and as such can stand in as payment for anything that normally would require lives and souls. As if that were not useful enough this energy can also be used to power various spells and even harm fully incorporeal targets."
600,Aetheric Harmony,Aion,"There are many kinds of magic in this world.
Indeed, there are many kinds of magic throughout the multiverse. All similar in that they let people tap into the energy of higher planes of existence, and yet different in application. There are those who spend thousands of years studying them, and barely scratch the surface of the potential knowledge that is the supernatural.
By taking this Perk, you will be granted a powerful tool to help you in your quest for understanding.
First: You will gain great insight into the nature of any magic you observe, which is increased even more should you be able to wield or interact directly with it.
Second: You can now convert one type of supernatural power into another. This means you could (for example) turn Exalted’s essence into Tamriel’s magicka or Naruto’s chakra. This will require a bit of practice at-first, and somewhat wasteful; but with time and effort will become second-nature and relatively efficient in its use.
Third: You’ll find that you can almost always convert your skills with one system of supernatural abilities to work with another. Adapting Potterverse-style spells into in the framework of Tamriel’s magicka or Exalted’s supernatural martial-arts into Street Fighter should prove relatively easy; Trying to convert the sophisticated magi-tech system of Lyrical Nanoha into the significantly-softer magic of the Dresden-verse might prove a bit more difficult, but you should be able to make something similar with a bit of effort (maybe using runes or something).
Lastly: Whenever you learn a new type of magic, your understanding of other magics will become... greater somehow; like the more you learn about magic in-general, the greater you become at all magics. With enough time and effort, you may one day develop a unified magical theory. What that might lead to... Well, perhaps it’s better that you find out on your own."
600,Applied Kabbalah,Unsong,"You have seen beyond worldly magic into the higher realm of Yetzirah, granting you the potential for many abilities. As a dream-world beyond true space, Yetzirah is a medium of powerful teleportation; as a realm of pure meaning, it facilitates potent telepathy. More significantly, through Yetzirah, you can modify reality as if it were literally made of words, symbols, and semiotics. Nouns, verbs, and adjectives can be broken down into letters in various languages and reconstructed, and new words and letters can even be written into reality.
This semantic magic largely enforces outcomes and narratives, and supplements your own abilities, but it can be used in ‘flashier’ ways, bordering on reality warping: it has been used to manipulate the weather, invoke the holy and unholy, buff and debuff, preserve and destroy, invoke the spirits of the dead, and more. The applications are potentially limitless in number, only bounded by your own skill at wordplay and the exertion of your own will across Yetzirah.
As a boon for purchasing this perk instead of learning the magic yourself, you can also perceive the spiritual, metaphorical, and abstract dimensions of other settings, and act on them to create similar downstream effects in material reality."
600,Bigger is Always Better,Warhammer Fantasy - Tomb Kings,"You're a true visionary, even amongst the most celebrated of your peers your creations would be known as truly awe-inspiring things. Grace, realism, detail, you are almost unsurpassed in all areas. But you have a certain specialisation, one more suited for a Necrotect than any other. The bigger it is, the more complex it is, the easier it is for you to make it. The larger the tomb and more intricate its design, the less time it takes for you to have fully working plans drawn up. Even the actual construction becomes easier in the same way, with larger and larger constructions seeming to be more and more fortunate. Extra supplies turn up out of nowhere, the slaves are in perpetual good moods and shortcuts tha cut time and resources needed without lowering quality are found aplenty."
600,Blood of the Pharaoh,Riordanverse - Kane Chronicles,You are descended from a great member of the Pharaohs of Egypt and thus are extremely powerful magic wise and are favored by the gods as hosts. Anyone who has the blood of the pharaohs has the right to become the Pharaoh of the House of Life. This is a capstone boost to all 600 CP perks
600,Bonds Of Fate,Fate/Stay Night,"Finally revealed, the secrets and knowledge to the Einzbern's Homunculi creation methods. It's all yours. From the way to turn natural children into basic Homunculi to creating flawless versions of the super Homunculi such as Ilyasviel herself, you've gained not only the knowledge but also the expertise in medicine, surgery and Alchemy focusing on life creation to actually carry out the process entirely on your own. Beyond mere skill, your creations, when they be living beings, seem to be better than those of any other peer on a fundamental level. Life you bring into being with your magics and sciences, from this world or any other, is stronger, faster, and smarter and so on then it would normally be. You could possibly focus this into one area or spread it out even more generally with some work. Taking The Family Art in Alchemy on top of this would push your Homunculi beyond even what the Einzbern family achieved.
Capstone Boost: Bonds Of Fate has now given you the ability to create dual natured beings. Specifically, these are living beings that can turn into items and vice versa. By crafting an item at the same time as creating a life form, artificial or not, you may combine them and allow that being to transform into the item at will, as well as to retain their aware minds whilst they are in item form. Unlike the case of Leysritt, there is no need to have the living being be of sufficient power to equal the item but you are limited to one being to one item in these fusions."
600,Celestial Kabbalah,Unsong,"You have a deep understanding of the relationships between higher powers and base reality, the mechanisms that make the intangible tangible. What this means for you is that you can intuitively perceive the operations and organizational forces underpinning the universe around you; this includes conventional physics, but also more abstract forces such as destiny, Adam Kadmon, narrative causality, the operations of any magic systems, and more.
With this deep insight, you can reach into the beating heart and grinding gears of these forces — if you dare — and manipulate them, or even carry out works of truly cosmic engineering. You might hedge out natural law, alter the parameters of a magic system and adjust its limits, rejigger the mechanisms of fate and destiny, or even run your own universe by means of magic or technology.
As a boon for purchasing this perk instead of learning this magic yourself, you will always be treated as having ‘admin’ privileges — at a minimum — within the user hierarchy of any ontological infrastructure or reality implementation system you interact with."
600,Code Creator,Fate/Zero,"Many Magi rarely move beyond their own field of focus when crafting items imbued with magical power. What reason would there be when they could simply pay for another Magi to make something if they absolutely needed it? You're one of these skilled experts that others come to. Obviously in your chosen field, you're one of the great masters in creating magical items, such that something like Volumen Hydrargyrum wouldn't be hard at all, but even when it comes to fields of magic you have no knowledge in at all you can get surprising results. So long as someone with the requisite knowledge is nearby and willing, you can draw on their knowledge of the subject as you work, effectively combining your skills with their knowledge to become a master craftsman in fields that you have no knowledge of.
Capstone Boost: The sorts of things you can draw from those assisting you or willing to offer help has grown beyond just skills, now including abilities and powers that you yourself do not possess or possess at a much lesser level. Whilst you may only use them when you are crafting something and with their permission, you can use any skill, ability, spell or power that they have alongside what you yourself possess to bring your crafting even further beyond what you are normally capable of."
600,Crafts of the High Age,Silmarillion SB,"You are learned in the crafts of the Numenoreans, perhaps a loremaster or a sage among their number. You are an expert in all the skills essential to raising an advanced agricultural and maritime civilization, from farming to water management to city planning to metalworking to carpentry to navigation - and moreover you can teach these skills to those who lack them at twice the normal speed. However, there is a particular craft which you have especial expertise in. Choose two of the following for free. Additional crafts may be chosen for 100 CP each, or 50 CP with a discount.
Shipbuilding: Though your expertise lies more in carpentry than building ironclad ships, by treatments of the wood, metal banding and other methods you can design and, with help from skilled workers, build vessels that can fly across the most treacherous seas like birds skimming clouds, or great ships of war truly worthy of being named Alcarondas - ‘castle of the sea’. You can lay spells upon such ships to ensure good winds save by divine intervention, spells for safe travels and returns and all manner of other enchantments that enhance the voyaging of your vessels, and through a combination of knowledge and spellcraft, perhaps you could even build a vessel capable of sailing the air, rather than only the sea.
Architecture: You are a master architect, capable of planning and building such grand edifices as the gates of Argonath or the ring of Orthanc - provided a large enough workforce, of course. More than this, however, you know spells and magics which can be worked into the stone of such edifices to make them as imperishable as the tower of Orthanc or the walls of Minas Tirith.
Weaponsmithing: You are a master smith of arms and armour, capable of forging artefacts to equal the craft of the dwarves. Moreover, you can weave into your creations subtle spells of bane and striking, so that their attacks hit harder and more precisely, or pierce protective magics on their targets. An example of such spells are those on the blades of Westernesse which Merry used to render the Witch-King of Angmar vulnerable. On the other hand, you also know spells of protection and warding which can be woven into armour and shields, so that they turn aside blows that ought to crush them, protect their wearers from harmful magics or bolster their wearers’ courage and spirit.
Herblore: You are a master of healing, knowing the use of countless medicinal and poisonous plants, and no small amount of surgery either. Though not every wound is within your power to mend, most that other healers would give up for dead can be saved by your expertise, provided you have the appropriate medicines and tools. You could concoct no small number of terrible poisons, either, if you so chose. Furthermore, you know spells of healing which, in combination with your medical expertise, would allow you to counter many curses and magical afflictions, such as that of the Morgul blade with which Frodo would one day be stabbed."
600,Craftsmen of the Gods,Viking Saga,"Things you make yourself from base components gain properties far beyond what they should. Belts that increase strength several times over or a spear that never misses are well within your skill, and you will only get better."
600,Daedalus Student,God of War,"It is one thing to work on forging mere sword and shield, but it is another to create truly marvelous wonders... for a mortal. You could make marvelous wings out of bird feathers and beeswax, capable of granting flight to anyone. Or maybe you wish to create an everchanging Labyrinth, that shifts and alters itself depending on how it moves. Regardless, your architect and forging skills have taken a dramatic increase, to the point where the things you create just may have properties and quality they normally shouldn't have, albeit directed towards the purpose of your creations. Through your works, your will be known... but take care that the gods do not take offense with your work.
Capstone Boost: Your crafting has undergone a dramatic improvement, to the point where you can make incredible works with the strength of an army within them. You have also gleamed into a new type of crafting, and you can forge energy constructs such as Zeus' Lightning to be used in your wishes."
600,Demi-GOD,Aion,"Have you ever noticed in your travels that healing and resurrection magic seem to always involve calling upon a god’s power? Well, as a demi-god yourself, why not cut out the middle-man?
Aside from receiving a fairly-large boost to both the power and finesse of any divine magic you’re capable of performing, you no-longer need to call upon an outside source when using such magics; instead fueling them with the divine spark that resides within you.
With time and practice, you may become a source of divine magic for others to call upon; and eventually, be able to nurture similar sparks in others. The latter will not be easy to accomplish, and will likely take you decades to achieve."
600,Domain Master,Age of Wonders II,"The Cosmos is unending, stretching on to infinity beyond all mortal sight. To understand the vast potential of reality is not to feel insignificant, for everyone is part of the whole. With wisdom, a Wizard of the Cosmos will learn that just as magic ties the world together, so too can your magic be bound to the world instead - vastly expanding their reach. With the correct magical reinforcement, this principle can be used to transform enchantments into variants that are much more costly to maintain, but that operate continually over untold hundreds of square miles: the so-called ‘Domain’ spells. Only a small number of these terrifyingly potent spells are known to Wizards, but you have awakened a potential within you that allows you to develop more of these spells with great ease. You can create a Domain variant of almost any magical effect you know,  with only a moderate amount of study and experimentation. Known examples include spells that slowly alter affected terrain to a type more pleasing to the Wizard, spells that burn, poison or curse all enemies under their effect, as well as the creation of Domains that strengthen summoned servants or that allow all allied forces to move with great speed as if under the effects of a ‘Haste’ spell.
However, do keep in mind that for all the power of Domain enchantments, they are still tied to the Wizard: these effects will only reach as far as your own magical influence reaches. In most cases this means relying on Wizard Towers, with a potential reach of up to a hundred miles or so, but this also means that losing a tower can deprive a large area of the effects until you re-establish your control."
600,Domination,Fate/Stay Night,"It was the Makiri family who created the Command Seal spell that would become so integral to the operation of the Grail Wars. Only the ancient head of that family, Zouken, may still remember how to create new ones, though others have since figured out how to transfer existing ones. Not only can you make new ones as good as Zouken in his prime but you are not limited to creating these for just Servants in the Grail War. Whilst expensive and time consuming to craft, you are able to apply these Command Seals to any target willing, or simply unable to resist, to take them. The wielder of these Command Seals is either yourself or a person of your choice and the bond between the wielder and the target automatically forms. The spells work exactly as they would as if they were the normal set of 3 Seals any Master gets, the only difference being the targets, wielder and number are now chosen by you, as long as you go through the effort of their creation.
Capstone Boost: You have the ability to pre-make Command Seals for later, instant use. The process is the same in time, effort and materials required but once complete, the Seals may be stored on a containing medium such as paper or leather. These may be used by the wielder to boost their own power as if they were on the user’s body or be placed on someone to instantly create a bond between that person and the seal that came into contact with them. For all intents and purposes, this is like you have created a Command Seal linking them to you as the Master in an instant, though the usual limitation of them resisting if they have enough power still exists."
600,"Exalted Ways Dominance: Bureaucracy, Crafting, Linguistics, Lore, Medicine, Occult, Performance​",Generic Exalted,"As one of the Dragon-blooded you were trained from birth to excel in the areas in which you showed talent, and you showed a great many talents indeed.
Choose any seven of the following - War, Melee, Martial Arts, Archery, Thrown, Riding, Sailing, Socializing, Athletics, Awareness, Dodge, Bureaucracy, Crafting, Integrity, Investigation, Larceny, Linguistics, Lore, Medicine, Occult, Performance, Presence, Stealth, Survival, or Resistance. You are now the undisputed master of those seven skills. This is in addition to any skills or abilities you would normally be good at on account of your Caste or 'favored' choices. You can do things with the seven skills you have chosen while half drunk and blind on your worst day that the greatest mortal practitioners would never be able to replicate, even on their best day, in their entire lives.
Additionally you can train anyone that you personally tutor in these seven abilities and they will quickly reach a level of skill close to, but just short of, your own level of skill. They will learn at a rate equivalent to an Exalt so long as you personally teach them, even if they aren't an Exalt.
If you chose Dodge you might one day be able to walk through a rainstorm without getting wet. If you choose Archery you might strike a man’s heart from over the horizon while he is standing in the middle of a forest. If you chose Bureaucracy the sheer efficiency and speed with which your organization operates will baffle even the most astute observers and leave competitors hopelessly scrambling to catch up. Choosing Medicine might allow you to perform brain surgery with a rusty knife using only one hand, and have the patient come out the other side perfectly healthy. Point blank the things you can manage with your chosen skills would be outright impossible for nearly anyone else to replicate, even other Essence users needing to ‘cheat’ and use Charms in order to match what you can do with nothing but your own innate talent. You may purchase this perk up to three times, each time it is purchased you must select different abilities."
600,Forge of Souls,God of War,"The Realm of Hades is plentiful, rife with dark wonders of the ages due to it being a part of the Earth, the ground responsible for wealth and harvest. But more importantly, it is home to the dead. Rivers such as the Acheron and the Phlegethon flow among the souls sentenced here, and whether the souls went to the Fields of Asphodel, Elysium, or the Fields of Punishment depended on their actions. Whether by accident or design, you have found a correlation between the two and have found a concerning art in refining spiritual energy or wayward souls and spirits into ore and metal. This metal is powerful in its own right, not only greatly increasing abilities related to the soul but may even possess a trait or two from the 'donor'. Be wary, for this is a dangerous art in its own right...
Capstone Boost: You find that your conversion ratio is improved, letting you get higher quality metals if you use the same amount of energy or the same materials for less energy used. You have also learned to turn different energies into metal, such as magic or psionic energy."
600,Godling,Riordanverse - Kane Chronicles,"The Path of the Gods involves harnessing a god's power and using it to perform extremely strong feats of magic. You have an advanced understanding of how to connect to a god, channel their power, and execute such feats, as well as how to train others. The magician practices channeling their deity's magic to get better at controlling the flow of power. They then find a go-to spell or magical specialty as the magician and the deity needs a sympathetic bond that needs good chemistry to be truly successful.
Post jump, this magic will allow the magician to channel gods of other worlds and pantheons, and augment other magic systems the same way.
Capstone Boost:  You may merge with your god and find a balance. When you act as the host of a god you are merged into one perfect whole. You have the power, skills, knowledge, etc. of the god while hosting them and are considered a god for the purposes of any magic that might affect mortals adversely."
600,Goibnu,Irish Mythology,"The greatest of the Tuatha smiths, Goibnu could create a spearhead with three strikes of his hammer, and it would be so sharp the man it cut would surely bleed to death. Like this legendary smith, you can forge or assemble anything you’ve the materials for, no matter how complex or intricate, in moments and whatever you forge shall be of mythic quality, whether armor lighter than cloth and harder than a mountain or plows that can turn over ten acres with one pass. Truly you are worthy to be called the smith of the gods."
600,Grandest Arcana,Sword and Sorcery,"Legends and myths are filled with fears of Sorcerers who could smite cities or devastate entire kingdoms, or even those who with effort manage to conjure and bind things that mankind can only call gods. You are one of them. You have an innate and intuitive brilliance that allows you to easily understand and engineer rituals and magical workings on massive scales. Should you have access to the right resources, from powerful artefacts, potent sacrifices, and even the churning machinery of the cosmos itself in the proper alignment of the stars you are capable of rituals that could throw entire lands down in defeat. The demands to successfully perform such works are as great and dangerous as their results and will likely stretch the bounds of even your skill to their limits, but you are one of those few whose might and arrogance might edge closer to the works of gods than that of man. Of course, pride goes before the fall, but such is the price to touch upon true glory."
600,Hard Work Conquering Talent,Fate/Zero,"Talent. Natural aptitude or skill. You either have it or you don’t. Your entire life could be decided at the moment you were conceived. You struggled so desperately to pass this barrier, this unbreakable glass ceiling and somehow, you did the impossible. You became living proof of the value of hard work. When you put in the work, the long hours, you get more out of it than anyone else would. The longer you work at learning something, the better this gets, but it won’t continue forever. You enjoy working in this way, so don’t worry about not having the will to put in that effort. And when you come up against something that only those with talent could do, something limited to those born with it? With enough work, you could match them in that too, no matter what your elders say.
Capstone Boost:  Your hard work has begun to surpass even the limits of humanity, much less the limits of your birth. So long as it is something that can be improved or trained with hard work in the first place, such as physical fitness or skill in magic, there is no practical limit on how far you can train it. However, as with all things, as you get better, it will take longer and longer to see substantial results.
Lords of the Night: 2,100CP"
600,Legacy of Mahal,Silmarillion SB,"Under your hands, the things that you craft are elevated beyond mere skill and into the realms of wonder. You know how to forge mithril into weapons and armour that even the Noldor will wonder at, but you know much more than this. Through the use of runes and the making-magics of your people you can replicate feats such as the creation of the war-masks which struck unnatural fear into those who looked upon them and protected their wearers from the fire of Glaurung, the forging of magical weapons made to be the bane of orcs and dark things, the building of gates and doors hidden from all detection save under special circumstances and more. This mastery of creation goes even beyond things you make alone and into those you cooperate in building; you could create designs for a tower that uses high winds to play music which will echo across a mountain range, or make the walls of a fortress so impenetrable that the siege-engines of Sauron would shatter themselves rather than the walls. Whatever skills you have in building, forging, craftsmanship or artistry, this perk will allow you to put in extra effort and time to elevate them beyond the mundane and into the realms of the magical and wondrous.
Above all, though, you are filled with a profound love of and wonder for creation. Your inspiration is near-boundless, your artistry magnificent, and no matter how long and hard the labour to create something you will never become weary or bored so long as you are bringing new wonders into the world."
600,Master Enchanter,Unmodded Minecraft,"Removing the randomness and ambiguity of the usual process is the least of what you can do. You don't suffer any restrictions when it comes to what kind of item can get what kind of enchantment, so you can fish up treasures with a chain-sickle or empower a shovel to deal massive damage to the undead. Selectively remove or add new effects to an existing magical item, or transfer effects from one item to another. Fuse multiple similar magical items together to make a single, stronger item. While there are limits to how much magic that can be crammed into something, the limit is much higher for you. This skill also covers the creation of space-bending chests that can store far more than their external dimensions should allow for"
600,Mind of the Sun,Exalted – The Solars,"Many speak of the First Age and its lost wonders, forgotten and quietly waiting for the return of their masters. However, far too many fixate on what was and what could have been, instead of looking towards the future, and you are not one who has time to waste rummaging around old ruins for secrets. Your Exaltation holds many of the lost knowledge of crafting and forging great Artifacts, as well as lost sciences of the First Age such as biogenesis.
You begin with the basic knowledge and fluency in Old Realm, as well as mastery of the various sciences and ways of crafting from the First Age, able to forge weapons, warstriders, and other items of legend to add to your own panoply. As a bonus, you know how to substitute magical materials for such items with their mundane equivalents or metals in other worlds - useful in worlds without materials such as orichalum.
Capstone Boost: Contrary to what some of the Solars of the First Age may have believed, the world is not improved by being painted in gold or forged in orichalum. The world is made whole by the sum of its parts, not merely the brightest piece of it. This realization comes with twofold benefits - you are able to attune yourself to any sort of supernatural metal: soulsteel, jade, moonsilver, or even things in other worlds - as though it were orichalum. Just as well, you can easily forge Artifacts with these different metals as well. But this is not all your teachings have discovered - you now understand the necessary principles to build tools and methods that can interact with the higher piece of the soul, even excising a piece of it without killing the subject. In time, you may even find ways to bolster, empower, or strip away elements attached to it, though generating means and power is up to you. If this sounds underwhelming, take note of this - Lytek would likely kill to know what you will eventually set the groundwork for."
600,New Age Necromancer,Dungeon Keeper Ami,"Once upon a time wizards were happy enough being able to raise undead, throw fireballs, and curse their enemies, well those were the old days and this is now. You are a modern wizard, you know the value of a well enchanted suit of armor. You know how to mix enchantments in such a way that things such as moving remote piloted armor suits are a very real possibility that you can make reality, magic powered railroads and three dimensional rune set ups are simply child's play for you, and even something as complicated as creating a gold powered dungeon heart is eventually possible. Though most enchantments are powered by mana you can offset this somewhat in two ways, either by instead binding the souls of the dead to your creations lowering the mana cost considerably the more souls you bind to it or by burning gold to take the place of mana that would be spent if you are squeamish.
Riordanverse: 4,400CP"
600,Old Powers of the Earth,Earthsea,"There are powers in this world older than the magic of wizards, and more terrible than dragons. The demons of the Tombs of Atuan and the creature sealed in the stone of the Terrenon are examples, but there are more. With this perk, you know how to design and build such structures as to imprison and contain such dreadful powers. These structures are not magical in themselves – or, at least, their magic is not as overt as that of wizards – but they can contain magic. Anything which can be brought within can be sealed there regardless of its power, so long as it is of a spiritual nature.
Structures built through this perk are invariably solid, earthen and ominous; common forms are tombs or cellar-chambers. Sealing a creature inside requires luring them within and physically closing the entrance; blocking it with a great stone or similar. Releasing it requires unblocking the entrance. The resources required to create a seal are proportional to the power of the sealed being; a minor demon could be sealed in a well, but a dark god would require an extensive tomb-complex.
Alternatively, you can build structures which invoke or call up spiritual powers, bringing those within to the attention of those beings. This is deeply inadvisable in Earthsea, as most of the Old Powers of the Earth are malicious or at the very least dangerous, but it might be more useful in other worlds for the construction of temples and fanes. In worlds without any such overt spiritual entities to invoke, these structures can instead create a feeling of connection with whatever being to which they are dedicated."
600,Original MK,Fate/Zero,"All people possess an Origin, a concept that lies at the very core of their being and what your Origin takes form as is up to you, though it should take the form of a single word that describes specific concept related to your being. Unlike most people though, you’ve learned to take full advantage of that Origin. Whatever you choose your Origin to be, you are immensely skilled in creating magical items and mystic codes based around that concept. These can range from simple, such as a Fire Origin allowing you to create explosives capable of tearing down large buildings, to the esoteric, such as a Severance/Binding dual Origin allowing one to create bullets that can disrupt and destroy a Magus’ ability to generate and channel magic, potentially crippling it entirely. You also gain the ability to tell at a glance the Origins of other people, this translating into insight into their character that you can use against them.
Capstone Boost: You may now include your Element in the original effects of the perk. Elements work similarly to Origins, but instead dictate the general alignment of a mage. In practice, you may repeat the process of choosing an Origin to gain another concept with which you can create impressive magical items with. Stacking the same concept twice is possible and brings you to the verge of Noble Phantasm quality items in your work. This also extends to the empathic effect, allowing you to recognise the Elements of others on sight and increasing the innate understanding you gain of other beings."
600,Phenomena Operation Principles,Fate/Legends: Oasis of Fantasy,"King Solomon established a worldwide network to allow the use of magecraft for humanity, a stark difference to the Age of Gods that held magic to be the province of the Gods and their kind alone. The phenomena operation technique was this grand working that Solomon accomplished and yet, he never took those principles further. Maybe they were left so that you could do something amazing with them. You have the knowledge, skill and outright potential to create massive magical formations and metaphysical structures, the sort of things that can establish entire systems of magic use for whole worlds, cast spells across entire planets, allow for mass alteration of any target within the field or almost any other imaginable effect that can be ‘programmed’ into these massive area creations. You can create these magical frameworks with surprisingly little energy as well. While it would still take a magician on the level of Solomon himself to create a planet spanning magical framework, even a basic magician of this age could cover a mile diameter framework. Thankfully, the frameworks can be piggybacked off of the World they are linked to in order to prevent you to need to constantly maintain them."
600,Ritualist,Ravenwood,"Ritual magic is an extensive form of arcane practice that allows those using it to accomplish great works even as fairly weak mages. You have gained considerable knowledge, both practical and theoretical, on the workings of ritual magic and, by extension, sacrificial blood magic. This allows you to create far reaching and incredibly powerful spell matrices that can be supplied over time by anyone, or fuelled by the life force of sacrificed creatures or blood. Such spell matrices last much longer than common spells, able to persist for weeks on a single casting. Additionally, each casting can be built up over time, allowing it to be stretched out in small portions that, if interrupted, can be restarted without losing all the progress made on the ritual. Even fast rituals, using sacrifices of life force (from yourself or a suitable sacrifice), can be quite persistent, lasting hours where a similar spell would only survive minutes. This is extensively used by the races of the demiplane to create Rituals of Propagation, complex rituals that can be used to turn humanoids into another race, designated by the ritual design. An individual may undergo multiple such rituals, but may become unstable, either physically or mentally, if too many are done without enough recovery time between such uses, which can take several years. You and your companions will automatically recover at the start of each new jump.
Capstone Boost: The unliving are a rarity among the denizens of the demiplane, often artificially made instead of granted that state by the demiplane itself. This state means you are receptive to other forms of enhancement, this is especially true for those formed from rituals, but will make spells or potions that affect you positively have a noticeable increase in effect. Your life force also has the effect of stabilizing such effects, making them less likely to harm you and allowing you to sustain up to eight such effects indefinitely with absolutely no downsides, though if you want to maintain an 9th effect, you’d have to give up one of the previous ones. This also allows you to maintain ritual spells and allows them to recharge over time. The stabilization effect means that rituals that would normally destabilize your form will no longer do so for longer than a week."
600,Rubedo,Lords of the Night - Zombies,"You can imbue your craft with perpetuity. For gross structure, you can form a half-real substance from Corpus and Gold that, when invested in an object, perfects and transcends that object. Afterwords, you're left with the perfected shadow of the transcended object. Such shadows resist damage much like lesser artifacts, and if they are somehow damaged will restore themselves over time. The shadow is also just better then the original untransended object was. It costs roughly five parts gold for every one part of the object to be transcended. For engines and other systems that need to be fuelled, it starts out costing as if to pay to transcend enough fuel for it to run all day to create a perpetual engine that runs on a common fuel. There is no good benchmark for all the different exotic fuels you might have, but it's safe to say that it grows exponentially more expensive the more exotic the fuel.
Dungeon Keeper: 2,200CP"
600,Runic Floorplan,Dungeon Keeper,"Reaching quite high, aren't you, Keeper? This is a truly demanding practice that will strain your resources and ingenuity to  the limit. If your dungeon is large enough and your skill up to the task, you can craft its structure to emulate a magical item on a massive scale. With only careful construction and a trickle of mana, a spell can be applied to your entire dungeon and anyone in it. The effects can be selective in what they apply to, and are nigh-impossible to resist or dispel. As an example, you could have everyone who dies within your territory immediately rise as undead under your control."
600,Student of Learning,Ravenwood,"While others may be a master in a particular skill, spending their life learning to do one thing, you have spent your whole life learning how to learn. Every skill you learn enhances your ability to learn similar skills (blacksmithing improves your ability to smelt metals, wield a hammer, wield fire magics, etc. just as an example), which stacks up as you learn and master new skills. The greater your mastery, the greater the speed you learn related skills. A skill that is more closely related to ones you already know will see a greater benefit than ones that are only tangentially related.
Capstone Boost: Becoming an unliving being has allowed you to surpass the limits normally experienced by other beings, allowing you to grow stronger near endlessly, the only limit being the amount of time you are willing to invest into learning or developing something about yourself. Additionally, with enough learning in a particular direction, you can condense a conceptual Domain based on the skills in question, greatly enhancing your abilities with anything related to the Domain. These are near identical to the Domains used by gods but without the divinity to make full use of them, enhancing your abilities passively with no active enhancement. The more domains you have, the harder it becomes to form a new one. If you somehow gain Divinity, these domains become true godly domains, however, the more you have, the slower you will develop as a god."
600,Teachings of Aulë,Silmarillion SB,"In Valinor, Aulë was a close companion of the Noldor, and taught them many useful crafts. Perhaps you were a student then, or a student of a student, but whatever the case you have great skill in all manner of crafts which deal with metals and the substances of the earth. You are a masterful architect and city-planner, an expert blacksmith, armourer and weaponsmith, a cunning worker with intricate devices, and learn other such crafts with ease. Furthermore, you have a knack for integrating your work with that of others, synthesising different styles of creation to achieve something greater than the sum of their parts. Finally, you have particular skill in one of the following areas, allowing you to imbue your creations not only with mundane excellence, but true magical power. Additional areas of enchantment may be chosen for 100 CP each, or 50 CP with a discount.
Architecture: Your architectural skills go beyond the mundane. You can plan cities which uplift the hearts and minds of their inhabitants, build walls proof against dragonfire and the whips of balrogs, and create hidden houses or underground halls so well-hidden that no enemy could find them - provided you don’t build an obvious bridge outside your door, of course. You can carve stone so that it seems to grow like living trees, and meld wooden constructions so seamlessly into a forest that they seem as though they grew there naturally.
Weaponsmithing: You can forge steel, silver and mithril into weapons and armour wound about with spells for the protection of their wearers and the destruction of their enemies. You can forge blades the equal of any from the forges of Gondolin, imbuing them with spells to warn of approaching foes. With metal like the star-iron Eol used to forge Anglachel, you could create weapons that would cleave any earthly steel. On the defensive side, your armour and shields would turn aside terrible blows, sit as light on a wearer as silken cloth, and stave off both fear and exhaustion.
Jewelcraft: Although jewellery might seem frivolous in comparison to the other crafts of the Noldor, it is here that they achieved perhaps the greatest degree of magical might. You have the knowledge to create items of wondrous power; rings that conceal their wearers, crowns that increase the wearer’s insight and capacity for thought-sending, and other such marvels. With enough time and practice – and perhaps a few secrets from a willing Maia - you might be able to learn how to forge a true Ring of Power."
600,The Fire in the Forging,Circle of Magic,"You have acquired a mastery of enchantment, the imprinting of permanent or semipermanent magical effects into your chosen medium. Weapons imbued with fire, cloth as protective as armor, far more powerful potions, cupcakes that satisfy all food cravings for days, trees that eat sound, stone paths that rearrange themselves every day... if you can figure out an effect, there's a good chance you can, eventually, figure out how to impart it... assuming you have the right magics and enough power at your disposal."
600,The Giving Spirit,Silmarillion SB,"There is perhaps no place in all of Arda so hallowed as the lands of Aman, or so corrupt and twisted as the dread fortress of Angband. With this perk, you gain the power to both bless and hallow, or corrupt and twist things and creatures within the world.
If you bless something, you effectively give a part of your spirit and strength to it, helping it grow into more of itself. Blessed things become haler, more healthy, more ideal, more beautiful, less easy for uncorrupted beings to harm and broadly ‘better’, as well as resistant to corruption, rejecting corrupted things in general. A blessed stream will flow swift and clear, full of life but not choked by weeds as it dances over rocks with a musical sound. A blessed land will grow strong and vital, its soil giving forth more crops than before while those crops in turn become more hale and hearty, and the farms will not harm the wilderness, or be harmed by it. A blessed animal might become more intelligent, a blessed sword sharper and more resistant to breaking. Perhaps most of all, blessed things are protected from evil; their thoughts are uplifted with hope and courage, black magic will fail before them, and blessed blades might drive spirits of the dark undead flying in fear.
If you corrupt something, you use your power to force it into a shape other than what it should have been, bending it to your will. This is not merely guiding growth, but transforming it into something else. By corrupting a land, you might make it barren, a dreadful, desolate desert, but one that serves your purposes and is less harmful to you and your forces than your opponents. By corrupting a human, you might transform them into a twisted creature, increasing their strength and power in battle at the expense of their new physiology causing them pain or similar. With decades or centuries of work, you could use a combination of corruption, inhabitation of dark spirits and other means to create even new species entirely divorced from what they were before - dragons, vampires and so on. Generally speaking, corrupted beings can either be stronger than they were to begin with, but not necessarily obedient to you, or weaker but easier to dominate.
The amount of spiritual power required to hallow or corrupt a thing roughly corresponds to the spiritual power of the thing in the beginning, and its scale. This power is unavailable to you so long as it is ‘in action’ - that is, as long as the power is taken up creating the change . Eventually, a blessed thing will become blessed as part of its very nature, or a corrupted thing become corrupt, and you will regain the power you expended to make it so. The more powerful the target, the more powerful the result - either corruption or hallowing can enhance the target’s powers, whether those be physical, mental or spiritual as appropriate to the blessing or corruption. The more powerful the blessed thing to begin with, the stronger it will be once blessed - the Silmarils burned even the hands of Melkor, the greatest of the Ainur partly because of the hallowing of Varda, but also because that hallowing was backed by the light of the Two Trees.
By default, a Maia could bless or corrupt a small valley, or a collection of people. With Arisen in Might, this ability is amplified greatly, allowing you to bless or corrupt entire regions, as Melian enchanted the forests of Doriath, or Sauron desolated the land of Mordor.
Additionally, blessing and corrupting are two sides of a spectrum; the more you focus your energies towards blessing, the harder it will be for you to corrupt and vice versa. This ‘slider’ can move both ways over the course of your existence; the most hallowed can descend into the pits of corruption, and perhaps find redemption after even that if they are willing to make recompense and face judgement. You cannot bless or corrupt yourself, though others may do this to you."
600,The Magic in the Weaving,Circle of Magic,"​It is a rare mage that can treat magic as if it were a tool of craft, and rarer still one who can draw magic from others to create something yet more astounding. You are one of those mages, able to wield and weave magic as easily as a seamstress would a needle and thread, or a cook would mix ingredients in a dish. Through the donation of magical power and abilities by others, you may combine the effects and abilities to be more than the sum of their parts and produce spells and effects that would be impossible if any one of the participants worked alone. While there is an upper limit to this (after all too many cooks spoil a stew) you will find that you can accomplish this to a lesser degree with foreign forms of magic as well. Just as you could combine the magic of allies into a single spell, so too can you combine the spells you can cast with various other forms of magic, improving or altering the effects of a spell you cast with one form of magic using a different one."
600,The Power in the Storm,Circle of Magic,"The ability to draw power from powerful natural phenomena. All ambient mages draw their power from the world around them, harnessing the forces of nature, folding it into a smaller more usable form, and when it has been shaped according to the users will, casting it forth in a constructive manner. You however take this to another level. While most mages can only draw in or handle the standard ambient energy that rests static within their elements, you can draw it all in as rare dynamic phenomena unleash the greatest of forces. You may draw upon the power of thunderous storms, massive tidal waves, crippling earthquakes or erupting volcanoes. So long as the phenomena is natural and occurring near you, you may tap into it and funnel all of that power into your spellcasting. Storing it for later use however is going to be... a VERY big challenge. The last person to try and store an Earthquake for later use destroyed an entire city and caused further quakes that damaged cities hundreds of miles away."
600,The Red-White Art,Kill 6 Billion Demons,"Red-White Art is a mixed art, more common in many uses than the pure White, but extremely rare and difficult in its most powerful uses. With this type of magic, you can transform people, such as turning your skin into iron, making kings babbling idiots, or transforming a warrior into a story tall monstrosity. At its peak, it can kill people, sometimes even entire armies, with a single word. People fear this art so much, that it is banned on some worlds.
Capstone Boost: You have found the power of the Black Arts; the act of creating something from nothing. As simple as it sounds, keep in mind all red arts require you to have matter available to mess with. It can also potentially kindle the Flame Immortal, allowing you to create souls from scratch."
600,The Way of the Cube,Unmodded Minecraft,"Whether you born to the cube or merely adopted it, you have internalized some of the principles of this world and made them your own. When you harvest something, you can choose to have it fall apart into whatever shapes and portions you desire. Pluck a plant from your garden or slaughter an animal from your stables, and they will be instantly and perfectly divided up among edible portions, usable materials and all other categories without the slightest waste. Things harvested with this perk are also just better, blemishes, damage and imperfections corrected during the process. This perk can't be used as a form of attack, so no punching the bones out of someone that bothers you."
600,Throne of the Soul,Tales of Symphonia,"You are a soul; you have a body. You can now make those bodies given appropriate resources, ranging from clones to golems. These creations can be made to be sentient, intelligent, and capable of learning. They’re quite obviously empty shells though; they lack independence, self motivation, true emotion, or sapience. Despite that, they’re unfailingly loyal to their creator, even if it isn’t an implanted imperative...
You now possess all the knowledge and skill required to move a soul into one of your creations, or allow a contained soul to pilot a body. If a soul is implanted into one of your intelligent creations, the soul is dominant, though likely to be fond despite itself of the body’s creator in addition to gaining a copy of the memories of the intelligence­ but as these memories lack emotion, it is unlikely to influence their character greatly."
600,Truth,Full Metal Alchemist,"The Gate of Truth, the place where all knowledge of Alchemy is stored, or so some think. You see, when one undergoes human transmutation, they find themselves taken through this gate, and given knowledge of alchemy greater than most experts, alongside the price of something taken from them. Somehow, your In-Jump origin managed to figure this out, and instead of trying a human transmutation, worked solely for the sake of entering this Gate and obtaining this knowledge. Somehow, this worked. Whether there was an item of great strength involved(hint hint), a gift from The Benefactor, or just Truth deciding to be a magnanimous fellow for once, he got that knowledge. You see, like a certain Dwarf in the Flask, you too have great knowledge of Alchemy. Instead of just being an expert, you’re more like a Master, having knowledge of almost every branch of Alchemy in one way or another. Included in this is also the method for creating Philosopher’s Stones, Father’s eclipse ritual, Homunculi(the original kind), Alkahestry, and all the lost arts of Xerxes. Somehow, like the other sacrificial candidates, and those stupid enough to try Human Transmutation, you too are now able to use Alchemy without a Transmutation Circle. You could spend centuries truly making this knowledge yours, but for now you’ll have to settle for the good amount of expertise you have."
600,Un-equivalent Exchange,Full Metal Alchemist,"This world’s alchemy runs on the concept of equivalent exchange, except in one major case: The use of human transmutation. You see, that question above isn’t just some guideline used to scare away alchemists, or limit their abilities, it’s a legitimate rule of the universe. There is nothing that matches the metaphysical value of the human soul, so attempts to revive others, and transmutate human life will almost always cost something that the bearer truly cannot go without such as their eyesight, organs, limbs, or even their entire bodies. This limit, and the one that states that only something of similar material makeup may be transmuted is waved for you. Now, you can apply the scientific reality to the mystical parts of Alchemy. As long as you have the mass necessary, you can transmute one thing to the other without issue. Sealing wounds and fixing bodies as long as you have the matter necessary to remake the parts? Sure. Bringing someone back to life using the materials necessary to form the human body, and their DNA as a blueprint? Truth won’t even flinch. In a way, you’re like a walking Philosopher’s Stone, though even you may not make something from nothing, only reconstitute what is already there. In addition, you still need to follow the rules of alchemy, so you must comprehend what you wish to reform, or break down. You best get studying. In future worlds, the same applies allowing you to break the rules of your mystical systems, and apply scientific logic to them regardless of their spiritual aspects restricting your ability to act. Your new magic system won’t let you turn things into gold despite you being perfectly capable of transmuting other things because of some mystical convenience? Not anymore."
700,Mastercraft,The Witcher Novels,"What separates a Master from an Apprentice? No, not the fact that the current Master married his teacher's only daughter and inherited his position in the guild. A True Master of his craft is person whose work is akin to art. Perhaps even the Art snobbish sorcerers like to call their magic, because when someone looks at what was made by your hand they cannot believe it is not magic. When someone thinks about your chosen profession your name is often found to be synonymous to it. Not surprisingly the rich and powerful will easily agree to outrageous prices to own what you make.
This is what it is to be the Master, but there is more, for you are gifted with talent for organization. Your subordinates always perform to the best of their abilities and always remain very loyal to you. Your businesses don't suffer from misfortune, working like well-oiled mechanisms as long as their focus is on your craft. They need so little oversight that you can spend your time on other pursuits almost without worry for your business. Eventually every master will take an apprentice, or several, and you can fully teach them what you know about your chosen art, almost regardless of how inept they are. They may not be able to surpass you but your legacy will live on through them and their work, and the work of their students and beyond, forever immortalizing your name. Even if history may not remember your other deeds expect to become a folklore hero in the future.
Oh, and good news to you who are Gnomes! You are now also a master metallurgist and have mastered the art of Gwyhyr blades, which are known to be among the greatest weapons ever forged on the continent, with each blade being a masterful work of art. For an extra 100 CP those unfortunate enough not to be Gnomish may also gain this understanding of their metallurgy and metalworks.
Capstone Boost: Now you cannot say that your work is not​ magic, because it is. On some fundamental level, any item you crafted or art piece you create will become legendary artifacts of an unmatched strength, a song will touch the very souls of listeners, resonating through the ages, and even food is something unearthly beautiful capable of feeding entire army. Even your failures will be something beyond work of mortals, like this sword you made while being drunk and then for some reason stabbed into stone near a lake with it. Someone stole it not so long ago by the way, you suspect some knight and a white-haired girl.
Many other wonders await to be born from your work, which can only become better and better, for you know that there is no perfection, only the path to it, so your mastery grows without limits, maybe in one day the sheer excellency of your work will even surpass perfection itself. It astonishing that you can do all of this even with most basic instruments and materials, at fraction of time, perhaps the materials bend to your will while you work? Forget about becoming folk hero, you are now a craftsman of mythical proportions. Don’t be surprised when people name you as famous saint, or even god, of your profession."
800,Arisen in Might,Silmarillion SB,"The might of your spirit is great; you are closer to the power of the Valar themselves than to the common Maiar, an equal to Mairon in his beginnings, to Melian who held even the power of Melkor away from the forests of Doriath, or to Ossë, who rules the coasts and shores of Middle-Earth. With this might comes greater power; the forms you can wear can be up to ten times the size of a human, with proportionate strength and physical abilities. Your spiritual power is immense, able to face a Maia such as Sauron or a similar spirit on an even playing field, and to hold out reasonably well even against a Vala. This strength can be put into other forms of magic as well, enhancing them proportional to the power you pour into them, such that spells which for others produce a localised fireball instead create a great conflagration - specially when used in combination with your Memories of the Music.
Finally, your skill in the magic of song is greatly increased. Not only can you manipulate the physical world as might a lesser Maia (see Songs of Power), but the strength of your spirit is such that you can do so with relative ease, without particular danger of tiring or becoming exhausted. Only enormous workings, such as the raising of a mountain, would exhaust you. Additionally, with lengthy preparation, you can even bring new things into being this way. You cannot create sapient life unless you have some out-of-jump means of providing a soul, but you could cause new species of trees to sprout from the earth without seeds, or create a new source for a mighty river.
Though you might not be the most powerful in Arda, you are certainly amongst the mighty. Tread carefully, lest you crush the small beneath you.
Fate/8,250CP"
800,Enchanting,Ars Magica,"You can use vis to create permanent magical enchantments on items, with more powerful and/or numerous effects requiring more vis. You may create enchantments that use any type of Hermetic magic that you have skill in, and power of the enchantments you can create scales with your magical power and knowledge in that subject, with no upper limit. Enchantments on par with your power level take months of work to create, and you can create even greater effects if you’re willing to spend years on them. On the other hand, weaker enchantments can be made in significantly less time, and duplicating enchantments that you or others have created before takes a maximum of three months if you have the notes on their creation, regardless of power level. Additionally, you can link together effects within the same enchanted item. For example, you might give an item a mind-reading and a fire-creating effect so that anyone within its range explodes if they register as hostile to its bearer.
If you are already familiar with Hermetic Enchanting when you take this perk, then you are able to work any supernatural effect that you know into an enchantment, not merely Hermetic magic. In addition, you can create enchantments three times faster than normal."
800,Glory To Me,Riordanverse - Percy Jackson,"Your divinely related abilities are all massively enhanced to the point that you could fight on par with some mid-tier gods. Using your powers is instinctual and nearly as easy as breathing. Also you gain benefits from your divine parent’s more obscure domains. A child of Hades might find themselves able to call up wealth and ghosts interchangeably while one of Apollo could burn his foes and heal his allies with his mere presence. Using your abilities extensively is tiring though and you should be careful not to wear yourself out too much by summoning a natural disaster where something smaller would’ve worked just as well. Generally the stronger your parent or other source of abilities the more you will get to work with, a child of a minor deity will probably get less but get some additional ways to interact with their parent’s domain. Generally a demigod can fight on par with a non combat focused god of a rank equivalent to their parents with this.

800,"Power Source: Delirium, Anima, Drift, Pact",Ravenwood,"The Demiplane has a wide array of powers at the disposal of the people within, some from the material, some developed by the locals, some created by the Demiplane itself, and some more potent or easier to access within the Demiplane’s bounds."
800,Shaper of Flesh,Silmarillion SB,"Even before the Valar were aware of the awakening of the Elves in Cuivienen, Melkor knew, and his servants kidnapped and twisted elves into orcs, mockeries of their former kind. In later ages, Saruman would perform another feat, breeding the uruk-hai to serve in his armies. You have learned these methods of twisting and transforming others into the shapes you desire for them. Through a combination of dark sorcery, alchemy and selective breeding, you can twist all manner of creatures into new forms. Over a few generations, you could breed wargs from wolves, create hardy new crops that can be grown in great profusion, or induce mutations and alterations in even sapient beings. You might ameliorate weaknesses, such as that of orcs to sunlight, or grant new abilities, like making a group of humans more resistant to poisons.
This process is not very fast, and can only modify and alter what already exists, but with time you can produce novel species to serve your aims. It is possible to make these alterations in a kind and considerate manner, or for a good purpose, but the process of transformation is rarely pleasant for those who undergo it, and the faster you want to make it happen, the more twisting and painful alterations it will require."
800,Vision of Primordial Spring,Silmarillion SB,"It is said that in the spring of Arda, when the world was lit as it were a changeless day by the lamps Illuin and Ormal, Yavanna first brought forth the fruits of her thought. There were trees in those days which grew like living mountains, cloud-crowned with their feet deep in a green twilight of their own making. Those days are vanished and gone - but in you there lives a memory which can be brought forth once more.
At your will, lands you cultivate grow strong and swiftly, plants bursting forth eagerly from the soil at twice the rate elsewhere, with no greater need for nutrients or water. This is but the least of your gifts, however. Under your care, plants of all kinds evoke a memorial of those early days in the spring of Arda, growing five or more times their normal size. This growth is more than physical, though. Lands you cause to flourish in this manner grow strong in spirit as well; they are greatly more resilient to corruption and desecration of all kinds, while animal denizens grow larger, stronger and wiser as well. Herbs and plants are more potent, fruits and crops more fulfilling, and any magical crafts which take advantage of them find their results increased as well.
Finally, though, there is the change in you yourself. These bountiful lands nourish you as much as you nourish them. While within these lands, your resilience to injury, disease, poisons and other harms is greatly increased, your stamina and endurance becomes to all intents and purposes infinite, and your strength is magnified twice over. These benefits linger to an extent while outside of these lands, but fade over time; within a week or so the benefits will be lost until you return, whereupon they return at approximately twice the rate."
800,Vitki,Ars Magica,"The Vitkir are mages who originated in northern Germany before spreading into Scandinavia, Iceland and the British Isles. Vitkar magic is based on Futhark runes, and thus their spells are only cast by carving or writing runes onto an object. Each spell, known as a rune script, takes time to learn or invent, but, once learned, can be cast in the time it takes to carve or write a short sentence. A rune script’s duration depends on the material used to write it. Runes written in paint or ink last only days, those carved into wood can last years, and spells engraved in stone or strong metals are effectively permanent unless the runes themselves are destroyed. Unlike other magical traditions, vis is not needed for creating permanent effects this way, though vis does make them more potent.
Each rune is associated with certain effects, and each spell is defined by a specific rune or combination of runes. Each must be practiced independently of the others, representing its own skill; a Vitki skilled in Hagalaz-based scripts is not necessarily good at Tiwaz. You gain a journeyman level of skill in each, with the potential to improve with time and effort.
ᚫ, Ansuz, the letter “A,” is associated with the mouth, speech, and communication. Rune scripts based on Ansuz might improve the target’s persuasiveness, distinguish audible illusions from “real” sounds, grant the ability to speak, translate spoken language, or read a target’s surface thoughts.
ᛒ, known as Berkanan, is “B” in the Futhark alphabet. Berkanan governs youth, healing and fertility, and is specifically associated with the birch tree. It can be used to accelerate or prevent healing, to target young people or animals, or as a contraceptive.
ᛞ is the letter “D,” and is called Dagaz. Dagaz means “day,” and growth, light, and the passage of time all fall under its purview. A rune script based on Dagaz might cause its target to grow or shrink in size based on the position of the sun or change the target’s rate of aging.
ᛖ, Ehwaz, meaning “horse,” is analogous to the letter “E.” The horse is noted for its strength, stamina and mobility and is considered a noble, loyal animal. The Ehwaz rune can impart these qualities to its target or promote harmony between man and beast.
ᚠ is the rune Fehu, equivalent to “F.” It represents prosperity and wealth, specifically in the form of currency, commodities, and livestock. Fehu rune scripts can grant luck or misfortune in acquiring wealth, direct a person to precious metals, or even summon livestock animals.
ᚷ, Gebo, the letter “G,” means “gift.” In Norse society, accepting a gift places one under certain obligations, usually giving a gift of equal value in return. Therefore, Gebo rune scripts can improve one’s ability to influence others, and particularly powerful Vitkir can even achieve complete mind control this way.
ᚺ is the rune Hagalaz, and corresponds to the letter “H.” Meaning “hail,” it represents the cruelty of nature, storms especially. Hagalaz rune scripts can increase or decrease the damage dealt by their target or summon storms and other severe weather phenomena.
ᛁ, analogous to the letter “I” in Futhark, is Isa, and means “ice.” It represents coldness and stillness in a literal and metaphorical sense. Isa can be used to create extreme cold, manipulate ice and water, inflict depression or apathy, or hold a target motionless.
ᛃ, called Jera, corresponds to the letter ‘“J.” It means “year,” but is associated with the autumn harvest specifically, and the bounty of nature more generally. Rune scripts based on Jera can improve tasks undertaken for an entire year, such as studying, training, teaching, etc., preserve or improve health, or summon food and drink.
ᚲ, Kauno, is the letter “K.” Kauno means “pain,” and is associated with heat and fire. With it, a Vitki can inflict, worsen, or heal disease, improve one’s sight, or set things aflame.
ᛚ is the rune Laguz, meaning “water,” specifically seawater. It is the Futhark version of the letter “L,” and rune scripts that use it can summon water, manipulate water, sense water, sense things in water, grant water breathing, or speed travel over water.
ᛗ is the letter “M,” called Mannaz. Its meaning is “mankind,” and Mannaz runes inspire skill and cooperation in their targets.
ᚾ, Naudiz, “N” in the rune alphabet, means “need.” It can grant fortune or misfortune in times of great need, grant luck in things that the target has attempted and failed before, delay a supernatural effect, extend the duration of another spell, or inflict despair or strife.
ᛜ is Ingwaz, which represents the velar nasal sound, “Ng.” Meaning “Lord,” Ingwaz is associated with safety, peace, home, and family. Rune scripts based on Ingwaz can grant fortune to a family or household, provide information on one’s home and family, safeguard the health of a pregnant woman and her child, or summon a person that the Vitki has an arcane connection to.
ᛟ is the Futhark analogue to the letter “O.” It is called Othila, meaning “inheritance.” While Fehu represents general forms of wealth, Othila is about specific objects such as heirlooms or lands. A Vitki can use it to improve the qualities of an item, making it more effective in its intended use. Othila can also be used to summon specific nonliving items smaller than a person.
ᛈ, Perth, corresponds to the letter “P.” Its literal meaning is “cup,” but it is associated with the concepts of fate, luck, gambling, pleasure, relaxation, secrets, and magic itself. In rune scripts, it can affect luck in matters of pure chance, sense, identify or dispel magic, or locate vis.
ᚱ is the letter “R” in the Futhark alphabet, pronounced Raido. It means “riding,” and thus holds dominion over speed and travel. Raido-based magic can help guide a traveler, improve a target’s stamina, repair a vehicle, heal a beast of burden, increase a target’s speed, or summon an object larger than a human, such as a vehicle.
ᛊ is Sowilo, “Sun.” It is the runic letter “S,” and is related to light, perception, the divine, and good triumphing over evil. Vitkar magic that uses Sowilo might grant improved perception, sight in darkness, the ability to see through illusions, or invisibility. It can also create or extinguish light or detect divine or infernal power.
ᛏ is the letter “T,” called Tiwaz. Tiwaz means Tyr, the Norse god of truth and battle. Tiwaz runes can grant bravery, confidence or skill in battle. They can also locate other people, tell truth from lies, grant mind reading, or predict the actions of others.
ᚦ, Thurisaz, represents the “Th” sound in the runic alphabet. Its meaning is “Giant,” “Ogre,” or “Thorn,” depending on dialect. Therefore, Vitkir using Thurisaz can weaken and harm supernatural creatures, create plants, destroy plants, or transform a target into a living thing.
ᚢ is the rune for “Aurochs,” corresponding to the letter “U,” and is called Uruz. The Aurochs is a symbol of strength and masculinity in Norse culture, and therefore rune scripts based on Uruz can increase a target’s strength, grant resistance to mind-altering effects, or summon animals.
ᚹ is the letter “W” in the Futhark alphabet. It is known as “Wunjo,” meaning “Joy.” It is also associated with intoxication, the absence of suffering, and glory in war. Wunjo-based magic can improve charisma, reduce or eliminate pain and feelings of fatigue, or inspire joy in others.
ᛇ, Ihwaz, means “Yew,” and is analogous to the letter “Y.” The Yew tree is associated with death due the Norse practice of planting them in graveyards, and therefore Ihwaz-based spells can create necromantic effects such as sensing, summoning or animating corpses. It can also be used to sense or summon supernatural creatures, summon trees, or increase or decrease a target’s intelligence.
ᛉ is Algiz, the letter “Z” in the Futhark alphabet. It means “Elk,” and the rune itself is sometimes interpreted as a hand outstretched in a blocking gesture. It is used for protection and to ward away specific targets. It can also be used to target elk or hands."
1000,"Academic Magic: Curse-weaving, Protective, Raw Elements, Stone",Circle of Magic,"The practice of using magic in known and precise ways usually through the expenditure of energy within the self and the use of external catalysts to shape and control it to a given end. As the ability is an innate part of the user, it is very easy to detect at young age and such mages usually start training very early. Academic mages must work hard to build up their internal reserves of magic and be diligent in ensuring that all of this energy is used in as an efficient and precise way as possible. Academic mages are generally more versatile in their magic than ambient mages but tend to be less powerful since they cannot draw upon ambient sources of power.
Academic mages may choose to specialize their learning to improve efficiency and increase their skill but this is a personal choice as they do not possess the natural affinities to one form of magic or another as ambient mages do. Some may not choose to specialize at all. The first specialization is free, and each additional one costs 200 CP. Specializations include but are not limited to;
Curse-weaving: The act of causing harm through magic, whether it be by causing a persistent ailment, a confounding of the senses or any one of a number of unpleasant things with varying lethality and duration. Curse weavers are popular with people who hold a grudge.
Protective: Using magic to protect from harm is a common and well chosen choice. Whether it be charms to ward off diseases, gird against misfortune, turn away curses or even create barriers of raw mystical force, protective mages are always in high demand.
Raw Elements: Academic mages who choose to practice elemental magic usually focus on one of the classical aristotelian elements; air, earth, fire or water. From there they focus on manipulating the element to various degrees but usually do so in subtle ways. In particular wards which prevent fire damage, sustain homes during earthquakes or prevent flooding are highly sought after and incorporated into most homes that can afford them. Some may choose to take this raw power in a more offensive route, turning it against others as a weapon of war, or using it to augment existing weapons such as Boom Stones or the dispersal of poisons.
Stone: Of the academic elemental mages, stone mages in particular focus on the variety of natural types of stones and may apply a number of wards and protections to appropriate types of stone increasing the spell's effectiveness."
1300,Minor Blessing,Riordanverse - Percy Jackson,"For one reason or another you've got a god who cares slightly about you and has seen fit to grant you some minor boon within their domains. Choose one god from any pantheon and gain a minor boon from them. The god will care slightly about you but unless you go on to further distinguish yourself it will be more of a minor interest in your affairs than someone they feel the need to help (Effectively think a diminished version of one ability a demigod might have, think minor ones are stuff along the lines of breathing water, lucid dreaming, or appropriate vague extra senses, useful but nothing especially major).

2400,"Ambient Magic: Thread, Green, Smith, Glass, Carpentry, Cooking",Circle of Magic,"Ambient magic takes different forms depending on the mage and the craft he or she performs. Each Ambient Magic is considered linked to a specific one of the four elements. There are a multitude of different forms of ambient magic, each linked to ages old traditions such as (but not limited to) cooking, dancing, smithing, weaving, animal tending, sailing, building, gardening, farming, and scribing; or to powerful natural forces, such as fire, wind, weather, and so on.
Thread: A form of Earth Magic, it allows the manipulation and enhancement of thread, cloth, and other tools of the weaver or sewer’s trade. It is practiced by Sandry and Dedicate Lark. Stitch Witches can enchant bandages to heal wounds, broider veils to hide identities, make clothes that protect like armor or ward away fire, and sew good luck or love charms.
Green: A form of Earth Magic, it allows the manipulation of plants and products made from them, medicine making and magical improvement of existing (plant-based) medicines. It is practiced by Briar, Dedicate Rosethorn, and First Dedicate Crane (an Air Initiate). Garden Mages can enchant crops, brew medicines and poisons of supernatural potency, shape entire orchards into living charms, kill entire forests... or restore life to dead woods.
Smith: A form of Fire Magic, it allows the sensing and manipulation of metals, ores, and other materials used in smithing (like coal), resistance to fire and burning metal, resistance to smoke damage to lungs, and varying levels of fire manipulation. It is practiced by Daja and Dedicate Frostpine. Not only are Smithmages immune to normal fire and being pierced by non-magical metal, they can craft supernaturally sharp blades, future scrying mirrors, and any number of charms from engraved metal or twisted wire.
Glass: A form of Fire Magic, in which the user creates unique glass objects with magical abilities (eg. scrying orbs or tracker / warning pellets), as well as identification of glass works without sight through the piece's own knowledge of its form. It is practiced by Kethlun Warder. Glassmages can make lenses and mirrors that grant extra-sensory abilities, such as the ability to see magic or track footprints. They can also make warded or incredibly strong windows.
Carpentry: A form of Earth Magic, it allows the magical shaping of wood, the identification of wood, the strengthening of processed wood, the softening of processed wood, and the sensing of weaknesses within wooden objects. It is practiced by Niamara Bancanor, Camoc Oakborn, and Arnen.
Cooking: A form of Fire Magic, Chef Magic draws power from all aspects of cooking and the manipulation of fire. A Chef Mage’s senses of taste and smell are incredibly precise, able to accurately judge both contents and quantities of ingredients. A Chef mage can, in defiance of that age old adage, pull some or all of an ingredient out of a dish with enough concentration. They can enhance flavors, healthiness, or even how much sustenance someone gains. They are also extremely skilled with knives. It is practiced by Jorality Bancanor, Olennika Potcracker, and Gorse."
