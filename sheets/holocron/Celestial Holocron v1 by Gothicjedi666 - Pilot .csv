",You understand the general principles behind piloting most vehicles in the star wars universe.

400 CP,Your Hangar,Star Wars - Squadrons,"Need somewhere to store your impressive collection of starships? This space acts as an attachment to your Warehouse, but may alternatively be placed on any property you own. It will be able to store any and all vehicles you own, expanding internally in size to accommodate them. Even Star Destroyers could be stored here! Any vehicles you own may be sent to this at any time they are not engaged in combat. This space utilises the aesthetics of either an Imperial or Mon Calamari starship hangar, and you can change between them at any time. Vehicles stored in this space can be retrieved by you, or those you would like to be able to do so, at any time, as long as sufficient space is nearby. If this space is destroyed, a replacement will appear in the same location after 24 hours. If that location is no longer valid, it will instead be moved to your Warehouse. "
500 CP,Simulation Room,Star Wars - Squadrons,"This space is now connected to either your Warehouse or a property you own by a special gateway. Here, you will be able to simulate various space battles. Three types of space battles are on offer. First, you can choose to take part in any of the story missions featured in Star Wars: Squadrons, taking the place of the player. Second, you can re-experience any of the space battles you have fought in the past, taking on the role you took then. These recreations are mostly accurate, but are limited by your own understanding of what transpired. Finally, you can take part in ‘random’ battles between the Empire and the New Republic, occurring in various locations and with different fleet compositions. In this last type, many pilots may take part at the same time, each with their own starfighter.
In these simulations, you can choose to use any of the ten starfighters available to the player in Star Wars: Squadrons: X-wing, Y-wing, A-wing, U-wing, B-wing, TIE fighter, TIE bomber, TIE interceptor, TIE reaper, and TIE defender. These ships can come with any loadout present in Star Wars: Squadrons. If a participant owns their own starship, then they can alternatively choose to use that starship instead.
True death or chain failure does not occur during these simulations; being killed or having your starship destroyed will instead safely eject a person from the simulation. Likewise, owned starships used here are not permanently damaged. With ‘random’ simulations, you can choose at the start of the battle for defeated pilots to be ‘respawned’ into the battle after a short period instead of being ejected right away. "
600 CP,Galactic Ace,Star Wars - Squadrons,"There’s no denying it, you are one of the best pilots the galaxy has to offer. Whether it’s an all around starfighter, interceptor, bomber, or support craft, you can pilot it to an incredible standard. Off course, the truly successful pilot has something more than raw skill on their side. While piloting a starfighter, you have what Wedge would refer to as “Skywalker luck”. Allies show up to assist at opportune times, exploding debris or environmental dangers will miss when they normally wouldn’t, you’ll manage to escape exploding ships or stations you have blown up from the inside, and things in general just tend to go your way"
600 CP,Jumper Dockyards,Star Wars - Squadrons,"Somewhere out in space is this large starship manufacturing facility. On par with the New Republic’s Nadiri Dockyards, it is capable of producing anything from starfighters to capital ships as large as a Starhawk. In order to produce these ships, you will need to provide the necessary materials. If you lack them, you can offer up currency to have the dockyards source them for you, even in non-Star Wars settings. The cost of materials sourced in this way is substantially marked up from their base value. Only materials used in the construction of the starships appearing in Star Wars: Squadrons can be sourced in this way.
Once you have the materials, the dockyards will need to know how to build the desired ship in question. To begin with, the dockyards are capable of building either all of the New Republic starships shown in Star Wars: Squadrons (minus Starhawk-class battleships), or all of the Imperial starships shown in Star Wars: Squadrons. If you can provide sufficient blueprints, or teach the dockyard crew in some other manner, then the construction of other kinds of ships will be possible as well. Beyond these two conditions, there are also the practical concerns of production time and space within the dockyards, which limit how many ships the dockyards can churn out at a time. The dockyards are outfitted with various defences, and possesses a number of hangars from which a small force of starfighters could be kept. They come with a sufficient crew to run and maintain them, which count as followers but cannot leave the dockyards."
