0 CP,Internal Commlink ,Star Wars - New Jedi Order,"You can send and receive signals with no external
device needed."
0 CP,Electro-Photo Receptors ,Star Wars - New Jedi Order,"These eyes are not like organic eyes, they see a broader spectrum, including UV and IR light, and model visual data in holographic, 3D format. Great for storage and later retrieval, but it also gives you a profound understanding of space and precise distances."
0 CP,Vocoder ,Star Wars - New Jedi Order,"Binary is efficient, and beeps and whistles are cute, but sometimes you just need to talk to meatbags in their own language. This off-the-shelf module allows you to produce all the sounds needed for Basic, and most common languages."
0 cp,Scomp Link,Star Wars - New Jedi Order,"You have a port allowing you to interface with the common computers of the Star Wars galaxy, from handheld datapads to the systems governing entire starships."
0 CP,Electronics,KOTOR,"A large supply of computer spikes and repair parts that can be used with nearly any modern machine in the galaxy. Computer spikes overwhelm electronics with junk data and are used by hackers to aid them in bypassing electronic security doors and terminals. Repair parts are packages of universally adaptable components that can be used to fix or upgrade droids, vehicles, and other machines."
0 CP,Pit Droids,Star Wars - Podracer,"These funny repair droids are mainly used for keeping your Pod in working order, but they occasionally find use in other places as well. The first purchase gets you two Pit Droids, sufficient to keep your Pod going so long as you don’t take too much damage during your races. Each repeat purchase will double the total number of droids you receive. Having more than four droids to keep your Pod in good form is typically pointless, but any remaining droids can be put to use repairing other gear you may have lying around, such as other vehicles, starships, or other properties you might possess. The more complex, powerful or valuable the gear that you task them to repair, the longer the job will usually take. Repairing a starfighter won’t take that much longer than fixing a Pod, but sending four pit droids to rebuild a Death Star is a different thing altogether. Droids that somehow end up damaged or destroyed are replaced after a week. All droids purchased here can be upgraded with a variety of improvements over the default ‘smart as a toaster’ version. However, your droids are guaranteed to never make things worse even if they’re unsuited for the task at hand - you won’t need to worry about them getting sucked into your Pod engines for example.They’ll do the best job they can, and if they can’t fix whatever damage remains they’ll just beep at you in confusion instead of trying and failing."
100 CP,"In A Desert, With A Box Of Scraps ",Star Wars: The Phantom Menace – The Reddit Edition V1.1,"You are able to build advanced tech like intelligent robots or customised Podracer with less-than-ideal components, even in environments that could cause problems. As a certain prodigy might tell you, sand gets everywhere."
100 CP,Toolkit,Star Wars: The Phantom Menace – The Reddit Edition V1.1,"If you’re going to be tinkering, it would help if you had more than your bare hands. This collection will slowly grow to include every tool you have used, so getting access to something once can benefit you. It starts off containing all the basics for a mechanic in the Star Wars Galaxy, so even the basic kit is far from primitive if you know what to do with it."
100 CP,Babble ,Star Wars: The Phantom Menace – The Reddit Edition V1.1,"You are fluent in the peculiar language known as “astromech babble”, allowing you to understand a variety of droids that communicate in a series of beeps, whistles and other electronic sounds. You can also speak this language just as well, though exactly how you accomplish this and whether anyone finds it notable is up to you. Considering few can understand this, you can get away with saying quite a lot when most of your audience just hears beeps and whistling."
100 CP,DD3-R1 ,"Star Wars: Death Troopers Gauntlet V 1.0
","A KX series security droid you were assigned when you were sent to investigate what happened to the Imperial detachment sent to The Vector. While surprisingly unhelpful in a fight, DD3-R1 can link with your helmet and armor to see your surroundings, and remotely access computers and terminals. It can also excellently map out routes that suit your needs, and make adjustments to those routes if necessary. 
"
100 CP,Astromech Droid,Star Wars - Dark Empire,"A droid much like R2-D2 with the same capabilities and sentient status. As R2 was instrumental to Luke Skywalker’s success, this little one will surely contribute greatly to your journey. Can be made a companion at will."
100 CP,Hydrospanner,Star Wars Movie Compilation : The Skywalker Saga Jumpchain,This special hydraulic spanner is a hand tool that dynamically shapeshifts to adjust for nuts and bolts of any shapes or sizes allowing it to also work as an all-purpose socket wrench and bit driver.
100 CP,Health Package Implant,KOTOR,"A regenerative implant that employs nanotechnology to speed up the healing process.
It coaxes the healing sections of the brain into working harder to repair damage."
100 CP,Krath War Droid Schematics,Tales of the Jedi,"In your possession are the schematics for a specific type of War Droid to be used during the war against Exar Kun. These droids are incredibly fast, strong, and durable to boot. Their functions however are quite simple, and they come armed with a melee durasteel blade, and a pulse wave bow that can be used for both long range and short range encounters. They're quite easy to build and can be mass produced as long as you have the facilities for it."
100 CP,Workshops ,Generic Jedi Clone Wars v1.4,"Workshops and laboratories for those who are not interested in the ways of combat, generally this is a large set of rooms that are capable of letting people inside your temple to create and research the subject they’re specialized in, the workshop provides state of the art equipments that can be brought within this galaxy, allowing people in the workshop to work on what they’re specialized in, any experiments done here will not damage any equipments or harm the researchers, any of the rooms here can duplicate into smaller versions of itself to provide personal workshops, if you so choose."
100 CP,Grease Monkey,Star Wars - Podracer,"As a newcomer to the Podracing scene, you likely won't have the kind of support or infrastructure that more wealthy or experienced racers have. You've turned that downside into an advantage though – spending long hours maintaining your Pod yourself means you're keenly aware of all its ins-and-outs, all its unique little differences and all the subtle ways it responds during a race. You've got a similar ability to rapidly come to understand the practical workings of any piece of equipment or vehicle you use."
200 CP,"What, Do You Think You’re A Jedi Or Something",Star Wars: The Phantom Menace – The Reddit Edition V1.1,"They can wave their hands all they want, but mind tricks won’t work on you. Attempts to influence your mind with the Force or other abilities don’t work. Only actual persuasion, threats, or perhaps bribery willsway you."
200 CP,Access Denied ,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40k,A major concern that the Mechanicus had was that the Republic would somehow understand their technology if they captured any intact gear. This is a concern that you do not have. Your technology can not be reverse engineered by anyone without your consent. Even if someone has the blueprints and a perfectly intact machine they would not be able to understand anything.
200 CP,Your Technology Shall Become Mine,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40k,Sometimes you have to admit that your enemy's gear is better than your own. This means that you need to take their gear apart and figure out how they work. You have the ability to reverse engineer anything. You will be capable of understanding new principles and new technological fields. The amount of time it takes to do so will depend on your intelligence and how complex the machinery is.
200 CP,Rejuvenation Tank,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40k,This is the rejuvenation tank that was used to keep the original form of General Grievous alive for years despite his incredibly damaged body. This pod is capable of bringing anyone back from the brink of death and even removing severe conditions such as cancers. In addition you will receive the blueprints needed to create more of these tanks as well as other similar types like the standard bacta tank.
200 CP,"
Combat Engineer",Star Wars: Death Troopers Gauntlet V 1.0,"An interesting and insidious aspect of Storm Trooper training was having trainees serve alongside other branches of the Imperial Army to further their indoctrination. While that aspect of the training can neatly be shoved far away from you, what won’t is the potential for training with Imperial combat engineers. This additional training has made you into something of a gear-head when it comes to operating and repairing both military and civilian equipment. Useful in its own right, but even more essential now. "
200 CP,Dark Force Cage,Star Wars - Dark Empire,"Sometimes you just want to transport a powerful prisoner without all the hassle of building a strong enough cage to contain them. That’s where this comes in; the Dark Force Cage serves as a solution to this age-old dark lord problem. Prisoners placed within its crackling confines will find all their abilities simply cease to function; the Force refuses to answer, and so on, and so forth. Makes for a handy and portable solution given its ability to transport itself."
200 CP,T3 Series Utility Droid,Star Wars Movie Compilation : The Skywalker Saga Jumpchain,"A small robot designed to maintain and interact with computer systems and other types of machines. This droid comes with a single blaster weapon but it can be equipped with more advanced offensive weapons, energy shields, armor, and other systems. If left for to long without a mind wipe it will develop it’s own personality. Can only communicate with electronic sounds. Purchasing this also gets you the schematics for the droid so you or someone else can make more."
200 CP,Computers,KOTOR,"Droids, networks, and personal computers are your playthings. You’re an expert at manipulating and improving digital devices, and you can cut through most security systems like a lightsaber through butter."
200 CP,Hardware ,KOTOR,"Gives you training in how to operate, repair and improve machines. You can easily
rebuild broken droids from salvaged parts, and you’ll even be able to fix starships given enough time and equipment."
200 CP,Droid Design,Tales of the Jedi,"Droids are an important part of the Star Wars universe, it’s safe to say that without them, nothing would really work the same. Thus, you’ve taken the initiative and instead learned how they work. This only starts small though, you have both the technical and theoretical knowledge to design simple protocol, astromech, or security Droids. In a few years after getting some experience, you can easily move on to something on the level of a Krath War Droid. After some more years and experience, even recreating Basilisks would seem like a simple challenge to  overcome."
200 CP,Assassin Droid,The Mandalorian,"Former assassin droids were reprogrammed to work as bounty hunters for a number of reasons they were efficient they had no conscious and they were cheap, you now have one of your own pre programmed to obey and protect you at any cost, this one is immune to reprogramming"
200 CP,Separatist Droid Blueprints,Clone Wars,"A list of mechanical infantry units planned to be produced for the CIS. This list includes every droid they plan to field, from the common B1 and vulture droids to the ultra rare MagnaGuards."
200 CP,Republic Vehicle Blueprints,Clone Wars,"A list of ships, mechs and armored vehicles either currently or planned to be produced for the Galactic Republic such as the AT-RT, the LAAT gunship, the ARC-170 starfighter, and even the Venator-class Star Destroyer. Designs for ships and vehicles such as the Mandator-II and  mperator-class Star Destroyer that were built and in service to the Republic before the end of the war, but not as widely produced compared to more popular ships, are also included."
200 CP,Scrapper ,Star Wars - Podracer,"Without the reputation to back their words and Truguts, many starting racers have to make do with the discarded scraps of more well-established racers. But just because an item is worn out or damaged doesn't mean it's not still useful – and you'd be surprised how much you can get working again if you put in the effort. You're a gifted junkyard salvager, with both a keen eye for useful scrap and the mechanic skills you'll need to get your haul back into working condition. Even better, it seems that you're unusually fortunate when you go 'junkyard delving', and are considerably more likely to find whatever you're looking for... or at least, a workable substitute."
200 CP,Jumper’s Pods And Parts ,Star Wars - Podracer,"This small shop provides a variety of second-hand, restored, salvaged and similar ‘used goods’, not unlike Watto’s junk shop in Mos Espa. While there’s various scraps and components here for a wide variety of systems, the shop’s biggest collection is found in Podracer parts. It comes with a decently competent staff so you don’t have to work here personally (unless you want to), and will provide a small but respectable income from its business without your direct intervention. Simply taking all the stock without paying to upgrade your own Pod will likely see it instantly go bankrupt, but it’s still an excellent way to get a reliable source of parts and services. Furthermore, as you spend more time in the Podracing circuit, achieve more victories and accrue greater fame, the shop will likewise become more popular by association. The better you do the higher its profits will be, and it will get easier access to suppliers, more advanced components, and so on."
200 CP,ID9 Seeker Droids,Star Wars - Rebels,"A set of four ID9 seeker droids, which are programmed to serve you. The small droids are each equipped with an electro-shock prod and blaster, making them useful in battle – if only as a diversion. They make effective scouts, and can record and playback audio; you’d be surprised at the amount of critical information your targets will volunteer when they believe no one is around. Your ID9 seeker droids are considered to be followers, and should one be lost or destroyed, a replacement will appear in your Warehouse after 24 hours. However, they may be imported individually as a companion in a future jump, in which case they operate under companion rules instead."
300 CP,Technical Specialist,Darth Bane Trilogy,"It is arguable that this galaxy has, on the whole, reached a technological plateau. This bar may be relatively high if one was to compare it to that of previous Jumps. Sentient computer systems, widely available commercial FTL, weapons that can scour planets, miraculous medical technology and gravity manipulation to name a few. An extremely comprehensive database of all these discoveries, refined and developed over the course of millennia, will be mentally accessible for you. Should you have the resources and tools on hand, there’s no reason you couldn’t create almost anything natively produced in this galaxy."
300 CP,Affinity for the Machine,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40k,Anakin is a technological genius when it comes to creating and working with machinery. Here his affinity is pushed even further allowing him to interface with machines and manipulate them directly. An example of this is when Anakin reverses the polarity of the Blackstone in Khayon. This process turns the Blackstone from a suppressive force into an amplifying force magnifying Khayon’s powers so that they could even be compared to his Primarch Magnus. You will gain a similar ability to connect with machines. You will find that you now possess this same spark and may perform similar applications to various types of machinery.
300 CP,Jawa Crawler,The Mandalorian,Big box like and stuffed to the brim with Jawa's stolen ship parts and stolen droids for you to sell hard to stop it's movement and it crosses sand as easily as solid ground
300 CP,Cyberneticist ,Clone Wars,Your a master at making artificial limbs and organs. You could easily create replacement parts indistinguishable from their originals or save someone from the brink of death by transforming them into a monstrous cyborg similar to General Grievous. You also know how to augment people in ways that won't diminish any supernatural powers or abilities they may possess.
400 CP,Whistle While You Work,Star Wars: The Phantom Menace – The Reddit Edition V1.1,"You have an extraordinary ability to hack into, navigate, alter, and manipulate electronic systems. You already have familiarity with most common systems, and if you get some more experience or detailed plans of other systems you will be able to deal with them just as easily. You can find ways around security systems in these computers just as well. You might need tools to use your talents effectively, or perhaps you have some other way of connecting with electronic systems. If something needs to be done with a computer system, you can probably manage it."
400 CP,Supplies,Star Wars: The Phantom Menace – The Reddit Edition V1.1,"Scavenged, bartered for and perhaps less legally acquired, this is all the supplies you need for any tinkering you might get up to. Given a bit of time you could build a Podracer out of this stuff, and perhaps more with additional time and equipment."
400 CP,Scrapped Protocol Droid,Darth Bane Trilogy,"This protocol droid seems to have been partially cannibalised; carbon scoring marks his chassis. The head is still quite active, eyes aglow with a sinister orange light. The droids personality core is quite acerbic and amoral, showing little concern for those around it - except for its new master, of course. Should you manage to find him an appropriate torso, he’d be extremely grateful and would happily carry out his ‘protocol’ duties with gusto. Why someone programmed a protocol droid to be so insulting is somewhat confusing... why, he keeps calling others meatbags."
400 CP,ChanPal SuRecon Center,Star Wars Movie Compilation : The Skywalker Saga Jumpchain,Your warehouse gains the Surgical Reconstruction Center can be used for perfect surgical augmentations and implement intensive cybernetic enhancement with a 0% chance of complications or the operation failing.
400 CP,Master Mechanic,Star Wars - The Force Unleashed,"Much like Jedi Master Kazdan Paratus you are a wizard when it comes to machines and, as such, can easily repair and build them. But the true benefit of this is that when it comes to designing new droids or machines; they’re always nothing less than magnificent no matter what they’re meant for."
400 CP,Gree Secrets,Generic Star Wars Fanfiction,"There are few civilizations in galactic history that have been as advanced as the Gree were at one point. From machines capable of terraforming entire worlds to the advanced sciences behind the Hypergates. Their technology was both unique and powerful, and now it's all yours. You have a complete record of the technology, both known and lost that belonged to the Gree race in its entirety. The principles it works on are no doubt different than most tech used by the galaxy but with time and effort replicating everything using other tech is possible, also helped by the plans giving clear directions and data on how everything"
400 CP,Chief Mechanic,Star Wars - Squadrons,"You have the necessary knowledge and skill required to maintain, repair, and refit all of the starships found in the starships section. While maintaining a squadron of starfighters is a job that you will be able to manage by yourself, larger vessel like capital ships may require you to instead head a team of engineers, due to the practical issue of only being at a single location at once, and only having so much time in which to get things done"
400 CP, A Mere Droid,Star Wars: The Phantom Menace – The Reddit Edition V1.1,"Or a mere alien, or a mere human, or... well, whatever you seem to be, you don’t have to give off any sort of sense of importance. You are capable of being easily overlooked and underestimated, even while you are able to discretely help others. Unless you obviously pull off something miraculous and let it be known, others will consider what you do as just your duty and not make a fuss of it."
400 CP,C-3P0 Construction Kit ,Star Wars Movie Compilation : The Skywalker Saga Jumpchain,"This handy dandy construction kit comes with all the components you will need to create a top of the line protocol droid, including instructions and tools. Every time you complete a construction kit or use all its pieces you gain a new kit for a droid of the same make and model. If you want you may change what type of construction kit you have to another type of canon droid, the new kit will arrive after 24 hours regardless of if you complete the previous kit."
500 CP,Forceful Engineer,Darth Bane Trilogy,"Force sensitive individuals and species have created wondrous unions of engineering genius and Force energies. Prisons to hold eldritch nightmares, holocrons and seemingly infinite factories that strip entire stars for the resources needed for your unending fleets. You are inspired when it comes to the design of such marvels, even being able to use the Light Side for unseen effects. This brilliance extends beyond the Force into the wider realm of ‘Magitek’. The potential trichotomy of Machine, ‘Magic’ and The Force could give birth to near unimaginable wonders for the inventive mind."
600 CP,Centerpoint Station,Generic Star Wars Fanfiction,"This was never designed to be a weapon, being the Celestial equivalent of construction equipment. However, the sheer amount of power this immobile space station can harness beggars the imagination. The station operates by using an immensely powerful hyperspace tractor beam to safely move anything from moons to solar systems and even black holes on a galactic scale. This one has an incredible range covering somewhere around half the galaxy. However, this isn’t just a free superweapon or stellar construction device. You’ll have to decipher how to control it on its own and given that it was designed by the Celestials that’ll be quite the task, though it will provide quite a bit of information about Celestial technology."
600 CP,The Maw Installation,Generic Star Wars Fanfiction,"Congratulations Jumper you’re now the proud owner of a secret research facility in the middle of a cluster of black holes! Beyond being almost unreachable and undetectable due to its location, and therefore one of the most secure locations in the galaxy, this large facility is one of the most advanced in the galaxy and contains everything a Galactic Empire with a virtually bottomless check book could give it. This includes quarters, labs, food production, etc. It is also staffed by a number of loyal follower characters who fulfill various roles in the station ranging from researchers to security. While the researchers will be of higher quality than most, only a few can be expected to match the likes of Qwi Xux and those of her level, though even that’s enough to reproduce things like the Sun Crusher and Death Star."
600 CP,Cutting Edge,Star Wars - Podracer,"What's the point of using the latest and most advanced technologies in your Pod if you have to rely on market availability? You can't wait around for others to catch up to you, and technological advancement is a race as thrilling as any on the Podracing tracks. Your knowledge and insights into technological progress make you nothing short of a mechanical savant, and coming up with some crazy new invention is trivial for one of your talents. Emphasis on the 'crazy', but you can't argue with results. Often, pushing your Pod (or most other technologies) to heights undreamed of is as simple as taking a moment to think and getting the necessary components."
600 CP,TIE Defender Factory,Star Wars - Rebels,"A large factory, equal to the TIE Defender factory present on Lothal prior to the destruction of its fuel depot. The factory has the necessary plans and workforce to build TIE fighters, TIE interceptors, and of course, TIE Defenders and TIE Defender Elites. Producing other ships may be possible, but you will need to provide the plans and additional training on your own. In order to produce these starfighters, you will need to provide the necessary materials. If you lack them, you can offer up currency to have the factory source them for you, even in non-Star Wars settings. The cost of materials sourced in this way is substantially marked up from their base value. Only materials used in the construction of the aforementioned starfighters can be sourced in this way. In addition to its workforce, the factory is outfitted with a small force of stormtroopers, as well as walkers, in order to defend it. All of these people are considered followers and are completely loyal to you – no need to worry about them sabotaging your projects from within! Should any perish, replacements will appear at the start of the next jump (post-chain, after ten years). At the start of each jump, the factory will be moved to an appropriate location, relatively close to your starting location. Post-chain, you will have an opportunity to move your factory to any free and appropriate space once every ten years. If destroyed, the factory will reappear at the start of the next jump (post-chain, after ten years). Your factory will retain any upgrades it has received."
