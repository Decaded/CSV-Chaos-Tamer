0 CP,Lightsaber ,Star Wars - Darth Plagueis,"The traditional weapon of the Sith and Jedi, lightsabers are weighty handles that emit a blade of superheated plasma in a magnetic containment field. This ‘blade’ is circular and its cut is omnidirectional, able to instantly sear through most materials in the galaxy in an instant and slowly melt through the few heat resistant enough to bare their edge. That magnetic fields makes the lightsaber a surprisingly versatile weapon, for it repels the ubiquitous blaster weapons used by most sapients and when used in conjunction with the prophetic powers of a Sith Lord the weapon can intercept and redirect ranged fire back at an attacker. As a Sith you have constructed your own lightsaber, with an artificial crystal in its hilt that produces the distinctive crimson blade favoured by your order, and have at least enough competence with it to use it in battle without injuring yourself."
0 CP,Through Victory My Chains Are Broken,Star Wars - New Jedi Order,"Sith believe in imposing their will upon the universe, going as far as their ambitions and powers will allow. The Force is not a shield to protect the weak, but a weapon that empowers the worthy. So you are adept at using the Force in combat, on the move, fighting by instinct."
100 CP,Dark Armor ,Star Wars - Dawn of the Jedi,"A rip off Darth Vader, thousands of years too early, and with a welding mask helmet, you have the dark armor of a Force Hound. Despite offering good defense, as well as serving as a space suit, it doesn’t impede your movements in any way, and is good for inspiring fear in your opponents."
100 CP,Scrolls,Darth Bane Trilogy,"In the library of the Korriban academies, Bane refined his philosophy and grew to hate the Brotherhood. He spent days pouring through the wisdom of those who came before him, great Lords like Naga Sadow, Darth Revan or King Adas. These are similarly lost scrolls and manuscripts, detailing further thoughts and beliefs of these powerful Sith masters of old. All utterly unique and historically valuable beyond compare. There is nothing here to improve your mastery of the Force, nor is there any lost Sith schematics. Nonetheless their value should be evident to any lover of learning, these treatise and musings offering great insight into the lives of great men and women."
100 CP,Maul,Star Wars - Darth Plagueis,"The Rule of Two is quite explicit, there may only be two Sith Lords in the Order at any one time, but that doesn’t stop these Lords from training enforcers and assassins strong in the Dark Side to perform tasks one deigns beneath them or that may expose their identity should matters go awry. A disposable dagger or bludgeon for one’s enemies, these operatives are not privy to the wider political machinations or arcane secrets of their masters and thus cannot successfully attack the latter. Some years ago while visiting a remote world, a Force sensitive woman recognised you for what you were and gave you her newborn child in the hopes that it could live where there only death or slavery awaited it. Naturally you accepted, for even then the child was strong in the Force, and its life thus far has been spent training in the arts of stealth and combat. Whether they operate under the delusion that they are your apprentice or recognise the difference between themselves and a true student, they are deeply loyal to you and very resistant to attempts to ferret out your secrets. Their capture should remain a remote possibility however, as they are skilled enough with a lightsaber to match near any Jedi Knight or Master in battle."
100 CP,Book Of Sith,Star Wars - Darth Plagueis,"The Sith Order has a history as long and by far more glorious than that of the stagnant Jedi Order, unfortunately many of their contributions to philosophy, art and the Force have been either destroyed in ignorant purges of the Jedi or forgotten in ancient tombs and archives never to be read again. What scraps of ancient wisdom that remain however have become all the more valuable for their scarcity, and you have spent a number of years collating the writings of the greatest Sith Lords into a large tome that best condenses the disparate and evolving philosophies of the Order. While these pages don’t contain the methods of replicating powerful Force techniques of the ancient Sith, the insight it grants into their modes of thinking and personal lives might one day help you unearth all that they took to the grave. The book holds a number of blank pages, that will slowly fill out throughout the years with scraps on your own insights, short passages on the nature of the Force, the purposes of the Sith, the best ways to manipulate galactic events and similar musings for aspiring Dark Lords of the future."
100 CP,Combat Robes,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40k,The Jedi seem to prefer their simple robes despite participating in open combat. The Sith on the other hand seem to be far more prepared for combat. This is a set of Sith armor built to withstand a high degree of damage. This armor is incredibly resistant to blaster fire and can even take a blow from a lightsaber at least for a few seconds without damage. The armor on the robes is made to ensure that you maintain your maximum mobility without sacrificing armor.
100 CP,Force Grip,Star Wars - New Jedi Order,"Grabbing an opponent by the throat, or equivalent, to restrict their breathing. Very effective as a distraction, or to make a point."
100 CP,Loremaster,Star Wars - Dark Empire,"Darth Sidious was said to have mastered almost every single technique involving the Dark Side. While you’re not his equal by any means you’ve started down the path to mastering the force and have learned the same lesson he did. That the words of the ancients hold great power and wisdom for those who look. Any and all ancient holocrons, records, etc you find are now easier and more agreeable with you cracking them open to learn of their contents."
100 CP,Qixoni Crystal ,"Star Wars Movie Compilation : The Skywalker Saga Jumpchain
","A lightsaber crystal that not only enhances the users blade, but also strengthens their
Force powers. It can only be used by individuals who are aligned with the dark side of the Force."
100 CP,Inquisitor’s Armour,Star Wars - Rebels,"This and a grey and black bodysuit with armour – standard for the Empire’s Inquisitors. Optionally it may come with a distinct helmet that matches the armour and works to make you more intimidating. If you prefer, your armour may have any Imperial insignias removed – perhaps you want to look more like a lone darksider instead of a dog of the Empire? In any case, your attire fits you perfectly, and is self-cleaning and self-repairing. Should it be lost or destroyed, a replacement will appear in your Warehouse after 24 hours."
200 CP,Force Saber ,Star Wars - Dawn of the Jedi,"The iconic weapon of the Force Hound, and a direct cause of the collapse of the Je’daii Order, this flanged handle is powered by the wielder’s Dark Side power to emit a blade of pure energy. In a lot of ways it works like a lightsaber, but powered directly by the Force. I’ve jailbroken yours, so you can power it with any mystical or supernatural abilities you possess, and it won’t corrupt you to the Dark Side. You can choose to have a saber, a dual saber, or a saber pike."
200 CP,Power Hierarchy,Star Wars - Dawn of the Jedi,"Lacking any kind of moral or ethical framework, Rakatan society is based solely on power and a balance of distrust and fear. You are an expert in exerting your power and ensuring that your subordinates and peers fear you and fear and distrust each other too much to unite against you. Managing a hierarchy of evil is as easy as eating the heart of a subordinate who didn’t think you knew they were disloyal."
200 CP,Terrible Beauty,Darth Bane Trilogy,"A great number of the Sith of Kaan’s empire seem to have avoided the physically degenerative influence of the Dark Side on their bodies. In fact, many are famed for both their breathtaking beauty and maximal malevolence. You too seem to have been granted such a reprieve from the Force, being possessed of a similar level of near inhuman splendour and elegance. Using said beauty for quick trysts and long term dalliances would not be hard for you to accomplish."
200 CP,Unconventional Light weapon,Darth Bane Trilogy,"During long periods of conflict between the Jedi and Sith orders lightsaber design begins to become rather heterodox. This lightsaber doesn’t follow tradition design philosophy and can take the form of a any ‘edged’ melee weapon you could desire. It might be as simple as a double bladed lightsaber like the one to be adopted by Rain or it might be something truly unique like Githany’s lightwhip. If the plasma lacking equivalent primarily worked by drawing blood, you can design a lightsaber with it in mind."
200 CP,Sith Amulet,Darth Bane Trilogy,"Through sorcerous and alchemical workings, ancient Sith would creating beautiful jewellery with arcane properties. This is one such piece that hasn’t been ransacked or destroyed before your time. This amulet can grant the wielder the ability to read and understand ancient lost languages and promotes healing in its wearer, but it’s greatest gift lies in its amplification of the effects of Sith magic. Where without it a Sith Sorcery might blast the flesh from the bones of a single man, he could now strip an armoured six man group. This boost scales to the very height of sorceries, allowing the greatest practitioners to utterly eclipse their peers, perhaps literally."
200 CP,Hiding Darkness Within the Light,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40k,"Chancellor Palpatine was viewed by many as one of the most beloved and supported rulers the Republic ever had. What many did not realize before his grand reveal was that he was also the Sith Lord Sidious and one of the most evil beings in the galaxy. Even when Sidious was surrounded by the Jedi in the heart of their power none of them realized the threat was hiding amongst them. You will find yourself in a similar position as you have learned to perfectly conceal your nature. You will be capable of passing any test or block placed on you. Two examples of this would be an examination or an artifacts test. For the examination like Sidious even if a Jedi personally examined your energy thoroughly they would not be able to find anything abnormal about you that you didn't allow them to find. Secondly, regarding the test on the opposite side perhaps you found a weapon meant to be wielded by someone who was evil incarnate. Even if you were a righteous being you would be accepted by the weapon and could wield it to its fullest capabilities."
200 CP,These Are My Trophies ,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40k,The Sith have a habit of collecting trophies from their worthy adversaries such as competent Jedi. This is a similar collection of items collected from the worthy foes that you have faced. The important part is that almost all of these tools and weapons are of use in some way. For example if you killed a Jedi then like General Grievous you would gain a lightsaber to use. Should any of your trophies be destroyed or lost they will be replaced the next day. So you don’t have to worry about breaking the limited edition blaster you got from killing a named Clone Commander.
200 CP,Force Lightning ,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40k,Force lightning is a power normally associated with the dark side due to its immense power. This ability allows you to shoot streams of lighting from your hands. The most iconic display of this ability is when Palpatine uses this to kill Mace Windu and shouts UNLIMITED POWER!!!
200 CP,Memory Walk,Star Wars - New Jedi Order,"First invented in the Pius Dea era by the fanatical Jedi Vindicators, the memory walk is a technique where a target’s mind is invaded and their worst memories looped until the mind breaks. Naturally it proved of great interest to Sith and other darksiders."
200 CP,Reverse Choke,Star Wars - New Jedi Order,"The skill of using the Force to create a vacuum, literally sucking the air from an opponent’s lungs. One may consider that just a needlessly fancy version of the existing choke, but it does have the advantage of working on entities not susceptible to the Force."
200 CP,IT-O Interrogation Unit,"Star Wars Movie Compilation : The Skywalker Saga Jumpchain
",This droid was designed in order to coax information out of its designated targets. It has been programmed with all known methods of physical and psychological torture. This droid is able to set off large amounts of pain without causing the target any long term physical har
200 CP,Sith Holocron of Rituals,Tales of the Jedi,"This is a Holocron of a famous Sith Lord from the past, be it Marka Ragnos, Ajunta Pall, or any other. Either way, they will teach you some of the greatest Sith Sorceries in their arsenal, some that may even allow you to sever yourself from Life or death, or some other insane feat. However you have to fight for the respect of the Sith in the Holocron. Disappointing them may mean they will refuse to teach you until you do something impressive. Take care not to do something that will bring their ire. It may also be used to forcibly imbue another with Force Sensitivity after this Jump."
300 CP,Knights of Ren,Star Wars Sequel Trilogy V1.1,"Every cult needs to start somewhere, and you’ll find no followers more devoted than these knights. Each of these six is an unequalled master of martial prowess, boasting their own unique weapons and fighting styles. Additionally, these six have a steady sensitivity to the Force. Though they don’t have the skill or strength to match the Jedi knights of old, perhaps you could change that with time."
300 CP,Force Storm ,Star Wars - New Jedi Order,"You can access the raw, seething energies of hyperspace to summon forth a storm that can tear apart worlds. You can shape this into wormholes for getting around the galaxy at unimaginable speeds. This is normally an absurdly dangerous and difficult power to use, but you are now the undisputed master of the technique."
300 CP,Force Rage,KOTOR,"A Force power that, when activated, sends you into a berserk state that slows down your perception of time, and significantly increases your strength, speed and endurance. This power can only remain active for short periods of time, and will leave you exhausted when deactivated."
400 CP,Meritocratic Distribution,Darth Bane Trilogy,"The Sith stand as equals now, as allies working towards a common goal. An equal distribution of rewards and prestige is perhaps expected, at least amongst all the Lords. However some are a little more equal than other, a few are a lot more equal. You belong to the latter camp, being lavished with gold where your allies may only be gifted silver. A joint venture to capture a Star system results in you gain the garden world and resource rich planets and asteroids. You’ll almost always get a bigger slice of the proverbial pie and won’t receive any of the resentment that you’d rightfully earn from it."
400 CP,"Sorcery",Darth Bane Trilogy,"The Force is not always manifested in the same way by all of its wielders. Many different Force groups exist across the Galaxy, with their own practices and deviations from what the layman might see as the the norm. Some Jedi might not have any talent for telekinesis, but may also possess greater access to the minds of others. However some Sith possess abilities truly strange and potent. Sorcery may be the name primitive societies give to the Force, but it is the only truly appropriate one for what you can do. Magics and alchemy no longer elude you, indeed your talent for them is great. In time, with many rituals and dark workings, you may discover powers that some would consider to be... unnatural. Warping the weather, obliterating the minds and bodies of your victims, transferring your consciousness and vital self to a new body will be the least of such sorcery. Alchemical abominations against nature like the War Behemoth or the Chrysalide Rancor, Force enhanced weaponry, Sith spit and biomechanical undead come together in your laboratories."
400 CP,Notes of Belia Darzu,Darth Bane Trilogy,"It seems there’s no need for you to brave the deep core to reach Tython, for you already have extensive notes detailing the work of the Dark Lord Belia Darzu - a master of the Sith Force technique of mechu-deru. This technique allows its practitioners to exert their influence over inanimate and robotic constructs. Through mechu-deru, mechanical structures could be bound to the will of the user and imbued with the power of the Force itself. Belia Darzu took it to an extreme in her creation of Technobeasts, Part machine, part organic alchemical constructs, these monsters infect living organisms with the nanogene spore, a technovirus that slowly lobotomises victims as they transition into loyal weaponised cyborgs. All of Darzu’s workings are detailed in these notes; with extensive study you may produce plagues beyond even her galaxy shaking abomination."
400 CP,The Rule of Two,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40k,"There normally are only two Sith at a time, a master and an apprentice. A third will only appear once one of these two has chosen a new apprentice of their own and they decide to eliminate the other. Doing this however requires that you have a student worthy of taking this position. This perk grants you two main boons. The first is that you will find yourself running into talented students worthy of being nurtured. Many of these individuals are worthy of being cultivated, but every now and then you will encounter a true diamond in the rough. The second boon is that you will be endowed with teaching skills ensuring that these students are able to reach their full capabilities."
400 CP,Sith Alchemy,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40k,"Sith alchemy is a variation of Sith magic used to create powerful relics of the dark side. Two examples of the more common techniques are the Mask technique and creating Sithspawn. The Mask is a form of fleshcrafting used to reshape an individual's appearance at the molecular level. Sithspawn are beings who have been altered using Sith Alchemy. These beings become far more brutal, intelligent, and loyal to their new maker. A third and notable power is the ability to manipulate the midichlorian count of other beings. Overall Sith alchemy gives you a wide range of abilities related to creation covering the fields of metallurgy and flesh craft."
400 CP,Sceptre of Marko Ragnos,Star Wars - New Jedi Order,"A large rod with the unique power to drain the Force from areas, shoot it as powerful laser beams or infuse it into new targets. With enough energy, you could raise the dead, or make a force-user of an ordinary sapient. Perhaps with time and study you may learn to strip the unworthy of the Force with it."
400 CP,The Wayfinder,Star Wars - Dark Empire,"Recovering the legacy of an order that has been destroyed, and lost, and deliberately suppressed is no simple task. All the commonly known sources of Jedi lore were plundered by the Empire long ago, and either destroyed or taken to one of Palpatine’s hidden caches. Fortunately, you have this fancy compass. This doesn’t point to one point, but rather to the next step in finding the nearest source of Jedi lore. In future jumps this will instead point the way toward caches of lost or forgotten lore or artifacts. Once you’ve found a location using this device, you can re-attune it to lead you back with a moment of effort."
400 CP,"Clones, Clones and More Clones!",Star Wars - Dark Empire,"This is interesting, is it not? Located in a location of your choice is now a set of twelve cloning tubes, each holding within a perfect, or, to be more precise, as close as one can get, copy of you in your prime within. On their own the vessels are empty of sapience and intent, making them well suited to be used as replacements should your own body falter. Of course, a master of the dark side could certainly find other uses for such superb specimens, I imagine. Naturally, the clones will replenish within a day should they be used."
400 CP,Force Sorcerer ,"Star Wars Movie Compilation : The Skywalker Saga Jumpchain
","Though this perk you gain knowledge of how to practice Allyan Magic, Death magic, Gungan magic, Shadow Magic, Sith alchemy, Sith magic, Totem magic and Tulgah Sorcery which are all ways to the use of the Force and Force powers to wield a form of magic. Using this Perk you can incorporate the properties of other catch-all terms for energy powers and abilities such as Ki, Magic, Psionics or Kinesis in order to make them each stronger than they would be separately and have any of the overlapping capabilities multiply."

full potential."
400 CP,Exar Kun’s Amulet,Tales of the Jedi,"This amulet is the same that Freedon Nadd once held, except unlike that one which has a twin, this one is somehow the complete pair in one form. With this amulet your Sith Sorceries are several times stronger than they would normally be, and if used with a certain ritual may even allow you to execute a ritual to gain immortality. That is not all either, within the amulet several dozen Sith Lords of your choice lie, and you may use them to gain more knowledge of the Dark Side of the Force."
500 CP,Sith’ari,Darth Bane Trilogy,"Despite the implications of its name, this perk doesn’t necessarily make you the prophesied Sith that would be granted the title. It instead serves to draw you towards widely influential events, places and people. Stalemated battles that could use your input, buried paths to knowledge esoteric or profane, and public figures that could be felled or upholstered if a guiding hand was applied."
600 CP,Star Forge,Star Wars - Dawn of the Jedi,"The Star Forge doesn’t actually appear in the Dawn of the Jedi series, but it’s the ultimate war resource of the Rakatan Infinite Empire. Using the power of the Dark Side, and matter drawn from a star it can churn out endless numbers of warships and war machines. Your copy has been altered like so many of the items here so it will work using any supernatural power you possess and will not corrupt people unless you want it to."
600 CP,Welcome to My Mind ,Star Wars - Dawn of the Jedi,"Lesser beings may strive desperately to keep enemies out of their mind. You can invite them in, secure in the knowledge that your mind is a cage and a far more dangerous environment than any mere deathtrap.

Quite quickly, those who think to break you will find themselves broken in turn.
"
600 CP,Darth Declaration,Darth Bane Trilogy,"Peace is a lie, there is only passion. Through passion, I gain strength. Through strength, power. Through power, victory. Through victory, my chains are broken. The Force shall free me. These are the words the Sith have operated under for millennia, the key steps to their unbelievable power. Kaan and his ilk have locked the Sith on the precipice of freedom, quashing their potential for power, through the  propagation of their delusion that all Sith Lords are equals. You recognise this as the lie it is. Perhaps you’ve declared yourself a Darth, perhaps an Emperor over your vassals, most definitely a being worthy
of the Sith. In recognising your superiority to your so called peers, you’ve broken your chains and found power. Paths to personal power open up readily to you, like the Force or your destiny has been waiting to reward one as enlightened as you. Whether it be learning secrets of the arcane, taking parsecs of territory or in ensuring your Dynasty; you find great power comes to you almost without effort."
600 CP,Soul Gestalt,Darth Bane Trilogy,"A warehouse addition. Although the Force Bomb may not be detonated with your presence in this galaxy, you now have a connection to a similar collection of souls to the one that held well over a hundred disembodied Force users. These spirits will never try to subvert you, and communication may be broken anytime you will it. They only wish to offer you advice and companionship should you ask for it, as well as the knowledge each could provide. If you would allow it, these souls can fortify your will and mind in times of duress and suffering, granting you the absolutely indomitable control of hundreds of Jedi  Masters and Sith Lords."
600 CP,Korriban Academy,Darth Bane Trilogy,"Korriban has long stood as a beacon of Sith might in the stars. It was the home of the original Sith people and the exiled Jedi. It has been one of the first planets reconquered by the Sith whenever they resurge. Korriban exists as their enduring legacy, still proudly displaying the tombs of Kings and Gods to the open sky. Above the Valley of Kings, greatest of the Sith of old, sits the Korriban Academy. This school has played host to some of the greatest Sith to ever cut through the Galaxy. Currently under the control of Lord Qordis, the school serves to shape the young Sith into powerful and precise weapons of the Brotherhood’s will. With this purchase you will be made headmaster of this most illustrious school. When training under its roof you’ll find the rate of advancement for your seemingly supernatural talents will rise immensely. A little difficult to quantify, you’ll find yourself progressing faster than one would think possible. The Academy will follow you to future worlds with a reputation as a prestigious and storied centre of academia."
600 CP,Darth Andeddu’s Writings,Darth Bane Trilogy,"Darth Andeddu was one of the few figures in history to have mastered the technique of Essence Transferal. This technique allows one to persist past their corporeal form and take the bodies of others for their own. Unlike what one may find in the tomb on Prakith, these detail a whole new level of Essence Transferal for he or she who would take this route to immortality. Unfortunately for most, transferring such vast amounts of Dark power to a new body causes it to rapidly degrade and forces them to move on or risk being consigned to The Void. With this purchase, you need not worry about such an eventuality. You may perfectly transfer yourself to a new host body, maintaining it and all your abilities perfectly for as long as you’d otherwise naturally live."
600 CP,The Heart ,Star Wars - Darth Plagueis,"Love. It is not a world customarily used by the Sith, but no word could better describe your unconditional attachment to this place and what it represents for your past and future  oth. This is an immense laboratory complex, filled with countless biological specimens in various stages of vivisection. To the naked eye their appears little similarity to these species, but should one reach out with the Force, they would realise that all share an unusual relationship with it. Some boast a resistance to its influence, able to deny the Force in an area around them, others can use it in ways not yet possible for the Sith and some are just sapient beings with a strong connection to it that you sought to study to better understand yourself. There are many experiments being conducted in this place, by loyal and secure droids, that would serve any alchemist among the Sith well and you’ll find any such experiments you oversee will produce a wealth of useful data and insights into the relationship between biological life and the Force. A few years spent in these halls could give rise to all manner of abominations, viable clone life and Force powers over life that could have alluded you for a lifetime without the facility. In future worlds they specimens may be changed or expanded to allow for you to better study similarly abnormal lifeforms appropriate to those worlds, with their own unique relationships to seemingly supernatural phenomena and principles."
600 CP,The Rakghoul Plague,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40k,"The Rakghoul plague is one of the most horrific weapons created by the Sith. This plague is capable of infecting any other creature with the exception of Force-sensitives and certain species of aliens. The virus can be spread through injuries created by the Rakghoul and the Muur Talisman. Choosing this option will grant you the Muur Talisman and it will be bonded to you so that no one else can control the plague. In addition, any Rakghoul created using these methods will be loyal to you or anyone else you designate with authority."
600 CP,Strike Me Down ,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40k,"Palpatine originally planned to seize Anakin's body so that he could utilize his power, but this plan was ruined after Anakin sustained his injuries turning him into Darth Vader. This would have occurred when Anakin struck him down in his rage allowing Sidious’s spirit to devour Anakin's soul and claim his body. You will now possess a similar ability. If someone kills you while they are filled with rage then you will be able to take their body for your own. This will combine the powers that you possess alongside theirs. This however will do nothing should their heart be filled with justice or they be at peace."
600 CP,Strange Datacube,Star Wars - Dark Empire,"Well what do we have here? Something the rebels would undoubtedly kill to get their hands on. Taking the shape of a small datacube, this device holds the schematics for all of the technologies used by the Galactic Empire and the Resurgent Dark Empire. This contains every superweapon, warship, droid, etc built by both Empires during their respective lifetimes, even if their use was limited, such as in the case of the Dark Troopers. Imagine what you could do if you plugged this into a World Devastator?"
600 CP,The Emperor’s Citadel,Star Wars - Dark Empire,"What is a Wizard without his tower? Not much of one if you ask me, fortunately, that's not an issue for you. Located on a planet of your choosing in the galaxy is a massive black and red tower protruding high into the skyline, the structure is an exact copy of Emperor Palpatine’s own citadel and contains anything a master of the Dark Side could want. Ranging from alchemical laboratories, sublevel breeding facilities and a vast library containing an immense amount of valuable knowledge of the ways of the force. The citadel itself is maintained by an army of maintenance droids and Dark Acolytes or other type of followers who keep it clean and running.
