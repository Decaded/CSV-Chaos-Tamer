100 CP,I want them alive ,Star Wars Movie Compilation : The Skywalker Saga Jumpchain,If you tell your subordinates that a target is needed to be captured alive they will not be capable of killing their targets.

1000 CP,Superweapon ,Star Wars - New Jedi Order,"The galaxy is nothing if not littered with ancient doomsday weapons or the fragments of the same. Purchase of this will grant one canonical superweapon, fully functional and factory fresh. Perhaps a planet-buster like the Death Star or Galaxy Gun, a more restrained version like the Eclipse-Class Super Star Destroyer or Eye of Palpatine. Or would you prefer an industrial threat like a World Devastator or Star Forge? Or the fun-sized packet of a Star Crusher, the mysterious Centerpoint Station... look, you have a lot of options. Just be careful, when you have a massive hammer, people can start to look like nails."
1000 CP,Death Star ,Star Wars Movie Compilation : The Skywalker Saga Jumpchain,"Referred to as the Ultimate Weapon the Death Star is a moon-sized, deep-space mobile battle station constructed by the Galactic Empire. It is designed to fire a single planet-destroying superlaser powered by massive Kyber crystals which would destroy any planet targeted. The Death Star can be placed within a warehouse extension perfectly sized for it and the station is capable of creating doorways into any of your warehouse extensions and rooms with a Toggleable setting anyone who enters them from the Death Star itself having their perception altered so that they believe they are still within the Death Star structure."
1000 CP,Death Star II ,Star Wars Movie Compilation : The Skywalker Saga Jumpchain,"This massive battlestation was constructed by the Galactic Empire. It was larger and more powerful than the first Death Star but with finer control. This version is fully complete but an Alt-Form that allows it to appear in the incomplete state of the canon version, it also possesses millions of millimeter-wide exhaust ports scattered over the surface of the station removing its fatal weaknesses. The most prominent weapon on the Death Star II is its immense superlaser which is capable of destroying a planet with a single blast. Unlike the original the concave focusing dish consists of seven smaller equal sized beams circling the dish and one larger beam located in the center, which are directly by the station's hypermatter reactor into a single destructive beam and thereby require minutes instead of hours to recharge. The Death Star can be placed within a warehouse extension perfectly sized for it and can import any warehouse extensions within its shell with the inside space becoming larger than the outsize if necessary to accommodate the extension."
1000 CP,StarKiller Base ,Star Wars Movie Compilation : The Skywalker Saga Jumpchain,"This mobile planetcraft was once the ice world of Ilum and is protected by planetary shields which protect it from outside forces and keep the atmospheric temperature within liveable ranges, allowing it to function as a habitable world even when it is in an absolute void. The planetcraft is armed with a superweapon that functions by siphoning a star and storing  stellar energy. Your version has unlimited energy storage. When fired it is capable of destroying entire star systems halfway across the galaxy by opening a hyperspace tunnel and projecting the concentrated energy of the star into its target, essentially throwing the star into it at hyperspace speeds."
200 CP,Praetorian Guard:,Star Wars Sequel Trilogy V1.1,"If it’s bodyguards you seek, look no further. This purchase nets you eight expert warriors who will protect you with fervent zeal. They may not be Force users themselves, but they have the training and fearlessness to tackle any Jedi or Sith. Unlike Snoke’s personal guard, these soldiers work in perfect tandem to coordinate your defence."
200 CP,Plundered Reparations,Darth Bane Trilogy,"The conquering army often bleeds the lands they invade dry. Gold, cultural relics and land leave the hands of the native population and enters into those of a new elite. You may not have been involved with the planetary conquest itself, but you’ve certainly profited from it. Enough valuable metals, gemstones and priceless artifacts to buy you a continent or two should you ever wish to retire to a verdant garden world. Beyond such obscenely expensive purchases this is quite hard to use or shift, what with it being a small hill of riches that weigh several hundred thousand metric tonnes"
200 CP,Walking Throne,Star Wars: The Phantom Menace – The Reddit Edition V1.1,"Sure, you could just walk... but then how could you show your superiority? You have a somewhat spider-like walking throne like the one belonging to Nute Gunray of the Trade Federation, allowing you to relax on your way to your destination."
200 CP,You Could Be Court-Martialed for This ,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40k,When the Jedi plan their operation to retake Axum and Anaxes they realize that they will need a massive amount of manpower to do this. As they contemplate this issue a number of the Clone Commanders step forward and pledge their forces. They refuse to stand by and wait for the senate to vote when their people are dying in droves. They agree that even if they are imprisoned for this they will happily assist in any way they can. You will find that any of the soldiers or forces that serve under you will develop a similar sense of loyalty. This effect will work on anyone even if you are only placed in command temporarily. You will become the highest authority in their hearts and they will answer should you call upon them.
200 CP,Discipline Beyond Measure ,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40k,Perhaps the greatest strength of the clones is their sheer discipline and adaptability. Even the Imperium acknowledges that the clones possess discipline that would cause envy in any regiment. By taking this perk you and any forces you command will now do so as well. Your forces will never break and will gain the ability to rapidly adapt to any fight. For example if a tactic was not working they would quickly utilize every tool they had to identify their foes weakness and then pounce on it.

change size and shape to accommodate anyone who is to battle within it.

200 CP,Stormtroopers,Empire at War,"The best of the Empire’s main base of infantry, stormtroopers
are far more disciplined and effective in combat than the minimally trained recruits of the
Imperial Army, having received full training before being deployed, and can actually hit
their marks unlike what common misconceptions may say. Each trooper comes with full
body armor and E-11 blasters, along with anything else an imperial stormtrooper is
expected to have. You gain a regiment’s worth of these troopers. Respawn monthly."
300 CP,General Grievous (Legends) ,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40k,"General Grievous is a very powerful warrior, but his true version is far above what was shown originally. He is an incredibly powerful warrior and a nearly unmatched strategic genius. For  eference he defeated an entire squad of Space Marines on his own without any trouble granted they were injured. He possesses the attitude of a warrior and believes that worthy opponents should be given a chance to die with honor. This attitude earned him the respect of the Crimson Razors even if they still hated him.

He will never betray you and should you fall he would see the galaxy burn in order to avenge you. You may choose the exact nature of your relationship."

400 CP,Elite Guard ,Star Wars - Darth Plagueis,"While it is true that few beings exist that could directly challenge a Sith Lord, even should they attack en-masse, the current custodians of the Force may notice should you fail to be circumspect in your use of your powers. That is why you have secured the protection of a company of soldiers akin to the Sun Guard, one hundred and forty four elite warriors utterly loyal to you, each being well provisioned and skilled in countless forms of warfare, sabotage and espionage. To a man they are all exceptional warriors, easily a rival for the infamous Mandalorian clans, and a number of your personal guard are mildly Force Sensitive, not to an extent that they could be Sith but they will possess frightening reflexes, coordination and an intuition for threats beyond any other, and they’ll quickly adapt to perform any task asked of them. They also prove implausibly resistant to interrogation should one be captured, being well inured to torture or methods of mind control, and inevitably finding ways to commit suicide should escape seem unlikely. Should any of your guard die, eager recruits from their ancestral clan will arrive to fill in for their fallen predecessor."
400 CP,Private Retreat ,Star Wars - Darth Plagueis,"The galaxy is an unfathomably large area from arm to arm, consisting of too many stars and planetoids to count and twenty thousand years has proven to be far too short a time for civilisations to settle in many of these systems. You have hyperspace coordinates to an otherwise unvisited star system, around a planet of which is a habitable moon that you own. Whether it’s legally registered to you, a corporation in which you hold great wealth or completely off the galactic books; none care to contest your claim nor to investigate what you do with your property. The environment, flora and fauna, whether native or artificially wrought, are entirely natural at present and the only structures on the surface consist of luxurious accommodations for yourself and hundreds of high status guests. This alone is not an exceptional prize for a wealthy noble or plutocrat, let alone a Sith Lord, but you’re also well connected to various contractors willing to discretely build and supply nearly anything you desire for your world. Endangered, predatory species so that you may engage in the most primal of blood sports? A luxurious pleasure palace filled with the finest dishes, narcotics and slaves available in the galaxy? An immensely dangerous racing circuit for one of the most thrilling pod-race tracks this side of Coruscant? Almost anything can be supplied so long as you and yours could derive enjoyment or relaxation from it and these clandestine contractors seem to receive their ample payments without your own accounts shrinking in response. Should you tire of one configuration, just contact them again to remove or replace the facilities and it’ll be like the former had never been present."
400 CP,Mining World ,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40k,"In order to produce droids a large amount of materials must be gathered continuously. To deal with this issue the Separatist sought out planets with large amounts of materials. This is one of those worlds, it is filled with numerous large mines that ship out materials for production. This planet will be able to produce an unlimited amount of different materials however you will need to harvest them. Lastly you may choose the exact composition of the planet. For example you could choose for the planet to be made of adamantium."
400 CP,Battle Meditation,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40k,Battle meditation is a powerful technique used to enhance the combat prowess and morale of individuals. Skilled users of this power are capable of using this ability to affect entire armies giving them enhanced coordination and cooperation. The effects of this power can also be reversed targeting your enemies' morale weakening them.
400 CP,Grace of the Emperor,Star Wars - Dark Empire,"Oftentimes in the world, how much you succeed is completely dependent on your superiors and their relationship with you. Someone competent and skilled may very well be passed over for a lesser candidate simply because they’re not as liked as them. You very fortunately don’t have to worry about that anymore, when it comes to superiors so long as you don’t intentionally aggravate and attack them you’ll always find favor with them. You’ll get the best posts, assignments, and always be among the first to be promoted, all things of great importance, especially when serving the likes of Darth Sidious."
400 CP,World Devastators,Star Wars - Dark Empire,"Well, not multiple but instead just one. But don’t worry it’s a start and one is the equivalent of many more. This juggernaut is bigger than an Imperial Star Destroyer and virtually indestructible, easily sustaining continuous bombardments from capital ships. Of course that’s not where it shines; this black giant is in fact a giant moving factory, using the giant opening on the front it sucks matter into its Molecular Furnace which would then turn it into raw material with which the machine would turn into a variety of war droids, starfighters,  etc. Though they aren’t just limited to that, building new World Devastators is well within their capacity and they also improve themselves continuously, ensuring no Devastator is the same. So take comfort in that fact that you hold in your hand the power to damn worlds and drown Empires in an endless horde of machines. Of note is that unlike Palpatine’s or the ones in the Strange Datacube this one and all its “children” are unable to be subverted or turned against you by anything."
400 CP,The Invisible Hand ,Star Wars Movie Compilation : The Skywalker Saga Jumpchain,"This modified Providence-class Dreadnought is propelled by a triad of Creveld-4 radial drives with each equipped with emergency booster engines, the ship has a Class 1.0 hyperdrive generator and 10 supplementary Class 10.0 generators all together making it incredibly maneuverable.

400 CP,Shield Generator Facility,Star Wars Movie Compilation : The Skywalker Saga Jumpchain,You gain a full shield facility that once placed in a setting and activated will be able to perfectly protect any external target.

400 CP,Terror Force,Star Wars - The Force Unleashed,"A gift from the Empire to you, you now have ownership of a task force of the Empire’s Terror Droids. The force is equipped with four different types of droids: Terror Droids, which are small spider like creations that use melee combat and grasp their opponents to launch vicious melee attacks; Terror Troopers, humanoid droids equipped with advanced stealth technology and weapons meant to quickly move in and out of dangerous situations without leaving a trace; Terror Bioroids, large hulking machines equipped with two bladed arms capable of posing a challenge to Jedi although they come with their own weaknesses; and finally the Terror Walkers; these monstrosities are four legged juggernauts equipped with energy projectors, shields, missiles, and sharpened legs, each one capable of slaughtering basic soldiers en masse or board an enemy ship with minimal support, and is typically viewed as nigh unstoppable..

This 1,600 meter behemoth is crewed by a little over 37,000 naval personnel, and is able to slug it out with nearly any other ship in the galaxy and come out triumphant due to its formidable weapons complement consisting of 12 heavy turbolasers, 60 twin turbolaser batteries, 60 ion cannons, 2 heavy ion cannons, and its complement of 72 starfighters. You gain 1 Imperial Star Destroyer and its crew. Respawns monthly."

400 CP,Lucrehulk-class Droid Control Ship ,Star Wars Movie Compilation : The Skywalker Saga Jumpchain,"This ship acts more as a mobile space station with a central sphere which acts as the ship's bridge and reactor assembly. The major feature of this ship is that it can mass produce droids and is able to control them using its array of Broadcast equipment. This ship is able to mass produce basic B-1 Battle Droids, Vulture Droids, C-9979 landing craft, Multi-Troop Transports,Armored Assault Tanks and Platoon Attack Craft though they will not be fiatbacked."
500 CP,Mandator II-class Star Dreadnought,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40k,"This is a powerful ship employed by the Galactic Republic after they realized that their ships were outclassed by the Imperial Navy. This ship was able to single handedly fight off a force of 1,000 escorts at once. This is one of the much heavier combat ships whose use was implemented to supplement the Venator Class starships. Its main advantages are that this variant of dreadnoughts are much more heavily armored and armed compared to other Republic vessels."
500 CP,Ion Cannon ,Star Wars Movie Compilation : The Skywalker Saga Jumpchain,This giant cannon can carve up an ion blast that will disable any electronics within a mile of the impact zone with greater charges increasing the intensity of the electrical interference and the range that the impact has.

600 CP,Art of War,Darth Bane Trilogy,"This war is slowing down, the Sith advance making less and less progress as the Republic finally mobilises itself. Both sides will come to a realisation that they’re quite well matched. Cold wars and battles of attrition don’t appeal to you, a conflict is supposed to reach a conclusion. Ensure that it does. In all matters of strategy and tactics you are a maestro, an artisan without compare. Your battle plans are deceptive, subtle and chillingly conclusive. You’re easily on par with figures like the Jedi Revan or Mitth'raw'nuruodo, ensuring your sides “victory”. This orchestration translates to any scale of battle in which you care to participate. Whether leading a four person squad or directing numerous fleets in several systems, you’re all but guaranteed victory barring extraordinary circumstances like a twelve to one confrontation or meeting a similarly brilliant mind."
600 CP,Face of the Conflict,Darth Bane Trilogy,"General Hoth, Lord Kaan and, now, you. These three possess the raw charisma and force of will to respectively militarise, as well as essentially take over, the Jedi Order, to change the fundamental nature of the Sith and to do whatever it is you plan to do with this purchase. Your presence, oration, charm, interpersonal skills and tangible convictions are increased drastically. Words pass your lips and the world responds, if not without several million middle persons. Persuade a proud King to surrender without a single battle, seduce a Jedi Master or a droid and convert crowds into fervent supporters of a cause they’ve only just been introduced to. Irrespective of whether or not your greatness has been determined by the Force, in time all may acknowledge it."
600 CP,Lord of the Fleet ,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40k,"To bring out the best of a fleet might you need someone who can truly command the ships and direct them at their whims. There are many individuals who are capable of this feat, but some stand out amongst the rest. Some notable examples of this are Grand Moff Tarkin, Grand Admiral Thrawn, Omega, and Chapter Master Orion. You now can be counted amongst these ranks and perhaps even stand at the top. Given time you could become the most feared and respected strategist in the galaxy. Few if any will survive a battle with you unless they possess overwhelming force and even then their victory is not guaranteed."

These skills and tactical abilities allowed him to become known as the Bane of the Crimson Razors with the run down and ruined forces of the Confederacy. Perhaps with time you will gain a similar title.

The main feature of the planet is the massive cloning facilities responsible for supplying the Republic with a clone army. This planet will come fully staffed by the Kaminoans who will be capable of creating clones for you. They will be capable of creating a clone of anything as long as you can provide a proper template for them. They will also be capable of making some modifications to the clones should you wish to alter them in some way. The only restriction is that the clones will be created as infants. So it will take a few years for these beings to be ready in any meaningful way.
600 CP,Droid Production Plants,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40k,The bulk of the Separatist and Sith armies are made up of Droids. These forces range from the simple B1 battle droids all the way to the massive Vulture Droids that function as their main space fighters.

This facility will come with the blueprints for every piece of machinery used by the Sith. Aside from this the planet will come with a defense fleet on par with the ones used to guard any of the other major production centers.

Under your command is a single Eclipse-Class Super Star Destroyer identical to Palpatine’s flagship. This monster is an absolute terror to face and represents the pinnacle of Imperial Naval technology; armed with five hundred and fifty heavy laser cannons and another five hundred turbolasers this ship is capable of easily smashing almost any other Star Wars ship in a straight slugfest. What it can’t beat in such a fight can easily be annihilated with its axial superlaser which is strong enough to crack planetary shields and slag continents and hit moving targets in battle. The ship is also equipped with ten gravity well generators to ensure opponents can’t make a run for it and a compliment of 600 TIE Interceptors and 96 TIE Bombers for fighter purposes.

600 CP,Jumper’s Militia,Star Wars - The Force Unleashed,"Much like a certain Jedi you didn’t trust the Clone soldiers of the Republic for one reason or another and instead elected to go another route and recruit your own army of volunteers for the Clone Wars. While these men and women are nowhere near as numerous as the armies of the Galactic Empire and only number about 500,000 they are still well trained and battle hardened veterans of the Clone Wars. They also come equipped with mid-tier weaponry and a small fleet of Clone Wars era warships."
