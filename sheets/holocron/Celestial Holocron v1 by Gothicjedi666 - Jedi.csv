100 CP,Mind of a Jed,Star Wars - Jedi Apprentice Jump,"The Jedi have several techniques for absorbing, recalling, and processing information, capable of recalling even something as detailed as a map they saw for several seconds, hours after the fact, and during a life or death moment to boot. Jedi are also able to experience years of traumatic missions, and while they are still affected by these traumas, most are able to move on and maintain a healthy mental state. You have internalized these aspects of the Jedi and possess crystal clear memory and instantaneous recall. Even better, you are guaranteed to recover from any mental traumas you receive. This might take a few weeks for some of the more disturbing things you encounter on your missions and a few months for failing to save a loved one. But even encountering something beyond reality would only break you for a couple of years at most and each time you recover from such trauma you will find yourself a little more resistant to similar traumas afterwards."
100 CP,The Code,Star Wars - Jedi Apprentice Jump,"This perk helps a Padawan stay with the Jedi code. It allows you to easily realize whatever social norms or rules there are in a place, society or order and provides a subtle instinct to follow to prevent you from straying from the path. In this jump it defaults to the Jedi code, but in future settings you may continue to follow the Code, choose a new Code to follow, or the generic local social norms, customs, and taboos. These instincts may be overruled or toggled on/off at will. Reciting the code will dramatically reduce any temptations you may have to break it. And finally, you may share your current code with anyone willing to learn, providing them a lesser form of this perk."
100 CP,Trusted Teacher ,Star Wars - Jedi Apprentice Jump,"One of the most important duties of a Jedi Knight, and an unofficial requirement for eventual promotion to Jedi Master, is to train the next generation in the ways of the Jedi. However, all the teachings in the world won’t accomplish anything if others don’t trust you enough to listen. Fortunately, that isn’t an issue for you. You have a natural air about you that conveys that you’re a good teacher. This doesn’t help you with the actual teaching, but it will help you avoid getting mistaken for a creepy old man with a strange van offering candy."
100 CP,Padawan Robes ,Star Wars - Jedi Apprentice Jump,"A set of self-cleaning robes you receive upon being accepted as a Padawan. These robes may be customized for a more personal look and have the effect of causing you to be underestimated as “just an apprentice”, so long as you are attached to someone higher ranking than yourself."
100 CP,Je'daii Katana,Star Wars - Dawn of the Jedi," Before the coming of the Force Hound Xesh, the Je’daii wielded swords that look remarkably similar to japanese katanas. These weapons were empowered by alchemy, making it preternaturally strong and sharp. This one, through the grace of the Benefactor, is even tougher, and cannot be easily sundered, even by a Force Saber. While a Katana is the most common form, your weapon could take the form of any one or 2 handed unpowered melee weapon."
100 CP,The Heart of the Guardian ,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40k,The Heart of the Guardian is an ancient crystal used by the redeemed Jedi Master Revan. When placed inside a lightsaber this crystal provides a powerful enhancement. The blade will become a fast yet devastatingly sharp blade. This can be used to upgrade any lightsaber to a much higher level. Perhaps you could learn how to recreate the crystal by studying it.
100 CP,Force Barrier,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40k,"The Force barrier is a simple, but incredibly useful power. This ability allows the user to
generate a shield of pure Force energy around their bodies. This shield is capable of
protecting you from various amounts of damage based on the strength of the user. For
example a youngling could probably block one blaster bolt, but Yoda could block a blast
from the main gun of a heavy tank."
100 CP,Force Control ,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40k,"Force Control refers to the ability in which the Force Users channels the force throughout
their bodies. This grants them superhuman strength and agility. The most common display
of this power is when they sprint as fast as a vehicle or are capable of jumping immense
heights."
100 CP,Ahsoka Tano,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40k,Ahsoka Tano is one of the most famous and respected members of the Jedi Order before she chose to leave the Order. Since then this spunky force user has acted to protect innocents wherever she goes. Ahsoka is one of the kindest members of the Jedi and one of the only people to genuinely believe that peace could occur between the Republic and the Imperium. Additionally she is actually one of the most powerful force users in the galaxy and most skilled duelists produced by the Jedi Order. She currently is still young and has yet to fully draw out her potential. Should she survive long enough or receive your assistance will be capable of even surpassing her Legends counterpart.
100 CP,Force Speed,Star Wars - The New Jedi Order,"Jedi are known for their incredible reflexes, but you can sprint faster than the eye can follow and cross a large room a lot faster than most foes could aim at you."
100 CP,Force Jump ,Star Wars - The New Jedi Order,"Extremely common power, you can leap up over eight times your height, and slow your falls to make any one survivable."
100 CP,Force Suppression,Star Wars Movie Compilation : The Skywalker Saga Jumpchain,"You are able to hide your force capabilities from the senses of others deceiving them into
thinking that your capabilities are weaker, stronger or non-existent."
100 CP,Jedi business go back to your drinks,Star Wars Movie Compilation : The Skywalker Saga Jumpchain,Whenever you cause a disturbance you are able to cause onlookers to lose interest in your actions by saying that it is official business for one group or another. This will not prev people from remembering your actions or interfering in what you're doing if your actions are related to them but if someone is not related to your actions they will ignore them.
100 CP,I’m Luke Skywalker I’m here to rescue you,Star Wars Movie Compilation : The Skywalker Saga Jumpchain,When rescuing someone you will be able to make them instinctively know that you are there to help them and how dependable you are.
100 CP,Solari Crystal ,KOTOR ,"A lightsaber crystal that not only enhances the users blade, but also strengthens their willpower. It can only be used by individuals who are aligned with the light side of the Force."
200 CP,Lightsaber Talent,Star Wars - Jedi Apprentice Jump,"Not skill, but a talent for learning and using one of the seven acknowledged Lightsaber forms. This may be purchased multiple times for a new form each time."
200 CP,Aura of Serenity,Star Wars - Jedi Apprentice Jump,"Within their duty Masters realized the importance of keeping a clear head. This perk allows not only others in your immediate vicinity to remain level-headed even in severe emotional turmoil, but it also causes them to view you with respect while exposed to this Aura. It remains ineffective to those openly hostile to you."
200 CP,Alchemical Beast ,Star Wars - Dawn of the Jedi,"Unlike the Jedi, the Je’daii do not disdain the art of alchemy, nor the process of altering living creatures. Here you have a force-imbued non-sentient living creature. Flying Rancor-dragons are a favorite, but you may choose any non-sentient living force creature, though copies of ones created with Sith Alchemy may be slightly different for having been created by a process in balance.
"
200 CP,Force Crystals,Star Wars - Dawn of the Jedi,"A rock that would be useful for any budding Force artificer. This boulder has crystals growing on it, but not just any crystals. It grows all manner of non-unique force crystals. Perfect for crafting force sabers, lightsabers, focuses, and holocrons. If a crystal is broken off a new one will soon grow in its place."
200 CP,Precision and Definition,Darth Bane Trilogy,"A true Master understands the need for a softer touch at times, to avoid frivolity and wastefulness. You are such a master, being able to use the Force with precision and flexibility not often found in youth. Very fine telekinetic manipulations, charging a battery with a definite application of lightning or touching upon the minds of an audience most gently to lend to a speech without it being noticed. This perk goes beyond your application of the Force, of course, providing an almost impossible level of delicacy with any supernatural power. A Ki blast like a micrometer laser? Teleportation onto an incredibly narrow wire? Both possible with this perk, assuming you couldn’t do so before."
200 CP,Armour of Light,Darth Bane Trilogy,"Objects submerged in a Dark Side nexus often take on unnatural and powerful properties. In an effort to bring about a greater sense of balance to the galaxy, I offer you this armour. Power armour composed of cortosis, with several melee and energy shields installed, this armour would represent the height of personal protection even without the addition of the Forces influence. The energies saturating the armour grant you a noble and stoic aura, granting the constant presence of the Valour technique to those under your command. The suit also promotes rapid healing in your nearby allies, doing away with fatigue and injuries in a matter of minutes."
200 CP,Promising Student,Star Wars: The Phantom Menace – The Reddit Edition V1.1,"You have someone to teach, and they are very willing to learn from you. They seem to be a quick learner, though with this talent comes a degree of disobedience and willingness to bend the rules you might not find in most Padawan. Fortunately, this unorthodox student looks like they will benefit greatly from an unorthodox teacher such as yourself."
200 CP,Breaking the Curses,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40k,"There are many unknown and dark techniques with devastating effects. You have studied these techniques extensively, but not to learn them. Instead you have learned to detect and counter them. Forbidden passions and long forgotten curses can be identified with a single glance as well as the appropriate treatment. This will allow you to perform feats similar to how Yoda shattered the curse Sidious placed on Padmé to kill her. Post jump your knowledge will update with similar forms of knowledge. For example in Harry Potter you would learn the cures to long lost potions and know how to deal with the Unforgivables."
200 CP,Force Healing ,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40k,"While most Force powers are centered around destruction some of them are focused on
healing. This power allows the user to channel the beings' connection to the Force to
accelerate their natural healing rate. Skilled users of this power can halt beings from dying
and heal lethal wounds."
200 CP,Mental Shields ,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40k,Mental shields are an important power used to defend the mind of the Force users. They allow them to repel mental attacks and mental manipulations. Skilled users are also capable of suppressing their presence to prevent themselves from being detected.
200 CP,Force Nexus ,Star Wars - The New Jedi Order,"A place of powerful force energies, like the Jedi praxeum on Yavin 4, or the caves of Dagobah. This place’s natural energies muffle your own force signature, while enhancing any meditation, divination or ritual five to ten times over. Can become a Warehouse Attachment after this Jump, or be imported."
200 CP,None Shall Pass,Star Wars - The New Jedi Order,"When you plant your feet at a gate or a bridge, none can bypass you or attack those in your charge without first dealing with you. For some reason, numbers seem meaningless if there is no fighter or beast among the horde that can best you in single combat, then charging as a mob is just delivering bodies up for your blade."
200 CP,Closed Doors,Star Wars - The New Jedi Order,"A closed fortress is what your mind, soul, and body are to the outside world, a fortress with its gates barred and its defenders ready. Any attempts to forcibly seize control of you or possess you will simply fail, powerful and ancient sorcerers will find their souls repulsed and driven back just as easily as one might swat a mosquito. All around a rather useful ability with a certain someone running around."
200 CP,Marksman-H Training Droid with Blast Helmet,Star Wars Movie Compilation : The Skywalker Saga Jumpchain,When using this training droid your reaction time and aiming skill progresses at 5 times the rate they would if this were a regular training droid and if you wear the blast helmet at the same time it will aid your perception training by 20 times.
300 CP,Force Stasis ,KOTOR,"A Force power that allows the user to temporarily stun organic creatures by trapping them in non-lethal energy fields. This power will only keep foes trapped for a few seconds, but you can improve it’s length with practice."
400 CP, Bad Feeling,Star Wars - Jedi Apprentice Jump,These feelings are a great threat indicator (and a famous quote). The stronger these bad feelings are the worse the situation is that you are currently in. Even hidden dangers such as assassins and sabotages and accidents just waiting to happen are included. You can truly ‘trust your instincts’ and clearly distinguish them from any false alarms and plain paranoia. If events are truly
400 CP,Negotiator,Star Wars - Jedi Apprentice Jump,"Lethal force is often not the best solution to an issue, and is not supposed to be the first resort of the Jedi. You are trained in negotiation, conflict resolution, and de-escalation. Moreover, you are very good at finding mutually beneficial solutions to problems, and ways to show others the benefits of cooperation."
400 CP,Meditation Room,Star Wars - Jedi Apprentice Jump,"A place that is set up for meditation & is very peaceful. It might be styled like a smaller version of the Room of a Thousand Fountains, or a bare room, or something else peaceful. It can also double as a training room for lightsabers, martial arts, or active use of the Force."
400 CP,Form and Finesse,Darth Bane Trilogy,"The lightsaber is easily one of the most distinctive weapons in the Galaxy. It identifies one as a user of the Force, belonging to a world that the vast majority of beings here will forever remain ignorant. It’d be a waste of such an icon then, if you were unskilled in its use. As your now diminished fortune would have it, you are one of the best lightsaber combatants to ever grace a battlefield. A grand master of the seven forms of lightsaber combat, and quite competent in more niche ones as well. In a battle between a thousand strong supposedly equal forces, you may help bring about a rout in your foes (after felling two dozen or so). These forms can be adapted to other melee weapons you pick up, be they metallic maces or whips."
400 CP,Personal Holocron,Darth Bane Trilogy,"This is an auto-updating holocron with a near infinite amount of storage space that fills itself with your arcane learnings and personal philosophy. It can serve as an incredibly effective teacher in your place, personalising its lessons for any students to whom you grant it. You may, at any time, bar others from using it or restrict the knowledge they can gain from your holocron. This holocron also serves to influence its listeners, bringing them more in line with your personal philosophies and beliefs even without explicitly delving into these schools of thought. They may come to embrace the free market,adopt a rule based approach to utilitarianism or learn to reject their passions in favour of peace."
400 CP,Room of a Thousand Fountains,Darth Bane Trilogy,"Much like the chamber in the Jedi Temple of Coruscant, this room promotes serenity and deep contemplation to any inside. This purchase goes somewhat beyond the currently existing room however, granting a number of benefits beyond the original. The waters of this room provide purification to any who bathe in them. Sith lords would be brought to the Light, diseases and poisons can be driven from the body and the eternal cynic might come to see the inherent good in others. On top of that, you’ll find any classically ‘light’ powers are increased in magnitude several times over if conducted in or from this room."
400 CP,Will of the Planet,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40k,"The Jedi seem to naturally possess a close relationship with planets and most groups of animals. An extreme example of this is when the Jedi are capable of rousing a planet's spirit. They can awaken the planet to combat their enemies through earthquakes, massive psychic attacks, and other unique methods. This method can also be used to awaken the spirits of planets, beings without sentience, and areas infused with large amounts of energy. Next, this perk will grant you a close bond with nature. You will find that you will never be directly attacked by an animal as long as you do not provoke them first. Lastly this will make you incredibly talented at nature or meditation based techniques such as Senjutsu."
400 CP,Dagger of Mortis ,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40k,The Dagger of Mortis is a mystical weapon held on the altar of Mortis. This weapon was hidden by the Father due to its ability to kill any being including the Celestials. That is the most powerful ability possessed by the dagger. Any being that is struck by a lethal blow will die. Any immortality they possess will be stripped away and any unique methods of defense will be bypassed.
400 CP,Lightsaber Smith ,Star Wars Movie Compilation : The Skywalker Saga Jumpchain,With this Perk you gain a vast wealth of knowledge on lightsaber construction including an archive of each and every lightsaber ever constructed in canon and the personalisations made on each lightsaber. This knowledge is not just of the lightsaber construction itself but also how each component is constructed every step of the way from the raw materials allowing you to theoretically construct any known lightsaber from scratch. This perk also allows you to work out how any materials could be incorporated into your lightsaber such as knowing how best to use Katchin in the lightsabers frame or how to process Taydenite into a lightsaber focusing crystal.
400 CP,Beast Control ,KOTOR,"A Force power that allows the user to control an animal. Once calmed, animals can be used in various ways, such as mounts, guards, or servants."
500 CP,Asteroid medical facility,Star Wars Movie Compilation : The Skywalker Saga Jumpchain,"This space capable medical facility consists of a series of white buildings and domes, with the main medical center rising slightly higher from the rear of the facility. Although this facility is designed for a zero atmospheric environment it can be set up on a planetary surface but the only entrance to the medicenter is via the landing bay’s decontamination chamber. While within this medical center it is not possible for any patient to die, the facility has all the relevant tools and equipment which can be used for surgical and research purposes. While the medicenter is automated by droid it can facilitate organic members of staf"
600 CP,Beloved by the Force,Star Wars - Jedi Apprentice Jump,This perk grants you an endless growth in force abilities. While the learning rate isn’t increased there is no upper limit for these abilities any more. Like the legendary Starkiller and Skywalker you too can enjoy such an advantage with which you can increase your midichlorian count via hard work (contrary to most other people). In time you could become almighty with these powers. (And the one thing Jumpers have is time.)
600 CP,Recognizing Wounds ,Star Wars - Jedi Apprentice Jump,"Within the Force horrifying events such as alignment shifts or massacres can cause “Wounds” within the Force. Now you too can sense these disturbances within the Force. You can feel whenever a horrifying event is happening (this sense is clearer the closer you are to the Wound) and instantly realize if a battle is imminent, and if so, the chances of your side surviving."
600 CP,Kwa Holocron,Star Wars - Dawn of the Jedi,"An ancient holocron, made by the amphibious Kwa long before the pilgrims who would become the Je’daii first set foot on Tython. It contains their knowledge of the galaxy, the Force, and their Force-based technology. While the Kwa can’t measure up to the Celestials, many of their technological wonders remain unmatched by any later individual or civilization.
"
600 CP,Crystal Caves,Darth Bane Trilogy,"A series of caves containing lightsaber crystals, this place has been made your responsibility. Various beautiful and vibrant crystals grow in the Force heavy air, these caves also serve as a sanctuary for those on the run. Impossible to navigate to outsiders you don’t permit entry to, these caves can effectively go on forever with no hope of escape. They also provide protection and escape routes from outside attacks wherever you’ve imported them, leading your friends and allies far out of harms way. So far, in fact, that they may lead you off planet should the worst happen and yours is rendered uninhabitable. Try not to think about the impossible folding of space this requires."
600 CP,The Chosen One ,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40k,"There is a prophecy of a Chosen One, a being who will bring balance to the Force and the galaxy. By taking this perk you will gain this mantle. You may optionally share it with Anakin or instead place yourself into a higher position above him. To aid you in this supposed prophecy you have been granted a number of advantages. First to demonstrate your immense potential you will start with a midichlorian count or at least the equivalent of 30,000. To compare, Yoda and Anakin Skywalker had a count of 17,700 and 27,700 respectively. Second, you will find that your power and skills grow at an exponential rate allowing you to surpass beings far older than you in a short period of time. Third, you will find yourself being drawn to opportunities and influential moments of the universe allowing you to control the path of fate. Lastly post-jump if there is a similar type of prophecy in the setting you may become the being the prophecy refers to with all that is entitled with it."
600 CP,Shatterpoints,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40k,"Shatterpoints are the weak points of the universe. They can be formed in events, individuals, and even worlds. By locating and targeting these points Force users can manipulate the fabric of reality to force the outcome they desire. An example of this is the ability to reopen a mortal wound that your foe had managed to heal from previously. The instances referring to events reflect the major routes of fate. For example Anakin Skywalker is constantly surrounded by Shatterpoints due to the immense influence he possesses over the galaxy's fate. You will gain the ability to see these points and to target them in order to force the outcomes you desire."
600 CP,Jedi Archives,Star Wars Movie Compilation : The Skywalker Saga Jumpchain,"This is the Jedi Order's repository of knowledge with its data stored electronically and holographically, holding information on every society and planet in the galaxy including full maps. This database initially contains every society's view of the force and the basics of how they use it. Each jump this archive updates adding information and maps relevant to that jump and how they see the dominant power type for that jump setting."
600 CP,Cave of Trials,Star Wars Movie Compilation : The Skywalker Saga Jumpchain,"This dark and powerful cave will manifest a customized challenge to anyone who enters into its depths showing them both literal and symbolic visions of the past, future, or possible futures. Anyone who enters into this cave is guaranteed to grow stronger from the lessons they learn in the cave but what they must face is what will change each time they enter."
800 CP,The Celestials,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40k,"The Celestials, also known as the Architects, or Force wielders were an ancient species who are said to be living embodiments of the Force. The Celestials are some of the most powerful force users to ever exist in the universe. Some examples of their powers include the ability to block lightsabers with their bodies, teleportation, memory erasure, transformation, and many other abilities. In addition to this the species is immortal and normally could only be harmed by a weapon known as the Dagger of Mortis. You may optionally choose to replace one of the canon Celestials or to be given a similar set of powers. Lastly by default you will be closer in power to the Son or the Daughter rather than the Father in his prime."
