100 CP,Universal Translator,Star Wars - Dawn of the Jedi," Interestingly enough, the people of Tython and the Rakatans of the Infinite empire use exactly the same alphabet, language, and pronunciation, despite the fact that they never even knew the other existed and had no previous contact. This isn’t ignored, but is actually mentioned. In each setting you will automatically know the common language of all the major powers.
"
100 CP,Holder of Secrets,Darth Bane Trilogy,"You are an individual most erudite and wise. This is commonly known fact amongst the crowds you wander. You possess a reputation as a man or woman of deep knowledge and insight, all seeing evidence to support such a reputation as they interact with you. Others tend to read deeply into your words and actions, seeing a great array of unknowable plans, hidden messages and lessons in what you do. Expect a certain level of caution and respect to be present in those who address you, weary of your judgements and possible machinations that they cannot see, let alone comprehend. This doesn’t actually make you any smarter or wiser, but image and impressions do a lot in your favour regardless."
100 CP,Amicable Monsters,Darth Bane Trilogy,"The Brotherhood are Sith, regardless of the name they choose to adopt. Deceit is in their blood; betrayals on their breath. Despite these well worn facts, inter-Sith politicking seems far less lethal that it used to be. In fact, many groups of the honourless, ambitious or desperate bent seem quite conscientious to you now. Groups you work in will tend to be... friendly now. Not loyal or loving, betrayals and plots may still happen depending on the group, but you’re now more likely to wake up in the morning. Not much, but it’s a reassurance I’m sure"
100 CP,Just Cause,Darth Bane Trilogy,"Your enemies might try to justify their beliefs with double think and sophistry, they might present their ideas in the most palatable way. That doesn’t matter when their reasoning is flawed and positions baseless. You find yourself near immune to fallacious talking points, able to recognise them with ease and tear them apart to their proponents discredit."
100 CP,Bureaucrat,Darth Bane Trilogy,"As tiresome as it may be, paperwork and logistics management might become quite critical for whatever career or societal position you might come to hold. This perk is there for those of you who do not want to learn how to deal with all that filing, those taxation reports and budget distribution. Now all obligations that’d fall under this purview will be completed automatically without your input. Never again will you have to sit, face blank, as piles of flimsy and documents torment you for hours on end."
100 CP,Flamboyant Clothes,Darth Bane Trilogy,"You’re a fashionable one, that’s for sure. You have a wardrobe hundreds of outfits long, drawn from the height of style on dozens of worlds. Whether it’s determined by the nobility, a commercial industry or the deeds required to get the materials that make it up; you have an outfit for any occasion or to meet any one of importance. Be prepared to stand out as a member of high society though, one can’t really slum about in clothes this grand."
100 CP,Not Entirely Honest,Star Wars - Darth Plagueis,"Utterly lacking in shame or empathy, ambitious, insidious; you are a viscous beast born to a rational, moralistic species. From a young age you recognised your deviant nature and learned to play the part everyone else came to without conscious effort. Your boundless rage and perverse lusts were locked under a mask of the urbane gentleman and your self-control was only tempered by the fires it has kept at bay. Your true nature is nigh-impossible to discern unless this iron-clad will is disturbed, with even your Forceful gifts being kept hidden from the minds of Jedi and Sith, and you find it easy to consciously alter and model your behaviour without it seeming forced or uncanny. It would be entirely possible for you to portray yourself as a loyal confidant, kindly father figure and patriotic statesmen to all who meet you and for that image to only crack when you decide that it no longer has any use to you."
100 CP," I Must Be Frank, Your Majesty ",Star Wars: The Phantom Menace – The Reddit Edition V1.1,"Can state the unpleasant and simple truth even to those who would otherwise ignore evidence or dislike the absence of tact. Very useful for getting across a point or getting someone to understand the severity of the situation. They might not like it, but they can’t blame you for saying it. You can also pass your name off as Frank, but that seems to be an optional addition."
100 CP,Child Queen,Star Wars: The Phantom Menace – The Reddit Edition V1.1,"If a child can rule a planet, age clearly isn’t a barrier to what you are allowed to do. So long as you are at least barely competent at a job, nobody will bat an eye about your apparent age or try to stop you from doing it based on age-related criteria."
100 CP,Data Pad ,Star Wars - New Jedi Order,"A handheld computer as is commonplace. Yours contains schematics of all non-military technology, as well as news and history, anything publicly available. This updates in future Jumps."

100 CP,Bodyguards ,Generic Star Wars Fanfiction,"Success naturally has many benefits, but it also comes with some downsides, that being at times jealousy and greed from others both less and equally well off. So, it makes sense that eventually someone is going to make an attempt on your life one way or another which is where these guys come in. Coming in the form of droids or organics, these well armed and trained soldiers will do everything in their power to keep you alive; which against most lower threats is quite easy, but against monsters like Force users or incredible bounty hunters like Cad Bane don’t expect them to hold."
200 CP,Information Network,Darth Bane Trilogy,"In War and in Peace, information will always remain the most valuable resource in the civilised Galaxy. What the information pertains to will affect its value in the eyes of specific parties and in different settings. Acquiring information, all of it, is now your charge. Collecting contacts, designing private data networks, buying and selling loyalties with it, sorting through said data.

You are particularly good at creating and spreading rumours and planting accusations that will bring down your political opponents. You are also quite good at preventing the same trick from being used on you and your allies.
200 CP,Phantom Menace ,Star Wars: The Phantom Menace – The Reddit Edition V1.1,"A phantom is like a ghost, a spectre that is physically not there, yet stands before a viewer in spite of that. A hologram is a virtual projector that makes a person appear before an audience as if they’re really there despite the fact they lack substance. When communicating with others, either just via audio or using visual methods such as the local holograms, you can completely hide your identity and influence in affairs. This might take the form of a hooded robe that conceals your body, some sort of distortion in the message, or another means of keeping your identity secret. Nobody will be able totrack, intercept or otherwise use your communication to locate you or your conspirators."
200 CP,Nice Quarters ,Star Wars: The Phantom Menace – The Reddit Edition V1.1,"You might like somewhere to live outside of the Senate building, even if it seems you practically live there.

200 CP,The bureaucrats are in charge now ,"Star Wars Movie Compilation : The Skywalker Saga Jumpchain
",You know the ins and outs of bureaucracy and how to tie things up with paperwork and so much red tape that permission to get things done will never happen without a lot of political power and a lot of people heavily pushing for it to get done.

200 CP,Secure Office,Generic Star Wars Fanfiction,"As a public figure, it can be hard to get true privacy, which makes it difficult to plot and scheme in peace without unsettling anyone who may happen to witness your mad cackling. This private office is immune to all methods of spying or external observation, whether technologically or supernaturally based, save those methods you choose to allow. Moreover, while extreme force could break into the office, the doors and windows are sturdy enough that no-one will be disturbing you without plenty of warning. And, as a bonus, the office comes with a perfectly secure, untraceable, and untapable hypercom link, for when you need to give orders to your patsies but can’t fly out to speak to them in person."

400 CP,Revolutionary Coup,Darth Bane Trilogy,"The royals, politicians and socialites that rule the world often fail in their duty to the people they ‘serve’. Sometimes incompetents and despots arise who bring undue suffering to the many. Waiting for them to voted out of office or replaced by their potentially better children in twenty years doesn’t really help. Ruling bodies need to be replaced from time to time. That’s what you do better than the revolutionary amateurs that try to start these transitions in society. Recruiting, arming, organising, training and eventually fielding revolutionaries is what you do best. Organising disposals of the old guard, infiltrating the office of State, subjecting the old regime to justice and setting up their more worthy replacements. All this and any other skills you might happen to need in such an endeavour are provided to you with this perk. The fire rises."
400 CP,Political Position,Darth Bane Trilogy,"Depending on how office is gained, this purchase will ensure that you’re either installed by the local autocrat or voted in by the flash election. Whatever your title or specific function, you become a relatively high member of the political body you apply for. In 12th century Europe you might become an influential courtier, here a long time ago in a far off galaxy you might be made a planetary senator or overseer of a newly conquered planet."
400 CP,Hefty Inheritance ,Star Wars - Darth Plagueis,"While the Republic itself may be a largely democratic body, many of its constituent worlds are monarchies and feudal societies where position is largely inherited. You come from one such planet, such as Serenno or Naboo, and more importantly are the heir or head to wealthy and highly influential aristocratic family. The respect for your position, both from the political  establishment and the people, is considerable and it’d be fairly easy for you to involve yourself with planetary politics and maybe even come to represent your world on the galactic stage. Interestingly enough, even on worlds or among species where nobility is considered an outdated or inherently strange concept, people can’t help but to recognise your good breeding, taste and how well you embody the virtues of your culture. This aura of old money will open up doors all over the galaxy that would remain barred to the nouveau riche unless they were extraordinarily wealthy and the word of you and your family has been considered as good as gold for centuries."
400 CP,I Love Democracy ,Star Wars - Darth Plagueis,"For all that fatalists talk of corruption and conspiracies steering the Republic, it is equally true that the well chosen words of a senator can unravel those very plots and redirect the course of galactic politics. Those cynics would no doubt say that such instances of honest statesmanship are the exception to the trend, but then they haven’t met you. A cunning linguist, master debater and historic orator; your voice cuts through the din of debate and dismissal like a lightsaber through the air, as your words have a deepened impact on the minds of others and invariably force them to think on what you have said. Even when you speak as an otherwise uninvested party, your words have a strong influence beyond that of most of those involved but it is when you have a stake in the subject that your speeches become truly profound. When those you represent or a cause you’ve long championed is the focus of plight or policy, then you alone can stop previously certain acts and set whole new precedents in galactic politics."
400 CP,Vote Of No Confidence ,Star Wars: The Phantom Menace – The Reddit Edition V1.1,"Not in you, this is what you can arrange in others. If enough public pressure or resentment is built up, you can set the wheels in motion to have public representatives removed. You don’t necessarily need to be the one to call for the vote either, you just need someone else willing to do so, and it will never look like the suggestion started at you if you don’t want it to. You could trigger the downfall of someone who thought you were a supporter, if you wanted. You also have a knack for arranging matters so you would have a good chance of getting the now vacant position, with your chances improving with further political machinations."
400 CP,Long Range Communicator ,Star Wars: The Phantom Menace – The Reddit Edition V1.1,"While you could certainly use a public one here, you may prefer to have an unmonitored private version. This allows you to communicate with anyone in the setting that has some sort of communication device and are not specifically blocking you. Call your friends, allies, and expendable patsies."
400 CP,The Globe of Peace,Star Wars Movie Compilation : The Skywalker Saga Jumpchain,This relic of the Naboo people is a glowing sphere that symbolizes the years of peace that reigned on the planet. This version is able to emit a passive field of peace draining aggression and intention for conflict within everyone within its range which can be scaled for room sized area of effect to a planet wide area of effect.
400 CP,Backup Alderaan,Star Wars Movie Compilation : The Skywalker Saga Jumpchain,"Your warehouse gains a pocket dimension that can once per planet copy any physically destroyed planet and its population, from a moment before its destruction. Any damage done to the planet during its destruction and if whatever caused the destruction was a part of the planet they will be removed from the copy. By default this is occupied by a copy of Alderaan and its people. You may keep the stored planet or use it to replace the destroyed one either in its original location or another viable one. When a planet you know about is destroyed you will gain a prompt option to copy it to your pocket dimension. If a different planet is already store you will be required to eject it first; if you do so, it will be released to a nearby safe location When removing your planet from storage you may choose for the copied populace to be a true resurrection, possibly pulling them out of an afterlife."
400 CP,Caamas Document,Generic Star Wars Fanfiction,"Sometimes people are just being a bit of a thorn in your side, if that’s the case this will be for you. It’s a document that happens to prove several of your political rivals were involved in an infamous crime and/or scandal, of the sort that could have them arrested and tried for terrorism and murder. The only downside is that depending on the actual character of your rivals, this may or may not be true or stand up to intense scrutiny, though it’s guaranteed to at least drag their name through the mud and sometimes a bit of time and slander is all you need. Updates in future Jumps."
400 CP,Human Replica Droid ,Generic Star Wars Fanfiction,"Otherwise known as HRDs, Human Replica Droids are among the most advanced machines in the galaxy for good reason. These espionage droids are built in such a way that only the most thorough of medical scans can determine they’re fakes and all others fully show them to be truly organic. The droids are also incredibly intelligent and can fulfil a number of tasks for you; whether it’s acting as a diplomat, infiltrator, or even assassin they do it well. This particular unit has been programmed with extensive assassination protocols similar to Prince Xizor’s and is equipped with powerful eye blasters for some reason, it’s also quite loyal to you, almost slavishly if one thought about it. Its appearance is up to you, though if you don’t choose it’ll default to copying Guri."
600 CP,Moon Mansion,Darth Bane Trilogy,"You have come into the possession of a rather lavish property on your starting planet, one that may come with you should you leave this galaxy in ten years. A large luxury mansion, always stocked with servants and supplies, that will always grant visitors an impression that you’re excessively wealthy. The mansion comes with a great inheritance, either from an unknown benefactor, a relative or your master. Enough money to sustain a very high standard of living for ten years with the occasional splurge, this income in renewed with a comparable amount of money at the start of a new Jump."
600 CP,Naboo Palace,Star Wars: The Phantom Menace – The Reddit Edition V1.1,"You own an opulent and well-maintained palace on Naboo, a home fit for royalty. It comes with all the staff you would need to live in it, and a small contingent of guards. You can import this into your Warehouse along with its extensive gardens, or into any other location you own. You can import any smaller structures, equipment or rooms you own into it as well."
600 CP,New Alderaan,Star Wars - Dark Empire,"A temperate planet in an unknown system that is not on any chart. No enemy will ever be able to find it unless they can get directions from someone who has been there. What’s more, it has a property that is quite curious indeed. If your friends or forces encounter some certain death situation but you are unable to actually find conclusive proof that they died, they will somehow shortly appear near this planet having escaped through unspoken means."
600 CP,Alliance to Restore [Insert Name Here]:,Star Wars - The Force Unleashed,"No politician is complete without some backup and you’ve got it in spades: an entire organization now backs you and your goals up no matter what they may be. The organization is incredibly good at infiltration and hit and run attacks and committing all sorts of illegal actions without getting caught, or at least managing to get away without a problem. Lastly the organization is completely loyal to you and could only be subverted by means beyond the realms of nature, such as Chaos taint or Sith Sorcery."
600 CP,Galactic Governor:,Star Wars - The Force Unleashed,"It would seem you actually earned your position as an Imperial Senator, unlike many within the Senate. By this I mean you have true ability when it comes to ruling, enough so that you could run a galactic government as bureaucratic and corrupt as the Old Republic smoothly and efficiently while also being able to easily juggle the various agendas of the parties within and quickly push new policies through. This governance skill also extends to the economy, allowing for galactic economic booms to be engineered with ease or even Great Depressions should that be the wish."
600 CP,Delta Source,Generic Star Wars Fanfiction,"Knowledge is power or so they say, and it’s a resource you’ll have in abundance. One way or another you have somehow bugged the sanctum of your greatest enemies, in an exotic fashion they will never uncover without significant help. Not everything it gives you is necessarily useful or correct, but short of literal mind-reading you couldn’t ask for better insight into your foes."
600 CP,A Party of your Own,Generic Star Wars Fanfiction,"It doesn’t have to actually be a political party but this an organization under your control. It could be the previously mentioned political party based entirely on your ideals and goals, a party with quite a bit of power. Or it could be a secret Cabal dedicated to the extermination of all Force users or something else along those lines, it’s entirely up to you. The organization itself is quite powerful and has the capacity to influence or outright push policy on a galactic scale. Depending on how you choose for this to manifest the benefits will change as some versions might allow you extensive spy networks and so on."
600 CP,Discretionary Budget,Star Wars - The High Republic,"You have been placed in charge of a massive fund for the Chancellor’s Great Works. An almost limitless well of money with one catch - you can’t spend it on yourself. It’s for grants to the arts and sciences, and public works, and must be used for these purposes. Still, what an opportunity to improve wherever you land, for in future Jumps this carries over and converts to local currency."
