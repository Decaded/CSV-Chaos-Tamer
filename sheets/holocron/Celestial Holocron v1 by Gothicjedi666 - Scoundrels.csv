Sabaac is one of the most popular card games in this galaxy, having players from the miners of Apatros to the halls of power for both of the current galactic states.

100 CP,Passable ID,Star Wars: The Phantom Menace – The Reddit Edition V1.1,"You have a basic form of identification, registering you as a citizen of wherever you happen to show up. It doesn’t provide a lot and won’t make anyone think you are important by itself, but it’s sufficient to prove who you are if you want an identity."
100 CP,Neural Suppressing Collar,Darth Bane Trilogy,"Neural suppressing collars are rather self-explanatory devices. They prohibit higher cognitive functions. Unfortunately they struggle with the ineffable quality of will and often fail on subjects with near inhuman levels of it. They’re all but useless on powerful Force sensitives who can ‘power’ through the cognitive field and then disable the collar. This one is considerable more powerful. In fact, it also disables one’s psychic powers. Be they a Force user, a Psyker or a Psion user, it matters not a dot when this collar is placed around their necks. Only you may take this item off of someone, leaving them otherwise permanently powerless."

100 CP,Turning A Blind Eye,Star Wars - The Force Unleashed,"Bounty Hunting isn’t exactly the most legal of all professions in the galaxy and could very easily end up with you on the Empire’s Most Wanted list. So long as you don’t directly move against a government or it’s members it’ll ignore your less than legal activities, so feel free to track down and nail a high class bounty in Corusaunct’s Upper districts without a single raised eyebrow from the nearby Stormtroopers. But as said before if said target is a ranking Imperial Officer this protection would fail. As one final note should you successfully conceal your identity then the perk will continue to protect you."

It is intended to be used for games of luck, but you can take the chance out of your victory with it and decide which colour you want it to land on. Whether you want to leave it up to the dice to decide, others will find that it cannot be influenced. It doesn’t matter if they have fancy Jedi powers or some form of fate manipulation, only you and the dice get to decide."
200 CP,Republic Credits,Star Wars: The Phantom Menace – The Reddit Edition V1.1,"You have a substantial amount of money in a widely accepted currency. This is enough to support yourself for a while, or perhaps make a particularly expensive purchase.

200 CP,I Wish That Jumper Wasn’t so Useful ,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40k,"Hondo Ohnaka is a corrupt, backstabbing, and dangerous pirate who will do almost anything to earn a quick buck. He however, is also one of the most well connected and useful mercenaries in the galaxy. His sheer value has earned him far more opportunities for forgiveness than he probably deserves. That is a trait that you and Hondo share. You will be forgiven and treated as an ally by anyone as long as you are capable of being a valuable resource. For example Hondo actually tried to sell Ahsoka into the black market yet he still works with her, and is even considered to be friends with her.

200 CP,Blaster Slinger ,Star Wars - Jedi Apprentice Jump,"Your hand eye coordination, reflexes, and instincts are amazing.

collars, bomb harnesses and implants, etc. You’re pretty deplorable if you use these, honestly. This is super illegal, if that wasn’t obvious."

You are a likable person, always remembering people’s names and interests, and generally knowing and easily applying all the tricks of winning friends and influencing people."
400 CP,Holdout Blasters,Star Wars: The Phantom Menace – The Reddit Edition V1.1,"Just because violence isn’t your first resort doesn’t mean you’re helpless.

They might not be particularly powerful, but they are a weapon that others will not expect."
400 CP,An Actual Smuggler,Star Wars - Dark Empire,"Your ability to move things undetected is legendary, running spice through an Imperial Blockade would be child’s play. Not an Imperial Blockade of the present mind you, but one during the Empire’s height guarding one of their most secure prisons where getting in is nigh impossible and where getting out simply doesn’t happen without the Empire’s approval. This also applies on the small scale as well; small packages, weapons, and so on can trivially be snuck past all sorts of scrutiny and prying eyes."
400 CP,Stealth Field Generator,Darth Bane Trilogy,"Essentially a portable, personal cloaking device, stealth field generators make their users all but invisible at medium and long ranges by bending light around them. Although useful for infiltration, especially in low visibility conditions, they have a tendency to fail at short range or should the user make contact with others or large objects. Expensive but not exceptionally uncommon, those SFGs don’t quite measure up to this one. This one grants complete invisibility to the user regardless of their actions, perfectly bending light to all outside observers. Sounds and smells will also be suppressed, so that species with enhanced hearing and olfactory senses won’t discover the user either. These qualities aren’t what makes the SFG so valuable however, the effect it has on the Force does. When cloaked you cannot be sensed through the Force, or other precognitive gifts, and it won’t warn your targets and adversaries of your actions. With this you could walk up to a Sith Lord, shoot him through the head and escape in the panic you’ve just caused."

400 CP,"They Can Run, But They Can’t Hide",Star Wars - The Force Unleashed,"So many targets believe if they run far enough or hide well enough you’ll lose them, yet that couldn’t be farther from the truth.

600 CP,Void in the Force,Star Wars - Jedi Apprentice Jump,"You are exceptionally resistant to Force powers. Like Grant Omega you are not completely immune to the Force, but you are extremely hard to affect, and even harder to detect.

In future jumps this resistance extends to other types of supernatural powers."
600 CP, Solo’s Luck:,Star Wars - Dark Empire,"A great deal of luck that can get you out of most sticky situations, leading you into ones where you stand to gain quite a bit. Han Solo can attest to that, lucky to be in a backwater bar at the right time and now a galactic hero married to the Princess of Alderaan and a leader of the rebellion. Your luck is now at that same level. It’ll lead into new and varied situations heaping rewards and adventure on you all the while and for those of a more traditional focus it’ll be quite something in any place where chance is King. Who knows, maybe you’ll ignore this Sith and Jedi crap and just rob the Sabacc circles blind and live like a king on the bounty you plunder."
600 CP,[REDACTED],Darth Bane Trilogy,"The Bounty Hunter Guild has, for millennia, provided morally ambiguous services to both legal and private entities. There have been organisations that offer more.... definite solutions to the problems of concerned customers. One such group was [REDACTED], originally a tool for maintaining the political stability of the Republic. Some claim they were destroyed millennia ago, others that they were merely subverted by an ambitious killer. Regardless, you seem to have gained the skills of one of their members. An elite assassin almost without peer in this galaxy, there are very few you couldn’t kill. Whether through the use of obscure Sith born poisons or from hundreds of kilometers away with a scoped rifle, you deliver death with an nigh absolute certainty to your targets.
