Your endeavors seem to take on a life of their own, spreading throughout entire communities like Fiendfyre.

But for you, and with this, keeping your magic secret won’t be that big of a problem. In your presence, Muggles always seem to rationalize or even ignore minor uses of magic. For example, floating small objects or creating a bit of fire and light will be thought of as a clever use of strings and Muggle technology such as lighters and the like. Of course, this isn’t going to be quite as effective if you try and perform greater feats of magic such as setting an entire forest ablaze with nothing more than a stick in your hands. In that case, you better have one handy-dandy explanation ready for them."

100 CP,The Family Watch,Wizarding World Jump,"It is a tradition amongst witches and wizards that they be given a watch when they come of age at seventeen years old. And while you may not be of this world, that does not mean that you cannot partake in its traditions and culture. Perhaps that is why you have this ornate and fanciful golden pocket watch, something you might consider as a gift from your benefactor, whoever they may be. And as always, this watch of yours is far from ordinary. You see, unlike a regular watch, this watch is not meant to tell the time and its hands represent neither the minute nor the hour. Rather, each hand is meant a representation of you and your trusted Companions. Like a certain redheaded family’s clock, the numbers on it have been changed to locations such as “home”, “school”, “work”, “prison”, “lost”, “mortal peril”, and many more. So long as this watch is by your side, you will always be aware of where your Companions might be and if they would be in need of your help.

As mentioned before, it is rather rare but fortunately for you, you are a Metamorphmagus now. The extent of your new abilities allows you to mimic the size and shape of just about anyone, be they someone as beautiful as the lovely Veela or someone as grizzled and battle-damaged as one Mad-Eye Moody.

400 CP,Ancient Magic ,The Wizarding World Jump,"Magic is much like knowledge.

With it, you will soon be capable of magic beyond the pale. Bringing forth rain and life to an entire valley suffering from the harshest drought shall be the least of what you can do.

400 CP,Unbound Potential,The Other Harry Potter Fanfic Jump,"Relating to the above bit of fanon is the idea of someone, usually  the “Manipulative Headbastard,” placing ‘blocks’ or ‘limiters’ on Harry’s magical core for some inexplicable reason because biggatons are the only way some fic authors can think of to make Harry ‘better’ than canon. Regardless, that’s not something you’ll ever have to deal with, as you are categorically immune to any and all attempts to bind, restrict, suppress, drain, steal, or damage any aspects of your power or energy."
400 CP,Jumper Manor,The Other Harry Potter Fanfic Jump,"What we have here is a luxurious sprawling estate with many acres of land and housing and accommodations that would make a jaded out-of-touch billionaire immediately pauperize themselves to try and fail to buy a home better than yours.
