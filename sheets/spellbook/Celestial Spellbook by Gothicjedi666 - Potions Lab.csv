Filled with what seems to be molten silver, the flask and the liquid within are nevertheless cool to the touch. More importantly, the liquid is enchanted in a rather special way. By pouring the liquid over a lost limb, be it an arm or a leg, the silver shall take on the shape of said appendage, replacing it with something greater. And don’t be afraid of running out. The flask itself always fills back up at the end of the day.

And now, the titular hopping pot has come to follow you around, hopping behind you on every step of your journey. But what can the pot do for you? For starters, unlike the pot in the story, this one can, all by itself, create a wonderful variety of potions for you, each one brewed as if a master of potions made it themselves. You won’t even need to provide the ingredients. The pot can make it all! Well, almost all of it. Potions such as the Potion of All Potential and its like are beyond even its extraordinary capabilities and it can’t really speed up the process of potion-making as much as you’d want it to. On a final note, it seems that the pot has a rather mischievous bent to it. It has a rather peculiar habit of trying to get you to help out others, much like it once did to a young boy. Unlike that young boy however, the pot won’t punish you for refusing to help. On the other hand, if you do help others, the potions the pot brews shall become better, the extent of which is determined on how often you choose to help those less fortunate than you."
400 CP,Book of Potions ,Wizarding World Jump,"As a rule, young students tend not to see the appeal of potions. After all, when you can create fire with a wave of your wand and make objects float with but a word, something like potions can seem a bit... boring.

100 CP,A Toad ,Wizarding World Jump,"Among the three pets allowed at Hogwarts, toads are by far the least popular. In fact, they’ve very much gone out of style years ago. In fact, you likely won’t find more than a handful of toads as pets regardless of where you go. Still, that does not mean they do not have their uses. They make remarkable test subjects for magic, especially potions given that they can absorb the potions through their skin rather than having to drink it like people do."
200 CP,Perils of Polyjuice,Wizarding World Jump,"Ah, the folly of youth. It is the time when people are most foolhardy, believing themselves to be far more prepared to face the world than they truly are. And more often than not, such youths are proven wrong, sometimes with very disastrous results. Few folks exemplify the foolishness of youth more than Maddalyn Magier, a young and beautiful lass with a penchant for potions. As a precocious child, Maddalyn had always been fascinated with the subtle science and exact art that is potion-making. And so, like many a reckless youth, before she even went to school, she sought to experiment. With Polyjuice. You know where this is going. Already time-consuming and complex, Maddalyn created a modified version of Polyjuice, one that was meant to allow the drinker to transform into an animal. It did not work. Instead of transforming her into an animal temporarily, like an Animagus, the potion changed her body entirely. But how has it changed her? Well, for one thing, given that rather than using mundane animal bits for her potion, she instead used the crushed remains of a Horned Serpent’s jewel. And so, she’s grown four horns on the sides and top of her head along with a few patches of scales all across her body. Not that it detracts from her beauty in any way. It actually makes her look quite exotic. But more than that, her potions experiment has bestowed upon her a few unique abilities, ones that others would be more than happy to kill for. Like the stories told about Horned Serpents, she possesses the ability to turn herself invisible in a manner most reminiscent of the basic Disillusionment Charm, but most uniquely, she possesses the power of flight. Like the Pegasus of myth, Maddalyn can soar through the skies with her own power, unassisted by things such as brooms, charms, or even wings. And despite all the changes to her body and all the discrimination now rallied against her, she does not seem to mind. She remains the same aloof yet confident girl she’s ever been. After all, she simply sees this transformation of hers as proof that magic has taken a liking to her. To further prove this hypothesis of hers, she has taken to focusing on improving her skills as a potioneer, devising more potions to further modify her body. So far, she hasn’t really had much success in her endeavors, aside from finding a few shortcuts on more common potions like the Edurus potion and the Thunderbrew. But she’s confident that she’ll be able to make her mark in history as the greatest Potions Master in history. Perhaps you canhelp her with that, either as her partner or just as someone to keep her from delving too deep into her experiments. She is rather reckless after all."
