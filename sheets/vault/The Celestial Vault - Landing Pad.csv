400,Ravager Ship ,Thor: Love and Thunder,"The M-ships are commonly used among the Ravagers, and they’re a favorite of the Guardians of the Galaxy. Why? Well, they’re excellent vessels. And now you have one. It’s a small spaceship that’s swift and agile enough to serve as a fighter craft, while big enough to serve as the living quarters of eight people. Eight, human-sized people. I don’t know how you’re going to squeeze into this thing if you’re an enormous shadow monster. Anyways, it has a flight deck capable of seating six people, living quarters below, and has a hyperdrive engine so you can jump interstellar distances from planet to planet. It’s also got armaments in the form of twin plasma cannons, a solid cache of futuristic guns onboard, a system to detect distress calls across the galaxy, and a small auxiliary pod with its own hyperdrive that can separate from the main ship. "
200,Quinjet ,Age of Ultron,The small jet capable of transferring the group of Avengers in relative comfort over long distances in a short amount of time. You are now in possession of one of these jets. Good luck learning to fly one or maybe you can find a pilot.
100,Helicopter ,Smallville,"Bird? Plane? No, it’s your own personal VTOL aircraft. Not as fast as a jet, but highly maneuverable, with the expected add-ons, unlimited fuel, self-repair, etc."
200,"A Kryptonian spaceship,",Smallville,"A Kryptonian spaceship, either a little one like Clark’s pod or a bigger one
like Brainiac used. Unarmed, but can outperform any terrestrial aircraft easily and has a
lot of utility functions and useful scanners."
400,Rogue Shadow,The Force Unleahesd,"You have in your possession a perfect match for Galen Marek’s advanced stealth ship, the Rogue Shadow. The ship itself is a marvel of Imperial engineering and can easily travel undetected just about anywhere in the galaxy and is
equipped with an advanced hyperdrive. To better avoid Imperial... entanglements. Comes with a version of Juno Eclipse."
200, X-Wing: ,The Dark Empire,"A trusty craft, scarred by innumerable battles, but still ready for more, this T-65 X-Wing has served you well over the years despite its age. You’ll find it easy to upgrade over the coming years and even without upgrades it’ll do curiously well against the advancing technologies of the galaxy. Should you desire, one can exchange this for a differing fighter used by the Republic during this time period."
200,The Millenium Falcon,The Dark Empire,"Not the actual ship but a copy of the famous heavily modified YT-1300 Freighter that’ll serve you just as well, if not better given it lacks the constant maintenance issues the real one has and plagues Han and Chewie so much. Should you desire you may pick a similar freighter type from this period to instead gain."
300,X-301 Interceptor ,Stargate: SG1,"A human attempt at reverse engineering the Goa'uld 'Death Glider' fighter craft, this plane utilizes a propulsion system to get places, is capable of exiting the atmosphere under its own power, and somehow it even takes inertia out of the equation so the pilot doesn't need to worry about G-forces. As a bonus, it's armed with two staff cannon weapons and comes with its own shields."
400,Tel'tak,Stargate: SG1,"comes with its own hyperspace drive, transportation rings, cloaking and even four escape pods. This one has been modified to come with its own shields, but it has no weapons to speak of. You may need to find those on your own."
200,Puddle Jumper ,Stargate Atlantis,"Your very own no-frills flying Ancient ATV, this spacecraft is a bit smaller than a bus and designed to go through the Stargate. Looks a bit like a truncated cylinder, internally segmented into front and rear sealed compartments for crew and cargo. It has extensive sensors, an armament of 8 drones, a very zippy sublight engine, surprisingly good shielding, a cloaking device and amazing inertial dampeners. However, it has no hyperdrive or any kind of plumbing, so it's best for short trips only (well, for certain definitions of short, since it can cross an entire solar system in under 24 hours)."
200,Union Shuttle,The Orville,"A standard issue shuttle craft used by the Planetary Union to transport cargo as well as personnel. It has seats for 6 human sized people including 2 for the pilots, but at maximum capacity can carry 32 human sized people. It is capable of travel at faster than light with its Quantum Drive and has a food synthesizer to create food, a cloaking device for stealth, deflector screens for protection which can also be used to protect the occupants from extremely strong gravity and a versatile docking port to allow for docking several different ports. If you don’t like the shoe shaped shuttle, then you can opt for the 3rd season redesign. Furthermore, it will return to you if lost or destroyed in one hour, and you have blueprints to create more."
400, Sith Infiltrator,The Phantom Meance,"A fittingly fearsome vessel for a deadly pilot, this model is identical to the starship Scimitar belonging to Darth Maul. Like him, you can use this sleek ship to silently travel wherever you need to be. This heavily modified Star Courier is armed with
concealed laser cannons, a torpedo launcher and a minelayer. It carries a compliment of 3 DRK-1 Dark Eye probe droids and a repulsorcraft speeder bike. You can choose the name of the ship and the bike."
400,Vertibird,Fallout 3,"Not too many enemies will have the benefit of air superiority, so you've already got a massive advantage by owning this flying tank.. It's got durable armor and can be outfitted with a number of weapons, though this one is equipped with gatling
lasers. It has enough room inside to fit an entire squad wearing power armor and their pilot. The best part is, you'll never have to worry about refueling."
