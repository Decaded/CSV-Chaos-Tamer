100,Jet Ski,Loki,"Wow, you have one of these? And a bunch of magazines about them, for  when you don’t have time or permission to use the Jet Ski. The latter could be quite useful  in learning how to use and maintain it, and we’ll throw in a proper life jacket so you can use it safely. You’re not really going to have any time to use it while you’re working for the TVA  though. "
400, XJ-2 Airspeeder ,Revenge of the Sith ,"Despite the red and silver colour scheme, this vehicle is actually an  excellent choice for getting anywhere discretely. It is registered under a pseudonym, which  will allow you to use it to travel without being monitored. Even if you’re not wearing any  sort of disguise, or using it from your own home, as far as anyone can tell it’s just ‘Jun Perr’  going out for a drive and no person or system will notice its occupants. In the event you are  somehow chased while driving it, you will find it has been modified for high speed and  manoeuvrability, and the steering yoke is modified to allow for sharp turns. It has unlimited  fuel and ammunition, and if destroyed or damaged you can summon another after a day has  passed. "
200,Space Racer’s Bike ,Invinicble,"You have received a  perfect copy of Space Racer’s space motorcycle. It is a  flying motorcycle that can fly extremely quickly, fast  enough to keep up with a young Viltrumite, and is able to  go FTL at the speed of full on capital ships. 
"
50,Car,Smallville,"Might be an old jalopy, might be a fancy sports car. But this self-maintaining and repairing motor vehicle never runs out of gas and even if totally destroyed reappears in your Vault a week later."
100,Punisher Party Van,MCU - 1,"Pssst, hey kid. You want some goodies? Of course you do. That's why you need this van. Immune to small arms fire and coming with a peculiar costume with a skull on the front, this van is sure to bring the party no matter where you want to go or who you want to invite. It's even got a few racks to store some... party favors as it were. Which may or may not be small arms or automatic weapons."
200,Atlas Mech ,Mass Effect - Legendary Edition,"When there are giant monsters, when one man isn't enough, when all else fails, there will always be giant fighting robots. Okay, that might be an exaggeration, but this machine designed by the human terrorist organization Cerberus is an impressive piece of tech. It combines the deadly armour and firepower of a YMIR mech with the tactical superiority of a trained pilot. Equipped with a powerful rocket launcher and a high-power mass accelerator cannon, powerful kinetic shields and a polycrystalline composite hull, it's sure to be a terror on any battlefield."
200,M35 Mako ,Mass Effect - Legendary Edition,"This vehicle was designed by the Human Alliance for their frigates, made for rapid deployment, and can be deployed on virtually any world. It's armor is tough enough to withstand high drops, extreme heat and cold and rough terrain, with the suspension and propulsion system allowing the vehicle to adapt to various terrain. It's not unarmed either, as it is in possession of a 155mm mass accelerator and a mounted machine gun, it's perfect for both travel and combat."
200,New Genesphere ,DC - Young Justice,"A living New Genesis technology. She is a Sphere that is capable of adopting several forms, including that of a flying motorcycle, and a pill bug mode that can jam control signals, and take control of mechanized objects.

200,War Wheel,Justice League Unlimited,"One of the Nazi superweapons invented by Vandal Savage in WW2. A giant monowheel tank covered in spikes and armed with two heavy cannons. This thing will tear through even modern tanks and vehicles, but most superpowered individuals won't have any problem taking this thing down."
400,Scout Salamander,Ciaphas Cain,"Unfortunately this does not give you a Space Marine pal, but you get the next best thing: a car with a big gun. The Salamander is a small reconnaissance vehicle used by the Imperial Guard and based on the Chimera chassis. It is designed primarily for reconnaissance duties and is lightly armed and armoured but very fast. It possesses an Autocannon to defend itself and the engine can be overcharged if some extra speed is needed.
