Free,PDA,Doom 3,"
The UAC’s standard PDA serves as a multi-purpose tool for all personal and administrative tasks. Holding an individual’s personal records, it can be used in place of any other form of I.D. (such as passports or access cards). It also serves as a mobile phone, provides access to the internet and personal emails, and it is capable of wirelessly downloading additional media such as instruction videos from nearby systems if such a service is provided. The PDA carries a biometric lock to prevent access to personal files by anyone other than the user, and this particular variant has been upgraded for maximum compatibility with any other computer system you might encounter in the future as well as effectively unlimited storage and memory. If lost or destroyed, you’ll find a replacement in your pocket the next time you reach for it, without any loss of data as a consequence of its previous incarnation’s untimely demise.

Free,Flashlight ,Doom 3,"
Sporting a static transfer power supply, the Flashlight is effectively guaranteed to never need recharging. Providing a decent amount of light, it is a vital tool for the UAC Mars facility, where power failures and brownouts are common due to the varied but frequently high energy needs of scientific equipment in locations like the Alpha and Delta labs. Its robust construction also allows it to be used as a cudgel in case of emergencies.

200,Psychic Paper ,Doctor Who,"Ah, now this is a bit more tricky. You now have a notebook’s worth of Psychic Paper, a Time Lord device that can tap the mental impressions of the reader to make him see an illusion of whatever document they’ve been told to expect to se. Very handy for convincing people you really do have valid identification or signed permission to be let in the building, or a contract as the latest consultant to their secret project, or whatever else you can think of. It doesn’t matter how many sheets of paper you tear out of your notebook, it will always have more. Even works on electronics... somehow. Exactly where the money comes from when you use it as a Credit Card is unknown, but you can. Unless you start drawing attention, that is. Besides that, this serves in place of biometrics, electric IDs, the lot. Since the Psychic Paper has to be able to read the subject’s mind in order to pull off the illusion, people who are particularly strong-willed or highly intelligent or possess sufficient psionic defenses can potentially see through it. Still, it should work handily enough on the vast majority of everyone you could reasonably expect to encounter."
100,Plausible ID,Revenge of the Sith,"You have a form of identification that backs up whatever position you  intend to have. This is all the paperwork, ID’s and records that would be needed to have a  position in a society that has such records"
100,Omni-tool,Mass Effect: Andromeda,"You get an omni-tool loaded up with programs and information that’d be best suited for unsupported colonization in a new galaxy. Because the Andromeda Initiative knew that they’d be going with a finite supply of ammo, medi-gel and power cells, each omni-tool can recover and repurpose appropriate resources to serve appropriate functions. For example, liquid coolant allows weapon heatsinks to be reused, and organic compounds can be refined into medi-gel. They can also convert consumable items into immediately usable forms. Finally, they do everything else regular omni-tools can: Communication, minifacturing fabricator, sensor analysis, and computer mainframe."
100,Protocol Droid:,The Force Unleashed,"Your very own protocol droid, loyal to you and capable of acting as a head butler for your properties. Though most importantly for you whenever this droid is present it passively boosts your diplomatic abilities."
100,Astromech Droid,Dark Empire,"A droid much like R2-D2 with the same capabilities and sentient status. As R2 was instrumental to Luke Skywalker’s success, this little one will surely contribute greatly to your journey. Will serve as a companion."
100,Communicator,Star Trek: Enterprise ,"A device for speaking to ships in orbit or people on the other side of a planet without a lot of infrastructure. Can be used to summon starships if you purchase any, or to call for beam-up."

50,Cellphone,Smallville," A phone with limitless battery and perfect signal anywhere, cannot
be lost or stolen or hacked. If you reach into your pocket, it will be there. Updates to
match the capabilities of the latest model."
50,Lantean Detector,Stargate Atlantis,"Detects life signs and the energy signatures of active tech (and possibly energy beings and biotech), but  doesn't distinguish between human and Wraith, or even human and replicator. Also useful for finding the nearest puddle jumper or Stargate if you’ve lost your way. You do not need to Ancient Gene to make it work"
50,Turkey Sandwiches ,Stargate Atlantis,"A brown paper lunch bag with a great turkey sandwich in it. In fact, its owner will always be able to find a great turkey sandwich inside the bag. If you ruin, lose, sell or give away the bag, it will only contain one last sandwich but a replacement bag will quickly turn up – certainly before lunchtime the next day – so please feel free to share. Your choice of mundane bread and condiments."
100,Perception Filter Key ,Doctor Who,"A key from the TARDIS, this tiny little thing has been modified to extend a Perception Filter all around the wearer. A perception filter is a field that, as the name suggests, filters you from people’s perceptions. Unless someone is deliberately looking for you, or you do something to attract attention, you find that people simply don’t care about you all that much. Their eyes pass right over you, dismissing you as part of the scenery. Could be useful, this."
400,Pan-Dimensional Cellphone,Doctor Who,"Exactly what it says on the tin. Normally all these can do is call, but this one is special even among them. Firstly, of course, this cellphone never runs out of battery power or encounters an error. It can hold any amount of data, and can never be physically damaged, hacked or corrupted. But all that’s just the side stuff. Mainly, this phone can operate perfectly fine, as if it was still in the best-connected spot on Earth, from any times and place in existence. Calling, messages, the internet, it all works just as well as it ever did, no matter where you end up. Yes, this includes the GPS. Somehow."
200, Storage Statues,The Phantom Meance. ,"Need to hide some questionably legal items, but don’t have easy access to extradimensional storage space? Perhaps you just want some decoration? This takes the form of several sculptures and statues that both look quite nice and have concealed places for storage within them. When something is hidden inside the statues, no
sensory abilities or technology will detect them, even if you were hiding artefacts that emitted an evil aura."
200,Walking Throne,The Phantom Meance. ,"Sure, you could just walk... but then how could you show your
superiority? You have a somewhat spider-like walking throne like the one belonging to Nute
Gunray of the Trade Federation, allowing you to relax on your way to your destination."
100, Intimidating Sunglasses ,Star Trek - Picard,"Even if your species is known to have a secondary eyelid developed from living on a desert planet that makes wearing sunglasses somewhat useless, sometimes you just need to look intimidating. This gives you a boost to intimidation while not actually making you any less capable of seeing. As a bonus, nobody wonders if you are really the species you are supposed to be if you wear these."
50,Fish Tank,Mass Effect - Legendary Edition,"As boring as they may be, most can agree that fishes are pretty to look at. What you have here is a massive tank filled with tropical, freshwater fishes from a number of planets, primarily from Earth. You will never have to worry about feeding them or cleaning out the tank, and the fish inside never seem to die. At the very least, it
will look good in your office or bedroom."
100,Pip-Boy 3000,Fallout 3,"A wrist mounted computer that can monitor its user's vitals, along with storing a large amount of information, record video and audio, automatically mapping out local terrain, an alarm function, a geiger counter, and can connect to other terminals. It can even play the radio."
200,Mother Box ,Justice League Unlimited. ,"An alien computer connected to the Source capable of interfacing with a wide array of machinery, projecting holographic images, providing information about topics known to the people of New Genesis or Apokolips, and creating portals between planets vast distances apart. This device is so advanced that it could reprogram a machine on par with Brainiac, but you have to directly attach the Mother Box to whatever it is you want it to interface with in order for it to work."
100,25th Century Drone,Justice League Unlimited. ,"A small levitating drone from the late 2400's. This cute little machine comes with a biometric scanner, a hologram projector capable of showing videos and animated images in mid-air, a virtual library of detailed information that it can instantly look up, and even a fan strong enough to quickly blow away smoke. In addition to all these features this thing will also serve as your own ever exuberant cheerleader, offering praise and encouragement whenever
it can."
0,Servo Skulls,Warhammer 40k - Adeptus Mechanicus,"A dozen servo skulls. Dull but reliable servants, coming equipped for a variety of tasks. The patterns of each are easy to re-fit for more specialized work.
"
200,Salacious Seer ,Craftworld Eldar,"This Seer, bearing both the Seer and Spirit Seer perks, appears to have an unhealthy interest in the concept of “love.” While romance is not unknown among the Eldar, this individual's propensity to use their gifts in a pursuit known as “matchmaking” is something of an annoyance to the Craftworld at large. Still, consider also that they seem to see a future together with you – regardless of any prior arrangements. The Craftworld's hope that you might be able to rein them in may well be unfounded..."
200,Fine Art Collection,Warhammer 40k - Planetary Governor,"Your collection of rare and valuable art pieces is the envy of many, showcasing your refined taste and appreciation for beauty.
