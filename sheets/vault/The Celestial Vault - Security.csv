200,Dark Force Cage,Dark Empire,"Sometimes you just want to transport a powerful prisoner without all the hassle of building a strong enough cage to contain them. That’s where this comes in; the Dark Force Cage serves as a solution to this age-old dark lord problem. Prisoners placed within its crackling confines will find all their abilities simply cease to function; the Force refuses to answer, and so on. Makes for a handy and portable solution given its ability to transport itself."
200,Robot Detector Machine,Loki,"Please confirm to your knowledge that you are not a fully  robotic being, were born an organic creature and do in fact possess what many cultures  would call a soul. Not sure? Would you like to test this? This archway will scan anything  passing through it, determine the nature of the being, presence of features such as a soul,  and create a printout of their temporal aura. By default, this device will also proceed to melt  the being from the inside out if it is a robot, but your version can switch this feature off if  desired. If you wanted to weed out robotic duplicates, Life Model Decoys and other  cybernetic infiltrators this might come in handy. Just be prepared to clear up the mess."
400, Time Twister,Loki,"A security device used by the TVA to control and evade their prisoners when necessary. It can be used to temporally loop whoever it is secured to, which can be used to return a prisoner to their original position by a few seconds and prevent them from being able to successfully run away or attack. It can also be used to transport the target to a set location. It comes in the form of a collar to go on the prisoner and a remote control for the one guarding them, but unlike the standard model this collar can’t be removed or disabled by anyone you place it onto, and the mechanism won’t activate against your will. This might be useful for avoiding a prisoner successfully removing the collar and using the device on you. Just bear in mind that the Time Twister just loops whoever it is placed on, not anything else, so if furniture has been moved since the wearer was last sitting on it, they will fall to the ground if looped back to when they were in that position. "
200,Jumpers Guard,Revenge of the Sith," You have been allowed your own set of private guards. This squad of red-clad soldiers are elite bodyguards for you. It seems these have been given the same training regime that has been proposed for future guards of the leader of the government, utterly loyal to you and highly skilled in various forms of martial arts, including  Echani. They are equipped with vibroswords and force pikes, in addition to heavy blaster pistols for ranged combat. If you keep them around, you will find they are quite adept when it comes to anyone weaker than you are. They are less useful against those who would overpower or equally match you, and in such situations, you might be better off fleeing or fighting personally rather than relying on your guards to deal with them. While they will not dramatically pose unless you instruct them otherwise, they are exceptionally good at protecting or avenging you and are particularly effective against opponents whose combat abilities favour style over substance. Since they are intended to protect you at all times, all you need to do is call for them and at least two will step into view from obscured areas. This appearing and vanishing capability will not be regarded as unusual, though their sudden appearance can still take those that threaten you by surprise. They have unlimited ammunition for their weapons, and if killed or injured you can summon them again after one hour. "
100,T-900 Infiltrator ,Terminator,"Despite primarily being designed for infiltration, many T-800 models are not very... convincing. They are often robotic and emotionless, acting in ways that would very much raise eyebrows within modern society, let alone within the paranoia-filled Resistance cells that the T-800 is supposed to infiltrate. But that’s why this was built. Unlike its predecessor, the T-900 is truly human-like. A T-900 could infiltrate human society for years on end and most people will never consider their behavior to be anything other than human. Emotions, tears, everything really. And now, a T-900 has made it her life’s mission to protect and follow you. She is extremely knowledgeable with a multitude of information downloaded right into her database, and she will, to the best of her ability, use all that she is to serve you. Treat her well."
50,FENRIS Mech ,Mass Effect -Legendary Edition ,"Designed by Hahne-Kedar specifically for security, this robotic canine is very friendly to its owner and their allies, while being a terror to its enemies. Their advanced sensors can detect weapons and narcotics, used in the same manner bomb and drug-sniffing dogs would, and this one is not hackable, meaning that pesky programmers won't be able to turn your beloved pet against you."
0,Friendly Mutant,Fallout 3,"An intelligent super mutant who retained his intellect, Fawkes was held captive and tormented within Vault 87 for his entire existence. But you have come along and freed him, and for that, he's eternally grateful. With his mutant biology and a giant gatling laser, there's little that could stop him."
200,Assassin Droid,The Mandolorian ,"Former assassin droids were reprogrammed to work as bounty hunters for a number of reasons they were efficient they had no conscious and they were cheap, you now have one of your own pre programmed to obey and protect you at any cost, this one is immune to reprogramming"
200,Inhibitor Collar,DC - Young Justice,"A special control collar designed to prevent the wearer from accessing their superhuman abilities, it can also apply enough electric shock to render a person unconscious. The collars must be pre-programmed for an individual's specific abilities. You receive a shiny new set of this collar, and blueprints on how to program them, and build more."
400,Canoptek Spyder,Necron,"Not all troops in the Necron arsenal were once Necrontyr. The Canoptek constructs bear the distinction of being entirely robotic in nature. One of the most important of these constructs is the Canoptek Spyder, meant to oversee Necron tombs while its inhabitants sleep. To aid in this purpose, the Canoptek Spyders are able to manufacture swarms of Canoptek Scarabs and direct them towards intruders, ripping them to shreds before they even have a chance to scream. Additionally, they are capable of repairing Necrons who are damaged beyond even Necrodermis' ability to repair.
