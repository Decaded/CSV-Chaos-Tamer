100,The Bar,Mass Effect: Andromeda,"When the going gets tough, the tough...go out for drinks? You have a bar full of drinks manned by a skilled bartender, that the people working for you can gather at, wind down, have a good time, and maybe let slip how they feel about how things are going. The selection is constantly refilling, and both the drinks and the bartender’s skills expand/update as you and your people encounter new things. Find a plant that smells good. It’ll be a great garnish. An off-duty soldier discovers a hole-in-the-wall with a bartender with a bunch of new drink recipes. Your person at the bar will rapidly learn how to make them, with equal skill. They’ll also be very good at dispensing advice and “overhearing” conversations and will relay intel to you. Lastly, as a side benefit of owning the place, you get free drinks.

100,Sabaac Deck,Darth Bane Triology ,"Sabaac is one of the most popular card games in this galaxy, having players from the miners of Apatros to the halls of power for both of the current galactic states. A sabacc deck comprised a number of face cards (including the Idiot, the Queen, the Evil One, and the Star) and four suits of fifteen pip cards (Flasks, Sabers, Staves, and Coins). The face value of the cards change at random in play but are locked as soon as the cards are placed on the sabacc tables suspension field. This in particular makes Sabacc a complex and unpredictable game, as a potential winning hand could turn into a losing one if not used at the right moment."
100,VR Stasis Pod,Stargate Atlantis,"Puts a body into suspended animation while the mind is active in a real-time VR simulation. From the
inside, the VR can be indistinguishable from reality, provided those inside don't remember going in or
try to tax the system too badly. Comes with a free selection of preset virtual environments plus
instructions for more."
50,The Game,Stargate Atlantis,"A pair of Ancient ‘game’ consoles, which contains a Civilization-style RTS game where the players take on the roles of Oracles guiding their respective nations. It has a level of detail totally beyond any game the Tau’ri have – a level of detail that would make one wonder if the nations were more than just simulations. Fortunately these particular consoles are not linked up to a series of satellites over a distant planet."
100,Matter Synthesis,The Orville,"This is a device that allows for the dematerialization of matter and the rematerialization of that matter as something else. This device allows it to reproduce nearly any amount of inorganic material when requested and has an advanced computer to allow for new materials to be reproduced with new instructions. The Synthesizer can create any inorganic material and even organic material such as food or beverages at virtually no cost, but cannot create power sources or fuel such as Dysonium as that entails a net energy loss. For example, you could use this device to create the structure and frame of something such as a smartphone,
but the power for that smartphone must come from somewhere else as powering it using the Synthesizer will result in a net energy loss. This comes with blueprints to make more Matter Synthesizers."
100,Executive Poker Set,Star Trek - Lower Decks,"The set includes a luxury leather box with soft velour interior, 300 clay poker chips, 5 poker dice,
and 2 decks of starfleet branded playing cards"
200,AR Machine ,Red Dwarf,"Alternate Reality machine allowing for highly accurate simulation, comes programmed with the
Camelot Game, Zero G Kickboxing and Jane Austin World."
300,Rejuvenation Shower ,Red Dwarf,"Restores the user to the prime of their youth. Will come as a flat pack and CANNOT be used to time
travel, regardless how bad you are with an Alan key."
200,Jumper Corp Vending Machine,The Outer Worlds,"Some would argue that convenience is a major factor or quality that people would love to have with buying the things they need for life... Like staple foods like protein-proving meats, biological minerals and vitamins in vegetables, and energy-producing carbohydrates. And maybe stuff for sugary treats and (cheap/fine) liquor, alongside possible weapons, armour, and other useful utility items. So why not tap into the market with your very own Vending Machine, albeit based on
the ones seen in Halcyon. It can take all forms of currency and can even have things be sold in case of bartering situations."
50,Galactic Cuisine ,Mass Effect - Legendary Edition,"All organics need some form of sustenance, from the familiar Human hamburger to the dextro-amino foods eaten by the Turians and Quarians. You receive a very large, replenishing pantry filled with all ingredients used in modern cooking used by the Citadel Races, as well as a comprehensive cookbook being downloaded to your omni-tool containing all recipes used."
50,Milky Way Media,Mass Effect - Legendary Edition,"Ever since sentient life could think, it's been trying to find ways to distract itself. Books, movies, and TV shows can be found in any species, and have only improved since they've left the confines of their homeworlds. You now have the largest media collection known to Citadel Space, containing every scrap of media created by its member races. Maybe after reading a suspenseful Salarian mystery novel you'll feel the need to curl up with your special someone and watch the popular Turian and Quarian romance film, ""Fleet and Flotilla."""
50,Vending Machine,Fallout 3,"The most popular drink in America, you just can't beat Nuka-cola! And now you'll never run out of this drink ever again. This vending machine is always filled with Nuka-Cola, as well as Nuka-Cola Quantum. This will instantly restock whenever you close it."
50,Beer Keg:,Deep Rock Galactic ,"Our employees are dwarves, naturally they demand beer, and a lot of it. Each keg you purchase here of company standard beer contains enough repopulating inebriation to last a year if drunk in moderation. As you undoubtedly will not drink it in moderation you may purchase more kegs or different brews for additional charges of 50 CP. Because our specialty craft brews are far more expensive, kegs of Arkenstout, Mactera Brew, Blackout Stout, etcetera will cost you 100 CP."""
