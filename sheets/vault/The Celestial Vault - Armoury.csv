100,Custom Armor ,Mass Effect: Andromeda,"This is your custom hardsuit, and you brought it with you from home (whether that be Milky Way or Andromeda).

200,Mandalorian Armor,The Force Unleashed,"No hunter is ready without a suit of armour to protect them, and you have something special indeed. A full suit of Mandalorian armour equipped with a heads-up display, jetpack, wrist weapons, etc, but best of all it’s made of Beskar Iron a virtually indestructible metal. While in the armor neither blaster bolts nor lightsabers will be able to harm you and it’ll take a great deal of firepower to pierce it.

400,Personal Force-Field Device,Stargate Atlantis,"A gem-like device that produces a personal force field and inertial dampening effect while still allowing filtered air to pass through it. You could be stabbed, shot, blasted, zatted, or thrown off a tall building – none of it would harm you – but it’s basically like walking around in a full-body oven mitt. It doesn't have an air supply so you can still suffocate without compatible air around you, and there’s a trick you have to figure out to eat or drink. The mental trigger that activates it locks it to your biometrics. However, if the shield is left on for too long, absorbs too much damage, or sustains repeated strikes, it will expend its power source and deactivate, unable to be reused until fully charged again."
