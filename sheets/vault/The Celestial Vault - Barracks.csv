400,Terror Force:,The Force Unleashed," A gift from the Empire to you, you now have ownership of a task force of the Empire’s Terror Droids. The force is equipped with four different types of droids: Terror Droids, which are smallspider-likee creations that use melee combat and grasp their opponents to launch vicious melee attacks; Terror Troopers, humanoid droids equipped with advanced stealth technology and weapons meant to quickly move in and out of dangerous situations without leaving a trace; Terror Bioroids, large hulking machines equipped with two bladed arms capable of posing a challenge to Jedi although they come with their own weaknesses; and finally the Terror Walkers; these monstrosities are four legged juggernauts equipped with energy projectors, shields, missiles, and sharpened legs, each one capable of slaughtering basic soldiers en masse or board an enemy ship with minimal support, and is typically viewed as nigh unstoppable.. You have within your possession a Task Force of these droids numbering a thousand, the majority will be the weaker droids and will with each level up they’ll be fewer of them but the exact composition is up to you."
400,Minuteman Squad ,Loki,"It seems you’ve been given command of a squad of TVA’s main forces. You might be the senior member if just a Minuteman, an active leader if a Hunter, or just overseeing them if you’re a Judge. If you’re not part of the TVA, perhaps they’ve gone rogue to join you. Either way, this squad of Followers are equipped with standard TVA  armour and Time Sticks, and one member carries a Reset Charge. While they have  TemPads as a necessity, it seems these are limited to creating Timedoors to and from  your current time and location, making them better at rapid response at the cost of preventing them from going anywhere else in time and space. Still, when you need a backup that’s just a call away, these are the fastest responders you could expect. Should they or their equipment be lost, damaged or expended, they’ll be reinforced and resupplied within 48  hours relative to you.
