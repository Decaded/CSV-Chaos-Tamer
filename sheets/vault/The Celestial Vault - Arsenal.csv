50,Shotgun,Doom 3,"This robust close-quarters weapon is very useful in the cramped confines of the UAC Mars base, and is frequently found in the hands of its security personnel. Firing a lethal blast of pellets capable of pulping flesh with ease, the Shotgun is a reliable, highly effective weapon at short range. Sporting an eight-round pump-action magazine, the need to insert each shell individually means that reloading a completely empty shotgun can be a somewhat lengthy process. Still, if you’re getting ‘up close and personal’, you’ll not find this weapon wanting. Its main downside is that the spread of its projectiles makes it nearly useless at longer ranges.
"
50,Double-Barrel Shotgun,Doom 3," (50CP)
This classic design has remained popular for centuries - and for good reason. Though this weapon needs to be reloaded after each shot and its effective range is very small, it provides unmatched close-quarters firepower. No other weapon can hope to provide the kind of instantaneous stopping power this beast unleashes at point-blank range, with the possible exception of the BFG 9000… which would likely kill the user as well.
"
50,Chainsaw ,Doom 3,"Delivered to Mars due to a supply mix-up, the Chainsaw is entirely useless as a tool (given Mars’ total lack of forestation). However, as a tool for demon-killing endeavors it is unmatched in close quarters combat potential. The teeth are honed to a razor’s edge, and they will never dull no matter how many demons you saw in half, and indeed you could probably use it to saw through solid steel without any noticeable drop in performance. It’s likewise guaranteed to never jam or get clogged (due to demon gore, for example), and the chain will never snap during use.
Rev ‘em up, and send those demons running!
"
100,Chaingun,Doom 3,"This weapon is a heavy-duty automatic weapon capable of literally sawing a target in half. Firing large-calibre armour-piercing rounds with a high rate of fire, few guns can match the sheer might of this automatic weapon. Though accuracy can become a problem at the range, each round carries enough force that a mere handful of hits is often enough to eliminate even armoured targets.
"
100,Plasma Rifle,Doom 3,"Part of the UAC’s next generation of handheld weaponry, the Plasma Rifle foregoes the use of bullets to instead send a stream of magnetically contained plasma at a target. Though its rate of fire is lower than that of the Machine Gun and Chaingun, each plasma bolt hits hard, and its ammo capacity is sufficient to saturate targets with a stream of blue fire."
100,Rocket Launcher,Doom 3,"Originally meant for demolition work, this design of Rocket Launcher has been modified for military use. Dealing immense damage in a wide radius and sporting a five-round magazine, few targets can withstand a barrage from this weapon. However, the rockets themselves are not guided, and agile opponents might be able to dodge if they see the attack coming. Close-quarters use is not recommended.
"
100,Sakaaran Laser Rifle ,Thor: Love and Thunder,"Tired of Asguardians swinging swords and hammers when they could just as easily go for ranged weapons? Those fools will tell you that their arms are “elegant weapons foa more civilized age.” Don’t listen to them. Why would you, when you can have the best of both worlds? This rifle, made on Sakaar, can fire powerful bolts of energy to fell your foes. Yet it’s also big and tough enough to swing around like a club if you’re strong enough. 
"
200,Time Stick,Loki,"The standard weapon used by the TVA to incapacitate and/or prune  Variants. Collapsible and capable of lengthening to a longer-bladed staff-like shape, this device can seemingly disintegrate any organic or inorganic target, while transporting it to the Void. Yours can be configured to send a target elsewhere if desired. An additional function can briefly slow a target hit by this baton-like weapon to 1/16th of its speed while causing them to feel the pain in real time. Useful if you need to secure someone with far greater strength than you. "
100,Trusted Blaster,The Force Unleashed,"No bounty hunter is ready without a trusted sidearm. You may pick any blaster-type weapon within the Star Wars galaxy to use as a sidearm, within reason. It’ll never break or run out of ammunition and will always be in peak condition unless you want wear and tear. Another weapon may also be imported into this."
100,Bowcaster,The Old Republic,"These bulky crossbow-railguns are the signature weapon of the Wookiees. While their woefully short 50 m max range, heavy recoil, slow fire rate, and 3-fold reliance on physical ammo, plasma gas, and energy packs make them impractical for military applications, the damage and penetration of the energy-infused metal quarrel are unmatched among handheld weapons, making them prized weapons for hunters of dangerous prey. Even the heaviest personal armour is unlikely to block a direct hit from a bowcaster bolt within the optimal range of 30 meters. Includes 3 35-round drum magazines and a power pack good for approximately 300 shots."
50,Phase Pistol,Star Trek: Enterprise,"The preferred weapon of the 22nd Century, this compact energy weapon has virtually limitless shots and a stun setting."
100,SkyNet Chips,Terminator,"Weapons are quite a necessity if you find yourself facing against the relentless hordes
of machines SkyNet has at its disposal. It’s unfortunate then that most conventional
weapons aren’t really that effective on SkyNet’s war machines. But that’s why you have
this. Within this box are an endless amount of computer chips. By integrating this chips
into your guns, you can improve their accuracy, fire rate, power, or clip size by 30% per
chip. You can only integrate three chips per gun however, but you do have the ability to
swap them for other chips whenever you aren’t in combat."
100,Isotope Weapon,Terminator,"Designed by a time traveler known only as the “Engineer”, the isotope weapon is a rifle
built from scavenged parts around 1963. It is, in a sense, a powerful plasma rifle that
allows for a variety of firing modes. Through the magnets around the chamber, the
plasma can be shaped into a cylinder, a bullet set to be fired off, one capable of blasting
apart a T-888. And you have the choice to fire off the plasma as either a single slug or a
pulse. You have not only the weapon but also the blueprints for it."
100,40-Watt Phased Plasma Rifle,Terminator,"As mankind was quick to realize, ballistic weaponry proved to be less than effective
against the machines that SkyNet had at its disposal. Which is why they had this. A plasma
rifle. This plasma rifle fires off bolts of plasma at a speed over Mach 25 and with a rate
of fire that far surpasses most common ballistic weapons. These bolts of plasma are
capable of punching through over a quarter of a meter of case-hardened steel. A direct
hit from this rifle is almost certainly guaranteed to put down any organic target, whether
it be through the explosion caused by the plasma or the shot itself. Even a near miss is
deadly, capable of inflicting 3rd-degree burns and any splash damage from it is about as
dangerous as a traditional grenade. As for ammunition, you’ll never need to worry about
that. This thing has unlimited ammunition. All you have to worry about is overheating
which means it needs to cool off every one or two hundred shots. Still, this is a powerful
weapon indeed. Go put down some Terminators, would you?"
100,M-134 Minigun,Terminator,"Ah. The M-134 minigun. A classic staple of action movies everywhere. Now you get the
chance to experience it all for yourself. Ordinarily, such a firearm would be far too heavy
and unwieldy to fire without being mounted onto a vehicle, you’ll find that you’ll have no
trouble lifting and firing this gun, being to practically weightless to you. Others will not
have that luxury. Capable of firing 6,000 bullets a minute, bullets going over twice the
speed of sound and capable of penetrating walls as easily as it blows holes in men. Not
only that but you’ll also find that you never need to worry about reloading this gun. This
thing has infinite ammunition. You can keep firing this until the barrel starts melting."
50,FN P90 Submachine Gun,Stargate: SG-1,"A standard weapon for most humans as they explore
the galaxy and the planets within it. It is a stable weapon for close-range skirmishes."
200,Staff Cannon ,Stargate: SG-1,"A modified version of the Ma'Tok Staff Weapon, this cannon is normally mounted on a Death Glider or used as an anti-artillery weapon. Yours has been modified, however, and provided you have the strength you can walk around with it like it was an energy mini-gun. Go nuts!"
50,Wraith Stunner Pistol/Rifle,Stargate Atlantis,"A wraith stunner pistol or rifle that incapacitates anyone it hits with a ""bolt"" of energy. One torso shot is usually enough to bring a person down; stronger humans may withstand up to three hits for a short
period."
200,Particle Magnum,Stargate Atlantis,"A handgun that fires bolts of energy and is styled remarkably like a revolver, used by the Travelers but sometimes found in the hands of others. The weapon has two selectors, one being the safety and the other deciding the power level: stun, kill and incinerate (explosive). This particular sidearm doesn’t need maintenance or recharging, and can have a different appearance if you like."
50,Zap o’ matic,Destroy All Humans,This rifle sized weapon fires a constant stream of electricity that arcs between targets and can wipe entire squads out in just a few seconds. Features a recharging battery that will top itself off with just a few moments pause.
50,Dislocator ,Destroy All Humans,"Fires pink gravity defying energy disks that fling whatever it hits in a random
direction. Like the Zap o' matic, the Dislocator has a recharging battery."
100,PM-44 ,The Orville,"A small single-handed plasma weapon used by the Planetary Union for security and combat and can be holstered for easy carrying. It has 10 different settings which can stun or kill depending on the setting, as a setting of 1 can stun most humanoid species, but a Moclan requires a setting of at least 5 to be stunned and the PM-44 at maximum setting can kill a human a kilometer away. It can also be used as a cigarette lighter. Furthermore, it will return to you if lost or destroyed in one hour, and you have blueprints to create more."
400,Alien Blaster,Fallout 3,"A strange weapon from beyond the stars, this silver and blue pistol will fire off azure blasts that seem to act like plasma, but function like lasers. It hits like a super sledge and can pierce through most armors. Even a single shot from this could vaporize a mole rat completely, so what do you think would happen if you shot it at
another person?"
600,Fatman,Fallout 3,"One of the most devastating weapons out there, this big gun can fire off miniature nukes at a target, ensuring that everything around them ends up as nuclear paste. You could even kill a Behemoth with one shot,"
600,Tesla Cannon ,Fallout 3,"For when you need some big guns, look no further than the Tesla Cannon. It will fire off powerful blasts of electricity at a target, more than likely frying them with a single shot, though you will find it especially potent against robots and those wearing power armor."
400,Jingwei's Shocksword,Fallout 3,"A unique variant of the swords typically given to Chinese officers. By flicking a switch on the handle, the blade becomes enveloped by a field of electricity. Beyond the obvious use of electrocuting enemies, there is always the chance that you could vaporize your enemies, leaving only a pile of ash in your wake."
200,The Darksaber,The Mandolorian,"Because it really just isn't star wars without a lightsaber this Lightsaber was forged by the only Mandalorian Jedi, it's known for its blocky hilt and black angular blade that looks more like a traditional sword than a normal Lightsaber, traditionally held by the leader of the Mandalorian people"
100,GLOCK 22 ,Harley Quinn,"You possess a pair of Glock 22s that never runs out of bullets, and never misfires, although the fire power of it is similar to a normal handgun."
100,Nth Metal Weapon,Justice League Unlimted ,A powerful piece of alien equipment. This melee weapon of choice cackles with high amounts of electricity from a small unnoticeable generator (It can be toggled on and off with but a thought.) It is stupidly durable able to even smack around powerful magic beings with relative ease due to its anti-magic properties. Like any weapon it's only as deadly as its user. Don't worry about it breaking down. It won't. For
200,My Trusty Laspistol,Ciaphas Canin,"While Cain is normally shown holding a bolt pistol he actually uses a laspistol most of the time. This is due to the lighter recoil and weight of the weapon. You receive an enhanced laspistol and chainsword. The laspistol has had its fire power increased to match that of an Inferno pistol. The chainsword similarly has been modified to be as strong as a power weapon. Should you lose these weapons or in the event they are destroyed they will reappear in your warehouse the next day. 
"
200,The Meltagun,Ciaphas Canin,"The Meltagun is a powerful, short range anti-armour weapon that produces an intense, energetic beam of heat in the tens of thousands of degrees Centigrade. It is an incredibly dangerous tool capable of killing powerful foes such as Space Marines and higher level Tyranids.
