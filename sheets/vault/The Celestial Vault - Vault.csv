800,UAC Mars Facility,Doom 3,"One of the most advanced scientific research stations in the solar system, the UAC’s Mars facilities work on everything from energy production and terraforming to Archaeology and teleportation. It is one of the pinnacles of human achievement… and now, it is yours. Or at least, a copy of it is - perhaps one far enough away from the original that it’s safe from the coming demonic invasion?
Coming with a full complement of (mostly) competent staff as well as a wide variety of interesting technologies, the facility now operates under your command. Whether you decide to take a more active hand in their research or simply leave them to their own interests, they’re guaranteed to come up with interesting ideas over time - usually in areas involving physics, weapons development, and so on. In future worlds, you’ll likewise become the owner of a large, productive center of scientific learning, though it doesn’t need to be on Mars as such.

600,TVA Holoprojector,Loki,"It seems you’ve acquired your own TVA Holoprojector, viewing  room optional and attaching itself to any property you own or accessible via your Vault. Using this device, you can look up the records of how the lives of any individual should go without any interference. You can review their past, present and future, easily  navigating to any specific point in their lives even if they’re thousands of years old. You  seem to be the only one absent from the records, which might be due to either a filing error  or your unusual nature. Curiously enough, hitting the device hard enough to crack the  screen seems to create a peculiar error in the records, causing it to generate a variety of  scenarios that could have occurred due to minor differences in events. Not particularly  useful for the purposes of the TVA, but it could be interesting if you ever wondered... what  if? "
400, Private Meeting Room,Revenge of the Sith," – Even if you and others share concerns about constitutional  amendments that weaken the legislature or the potential rise of a dictatorship, actually  meeting to discuss such developments can be dangerous. Now you have somewhere to  meet without the fear of being arrested as traitors or spied upon. This room, which can be  attached to any property you own, protects those within it from any attempts at monitoring  or otherwise spying on the room and what occurs within it. It will not appear as a blank spot  to any sensory technologies or abilities either, just generating generic but believable  conversations and events to such comprehensive monitoring efforts that will be overlooked.  Any agreements by those within it to keep secrets will be enforced, so once someone  verbally agrees to keep a secret, even if they don’t want to, they will not even reveal it to  their family or loved ones. "
200,Hall of Victories,Mass Effect: Andromeda,"You now have a place to show off your successes, and maybe even include those of your subordinates. Any time you or your subordinates have a noteworthy victory, there will be another display piece here going over what happened, and how you (or your subordinate(s)) were critical. You can open up this hall to whoever you wish, inspiring those who visit, improving your fame, and improving their confidence and belief in you. People who have heard of you because of your improved fame will be more open to listening to you. You can also choose specific things to display, such as
trophies or prototypes, or maybe even holographic displays of the important men and women who call you boss."
200,Meditation Chamber,Darth Bane Trilogy,"Both the Jedi and the Sith seem to share a love of meditating. The particularities of how they do it vary yes, but it’s well known that immersing oneself in the Force when alone has a plethora of benefits associated with it. This is your meditation chamber, a room for solitude and reflection. Mediation here brings with it great clarity of thought and the necessary rest sleep would otherwise bring to you."
200,Lantean Control Chair ,Stargate Atlantis,"Allows a person sitting in it to mentally control any technology hooked up to it - such as a starship or a defense network. No need for invasive cybernetic implants or cables jacking into your head - just sit in the chair and let your mind do the controlling. Such chairs are normally locked to the ATA gene, but you can lock this one to whatever conditions you like. As a special offer, you can also (dis)connect this particular chair to anything you bought with CP just by picking it up and putting it in or on that thing."
100,Asgardian Armory,,"When you have a collection of rare items, dangerous artifacts, or powerful weapons you want to show off... look no further. Gilded in gold and stone, this Vault Attachment has plenty of pedestals to place items of your choice up for display to prove your superiority or power over others. As a bonus, this place will continue to grow more resplendent and better reflect the items you place in here and the power you wielded to get them while holding plaques that give tales of their procurement. For an additional +200CP, items you place in here can be summoned to your person upon mentally commanding it while the Armory itself is protected and maintained by three Destroyer Units that are designed in a manner of your choosing."
400,The Forge,Deep Rock Galactic,"""Of course, we are dwarves. Gone may be the days of hammering heated lumps of metal on an anvil but our creative spark has certainly not waned. Take a weapon to this marvel of technology and, for a modest exchange of specialized Minerals you can fabricate your own Overclocks for that weapon or piece of equipment. Such modifications can simply offer a small boost to what the piece already does well, offer a larger boost at a balanced detriment, or completely evolve how you use that piece of gear. The strength of the object you are attempting to modify will naturally affect the amount of Minerals you need to use for an upgrade, and what kinds of Minerals."""
200,Red Room,MCU - 3,"holding cells and security systems in this grim structure belie it’s true purpose: Indoctrination into the Black Widow
project. Vats full of pheromones within can be Red Room used to implant inhuman loyalty in those trained here, while the cold-eyed Widows already instilled in the project relentlessly instil in recruits the same fighting techniques that Natasha
Romanov herself picked up-and perhaps a particularly talented student could even surpass her. Conveniently, this particular facility also produces the antidote to the pheromones if you ever need leverage...or have that peculiar Western affliction called “mercy” the Soviet Union long excised from itself in its pursuit of supersoldier excellence."
