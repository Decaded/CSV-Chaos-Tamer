200,Drexyl,Darth Bane Triology ,"Drexyls are animals native to the moon of Dxun. They’re migratory predators that have traditionally been tamed by the Beast Masters of Onderon for war and status. A full-grown adult has a wingspan of twenty metres and possesses a hide capable of resisting heavy-duty blaster weapons. This one is not only obedient but exceptionally intelligent and strong-willed, capable of understanding following advanced instructions, carrying out complex maneuvers and holding to battle plans. Its will is such that if Bane had encountered this one on Dxun, he may have never left the planet."
50,Pet Neek,Darth Bane Triology ,"Neeks are reptilian herbivores, averaging about thirty centimetres in height, indigenous to the planet Ambria. They are non-sentient, and can often be seen congregating in flocks of about half a dozen, banding together for protection against the larger, carnivorous creatures. Usually timid and scatty, this particular Neek seems to have imprinted on you as its mother. Why you would want a cute, herbivorous raptor of such an adorable stature is beyond me"
100,Man’s Best Friend,Terminator,"Even before the written word, dogs have always been a part of man’s world. There is even evidence to suggest that dogs were the very first animals mankind ever domesticated. Across all of time and space, dogs will always be man’s best friend. Even after the apocalypse, dogs shall ever be mankind’s most loyal ally. It is only right then that you should have one such companion to stand by your side. This companion is a dog that shall forever be loyal to you and you alone. It will always be able to tell you apart from anything trying to fool it and not only that, but your good friend will always be able
to determine whether or not someone is actually human. This good boy is free for Humans, and you may import a pet or creature you already own into this option. If you wish, you can bring a pet you once owned to take this dog’s place."
0,Hamster ,Mass Effect Legendary Edition,"Isn't he just the most adorable little thing? You are now the proud owner of this Earthling pet that is known for randomly killing itself. Luckily there's no way yours will suffer such a fate, and if he is killed then it will just be resurrected the next day. You receive a glass cage to hold it in, as well as the food needed to feed him."
50,Varren,Mass Effect Legendary Edition,"Native to the planet Tuchanka, these reptilian omnivores are savage survivors, and opportune scavengers. Their fangs and claws are very dangerous to unprotected flesh, and can easily adapt to most environments. This one has been trained, is extremely loyal to you, and acts much like any other dog you'd find on Earth."
200,Alpha Predator,Fallout 3,"Fewer creatures out there inspire such fear and dread as the mighty deathclaw. Running faster than a man ever could, with massive talons that can cut through even power armor with frightening ease, and a scaly hide that is resistant to damage, is it any wonder that this beast is so feared?"
100,Gyrinx,Craftworld Eldar," This graceful, cat-like creature is odd in many ways. Empathetic to a fault, and
capable of forming a mighty mental bond with its owner, it can even improve the speed of its master's
thoughts. In temperament, habit, and even (slightly) physicality, it will, as your bond grows, come to
resemble you."
0/50,Babel Fish,Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy,"This is a small fish that goes in your ear. It can convert any spoken language into something you can understand. It looks like a goldfish and is so staggeringly useful that it (probably) disproves the existence of god. For 50 CP, you get a breeding pair."
