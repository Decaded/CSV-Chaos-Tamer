100,Holo Desk ,Age of Ultron,"A table shaped device that can create holographic models perfect for study, analysis and reconstruction of a vast array of items, weapons and events. Come in any design and colour of your choice. "
400,Junkyard,Mass Effect: Andromeda,"Junk to some is treasure to others. You get a doorway that leads to a small pocket universe that is filled with the local area’s lost, broken and/or discarded items. You might find broken gear, ruined vehicles, or maybe a pristine limited
edition item that someone just forgot about. Everything in here will be somewhat useful to you, but you get to decide if its use is as a source of resources, or if something is worth fixing. The doorway takes the appearance of an expandable hula hoop that opens a portal to the pocket universe. The pocket universe will refill with junk as you travel, or as the local area around you generates junk that will be siphoned off. In addition."
200,Toolkit ,New Jedi Order,A portable kit that happens to contain whatever you need for nonviolent use. From the most sophisticated of first aid kits to a hydrospanner to a delicate artisans tool.
200,Pristine Crux 2000 Workbench,The Outerworlds,"Normally, a Crux 2000 Workbench is a machine you’d see out there in Halcyon where you need to make upgrades, installing/removing mods, repair work on your equipment and so on, but this one is ‘different’. For one, it looks about as clean and factory new compared to other copies out there, so it’ll hopefully look nice wherever you place it. Another major difference is that anything repaired here will also somehow get this rather ‘Pristine’ quality added. This special quality makes the item in question vastly more durable and also just makes them look far nicer and far more valuable if one would wish to part the item for Bits. Oh, and the last one being that it can be easily modified to work on non-Haclyon tech as well, while still offering this special quality to make them ‘Pristine’ as well."
50,Dum-E and U,MCU -1,"Okay these robots may not do much, but they've got spirit! ...whatever passes for spirit in robots. Taking the form of single robot arms on treads, they try to do their best to aid you around your home and fulfill your wishes. Along with excellent pattern recognition they're unusually good at assisting with fabrication and mechanical construction of electrinics. Just be mindful that you need to word things properly ."
400,Delilah the Dark Elf,MCU -1,"Not everyone agreed with the homicidal views of Malekith and his horde of Dark Elves in regard to the light in the universe. A rare few such as Deliah felt that their time had come and gone, and would resign themselves to seeing what this new state of creation could offer. She's very curious as a result, and it's a good idea not to leave her alone with any technology for more than ten minutes if you don't want it disassembled and in the process of being studied. She's very meticulous at recording anything she finds though, so perhaps it might be good to let her work."
100,Engine-sister,Warhammer 40k - Adeptus Mechanicus,"voluminous red robes cannot hide the curves beneath, to this woman's eternal embarrassment. Friendly and perky in conversation to both man and machine, she is torn between her desire to be closer to the machine and her attachment to humanity. The possibility of a harmonious union between the two has inspired her to follow you. She has all 100, 200, and 400cp enginseer perks. She also has 'subtle bionics' 'artisan' and one pick of 'magos designation.'
"
200,Huragok Ally,Halo,"Something of a surprise and most definitely an attention-grabber, a Huragok is supposed to be one of the members of the Covenant Homogeny and has normally been seen only in their presence. Yet Huragok, also known by those in the UNSC as 'Engineers', are primarily pacifistic and dedicate themselves purely to repairing and working on any technology around them. This particular one seems to have gotten lost and ended up deciding to follow you for the sake of making sure your technology was functioning. Aside from melodic whistling sounds that sound slightly similar to Earth whales, Huragoks communicate using either sign language with their tendrils or through text messaging thanks to their penchant of being biological supercomputers. Huragok are highly prized for being able to fix almost anything they touch, and you should expect a lot of questioning if someone spots you with one.
