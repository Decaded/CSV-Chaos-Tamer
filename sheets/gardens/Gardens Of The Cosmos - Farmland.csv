Setting,Perk/Item,Description,Price
A Brothers Price,Farm,"This charming and well-built Farm is one recently purchased by your or your family, or perhaps your family has been here for some time, and built it brick by brick from the foundations, either way it is solidly built, easily defended and well-considered in terms of the layout between the central farmhouse and the surrounding outbuildings and barn.

The farm is quite large and for its size is unreasonably productive for the place and time, capable of feeding a large family of around 100 with enough left over to sell. The farmland can only harvest mundane crops, and it’s fields can only sustain mundane farm animals, but beyond that the farm is quite adept at taking on improvement and alterations, so long as it remains distinctly a ‘farm’ and not something else.",200
A Will Eternal,Spirit Farm,"What every good sect needs is an area that they can grow and raise the more domestic variety of spiritual fauna and flora. Adventuring to gain rare resources is all well and good, but they also need a stable income of cultivation material. This is your one. A moderately large area of farmland. There is space for farming crops, though do try to look after the soil for the results. There is also grassland for animals, complete with a chicken pen filled with a plethora of spirit tailed chickens which are delicious to eat, helps with your cultivation, and whose feathers can be burned to produce two-colour flames. Renovate this grassland as you wish to take care of different farm animals.",100
All-Star Superman,Kansas Farm,"Just a small town girl...wait, we did that already. It’s a simple, mundane farm. You know, the family kind. Comes with a bunch of livestock and fertile soil for plenty of crops of your own choosing, plus things like a barn and a working tractor.. What are you waiting for? Get to work!",200
Atelier Arland,Herb Garden,"Your own personal herb garden, though you’ll find that plenty of people in Arland seem to have one nearby. Perhaps it’s due to how popular alchemists are in Arland proper, but hey, at least now you can stop asking that neighbouring girl for some herbs. You could always continue to hunt in the various dungeons for herbs – but this will give you a reliable measure to cultivate new herbs, something that won’t be as easy in a dungeon. You may only purchase a single garden, though taking this option multiple times will double its size each time – it starts off the size of a small backyard garden.",50
Atomicrops,A Small Farm,"A large plot of land, at about ten acres. It has a hard rocky ground good only for weeds, with only a few square feet of arable soil in the middle, near a well that always has water. After this jump it can be added to your warehouse, near a town at your beginning location in a jump, or on another property you've bought with CP and you can change its location at the start of each jump.",Free
Battle Through The Heavens,Garden of Deadly Eden,"While going out and collecting resources is a tried and true way to gather medicinal plants, sometimes it is easier to simply farm them. This is a wonderful valley, with conditions necessary to grow just about anything and everything, filled with beautiful plants. If only half of them weren’t deathly poisonous. Poison Masters and Alchemists would love to own one of these. Initially it comes stocked with a vast variety of basic plants. Afterwards, these will need to be planted and grown by someone. This valley is nearly 10 km in size, and will warp space to accommodate any particularly large plants, up to 100 km in size. Post jump, this valley will remain attached to your warehouse.",400
Black Crusade Part 1,Garden of Plagues,"Have you ever found yourself in a situation where you just wanted to give and give until you couldn’t give anymore? Decided that in a galaxy of death and stagnation, you just wanted to do your part and bring joy to a world that so desperately needed the affections of one who didn’t judge? While you’re not alone, you also happen to be in the same boat as others in that you need a place to make your presents. Fret not, for your parlor awaits. A large forest that seems to always be hot and humid, it’s at just the right temperature for plants and wildlife to thrive and grow at an accelerated rate. The soil is rich in nutrients to guarantee bountiful yields, and time seems to flow faster to allow life to spread... and die, and rise anew as all manners of viruses and plagues that achieve symbiosis. Adding more plants or plagues simply lets it take new material in, like giving a plant water to grow. Finally, upon cultivating a plant or pathogen that fills you or anyone who uses this place with love and pride in their work will find a tiny piece of that love empowering their soul and optionally altering their appearance to take on traits of the life around them. All life is connected, and it’s our duty to help it along. You may choose if this is a property or a Warehouse attachment.",200
Changeling The Lost,Fairy Garden,"Any extradimensional space that follows you through jumps now has enough ambient glamour to support the growth of goblin fruits and other plants that grow in the hedge or give you a quick fix when you're in need. This ambient glamour will have no effect on mortals, but leaves changelings feeling giddy. You have to actually transplant the fruits you want, though. If you don't have any spaces that follow you through jumps, you now have a small garden that appears in a safe place.",50
Chocobo Dungeon,The Flower Garden,"It looks more like a farmer’s planting field than a proper garden, but this attachment is largely for folks who want a place to plant seeds and nuts that they might find inside the dungeon. The field remains hydrated, courtesy to rain clouds that pass by in a routine manner, but with this extension we’ll also throw in a fully grown nut tree and a small flower garden. Nuts drop routinely from this tree – though the type of nut which drops varies between the wide varieties of nuts that can be found in the dungeons. The flowers on the other hand can be tossed at enemies, and most of them have effects similar to recovery potions and whatnot.",50
Ciel Nosurge,Kitchen Garden,"Ra Ciela’s inhabitants have developed a very rich food culture. This translates into multiple customs and tendencies. One such manifestation is the Kitchen Garden, a special room present inside most homes that is dedicated to the growing of various kinds of foods, though mainly plants like fruits and vegetables. This living room-sized chamber and its contents are easy to take care off and it will even provide a small yet noticeable boost to the growth speed of any plants placed inside. You now possess such a room, which will either integrate itself as an add-on to your Warehouse or spawn as a small shed-like structure in future worlds.",200
Civilization,Hanging Gardens,"When hung as inside a structure or on some property as a talisman, the Hanging Gardens ensures food you are aware of will never spoil, and that there will always be enough for thirds, even if you only made enough for one serving. When placed as a structure, The Hanging Gardens improves efficiency of harvests and crops, ensuring they are 25% more bountiful and effective.",100
Coiling Dragon Part 1,Cultivators Farm,"You have access to a small but highly fertile farm attached to your warehouse. It is stuffed to the brim with almost every plant imaginable. From the nearly mundane ginseng to the rare and mystical blueheart grass. The common link between all ingredients is they have magical properties which can be used in cultivation. There is at least a sample of almost everything used in magical medicine. Careful experimentation will allow you to make drugs and poisons useful for a cultivator. The farm is fertile enough you won’t even need to pay attention to any plants placed in it for them to grow healthy and strong. Should you use up all of a plant you will receive new samples of it in a decade. This farm may be attached to your warehouse, hidden somewhere known only to you, or attached to another property.",100
Cuphead,Fickle Farm Plot,"“Well I’ll be a monkey’s uncle, look at this dirt! This here is a plot of nutrient rich dirt all set up for gardening and farming whatever you want to plant here. Anything you grow here ends up extra big and health. Potatoes the size of a boss, carrots the size of a grain silo, gourds you could live in! Temperament may vary, so be kind to those greens!”",200
Digimon World Next Order,Meat Field,"The digital world is proud of its long history of excellent meat farms, and with this purchase you too will be able to join in this proud tradition. You’re now the proud owner of a modest field that grows the most precious crop of all; meat. Tenderloins, porkchops, crispy bacon, t-bone steaks, turkey legs and so much more; each perfectly seasoned and piping hot, just begging to be eaten right off the branch. Each day you’ll find a fresh batch large enough to feed a pack of hungry digimon and still have enough left over to sell for a tidy profit; which you can harvest without fear of unwanted pests despite its seductive aroma. Better yet, the fruits of this field are so rich and nutritious that a few servings is enough to satisfy even the most voracious of eaters!",200
Digimon World Re-Digitize,Carnivore Patch,"A modest plot of land to call your own. Perfect for a cozy farmhouse to live in while you wait for your meat harvest. That’s right, MEAT harvest. This patch of land has the peculiar trait that makes plants grow meat instead of fruit; each fresh and delectable enough to be eaten straight from the garden, and filling enough to satisfy even cyborg dinosaurs. The patch refills it’s bounty at the start of each day; providing more than enough meat for up to three meals per guest.",100
Egyptian Mythology,Black Earth,"A house in the Egyptian style, with a walled courtyard, outer communal rooms, and private rooms in the rear, seated in the centre of a large division of farmland with all of the tools and oxen you will need to sow and reap your crops. The bountiful, dark earth provides generous harvests to grow each season, and the canals and wells will not run dry.
These fertile fields are you spiritual homeland, and thus this land may be found when wandering between worlds: if your ba was banished into Duat, it might find this home in the shadowy realm; if your ahk finally arrived in the green fields of Aaru, it would find this home there too, exactly as you left it. When it is found in other realms of existence, it provides something of a safe haven from the natural dangers of those realms; the malevolent spirits of Duat tend to avoid it.",200
Elona,Deed of Farm,"A deed to a small piece of land. When it's read on an unclaimed piece of land, the magic in the deed will cause a small barn and some tilled fields to appear around you. Next to the field is some boxes for making compost in. The etherwind causes plants to grow faster. Comes with a bag of seeds: 3 fruit, 3 vegetable, 3 herb, 3 gem, 3 unknown, 2 magic, and 1 Artifact. A new one appears in your cosmic warehouse in any future jumps, and is only replaced if used or lost.",250
Evo Search For Eden,Primordial Garden,"A largish walled garden added onto your warehouse, accessed through a door in the wall. Aside from a large clearing with a constant stream of crystal clear water and a small lake, there are also fruit bearing trees here that are always full. The conditions here are ideal for life, meaning that any animal or plant placed here will rapidly reach a peak state of health, and any growth they undergo will be optimized. Non-intelligent creatures here will not attack you unless attacked first, and will be much easier to tame. As a final benefit, getting a good night’s rest here washes away any and all stress that someone is suffering from.",300
Farmville,Home Farm,"Each Jumper starts with square-shaped home farm, 140 meters x 140 meters of undeveloped land. You can set up things on it however you want, but keep in mind that you’re limited to that size.",Free
Farmville,Orchard,"Purchase of this gives you orchard in which you can plant up to 20 trees, bushes or vines. For additional 50 CP you can expand holding space of it for additional 20 trees, but unfortunately for max of 40 trees altogether per orchard.",100
Final Fantasy XIV,Aether Garden,"A very pleasant garden, with rows of herbs and flowers already planted, and a network of pools and fountains set up. The individual greenhouses that come along with this can be freely adjusted in terms of the atmosphere inside, to account for the different biomes which your plant samples may require. The Crystal underneath the Garden will ensure that the soil here is fertilized all year round.",50
Fire Emblem -  Tellius,"Grand, Rolling Fields","These sunlit, grassy fields will always be bright and unclouded by rain, and yet any grass or things growing in it will always grow strong. Even if the plants are rare and require exotic or overtly specific conditions like magic leylines or it has to be watered in a certain way, somehow this place will always be perfect to grow those plants in.",600
Fire Emblem Valentia,Farm or Winery,"Zofia is famous for it’s great bounty from the Goddess Mila. Peasant farmers live comfortably here for that reason without even needing to work hard. Now you have a farm that has been blessed by Mila. By default it is a sheep ranch, but you may make it a winery or some other farm or ranch. Here, anything you plant here will grow easily without any special environment, minerals, or water. It also has a steady source of income as people will naturally drift to it and buy things from it.",200
Forerunner Saga,Garden Of Life,"One of the greatest joys of many Lifeworkers is to work with, and study, exotic animals and ecosystems from around the galaxy. Multitudes of planets had their ecosystems tended to by the many lifeworkers of the forerunners, and even the Greater and Lesser Arks were filled with a plethora of wildlife. Some lifeworkers would go out of their way to be invited to the residents of wealthy Forerunners who often would have interesting fauna and flora near their estates. This is your own lifeworker garden. Measuring several hundreds of miles wide enclosed within compressed space, this habitat comes with a massive variety of life from all of the Ecumene. Hidden within camouflaged Forerunner observatories, there lies a cylix containing millions of metal slabs, which each contain the genetic information and suspended body of a specific species. In the very centre of the garden is a lifeworker laboratory where one can experiment with these genes or use them to create entirely new species.",200
Generic Otome Isekai Game,Farm,"A modest plot of land, rented out to nameless followers that endlessly, tirelessly and happily work, is now yours. This plot is guaranteed to be safe no matter where it is located in the world from disasters or wars or deliberate sabotage or similar unpleasantness. It yields the highest quality food, including vegetables, fruit and herbs local to the region and even similar regions further afield as well as any additional plant you introduce to it. For all its modest appearance it never seems to run out of room for new plants so long as you are actively involved or supervising its expansion. With this you will never starve and in time maybe no one ever will should you be a generous sort.",400
Generic Xianxia,Time-Accelerated Spirit Garden,"Inside this room is fifty square acres of sunny, watered, fertile farmland that is tended by helpful nature spirits. The atmosphere in the room is filled with spiritual energy making it conducive to the raising of plantlife, increasing its nutritional value tenfold. Mundane plants grown here that are consumed have a small chance of increasing their spiritual power slightly. While this benefit is almost infinitesimally negligible to cultivators, it is possible that non-cultivators who eat it will become aware of the spiritual energy as it flows into them, allowing them to begin to learn how to cultivate. As long as the door is open and/or if there is a sapient being inside the room, time moves the same inside as it does outside. When closed with nobody inside, however, time in the room moves at a rate of one thousand years inside to one day outside. In short, the plants in here will grow very old, very fast. Rare ingredients that would take thousands of years to mature or millions to grow can now be cultivated within a reasonable timeframe.",600
Genshin Impact,Fruits Of The Forest,"There are many different ingredients and materials in this world that you are unlikely to find in any other. With professions such as alchemy relying on these very things, it would be remiss if you didn’t have access to those items later. As and when you wish, you may enter into this moderately sized space filled with lush plant life and creatures in a variety of environments. In many ways this space would appear similar to that of a pocket realm or domain. Every few days any plants or animals that have been harvested will reappear, though rarer species such as regisvines and the like will take longer. In future worlds, you can add other species to the space by simply bringing them inside.",200
Goblin Slayer,Farmstead,"A little farm of your own. Well, maybe not quite yours entirely. A friendly family works here, one you’ve known since childhood. They care a great deal for you and are always happy to have you around, their presence warming your heart and soothing your soul. The farm, despite the small size, brings in a fair amount of money due to the quality of it’s goods. It’s also very hard to find for any hostile force that might seek to attack it or you and very easy to defend should they manage to come near. There’s a few spare buildings that are well fortified you could use to store your things. And apparently, the young daughter of the head farmer here is quite interested in you too! You can import a property you own to make it part of this farmstead.",400
Greek Myth,Raidable Farm,"A large farm run by completely normal mortals. It is filled with fine olives and great sheep. The land seems to take care of itself only needing seeds to be scattered on the ground to give a bountiful and healthy harvest. The men living here never seem to care or fight back against you if you steal, raid, or otherwise take the food from this land so long as you let them live. You could spread rumors of your prowess and how you terrorize this farm by hurting the farmers or you could just take what you need and leave. The choice is yours.",100
Hamtaro,Sunflower Farm,"This gorgeous farm is surrounded by sunflowers or any one singular type of flower you desire. There’s nothing but flowers for miles. It really is a sight. The farm itself can farm one kind of crop, and it is an old farm in whatever style you wish. By default it is japanese-style and surrounded by rice paddies. Of course, it could be something like a cow farm if you so wish. It feels homey and nice, and anyone could feel happy living here. Can be a warehouse extension if you desire, or somewhere in this world.",400
Honorverse,Celery Patch,"Cluster Stalk. The Great Uniter. Treecatnip. The Leafy Sticks of Awesomeness. Yes, it’s celery! You have a patch of Sphinxian soil perfect for the cultivation of this wonder vegetable, which is so fertile it can be harvested multiple times a week. In addition to the normal deliciousness of celery, the Sphinxian stuff contains minerals necessary for the continued health of Treecats’ telempathic organs, so they quickly become massive fans of the stuff. If you carry some around with you and are willing to give in, it’s a quick and easy way to make friends with any Treecat you meet.",50
I've Been Killing Slimes for 300 Years and Maxed Out My Level ,Witch's Garden,"One of the main avenues of work that witches go down is with the use of herbs. It is using these herbs that a witch will make their brew. Naturally the herbs used by them are generally of a more magical variety. It would be a shame if you were unable to continue this work without access to those herbs. This is a small tilled garden, within which is planted a variety of miscellaneous magical herbs. Each of these plants will provide seeds once harvested, ensuring a renewable source of each.",200
Joseph And The Brothers,The Great Vineyard,"Judah is said to have been ‘red eyed from wine’. He must’ve had quite a lot of wine, if you ask me. Well, now you own the source of all that wine that he consumes, the vineyard of Judah. You will also receive a sufficient amount of laborers to work the vineyard, although they can’t be used for anything else. With this, you can either drink all the wine that you would like, or you can even just start your own wine company! Whatever you please. This will import itself into any future jumps if you like, even with settings that supposedly lack grapes.",200
Kamen Rider Gaim,Go to Hel,"It would appear you have happened across an oddly fertile patch of Helheim. Any seeds you plant here will grow into Helheim plants that produce Lockseeds of the source of the seeds. You could even try crossbreeding the resulting plants to create Lockseeds that grant armaments based on a mix of the two donor plants. While this can get you some very potent Lockseeds, keep in mind it won't necessarily scale directly with the fruits, and something on the level of the Forbidden Fruit would take ages of effort and many unusual fruits to even begin to approach it. After the jump, this patch becomes attached to your Warehouse, giving you a stable Helheim patch free of Invess except any you make.",600
Kingdom Come,Kansas Farm,"A calm farm that cannot be disturbed or found as long as you do not use it as a base, this is a good place for when you just want to relax and live a life of peace. There’s a nearby town that has a farmer’s market on whatever day is the most convenient for you to sell your crops. It’ll be enough to keep your farm afloat if you make a habit of showing up while you’re on the farm. A chill place, and the fields are always overflowing with whatever tools or seeds you want or need. It’s comfy, calm, and is decently sized enough to hold nine people. When you leave, any companions not part of your total eight can stay to tend to its crops.",100
Kulipari,The Amphibilands,"A lush, fertile land with abundant water. Perfect for raising whatever livestock or crops suit your fancy. True, it’s also small enough to cross in two days, but if not used as a Warehouse Attachment, you may import it complete with a Veil that causes any intruders to get turned around and walk right out.",400
MtG - Lorwyn,Murmuring Grove,"Treefolk are sometimes said to value the life of a tree more than that of skinfolk, which may have something to do with the fact that almost any tree could awaken as a new treefolk if it was ready to go through the Rising. Accordingly, they protect their groves fiercely. A duty that now falls to you as well, as you have gained ownership of a small grove of the Rising, a protected birthplace of treefolk filled with trees of your choice, whether they be one particular species of tree or a collection of all Lorwyn’s species like a parliament of trees. Trees planted here grow at an astounding rate, to the point that poplar saplings might shoot up to grow nine feet tall in less than a handful of days, and they seem to Rise more often than the trees in other groves do, even if left unattended. But it is the older trees who truly give this grove a special character, for the trees here speak and remember much. They might not be treefolk, having not undergone the rising themselves, but are still aware enough to speak amongst themselves and share their wisdom. Treefolk and druids can empathically understand them as though they were speaking, and if people of other tribes stay perfectly still, they may be able to hear the trees gossiping among one another as well.",400
Neverland - A Fantasy Role-Playing Setting,Fae Farm,"A copy of one of the many farmlands found in Elphame, complete with enchanted crops and livestock. Your farm includes but is not limited to: cabbage (which either turns you into a donkey or turns you back to normal), hungry grass (cursed wheat that triggers mad, endless hunger if one walks through before it’s cut), witch herbs (only grown in the dark for dark mystic powers), fairy cattle, and the Arkan Sonney (a nigh-uncatchable white pig that brings good luck to whoever manages to catch it).",400
NieR,Homely Garden,"A fairly large plot of land that was designed to be the perfect garden, now attached to either your warehouse or a property you own. This garden has several special properties, particularly useful for growing some of the supernatural plants found in this world. First, plant seeds put into the garden will grow faster and more plentiful. Things that would have taken years to sprout now do so in just hours and planting a single seed will result in an entire line of the garden being filled with that seed, giving you a dozen times as many plants from a single seed. You are also able to use the garden to hybridise plants together by planting two seeds in a single location, creating a plant that will share the properties of both component plants and can even be combined further by planting the seed of that plant with another seed.",600
October Daye,Farms,"There are many plants that grew in the deeper fae realms that can with care be coaxed to grow elsewhere and animals that depend on those environments or plants. This farm makes plants grow as well as they would in the fae lands they are native to (any fae, in case you have a pile of mallorn seeds). It can do the same for animals, if you give the right grazing or prey. The first purchase gets you farmland three miles on a side; subsequent purchases give you an extra mile per side (9mi², 25mi², 49mi², etc). The fae care not for your metric units. For 200cp more, your farm can emulate any environmental needs, not just fae.",100
Ori and the Blind Forest,Hermit’s Orchard,"Other matters came to eclipse the passage of time, and it soon seemed an eternity that the valleys lay barren. In truth, it has only been years, though such mistakes might be forgiven in the face of decay’s unceasing spread. Hidden between two cliffs, this is a small grotto which has miraculously escaped the worst ills affecting Nibel. Creatures who eat the fruit on these trees can grow fit even should they eat nothing else. Additionally, anything planted in this little slice of paradise will grow strong, healthy, and bountifully regardless of local conditions such as aridity and pollution. Likewise, forest fires and vandals will tend to steer clear of the area unless you lead them here, though more deliberate attempts to destroy this sanctuary will see it burn as normal.",200
Otome Game no Hametsu Flag shika nai Akuyaku Reijou ni Tensei shite shimatta...,My Secret Eden,"A large piece of land that is the perfect ground for planting any kinds of crops or vegetables. Crops cultivated in this pot of land always grow healthy and are extremely resistant to weather damage or plagues, so you can ease your worries on that front. Plus they always seem to taste at least a little better than they otherwise would, and even more so if you are the one who personally cultivated them. While this garden follows you to any jump and can be attached to any property that you own, you will also find that any place that you stay for a long time has a similar field for you to keep your new hobby. Their owners are always happy to let you lend a hand and share some good ol’ fashioned farming fun, as well as letting you take a share of the products.",200
Otoyomegatari (Bride Stories),Farmland,"A few acres of level, fertile land with a plentiful water well, on which to sow crops or keep some livestock, but you could equally build a home on it or anything else that takes your fancy. After this jump it inserts itself somewhere appropriate in the new world.",400
Ox Tales,Farm,"A decent, 400 acre farm complete with fields for crops and grazing and a variety of sapient livestock (chickens, horses, cows, pigs, sheep, etc.). Any animals that live within 50 feet of the farm will also gradually become sapient; you can shut off/toggle with the sapient effect if you wish.",200
Peter Pan,Never Tree,"You now own your own Never Tree, just like the one in and above the Home Under the Ground. Multiple, seemingly normal trees appear on the surface, but they are in fact the “branches” of the tree. Each branch will continue to grow like a normal tree, but the inside of the branch is in fact hollow. In fact, if you measure a certain individual, you can make one of the trunk-branches’ hollow interior just the right size for that person to slip through (any bigger, though, and you’d get stuck). Slip into one of the tree hollows, and you will end up in an underground hideout that encompasses the trunk and the roots. The roots are exceptionally hardy, and can thrive in any location. The roots grow systematically throughout the day, and regenerate all damage. Therefore, you can cut off a table in the morning, slap it on the regrown roots at noon for lunch, and then saw it up again to make room for playing. In any case, you’ll never be low on firewood. Giant mushrooms also grow inside for handy seats and occasional seasoning. If you took Moter Knows Best, you can refurbish and expand the interior “home underground” as you wish. After the jump, it will grow in your warehouse, and you can plant cuttings in future jumps.",500
Peter Pan,Fairy Dress,"A lovely outfit made from various plants that is designed by the finest of fairy clothiers to reflect your personality and abilities as a fairy. Neverland flora never truly dying even when plucked, the clothes remain completely fresh, and will regrow if damaged.",50
Plants vs Zombies,Zen Garden,"This is a Zen Garden, or an Indoors garden, in different terms. You can place cuttings of any plants in here, and be assured of it achieving maximum growth! They don’t need water or food or anything to survive, not really. While they cannot grow without fertilizer and regular dosages of water, they can survive indefinitely even if you never look at them again. But you should feed them and water them all the same, because they pay you for  it! You get steadily increasing amounts from them as they grow, in proportion to how rare or valuable the plant is. But once full grown even the most common plants give you the equivalent of $1000 every time you water them, and the same for every insecticide spray, bag of fertilizer or few minutes of music. The plants will let you know when they want any of these, you don’t get a continuous flow if you keep it running.",300
Prince Of Persia,Fertile Ground,"Once per jump,you will receive a seed that can be planted to sprout a beautiful garden suited to any environment able to support life. So long as the garden remains healthy it will produce a great deal of magical energy, and unless intentionally destroyed the garden will take care of itself. It is simplicity itself to direct the magic produced towards whatever task you desire, but if left unharnessed the energy will condense in the seeds, fruits, and other products of the plants within the garden. You may plant a seed within a property that follows you between jumps.",200
Slime Rancher,Starter Ranch,"So here we have the basics of what you need to ranch slimes. A simple dome shaped house with basic living utilities and a single slime pen with several plots that can be used as a base for farming, slime pens, or other constructions. The size of your land is a simple 100 acres and appears aesthetically based on your starting location. Regardless of your stating location your land is perfectly fertile for farming all kinds of crops. Post-jump you can select to take your farm with you, either following you jump to jump or as a warehouse attachment. If taken as a warehouse attachment it can only be used for slime ranching purposes and not general storage and is simply a piece of land surrounded by a faux slime sea that cannot be swam in or used for any purpose.",200
Space Pirate Captain Harlock,Offworld Garden,"You now have a small farm for growing fresh vegetables located on the nearest planetoid that is not a satellite of the planet on which you are currently located. Here, this will be on Mars, protected by robots, and with the produce being grown and shipped back to you fresh by robots. You now effectively have an infinite supply of about five kinds of vegetable, all engineered to stay fresh in the void of space until they can reach you.",300
Spirit Island,Plantation,"Or you could just actually have land, growing highly profitable crops, acres and acres of it. Also serves as a convenient base of operations for whatever you’re up to.",400
Squirrel And Hedgehog,Garden Bed,"Be more in touch with nature with this wonderful garden bed! Seeds you plant here will require less water than usual, and will always yield plentiful vegetables and fruit.

It'll even work on other kinds of plants.",300
Starcraft Terran (Lone Valkyrie Edition),Bio-Dome,"A bio-dome is a Terran structure that they use for ecological projects such as in small-scale terraforming or studies relating to plants. There are a wide variety of possible configurations each bio-dome can take. One of these configurations is similar in nature to that of a command center. Bio-domes were used most notably on the colony planet of Haven. Models included forest biomes, water biomes, and air biomes. Each Bio-dome is large enough to comfortably fit a fully grown tree, and comes with glass walls that have metal shutters. You have received three of your own bio-domes, that you can set up and configure as you wish.",100
Stardew Valley,The Farm,"This is what most people think of when they dream of ideal farmland. The soil is rich and terrain as flat as a lake with no breeze. There is plenty of room for large plots of crops as well as fields for open grazing of all kinds of livestock. A pair of small lakes are the only interruption to otherwise perfect farmland. The greenhouse will need to be repaired, but the house itself is sound enough. Small, but sound. A comfortable bed and older television are included as well. A small cave set in the rocks would be a fine place to grow some mushrooms.",Free
Stardew Valley,Riverland Farm,"This farm is situated in the flooded lowlands of Stardew Valley. Bridges and piers connect each of the nine islands, but even so farming space is at a premium. Maintaining crops and livestock will be all but impossible. Still, it is a perfect farm for those who enjoy fishing and the bounty of nature’s rivers. Surprisingly the waters of this farm contain fish from all over the valley. Even ocean fish from time to time when the tides are right. The house is in surprisingly good shape considering the amount of moisture in the air, but the greenhouse has fallen into disrepair. There is also a cave frequented by a startlingly wide variety of birds. It would be an excellent place to gather wild eggs if one has the bravery to weather the pecking beaks and screeching calls.",Free
Stardew Valley,Forest Farm,"This farm can be found situated in the grove of the deep woods, hemmed in on all sides by ancient trees. There are certain laws in place about disturbing them so don’t get any ideas about wildly expanding your plot. Four ponds of various sizes take up a sizable portion of the usable farmland. Choosing between livestock and crops is less of an issue here, but doing both will leave little room for anything else. But the forest provides some of its own bounty to make up for these limitations. Wild berries grow in abundance on the many bushes found here during the correct seasons. And there always seems to be stumps to harvest for the hardwood people so crave as perfect building material. There is also a cave set in the northern bluff that is home to a family of docile fruit bats. They travel far and wide and often bring back more than they can hope to eat. The house itself is in excellent shape, though moss seems to have grown up the rear of it, and nature has reclaimed the greenhouse entirely. Still, it is an excellent plot for those who enjoy the tranquility of the forest and foraging for what it has to offer.",Free
Stardew Valley,Hilltop Farm,"This rocky and rugged piece of land is set up in the mountains that surround Stardew Valley to the north. As if the landscape didn’t make farmland scarce enough a wide creek runs through the entire plot, neatly bisecting it. So while one will almost certainly have to choose between crops and livestock here this plot is not without its perks. The rocks of these hills are rich with deposits of coal, precious metals, gemstones of all varieties, and rare artifacts from ages past. There are even rumors of gold and garnets being found in small quantities in the riverbed. Those who enjoy mining and prospecting will never find themselves bored here. The house itself could use airing out and a good mopping but is solid enough. The greenhouse, however, looks as if the local kids have been throwing rocks at it for two generations and will have to be rebuilt from the ground up. Strangely, the plot is only home to a single cave, but oh how it glitters with possible riches.",Free
Stardew Valley,Wilderness Farm,"This farm can be found sandwiched between the large river feeding into the ocean and the cliffs marking the edge of the mountains. A large lake sits in the middle of the property as well, fed by a spring that now only trickles out water. It is neither the largest nor the smallest of the available farmlands. There is room enough for some animals and crops if one is creative with their placement. However, this farmland was once cursed by the witch who lives in this area. Each night the plot is beset by golems made out of straw! They are at least silent creations and don’t seem interested in bothering livestock, crops, or battering their way into buildings. They’ll harass any people they find outside at night though. They are a challenging foe, but hardly insurmountable. Additionally, past farmers reported their chickens occasionally laying black eggs with red spots that tasted absolutely horrible. Strange. The cave is utterly barren and holds neither useful materials or anything of interest. The house itself is very sturdy, just in case the straw golems get any ideas. And the greenhouse appears as if it was blasted apart, but can be rebuilt.",Free
Stardew Valley,Bastion of the Nature Spirits,"This plot is certainly different from all the rest. A simple glance at the profusion of flowers and colorfully leaved trees is enough to see something strange is going on here. The rocky ground doesn’t hamper both crops and livestock sharing the same land, though they will likely have to be placed on opposite sides of the small river running through the plot. It is fed by a spring that bubbles up from under the rocks and flows fairly fast. Farmers who choose to take up caring for this plot of land will discover a grouping of Nature Spirits have taken shelter in the small cave. They are a wary bunch, but if one follows the old traditions or is kind to them, they will prove to be quite able helpers. Slow and a little erratic with their choice of duties, but useful  nonetheless. They will water crops, milk animals, and even repair fences, but only as they desire. They willsometimes leave jobs half done or only shear one animal out of six. It’s hard to predict the whims of such creatures. Still, they have kept the house not only sound, but beautifully decorated inside and out. However, glass is beyond their skill and the greenhouse is going to need your help if it is to function again. This house is best suited to those with a little of the magical talent themselves or someone interested in such things.",Free
Stardew Valley,Four Corners Farm,"This farm can be found directly east of town, just a short walk past the town’s library. It’s unusual configuration should rightly confuse anyone with an understanding of agriculture. It was designed and cultivated as an experiment in cooperative farming before the idea was abandoned some time ago. The upper left quadrant was seeded with wild plants and trees from the deep forest, allowing for hardwood and seeds of all kinds to be found there in abundance. The lower left was dedicated to experiments in fish populations, so an unusually large variety of lake fish can be found in its depths. The lower right quadrant was carved directly out of the hills and consequently has unusually rocky soil. Minerals of all kinds can be found there. Only the upper right quadrant was left alone, perhaps as a baseline, and grows the traditional crops of the region quite well. The cave is larger than most but is currently empty. It would make an excellent storehouse if nothing else.",Free
Stardew Valley,Beach Farm,"Just off to the west of the beach of Stardew Valley lies a tiny, sandy peninsula that was once a retirement home for a sea captain. His love of fishing clearly influenced his choice in location as this farm is rather poorly situated for much else. It has very little land suited for traditional farming. While it is possible to plant crops in the sandy soil of the beach, doing so would take careful planning and ever more careful tending. Especially since it is ill-suited to traditional sprinkler systems. Overwatering can lead to fatal levels of salt leaching into whatever is planted there. Still, for those who wish for a scenic view, sand between their toes, salt air in their lungs, and the sound of surf in their ears, there is no better place in the whole valley than here.  Sharp eyed residents would do well to keep their eyes on the shoreline. The unusual currents of the area have ahabit of dragging all kinds of crates up from the depths and across huge distances to its shore. One never knows what they will find inside. The cave on this farm floods with each high tide, leaving behind tidal pools teaming with small fish, chunks of coral, and even sea urchins.",Free
The Elder Scrolls V - Skyrim,Seeking Your Roots,"At first glance appearing to be a humble farm plot, this is really the result of a master alchemist’s life’s achievement. You’ve inherited the results. The soil here is specially treated. The fields manage perfectly well unattended, only requiring some replanting of seeds after a harvest. This property will makes you one of the only people able to cultivate a certain rare root: Nirnroot. Giving a soft glow and telltale hum the plant is a unique sight for many. Along with the field itself is copious research notes for fantastic formula using the plant that are well beyond what can normally be achieved with alchemy. If the noise and light from this farm would bother you the field can be used to cultivate two other options instead. There’s equally rare Jarrin Root which needs no alchemy to be exceptionally deadly. Or, there’s Canis Root, which is a natural repellant for werebears and makes an excellent tea.",200
The Great Ruler Part 2,Divine Beast Haven,"What is trash to some is a treasure for others. Take this Divine Beast Haven for example. This is the location where two as-of-yet unspecified supreme divine beasts fell. This event has led to the formation of odd pools containing incredibly pure beast essence. Should a human absorb these pools, they will be able to gain a physique similar to that of one of the divine beasts that fell. A phoenix physique would exhibit great speed, a dragon physique would show strength, a tortoise would have a sturdy defense, and so on. However, as mentioned, this area is of little use to Divine Beasts, the effect barely being noteworthy for those who already possess the body of a beast. Hidden deep in this mountainous region is a strange fruit growing from the skulls of the two beasts. Consuming this fruit will allow you to gain the most perfect complete physique, potentially even a blend of both of them if you are lucky. Every ten years this Haven will open, allowing people to compete for the pools hidden within.",200
The Legend Of Zelda - A Link To The Past,Apple Orchard,"When all was said and done, two versions of Link chose to leave the land of Hyrule in an attempt to protect the Triforce from any more would be thieves. The other two stayed with Princess Zelda, and of those two only one remained a knight. The other one went back to the life he had before hearing her voice in his head, that of an apple farmer. You now have a small plot of land containing a small home fit for two, and of course a decently sized orchard of apples. Said trees will grow into delicious fruits will the bare minimum of care, and if you take great pains to give them the best you can give, they will occasionally pop out an enchanted apple, capable of healing any injury short of death. If you took ‘The Fruit of One’s Labor’, you can change this from apples to whatever you chose previously.",200
The Legend Of Zelda - Skyward Sword,Pumpkin Harvest,"For a flying island, you’d think that the place would eventually become barren. Crops pull nutrients out of the ground, and with skyloft disconnected from the rest of the world, they would have no way to draw in more. Maybe they’re amazing at fertilization, maybe it’s magic. They do have a waterfall that is still falling after two thousand years after all. Anyways, you now have a decently sized patch of ground that seems to grow pumpkins at an absolutely astounding rate. Simply throw down a handful of seeds and by the end of the week your garden will be full to bursting with pumpkins - more than enough to feed a dozen people for the week it took to grow them. Sadly, this place can only grow pumpkins. Don’t ask me why, I guess they’re Hylia’s favorite fruit or something?",100
Three Star Gauntlet,The Garden,"This is 4 acres of premium farmland that will perfectly support whatever food crops you wish to grow there. All four acres have the same microclimate, but each can be subdivided into up to 16 equal-sized blocks where custom trace nutrients or flavorants can be imbedded in the soil per planting with a handy command console that comes included. Anything that’s not farming related (fences, farm equipment, livestock, etc.) that you leave out there will be stolen by rabbits. It is attached to your warehouse after the jump and as close to your restaurant as local zoning allows during the jump. Each additional Gardener among your companions counts as one ‘More Land!’ rather than each getting their own Garden. ",200
Tremors,Ranch,"A large farm/ranch that raises animals and crops of your choice. I recommend a suitably hardy selection given the sort of environment it’s likely to be placed in here. Running the place is a full time job, but everything will be just fine when you come back after being chased away by graboids or distracted by something time-consuming and you don’t have anyone to look after it. Replaces lost animals and plants monthly after inevitably being destroyed.",400
Über,Farm,"A small plot of land and a plain house, out of the way of the real conflict. Surviving off the land will be something of a struggle but unless you bring trouble here yourself it will pass you by without posing a threat to your life. May become a warehouse attachment or be imported on a Jump-by-Jump basis after finishing this Jump.",200
Warhammer Fantasy - Amazons,Secret Garden,"Most Amazons have a garden of t their own, given they are all trained in at least a basic knowledge of how to grow and use the plants of the jungle for varying purposes. Your garden is both particularly large and filled with all manner of strange, deadly and wonderful plans and bugs. It encourages growth greatly in plants and seems to be able to support plants from any normal environment regardless of where the garden actually is, though unique or supernatural environmental plants won’t find themselves helped here. The garden retains changes to it, including carrying plants over to future worlds that you have placed in it, and will attach to either a property you own or be in an isolated location.",100
Warhammer Fantasy - Halflings Of The Moot,The Family Farm,"Farmlands are the staple to The Moot and to halfling ways of life. Entire bloodlines are dedicated to caring for and working the land belonging to their forebears, ensuring that in return the land cares for them with its bounty. A lesson that has been drilled into you in turn, even as your old man left the farm to you in his will.

All four-hundred-and-forty-four acres of your family farmland has been left to you. Every single inch of it has been well-maintained over the years, the soil almost preternaturally easy to till and plow by the efforts of you and your farmhands. Some traces of the Wind of Life have permanently seeped into the land as well; Not only does its bounty grow half-again as large as it would have normally, but the land seems to resist the taint of dark magic such as the necromantic energies of Sylvania, or the twisted touches of Chaos.

Additionally, there is a small-but-comfortable farmhouse on the property, along with a couple sheds full of farming equipment and a barn for any working beasts you may need.",400
Warhammer Fantasy - Wood Elves,Garden of Hope,"The Treefolk either cannot replenish their numbers, or cannot do so at rates meaningful enough to arrest the depletion of their ancients. With each Elder that falls, the other Elders of their kind absorb his strength and perhaps lesser spirits return to the forest entirely. And yet, with your investment here a miracle is realised. This enchanted field of foliage is no larger than an Imperial nobleman’s garden, but legend has it that it was torn from Isha’s very own garden long ago-for within, a spell of divine power can turn the seeds of trees into Treemen. The natural magics grounded here are powerful in a way that rivals the Isle of Rebirth in distant Ulthuan and could conceivably be harnessed by a skilled mage, but the process of rebirth takes time; left alone, it would normally take almost a decade for young Treemen to grow and arise-assuming the tree matures like those of this world anyway, considering a healthy tree is required for the nascent spirit to inhabit it. But aha, this pot of land isn’t alone is it? For one skilled in the Lore of Life as even a regular Treeman or a powerful Spellsinger, the natural energies here can be carefully invigorated to shorten the growth of Treemen to weeks. And at a stretch with other truly powerful fonts of life magic such as the Acorns of Ages-or much more adroitly, with power commensurate to the Mage Queen herself-dozens of Treemen can be awoken from here in moments. It cannot be stressed enough that such a natural bounty is an unimaginable source of hope for Athel Loren, and the story behind its creation the stuff of legends.",600
White Knight Chronicles,Farm Land,"Farm Land is as the name on the tin says, land specifically fenced off from the rest of the town for Farmers to use. It comes in three types ""Tilled Land"", ""Grazing Land"" and ""Fungus Farm"" that correspond to the Specialties of Farmers.

""Tilled Land"" has been picked clean of grass or weeds and worked extensively to allow crops of some kind to be planted, ultimately granting a bonus to Cultivated Flora for each Farmer Resident you have.

""Grazing Land"" is more tightly fenced in and has plentiful grass and small bugs for animals with various diets to feed on, and a small pen for livestock to sleep in. It grants a bonus to Livestock for each Farmer Resident you have.

""Fungus Farm"" is a structure built underground that's dark, damp and comes pre-stocked with wooden crates and shelves, ideal conditions to grow mushrooms. Fungus Farm grants a bonus to Fungus for each Farmer Resident you have.

""Low Quality"" Farm Land costs 50JP and is rather small, notable as something more for personal use than supplying for many. It grants a +1 to the relevant Job Specialty for each Farmer Resident you have.

""Medium Quality"" Farm Land costs 100JP and is both larger and higher quality, with healthier soil, damper condition or what have you. It's big enough to actually start providing for more than the Farmer's family. It gives a bonus of +2 to the relevant Specialty.

""High Quality"" Farm Land costs 200JP and is even larger and higher quality, enough so to truly be called a farm and coming with a large building for storing crops or keeping livestock safe (such as a barn). It grants +3 to the relevant Specialty for each Farmer Resident you have.",50/100/200
World Of Cultivation,Great Ling Field,"500 acres of high grade farmland suitable for planting ling crops in will attach themselves to your warehouse, this pocket farm is greatly beneficial to all plants you grow there allowing them to grow quickly without risk of pests.
