0CP,Powers,Chronicle,"What would you do if you had the power to do whatever you want, Jumper? No matter what 
your answer to that question is, you’ll be able to prove it to the world soon enough. Through 
strange means, you have gained the potential to do great things, though you might not notice it 
for the first few weeks. But after some time, you will come to realize the existence of what might 
be described as a new sort of muscle. One that allows you to use a power commonly called 
telekinesis in fiction. After you first begin to use it, even moving a baseball around for a few 
seconds will be too much overexertion, the strain making your nose bleed. But like any other 
muscle, this one can be trained as well. Throughout the course of a few weeks, if you trained 
regularly, your power would grow by leaps and bounds, allowing you to easily move around 
cars, fly, or create a protective forcefield around yourself. And just a mere month after that, you 
would be able to throw around buses like they weighted nothing, easily fly through skyscrapers 
without harm, and create telekinetic pulses and vibrations to push away dozens of cars or 
threaten the structural integrity of multiple high-rises. If you kept at it, who knows how much 
stronger you could become.  

If you want to, you may instead gain these powers from a strange crystal, far down a hole in a 
Seattle forest, perhaps alongside a few others, some teenagers or your companions. That will 

cause you to develop what could be called a psychic connection: should one of you experience 
an extreme emotion such as anger or fear, your nose will start bleeding heavily as if you had 
overused your powers, and you will even start to vaguely hear voices and sounds around them. "
0CP,Airburst,My Hero Academia,"The user is able to compress small quantities of air into marbles and
project them. The marbles rupture on contact with something, popping with the force of a
large balloon.
The marbles even sound like popping balloons, leaving them a startling, attention
grabbing distraction but ultimately harmless. The user must hold their breath while
collecting and throwing these marbles of air, requiring strong lungs."
0CP,Anesthetic,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user is able to temporarily numb a portion of themselves or
another living creature by poking them with their fingers.
This poke feels like a minor prick, and causes a small area around the point of
contact to lose sensation for a period of ten to twenty minutes. Target is not inhibited in any
way otherwise. There is a small cooldown between each activation of this Quirk."
0CP,Badger,My Hero Academia,"This Quirk grants the power to lengthen and harden the user’s nails a bit
on command. This can be helpful with peeling tags, clawing people, poking through plastic,
scratching a particular itch and so on. Comes at the expense of the effects not being very
potent."
0CP,Barbs,My Hero Academia,"The user is able to cause small thorns to sprout from inanimate objects
they touch, around an inch in length each. They can cause barbs to appear up to half a yard
from their touch.
The thorns take on the hardness of the material they’re made of, meaning some
might be more dangerous than others, but not the toughness, as they’re persistently brittle.
This means thorns made of things that would ordinarily bend or dent like rubber or
iron will instead crack and crumble when enough force is applied."
0CP,Bendy Fingers,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user has a heightened range of movement within their
fingers, allowing them to bend backwards and side to side as easily as normal fingers could
be curled forward. This heightened flexibility and dexterity is exclusively in the fingers."
0CP,Big Horn,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk has a large pair of horns of whatever shape and
size they desire. The horns are incredibly strong, needing industrial equipment to break.
The user’s skull and spine are also strengthened, which in combination with the
horns allows the user to charge, batter and slam their horns and heads into enemies with
less personal risk of harm.
The horns due to their size can often get in the way. Horns heal over time if severed
unlike other body parts, but do so somewhat slowly."
0CP,Blade Arms,My Hero Academia,"The user, as you guessed it, has the ability to sprout short metal
blades from their arms. The metal blades have about the same general sharpness and
strength as a normal knife.
The user’s primary limitation is the fact that they can only sprout the blades from
the backs of their arms and they’re rather short, making them a bit awkward to use."
0CP,Booze Hound,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is acutely aware of alcohol in their area,
being able to detect general location, strength and amount fairly easily.
Someone with this Quirk would be able to easily make out the blood alcohol content
of someone if they have doubts of their sobriety, or hidden wine or booze when
interrogating.
The strength of the Quirk is such that someone soaked with alcohol could be reliably
tracked as well. The user of this quirk can start getting tipsy if the sense is left active too long."
0CP,Brail,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user has a heightened sense of touch that has a complex
interaction with the language processing sections of the brain. Through this, the Quirk user
is able to read from physical mediums of writing such as magazines or books by simply laying
their hand on the cover.
The Quirk user must know the language they’re attempting to read. Doesn’t work
with text not recorded in a physical medium, such as that on a computer screen. Only a few
times faster than reading it through ordinary means."
0CP,Censor!,My Hero Academia,"As opposed to most Sensory Quirks, “Censor!"" allows the Quirk user to
deprive themselves. The Quirk user has the capacity to blur or censor things within their
perception.
Erasing the sight of something within vision as if covering it with marker, dulling
scents as if stuffing your nose, distorting sounds as if throwing them through a filter and
more.
As this only allows the Quirk user to ignore things, it is usually more of a tool of
convenience rather than true utility. You are only able to censor things within your
perception, not the perception of others."
0CP,Coating,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to smooth over whatever they touch, giving
it a slippery, shiny surface as if given a wax polish. This can be used to reduce traction and
cause accidents.
The user of this perk needs to be able to press and wipe their hand across something
to smooth it, needing it to already be solid and firm. Damage to an object’s surface reverts
the effects."
0CP,Confetti,My Hero Academia,"This Quirk bestows the ability to manipulate pieces of paper after the
Quirk user has come into contact with them. Their control is such that they can manipulate
many pieces over a wide area, making folds and cuts as desired to shape and split it up.
Confetti is unable to manipulate any one piece weighing more than a standard piece
of notebook paper however, such as a magazine or a poster. The Quirk user loses the ability
to manipulate paper that’s been wet too much, the paper’s integrity failing and weight
becoming too great."
0CP,Curveball,My Hero Academia,"This Quirk allows the user to apply a delayed rotation to small objects,
designating the direction at that time. This rotation activates the moment the object begins
to move at any significant speeds, and will scale in speed with the speed of the object.
The Quirk may be activated and applied through one degree of separation, such as
through striking something with a club or bat. The effects of this Quirk end once the object
affected comes to a stop, after initial activation."
0CP,Four Arms,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk has four arms, obviously. These arms are all
exactly the same in strength, length and so on. The user can obviously hold more things or
punch with more limbs.
The user of this Quirk will still have a preferred side like normal people making them
more handy with their right or left side. The extra arms may make tight corridors a problem."
0CP,Graffiti,My Hero Academia,"The user is able to change the color of whatever they touch to any color
in the rainbow and spread that color as they please from the point of contact up to a meter.
Despite the colors of the material actually changing, the effects can be removed as if
it was wet paint with moisture and a little pressure such as water, sweat and skin oils. No
residue remains."
0CP,Green Thumbs,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk can transform their thumbs into long,
prehensile vines with leaves growing off of them and full sensations.
This can be used to grab or thwap thing near the user, as well as having a limited
capacity to soak nutrients out of soil, water and light, though certainly not enough to live.
The vines aren’t quite as durable as a human thumb, and if cut or damaged severely,
the user will experience intense pain. They have a length limit of five meters."
0CP,Gyrate,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user has the ability to rotate their body parts independently of
one another at potentially high speeds. The Quirk user can get hurt due to their otherwise
normal body attempting to rotate when stuck, or colliding with hard objects.
This Quirk treat clothing over rotating body parts as an extension of the body part.
The Quirk user may become dizzy if they spin their head or eyes, having no resistance to this."
0CP,Hammerhead,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk has small, vertical lines going across their
face and nose allowing them to sense electricity within a couple meters in front of them,
double that in water.
This allows the user to search for hidden lifeforms or electronics that would be
otherwise hidden from sight, smell or sound. The relatively short range limits its
effectiveness unless the user already has a general idea of what they’re looking for though."
0CP,Hardening,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to harden any part of their body. This
protects them against not only physical force, but also heat and shock.
Such protection is minimal to start, but as with most Quirks can be trained up
tremendously. Hardening effects can be worn down with repeated abuse."
0CP,Hay Fever,My Hero Academia,"The user is able to produce a pollen-like powder from their body,
blowing it away into the surrounding area and triggering allergy-like symptoms in whoever
breaths it in.
This can excess mucus production, watery eyes, inflamed sinuses, itchy skin and
similar affects. The user of this Quirk is not immune to its effects, requiring protection."
0CP,Headlights,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to collect and manipulate photons inside
their eyes and then use them to shine beams of light later on, like personal flashlights or
headlights.
The user of this Quirk is able to concentrate or widen the rays of light, which allows
them to potential beam lasers into someone’s eyes to temporarily blind them.
The user is heavily limited due to needing to recharge regularly and being unable to
see out of an eye when they’re using their powers, necessitating the need to use only one
eye at a time if they wish to use it to light their way."
0CP,Hedgehog,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user is born with large metal spikes growing from their back
which become larger with age. The spikes will fall out if the Quirk user becomes too cold,
and will not grow back. They’re ordinarily about as hard as iron."
0CP,Ice Cube,My Hero Academia,"This Quirk allows the Quirk user to produce perfectly chilled ice cubes
by shaking a closed fist, causing them to fall out of their fist. Crushed ice and dry ice are
options.
Ice Cube uses body moisture as a resource to generate ice. Several average coolers
could be filled before the quirk user starts getting thirsty."
0CP,Interject,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user has the ability to disrupt a target’s chain of thought by
interrupting them as they speak. This causes them to completely lose track of whatever they
were talking about, allowing the user to stop speeches or arguments in their tracks. No long
term memory effects."
0CP,Leaf Manipulation,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk has to power to project leaves from
their surroundings as small, sharp blades at a target. Able to shoot many at once with
relative ease.
They have no real control over the leaves beyond shooting them, and their lack of
real mass doesn’t make them very dangerous for the most part. No ability to generate leaves
or very difficult to project heavily damaged leaves."
0CP,Lighter,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to able to produce flames over their thumbs
by snapping, using the air in their lungs as fuel.
Using this Quirk allows one to either sustain a small flame for a bit by parceling out
their breath, or blow it all away in a small fireball that leaves themselves breathless. Limited
by lung capacity."
0CP,Little Pompeii,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user has the ability to produce and control ashes from
their finger tips. Little Pompeii seems to provide an immunity, or strong resistance, to
degenerative side effects of smoking. Fingertips glow orange while active.
Ashes are hot to the touch, but lack so much mass and are hard enough to produce
that not much can be done with them other than ignite already highly flammable materials."
0CP,Love,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user is able to directly enhance the strength, speed and resilience
of a single individual by declaring their love for them. The potency of the enhancement
scales directly with the amount of love felt towards the target, having no effect on strangers
or those disliked by the user.
The Quirk may only be used once every 24 hours. The target must be within range to
hear the Quirk user’s declaration. The enhancement is temporary, lasting a moderate length
of time before wearing off."
0CP,Love Lucky,My Hero Academia,"This Quirk automatically cross compares all known traits, features
and knowledge collected on two individuals that is present within the user’s mind, even if
‘forgotten’, and measures compatibility based on such information.
The Quirk is used by observing the two people in mind and activating it. After a
moment, the user’s vision will tint a certain color to indicate the general level of
compatibility. White tinted vision indicates the highest possible compatibility while black is
the lowest. (Other colors are up to you.)
The Quirk is only as good as how well the user knows the two targets. The
information on how compatible they are as individuals has no inherent benefit, but can be
used to partner potential friends together for teamwork purposes or play matchmaker."
0CP,Mochi Press,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk possesses a long, thin tail ending in a
cylindrical club that they can use like a mallet to mash things into a sticky, soft solid.
This Quirk is able to mash liquids, completely dry powders, grains and any solid soft
enough to pound and mash into the same dough-like texture after beating it enough.
This Quirk is heavily limited by the tail’s own durability, leaving the user unable to
affect anything too hard without damaging their tail. Repeated use can leave tail muscles
sore."
0CP,Mustard,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk has small antennae that give them an acute sense
of gravity, allowing them to always tell up from down even while disoriented.
This inherently gives better coordination as the user is able to twist and flip while
always knowing up from down. It also gives a general sense of day and night by sensing the
moon’s pull.
The user of this Quirk gains no inherent additional agility to better make use of their
Quirk, needing to become better at it themselves."
0CP,Negative,My Hero Academia,"With a touch, allows the Quirk user to flip an object or person’s color
palette as if to turn it into a photo negative. Persons affected by this Quirk also view the
world this way, seeing light as dark and dark as light, highlighting objects normally hidden in
the scenery.
This can usually be more of a negative than a boon. Only lasts several minutes at a
time. Unable to affect objects larger than a refrigerator."
0CP,Orbit,My Hero Academia,"The one born with this Quirk naturally has a gravitational pull, passively
pulling small objects towards the user and into a steady orbit around them.
The holder of this Quirk is able to change the part of their body that emits this field
such as to their head or hand, but cannot shut it off entirely."
0CP,Paralyzation,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to lock up the muscles of a target’s
body, paralyzing them. It can work on just about anyone, but has severe limitations with its use.
The user requires three seconds of sustained eye contact with the target before
activation. Additionally, either party breaking eye contact causes the effects to wear off."
0CP,Peeper,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user has x-ray vision, allowing them to see through solid
objects and surfaces to peer at what’s beneath. The thicker and/or denser something is, the
more difficult it is to see through. Perception of what lies underneath becomes blurrier and
unclear.
Difficulties begin with anything thicker than your pinky finger. You really should be
careful where you’re aiming this. Some things are better left unseen."
0CP,Pepper Breath,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk’s saliva induces a chemical reaction with the
stomach acid of others. If the user can get them to swallow it, it will temporarily produce a
thick smoke.
This smoke is unsavory, causes a bit of coughing and can cloud vision for the one
expelling it. It also makes them look like they just got done eating something rather spicy.
This Quirk is dependent on the user kissing a target or otherwise getting their spit in
their stomach, making it difficult to say the least. The smoke produce varies based on spit
swapped, lasting between ten seconds and a minute."
0CP,Permeation,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to become intangible, causing
everything to pass through them harmlessly, with many conditions and caveats.
When the user sinks into an object with their power and deactivates their perk,
they’re shunted out due to matter being unable to overlap, popping them back up on the
surface.
The major limitation is obvious, the user causes everything to pass through them,
including light, air, varying small particles, vibrations and so on.
This essentially causes their senses to stop functioning due to lack of input until the
user shuts off their Quirk. This can be incredibly dangerous due to the user being unable to
breath, hear or see."
0CP,Placebo,My Hero Academia,"This Quirk allows the user to create small, strangely patterned pills from
their hands. Those who swallow one of these pills increase their suggestibility, making them
more likely to believe the Quirk user over what the pill is supposed to do.
Despite the odd appearance, these are just synthesized sugar pills with no actual
effect on the biology on most creatures. The suggestibility may be broken if the target is
informed over the nature of the pills."
0CP,Radio Star,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to perceive and pick up on radio waves,
either listening to them internally or playing them from their teeth like miniature speakers
for others.
Using this Quirk, the user can listen to whatever songs or radio talk shows might be
on, tune in to police scanners, or potentially even listen in on secret radio communications.
The user has excellent reception, having twice the range of average radios while
picking things up clearly. The user can’t really shut the power off though, simply switch to
dead air when they want to rest, potentially meaning sudden unwanted static if someone
starts using their dead air."
0CP,Ringer,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk can dull a target’s sense of hearing by slapping their
ears simultaneously, causing the target to hear everything as if they were underwater.
The user of this Quirk must slap both ears around the same time to activate the
Quirk. This Quirk lasts for five minutes before wearing off, restoring a target’s hearing."
0CP,Rule Breaker,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user has the ability to reverse the gender of living
creatures, making males into females, and females into males. The Quirk user requires
physical contact with their target for ten seconds before they may activate this ability.
The Quirk user has the ability to reverse the effects the same way they applied them.
Those affected by this Quirk will revert to their original gender regardless after several hours
of time pass."
0CP,Scarface,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user has the power to have their voice originate from any
point within a small radius around their body. This gives them limited ability with throwing
their voice and a particular talent with ventriloquism if they pursue that.
Coincidentally, the Quirk user is unable to open their mouth while making use of
their Quirk, and for several seconds after. This can be threatening if their nose is suddenly
sealed."
0CP,Season City,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to manipulate condiments or
seasonings found on most tables such as salt, sugar, pepper, ketchup and mustard.
The primary limitation of this Quirk is only being able to take control of one type of
thing at a time, as well as obviously being in short supply outside of a restaurant, store or
home."
0CP,Shadow Puppets,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user gains the ability to manipulate their own shadow.
Stretching it, twisting it, shaping it, growing it, shrinking it and even adjusting the shade.
This Quirk does not give any unique properties to the shadow by itself. The Quirk
user has difficulty with growing their shadow more than twice its current size."
0CP,Soda Fountain,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user has the capacity to turn water into another fluid
with a touch. This new fluid is selected at the time of purchase, and may be any safe to
consume fluid or beverage the Quirk user desires, such as vinegar, wine, or lemonade.
The quirk user is limited to converting up to a gallon of water into this new fluid at a
time. The Quirk user absorbs a small amount of water with each use, inhibiting extended
usage."
0CP,Stink Bomb,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user smells just awful. The smell pushes into the nose and
can disorient people just with the wretching scent alone. It’s resilient enough to even
penetrate lesser filters. As a downside, it can’t really be turned off, not fully, you will always
smell pretty bad."
0CP,Sunburn,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user is able to grab and peel off the thin surface of inanimate
objects. This allows the user to clean a dust covered shelf with a pinch, remove screen
protectors with ease or take off the charred surface of an overcooked piece of meat.
This ‘surface’ is usually pliable when being pulled by this Quirk, even when it
shouldn’t be, like the previous example of the dust covered shelf where the surface is a
collection of particles.
Difficult to use on the same surface more than once in quick succession. Few
noticeable applications outside of household utility and cleaning."
0CP,Sunspots,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk can flash a light in the center of their palms for a
fraction of a second. If someone is looking into their palm during the flash, their vision will
be crippled.
The center of a target’s vision will be dominated by a bright purple circle, leaving
only their peripherals available. The circle lasts until the target blinks twenty times. The user
is unable to use their flash more than once every two minutes."
0CP,Telescoping,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to lengthen their spine and torso up to
five times its normal length, or contract it down to half its normal length.
This Quirk allows the user to essentially stretch themselves to grab on to high ledges
before contracting themselves back to normal, or shoot their upper body at enemies.
The user of this Quirk has no special ability to be used to the full height allowed,
making moving around with short legs unaccustomed to the extra weight and awkward
height difficult."
0CP,Trace Empathy,My Hero Academia,"This Quirk allows you to broadcast the way you feel, causing a
mental inclination to develop in all those around you to feel the way you do. With no true
control over how you feel though, the actual utility can often fluctuate."
0CP,Transparency,My Hero Academia,"The one born with this Quirk is completely transparent, invisible to
the naked eye. The user of this Quirk cannot shut it off or turn their clothes invisible
however.
Because of the user’s need to strip down to nothing at all, the risks inherent with
completely exposed skin like extreme heat or cold become readily apparent."
0CP,Uppercrust,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to create and spread a hard, jagged
material made of keratin among other things from their hands, allowing them to protect
their firsts or bind enemies.
The strength of this material is similar to fingernails, but can be layered to
strengthen it. The user is unable to produce much at once and the quality of the material
can degrade with stress."
0CP,Wall Run,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user feels the affects of heightened gravity in the direction
their feet are facing. This allows the Quirk user to more easily climb steep inclines. This
effect isn’t quite strong enough to ignore Earth’s gravity, preventing casual traversal on
vertical surfaces.
If the Quirk user runs, they may more easily move up or across walls, but will
eventually slide off. The Quirk user is able to reduce the effects, but is unable to completely
turn them off, making their day to day life somewhat burdensome compared to others."
0CP,Waterworks,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to produce an outrageous flow of tears
and project them a great distance, similar to a pair of hoses. This also allows them to cry on
command.
While the user has a kind of inner reservoir of additional water for the tears to draw
from, it’s rather small, meaning the user is heavily limited by their body’s moisture, needing
frequent water breaks."
0CP,Weak Attraction,My Hero Academia,"With this perk you may pull small, lightweight objects closer to
you. This is a Quirk of convenience, grabbing things from the other side of the room like keys
or drinks.
It is heavily limited by the weight of the individual objects it can grab, mostly
focused on small, lightweight things under a few pounds."
0CP,Wild Lice,My Hero Academia,"This Quirk causes symbiotic insects to spawn from the user’s body and
live in their hair, using it as a breeding ground. The insects spread and attack those who
touch their host while the user is stressed, spreading and biting viciously to leave a victim
terribly irritated and itchy.
They hate water and will run away at the first signs of it, making them fairly easy to
wash off with just a quick rinse. Even the host can be deprived of their itchy defense force if
washed, but they’ll be replenished with time."
300,Flight,Marvel Age of Krakoa,"Flight (100/200/300 CP): You can fly, Jumper. This isn’t the only way to get flight in
this jump, but for 100 CP you get it with no frills and can control the mechanics of it,
levitation or wings, or anything else you can imagine. You start out at about 70 MPH on
a casual flight and a couple hundred MPH when pressing yourself, but with time and
effort could push it to a casual Mach 1 and in excess of Mach 4 when you press. If you
want frills, and you chose to fly with wings, you can have them weaponized. Very
flexible wings with some kind of cutting edge, for example, Archangel’s techno-organic
wings. This upgrade costs 100 CP and lets you shear through steel with ease. A separate
100 CP upgrade would let you start with a casual Mach 5 flight speed and eventually
reach the point where you could go faster than light if you were in a vacuum."
300,Non-Living Form,Marvel Age of Krakoa,"You can transform your body into a living,
organic version of a normally unliving substance such as ice, plasma, some type of
metal, a gemstone, wood, or what have you. The exact properties of this form, as well as
its pros and cons, are determined by the substance in question. For 100 CP the
transformation is only skin deep, but for 200 it’s full body. This will never inhibit your
ability to move or function. If you purchased the Elemental or Green Thumb Power, you
can purchase this at a discount in order to gain an appropriate form. For an extra 100
CP, this can include exotic or supernatural substances, something as durable as
osmium-steel or adamantium, as versatile as vibranium or mysterium, or outright
divine like Uru or adamantine."
800,Healing Factor,Marvel Age of Krakoa,"You heal faster and more efficiently
than others do. For 100 CP it’s minor. Minor injuries heal three times faster while major
injuries recover a level of scale faster, Ie something that would naturally heal in two
months healing in two weeks, though particularly severe injuries may still require
medical attention. For 200 CP you have proper regeneration, flesh wounds healing
before your eyes, broken bones setting themselves, and so on though you may still need
assistance to recover from severe nerve or organ damage. For 400 CP, you’re closer to
Wolverine or Deadpool. Not only could you regrow a severed limb or an organ within a
day tops, but you can even live through injuries that should kill you before even you can
heal. In extreme cases, you might even be able to live through being liquified and pull
yourself back together or recover from a single cell. Unlike Deadpool, you don’t have to
worry about a bunch of your cast-off limbs and organs pulling together to make a new
you. You no longer need medical attention to make a full recovery from any injury, and
will always heal to the best possible physical condition you can be in. For 600 CP you’re
much the same, but your healing factor extends to mental and spiritual matters, being
able to help you recover from severe trauma or uncover memory or push back against
mental intrusion or spiritual corruption, though at a much-reduced rate compared to
your physical body. Unlike Wade or Logan, you don’t have to worry about losing large
chunks of memory due to your power deciding that was the best way to cope with
trauma. For 800 CP, you’re virtually unkillable, able to regenerate from a single
molecule though it may take up to a month to return to a functional state."
400,Superhuman Senses,Marvel Age of Krakoa,"With this perk, your senses are unusually
sharp. For 100 CP all of your mundane senses are at the peak of a member of your race,
or perhaps even higher if they are already so sharp, with one, in particular, being well
beyond that such as Wolverine’s sense of smell or Hawkeye’s unusually far and precise
field of vision. For 200 CP you're much the same, but two of your senses are enhanced
beyond the normal range to a greater degree than the 100-point version. Black Panther,
for example, has smell and vision comparable to Wolverine and Hawkeye but can
distinguish between more distinct smells and colors, more easily memorize distinct
scents, and see into the ultraviolet spectrum. For 400 CP, each of your senses is
comparable to the human known as Daredevil with the caveat that you still have fully
functional vision and it is enhanced to the same degree. This includes his psionic senses,
his radar and sonar."
200,Liquid Metal Body,Kingdom Come,"Your body is made of titanium. Your body never rusts as you gleam in the light. It can shapeshift and is
very, very hard, the strongest metal out there. Capable of turning your fists into sharp blades and other
metal objects. But you are also capable of turning into liquid, dripping through grates and slide as a
puddle of metal at rapid speed.
For an extra 100 CP, you may also choose to be an out of realm substance you currently possess or can
create. You need only a small sample of the substance to become it."
200,Animal Tamer,Legion of Liberty,"You can quickly form a bond with animals given a few
moments, only a handful at a time (though small swarms of insects is possible, it
scales up with size) after which, they will follow simple instructions. - Ride along, for an extra 100 cp your bond deepens into a telepathic link. You can see what they see, and issue further directions mentally."
200,Flight,Young Justice,"You can fly under your own power. Either through wings, or through
mental power, you can cruise at speeds of approximately 100mph, and sustain a speed
twice that for a while. (Free for Thanagarian)
For an additional 100cp, you can fly as fast as an Earth-16 Kryptonian under a yellow
sun, which is at least supersonic. (Free for Kryptonian and Demigod)"
200,Infrared Vision,Young Justice,"Your vision allows you to visually detect heat signatures,
allowing you to easily see in the dark. Furthermore, this also gives you the ability to see
vast distances when you want to, and microscopic objects. (Free for Kryptonian Hybrid)
For an additional 100cp, you can also see through any solid object or surface, with the
exception of objects and surfaces lined with lead. (Free for Kryptonian)"
400,Super Soldier,Marvel Age of Krakoa,"You’ve been chemically enhanced in order to better
serve a military purpose, or have a physiology similar to someone who has. For 100 CP
you’re akin to a Black Widow, being able to easily maintain yourself at a state of peak
health and fitness in all physical regards while aging as gracefully as possible for your
circumstances. For 400 CP, you’re a match for Captain America, permanently kept at
the greatest peaks of both physical and mental ability and blessed with eternal youth
and immunity to all natural diseases and enough resistance to drugs and toxins that
normally no amount of alcohol would be able to affect you… Though since you’re paying
CP for it you can still get drunk if you want to and only if you want to."
1000 CP,Speed Force Unity,Kingdom Come,"You are unified with the Speedforce, but unlike the Flash you aren’t trapped within its confines. You being
able to “run fast” is just the tip of the iceberg of the power you have. You’ve transcended past the need for
food, water, or air. You’re able to see and sense metaphysical beings in other realities watching you or in
other dimensions or invisible creatures, and reach past those interdimensional barriers. Able to be
anywhere near or on Earth in a zeptosecond, and to blow up anyone or anything with mass by heavily
vibrating their molecules with a touch no matter how large or dense their mass is. Any incorporeal beings
can be fought with your strength, as you can yank them from the plane of existence they’re on to your
level, giving them mass and the mortality that having a corporeal form grants them.
But you can also use this power to vibrate your way into other worlds entirely as you move past the
barriers separating the worlds, and take people you can hold with you. You can also draw on the
Speedforce at any time to give you electric powers and use it as a virtually infinite source of energy as
you are completely one with it. You could also use the Speedforce to power electric devices without them
shorting out or any damage from it."
1000CP,Power Absorption,X-Men the Claremont Years,"You possess one of the arguably most powerful, but also most cripplingly flawed, powers in the setting. Like Rogue you
may absorb another entity’s powers through skin to skin contact. While this has some
limits - it doesn’t work on robots and some beings are too powerful to completely drain -
for most entities this will quickly knock them out while granting you all of their powers.
You may drain multiple being’s powers at once, combining them into yourself, and if you
drain someone’s power long enough you obtain their power on a long term basis (while
often called permanent Rogue has always eventually lost these powers) causing them to
lose their powers and fall into a deep coma if they do not die.
However as noted this is a power that comes with a great flaw. While, unlike Rogue, you
can turn this power on and off at will, that is the smallest difficulty for her power. Any
creature whose vital energy/powers you absorb will continue to exist within your mind as
a psychic shadow. Those with a strong enough will/psyche may overwhelm your control
when you are absorbing them, and if you fully drain someone the psychic echo will be
significantly stronger. Rogue was never the same again after she drained Miss Marvel’s
powers into herself, and how much of it was because of her time with the X-Men and
how much was due to Carol Danver’s psychic influence on herself was never known even
to Rogue. So do take care, Jumper.
You are immune to other such contact based power draining effects, and others with such
a power are immune to this effect."
1000CP,Aura Generation,Young Justice,"This is arguably the most diverse power in this jump. You
have the ability to generate multiple colored auras, each with a different ability. Initially,
you will only be able to use one aura at a time, with the ability to switch between them at
will. You may eventually use all your powers at once, by unlocking a Rainbow Power
state, where you emit all your auras at once. (Discounted for One More Life, discount
does not stack with Meta Origin)
● Red Aura: Force Fields - Capable of taking blows from an Earth-16 Kryptonian
for a short while before cracking.
● Orange Aura: Flight and Telekinesis - The telekinesis is significantly weaker than
the Psychic power, flight is comparable to the first purchase of Flight.
● Yellow Aura: Energy Blasts - Compatible with Energy Projection power.
● Green Aura: Holograms - can create decoys of yourself and others, create fake
surroundings, and even walls. Although, the holograms are not solid and are
easily disrupted.
● Blue Aura: Light - you can emit light, enough to blind those looking directly at it.
● Indigo Aura: Boom Tubes - Generate indigo-colored boom tubes.
● Violet Aura: Healing - You can heal yourself and others, including advanced AIs,
ie. a Motherbox. You can even cleanse others of mind control."
100CP,Angel of the Heavens,Avengers Vs X-Men,"A pair of great angel wings extends from your back, made of advanced techno-organic metal. A mix
of mutant and technology, there are few better suited to ruling the skies than you. They enable flight
at several times the speed of sound with ease and are very strong shields, easily holding up to a
military weapon barrage. The edges of the wings are sharp enough to cut through diamond or stone,
as are the feathers that can be accurately launched like knives, and the wings themselves are strong
enough to shatter stone by batting against it. Your body is somewhat enhanced along with these
wings, gaining the stamina to fly for hours without rest and peak human physical capabilities outside
of this. Your wings grow quickly and any damage to them will be healed within hours. Even full
removal of the wings only lasts a few days at most."
100CP,Be Dazzled,Avengers Vs X-Men,"The power to transform sound into light is yours. Any sound that you hear is absorbed by you and
transformed back into light, rendering you impossible to deafen. The light is under your control and
is much greater in output then the energy taken in from the sound. Uncontrolled, your body will
simply produce regular flashes of light but with focus, everything form custom light shows, detailed
visual illusions, powerful burning lasers or concussive blasts of light can be created. Even short lived
solid light constructs can be made. Like Dazzler herself, you cannot store this power in you, so it
requires constant sound to be effective."
100CP,Devil Sense,Avengers Vs X-Men,"After being exposed to a certain radioactive isotope, your sensory systems have been heightened far
beyond any human level. Like the Devil of Hell’s Kitchen, your five senses are each enough to
operate in a fight on their own. With touch alone, you could feel the presence of every person in a
room via heat and air displacement. Your other senses are similarly heightened, except for your
senses of sight which remains at human levels. This extends from being able to track scents like an
animal to replicating sonar via your hearing senses. Due to your body adapting to react to this
sensory information, you also have superhuman agility and bodily reflexes, which would be lethal if
combined with martial training. Telepaths will also find it very difficult to read your mind, as they
become overwhelmed by the sensory information you easily process."
100CP,Glob Man,Avengers Vs X-Men,"A body made up of a special Living Wax substance is what you have. You look like a skeleton and all
the organs of a human body held up in a humanoid figure of jelly. You’re pretty solid despite the jelly
look though, normal military bombs won’t budge you much at all, and you’re more than capable of
lifting and throwing a car down the street. You look damn weird though."
100CP,Jubilation,Avengers Vs X-Men,"You possess the ever so incredible ability of making fireworks. With a thought, you can summon
small balls of light and control them, altering their shape as you please. When you wish, they can
explode. Sometimes this is little more than an actual firework, just some pretty flashes and sparkles.
Sometimes it’s strong enough to blow a hole in a thick metal wall. You can create dozens or hundred
of the light balls at a time but they’re not terribly powerful. If you take your ability to task and train
to your limits, you may find a way to create explosions at smaller and smaller sizes, even potentially
attacking things on a sub-atomic level."
100CP,Matter Dissolution,Avengers Vs X-Men,"Basic but destructive, they called you. With a power that lets you dissolve the binding forces of any
matter you come into physical contact with, it’s not a surprising descriptor. You’re very hard to keep
still, though you can control your power when you wish, and unnatural energies may allow some to
resist your powers."
100CP,Shadowcat,Avengers Vs X-Men,"You have the ability to become intangible at will, taking along anything you are in contact with for
the ride. You can phase through things selectively or fully, even applying this selective nature to
what you touch. That famous heart steal isn’t so far out of reach. You naturally disrupt any
electronics you phase through, which can be both a help and a hindrance."
100CP,Take A Gamble,Avengers Vs X-Men,"Anything becomes an explosion when it gets in your hands. You have the mutant power to
accelerate the kinetic energy in anything you touch, much like Gambit does, and can thus turn things
into remote activated bombs or quite scary ranged weapons, capable of tearing through most
physical objects via vibrations. When you make something explode, it’ll do more damage the bigger
the object. A playing card blows up like a grenade, a person? They’ll take out an entire building. The
shame is that the bigger the object, the longer it’ll take for you to charge it up right."
100CP,Transonic Flight,Avengers Vs X-Men,"Simple speed is still speed. Someone might have a problem with it but when you can knock them out
in the blink of an eye, who really cares? You have the twin powers of supersonic movement and
supersonic flight. Straightforward and far from impressing anyone but they’re more than effective
enough against most people. You’re not only fast though. Your skin is made of little blue crystals that
shapeshift in response to your current movement, enabling you to be as agile and fast as physically
possible for your current abilities. Sometimes this is as simple as becoming more aerodynamic when
running at high speeds and sometimes you can turned into a winged snake creature when flying at
high altitudes. It helps you move quite a bit faster but you can force it down if need be."
100CP,Flight,Generic Super Academy,"You have the ability to soar through the air as you will, and can fully exploit 3d 
movement for all it’s worth. The exact mechanics of how this is done depends on the Source of 
the power, but in general, no matter the source, they all have the same mechanical effect. You 
have just good enough reflexes to not smack into things at whatever level of flight you have, but 
they are tied into your flight power and have no practical use beyond not flying into things 
accidentally. 
At Street Tier you can fly at around 100mph, and suffer none of the normal complications 
of moving through the air at such speeds. 
At National Tier you can fly just short of the sound barrier, and have mastered the 
practical uses of 3d movement. 
At Global Tier you are well past supersonic in terms of speed, and your speed has no 
effect on your surroundings unless you desire it to (you won’t shatter buildings by flying near 
them at max speed, basically). You have mastered the use of flight in combat by this point, and 
it is as intuitive for you as breathing. 
At Cosmic Tier you could fly from one side of the world to the other in only a few 
moments, and in a vacuum you could fly to other planets and solar systems in a relatively short 
time frame if you know where you’re going."
100CP,Inviolate Body,Generic Super Academy,"Your body is a temple, as they say, and you benefit from such via several supernatural 
abilities related to it. 
At Street Tier you have no need to eat, drink, breathe, produce human waste, or sleep, 
and are not adversely affected by environments with extreme high or low pressure such as the 
bottom of the ocean or the upper atmosphere or extreme temperature such as near the heart of 
a volcano or Antarctica.  
At National Tier you are further immune to all forms of poison, sickness, and disease 
mundane or otherwise and are immune to the harmful effects of radiation alongside truly 
extreme environments such as being in space. 
At Global Tier you are biologically immortal and utterly tireless, having unlimited stamina. 
You will age to your physical prime but no further. 
Finally at Cosmic Tier you are completely immune to any attempt to forcefully change, 
control, or manipulate your body against your will in any fashion no matter what method is 
attempted or used. This does not protect from direct damage, but from more exotic attacks such 
as transformations or disintegration."
100CP,Stealth,Generic Super Academy,"Your power is based around making you undetectable. It could make you invisible, it 
could be a SEP field, it could be a cloaking device, but it is all about the ability to be hidden. 
 At Street Tier this ability is limited to a single mundane sense. In the case of Invisibility, 
you might be visible in the extreme ultraviolet or infrared spectrums of light. Alternatively, it may 
only work against certain types of observers, such as being invisible to machines or to animals, 
or it may have some limitation, like still leaving a shadow or only working in the shadows. 
 At National Tier this power works against multiple mundane senses, such as sight and 
hearing or could hide you from unusual senses such as Clairvoyance or Sonar. 
 At Global Tier you can become essentially undetectable except by the most 
out-of-context senses. At this level pre-cognitive senses have difficulty ‘seeing’ you, and are 
generally unreliable where you are involved (though this does not affect your own precog, if you 
have it). You can also extend this protection to the area around you, or to specific people in that area. 
At Cosmic Tier you can only be found when you choose. This could even work at 
conceptual levels, keeping you alive by letting you hide from Death (once per jump, or once per 
decade in longer jumps), or letting you sneak out of your Karma. You could sneak into 
Aphrodite’s bedroom, and sneak out again safely when Hephaestus or Ares show up to visit 
her. At this level you are completely immune to precognitive abilities, and can’t even be noticed 
by the ‘holes’ you leave in such senses."
100CP,Superhuman Skill,Generic Super Academy,"You possess greater than human levels of skill in a single occupation. You could be a 
superhuman sniper, martial artist, mechanic, chef, or any other area of skill. You may purchase 
additional occupations for an extra 100 cp each. 
At Street Tier you are slightly above what a normal human could achieve. This level in 
skill is equivalent to Bullseye’s accuracy or Lady Shiva’s fighting skill. 
At National Tier you can achieve feats of skill that would normally only be possible with 
machine-like perfection. You could literally shoot the wings off a fly at 100 meters, perform 
delicate brain surgery with a shard of glass in a tenth the normal time, or write a song that 
inspires a national revolution within days. 
At Global Tier the laws of physics become flexible when you practice your skills. You can 
bend bullets Wanted style, balance on a cloud, or swim up a rainstorm. 
At Cosmic Tier things get a little ridiculous. Your skills acquire conceptual level effects. 
You could shoot someone by targeting their shadow, dodge bad luck, or repair spatial rifts with 
duct tape and bailing wire."
100CP,A Dead Man,Kingdom Come,"You died. But you did not pass on, and you happened to keep your flesh body for whatever reason.
Perhaps it wasn’t your time, and your spirit was returned to your body. But this strange brush with death
left you with an odd power. You can turn incorporeal and cannot be seen or heard by normal people. Not
only can you see extradimensional beings and ghosts (and chat with them as well), you can also possess
living things, like dogs or humans. They won’t remember what you make them do unless you will it.
Particularly willful people can flush you from their body if they wish."
100CP,Immortal,Kingdom Come,"You may have lived a long life, from the era of cave paintings and before the time of the written word.
You’ve probably picked up a lot of skills here and there--It was such a long time from prehistory to now,
after all. Immortality has also perfected every part of your body, and your body is always in working order.
Age and injury does not steal from your muscles, and you have had a long, long life in this world of which
you have accumulated many skills and degrees in assorted subjects. You’re in peak human condition,
and this will never go away. You cannot die from old age and disease or become visibly older over time
unless you will it, and your accumulated skills and knowledge from many years will help you go far in this
world. You also cannot get rusty in skills or fighting in any way shape or form."
100CP,Thanagarian,Kingdom Come,"You are part of an alien race that resemble bird people. Known as the Thanagarians, they have massive
wings that enable them to soar through the sky, increased resistance to pain, enhanced strength (Not to
the level of superman, but it exceeds peak human), enhanced senses, and an extended lifespan. One
hundred years for a Thanagarian is thirty years for a human. Specifically with your senses, your vision
stretches far like a bird’s and you can perceive sounds better than humans, with a wider hearing range."
100CP,Fang and Claw,Marvel Age of Krakoa,"You have exactly what it says on the tin. Your “fangs” are a
weapon of last resort, only slightly sharper or harder than your teeth would otherwise
be, but your claws, which can be from your hands, feet, or both, can carve through
granite. They can be as short as an inch in length or as long as a foot, and can be
retracted if necessary. Additionally, your bones have enhanced density."
100CP,Lucky,Marvel Age of Krakoa,"You find that probability tends to bend in your favor when you’re in
danger. This ability scales with how much danger you’re in, how fast your heart is
beating, how much adrenaline is in your system, and the like. And how active you are: If
someone is shooting at you, their gun is more likely to jam if you actively try to dodge
their shot than if you just stand still and let them shoot. You also seem to have a mild
form of precognitive reflexes, that is to say, you only dodge away from actual danger and
never dodge into danger."
100CP,Nature-Talker,Marvel Age of Krakoa,"Well, not literally. You have a psionic, empathetic, ability to
commune with non-sapient organisms. You can direct feelings, intentions, and
sometimes information to either flora or fauna and pick up the same in return. This can
be purchased twice to gain the ability to commune with both flora and fauna."
100CP,Omnidexterity,Marvel Age of Krakoa,"You can use either hand equally well, and either foot is as
dexterous as one of your hands. You also possess increased flexibility allowing you to
use a foot/leg in place of a hand/arm, the strength and balance to support your weight
with one or both arms, and you are perfectly comfortable using any limb for any
purpose."
100CP,Omniglot,Marvel Age of Krakoa,"Simply put, this is the power to speak and read every language.
Any language you encounter, be it written, spoken, or otherwise is something you
understand intuitively and can learn to communicate with almost instantly as long as
you are physically capable of doing so. Note that this also includes body language,
programming languages, secret codes, arcane secrets… With enough time you could
learn to communicate with beings that lack an innate form of communication or create
your own unique languages that can only be used by those you allow to learn."
100CP,ARG,Marvel's Kid Heroes,"You have a HUD that displays useful information of
all sorts. You can mentally access the internet for information."
100CP,Blast!,Marvel's Kid Heroes,"By focusing (or panicking) you can cause things to explode, ranging from a
small ﬁrecracker to leveling a building. Takes several seconds
of intense focus, unless you panic, in which case it happens
uncontrollably."
100CP,Exceptional Skill,Marvel's Kid Heroes,"You are so good at something, like archery,
swordsmanship,  martial arts, piloting or frisbee, that it may as
well be a superpower. May be taken multiple times."
100CP,Healing,Marvel's Kid Heroes,"You have the simplest of powers, to mend illness and minor injuries by touching someone
and infusing them with your powers. Even serious injuries can
at least be stabilized."
100CP,Nimble,Marvel's Kid Heroes,"You have the makings of a world class acrobat
and contortionist. Anything your ﬁngers do can be done as
easily with your toes."
100CP,Super-Soldier,Marvel's Kid Heroes,"Through genetics, training, or blood transfer, you’re a peak human equal
to Captain America or will be when you’re older. For now, you
can easily overpower baseline humans and are fast and agile as
well."
100CP,Telepatic Immunity,Marvel's Kid Heroes,Your mind is shielded from reading or manipulation.
100CP,Wind,Marvel's Kid Heroes,"You can command the very air, generating wind blasts and limited shields to deﬂect objects
and blow away gasses. At your greatest extent, you could create
a highly localized tornado."
100CP,Absorb & Release,My Hero Academia,"This Quirk allows the user to absorb enemy attacks, kinetic and
energy based, hold them within their body and release them whenever and however they
wish.
It is heavily limited, however, by the fact that it doesn’t protect the user of the Quirk
in the process of absorbing the attack, causing them to be burnt by fire, shocked by
electricity and so on."
100CP,Airwalk,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user has the capacity to float and levitate though the air as if
weightless. This can be used to reach difficult spaces, scout from above, move yourself out
of range of enemy retaliation and basically all the other applications you can imagine for
flight.
Air Walk bestows a high degree of control over the user’s movement through the air.
Conversely, this flight has low acceleration, and the faster the user is going, the less control
they’ll have."
100CP,Animal Voice,My Hero Academia,"Animal Voice allows one to communicate with and command
animals, vocally. Animals who receive these orders will follow without fail.
You may not control things that only appear to be animals. Animals need to be able
to hear you to receive your orders. Intense fear or shock can cause animals to break your
control and disobey."
100CP,Army Man,My Hero Academia,"This Quirk allows the user to harmlessly “implant"" small, inanimate
objects within a living creature. The act has no sensation, meaning the target may never
notice the exchange if the Quirk user was able to perform the act with enough subtlety.
Once past the skin, objects will find or create a space for themselves to exist, as
opposed to fusing with tissues. This means the act alone will not bring harm, though the
nature of the object may still allow harm to be caused. The Quirk user has the capacity to
pull objects back out.
The Quirk user will feel shock coursing through the limb used to activate this Quirk.
Repeated usage can cause numbness, and difficulty moving the affected body part, as if it
had gone to sleep."
100CP,Babel,My Hero Academia,"This Quirk acts as a form of auto-telekinesis, commanding inanimate
objects to stack on top of each other in a perfectly balanced tower, making use of each
object’s center of gravity.
The user must target the objects they wish to stack in this manner, before said
objects fly to the “foundation"" to quickly twist, turn, adjust and stack themselves up to form
a tower or pillar.
The user is limited by both weight and number of objects. They’re unable to target
anything heavier than what they could pick up, and will get headaches of varying intensity if
stacking too many things at once due to the complexity of the task."
100CP,Bad Breath,My Hero Academia,"The quirk user is able to project a dense, light blocking cloud of
multicolored fog from openings of their face, such as mouth, ears and nose. Pores are the
hardest to generate the noxious fog from, but also a possibility possible.
The fog has mild hallucinogenic properties, inducing a lingering state of dizziness,
nausea and haziness of senses. Due to the thickness of the fog, it can also be used to block
vision, and will linger for a while in the area around the user.
It’s a light gas however, and as such that will float, relying on the Quirk user’s lung
strength to properly propagate in the initial breath. Fog may at times obscure the user’s own
vision."
100CP,Beast,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user is able to assume a more bestial form with a number of
associated benefits, growing larger, obtaining larger teeth, and acquiring full body fur when
they assume this form.
In this form, they acquire heightened physical abilities, most pronounced being
speed and strength. The Quirk user also acquires advanced senses, including an extremely
acute sense of smell.
Their smell alone would allow them to quickly detect and identify familiar scents,
picking apart individuals at range along with details like where they are and how fast they’re
traveling.
Overpowering scents can have deleterious effects on the Quirk user. The Quirk user
is consumed by a great euphoria when transformed that can heavily affect decision making
abilities and cognitive abilities."
100CP,Black,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user is able to merge with anything seen as the color black. This
includes shadows, which are simply black due to the absence of light. The Quirk user may
move quickly around and through anything they’re currently merged with, enabling quick movement.
The Quirk user may ready this ability ahead of time to instantly merge with
something black upon contact. If the current target of possession is destroyed, the Quirk
user is forced from their hiding place, which includes shadows dismissed by light. With time
comes potential for manipulating their hosts."
100CP,Blood Curdle,My Hero Academia,"This Quirk allows the user to temporarily paralyze their target by
consuming some of their blood, up to an absolute maximum after training of 8 minutes if
they share the same type.
The various other blood types will be paralyzed for less time. The obvious limitation
is actually licking up the target’s blood and fighting multiple people."
100CP,Blood Manipulation,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to manipulate their own blood.
They can harden it, eject it from their body, pull it back in, manipulate it inside their body to
move their own body and so on.
The limitations of Blood Manipulation are obvious, as it’s important to keep most of
it inside of you to avoid dying and such, and pulling it back in after ejecting it may prove
dangerous if it brings back any contaminants."
100CP,Bone Spear,My Hero Academia,"This Quirk allows you to sprout super hard drills of bone from your
body for both offensive and defensive measures. It can also be used to support your limbs
for melee attacks.
When sprouting Bone Spears, movement may become awkward until you force
them to recede, and sprouting too many at once can leave them more brittle than sprouting
a few."
100CP,Cemedine,My Hero Academia,"This Quirk allows you to expel a great deal of glue-like viscous fluid
that quickly hardens, making it ideal for repairing damage or trapping enemies.
The user of this Quirk is limited somewhat by their body’s hydration and potentially
getting themselves stuck while the glue is still wet."
100CP,Chronostasis,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user gains two arrow shaped locks of hair, a larger one in
front called “the minute hand"" and a smaller one in the back called “the hour hand.""
The user is able to extend these arrows which have the capacity to cut or pierce a
normal human’s flesh. When injured by one of these hands, the victim finds their body
massively slowed down to the point of near immobility. This effect lasts as long as the name
of the hand that gave the injury.
Others may freely manipulate the victim while slowed, allowing them to be easily
detained. The hands of Chronostasis can only fire in a straight line, making it difficult to aim
with the hour hand. The effect cannot stack. Only able to project the arrow hair hands while
staying completely still."
100CP,Chute,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quick can retract an enemy’s body parts with sufficient
physical impact. The user of this Quirk is also a bit stronger than the average human.
This enables the user of this Quirk to be able to do things like meet an enemy’s
punch with their own punch and cause it to get pushed back into their own harm, or push
their head into their torso.
This Quirk is harmless by itself, simply causing an enemy to lose access to body parts.
Victims of this Quirk will eventually be able to push retraced parts back out. Those with
significant strength are more resistant to this Quirk’s effects."
100CP,Confession,My Hero Academia,"This Quirk allows the user to force anyone they ask a question to
answer with the truth to the absolute best of their abilities. This can even allow the user to
get the truth to questions the target may be suppressing or not fully aware of, like their true
feelings on a touchy subject.
This Quirk is not only an extremely potent interrogation tool, or for psychological
torture. As it only allows for forcing out the truth to the questions the user asks, the user
must know what questions to ask and how to ask them to get the best of this ability."
100CP,Crystallization,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user is able to produce crystals from anywhere on their
body. These crystals are very hard, though not unbreakable, which allows them to give
themselves a form of crude armor as the situation calls for it.
The Quirk user may grow them near instantly, though body hair inhibits structural
integrity. The Quirk user has difficulty shaping their crystals, which may leave them
somewhat awkward in some situations."
100CP,Disintegration,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to destroy anything they lay their
hands on, causing it to slowly crumble to bits. The user must lay their entire hand and five
fingers on their target.
Unfortunately, this Quirk is always on, meaning the user must be incredibly careful
not to lay their entire hand on anything they want to keep intact."
100CP,Double,My Hero Academia,"Double is a quirk that allows the user to create copies of themselves or
others with a touch, up to two at a time. The clones have the same personality and abilities
as the original which may either be a boon or a risk depending on who you clone. This
includes their Quirk.
This is not without its fair share of caveats however. Due to the autonomous nature
of clones, they have the potential to rebel if they don’t like their lot.
The first clone made of someone is much less durable and will dissolve into black
liquid when injured too much, the second clone will be even less durable than the first.
Finally, the Quirk user needs a stellar mental image of whoever they’re copying to
make a proper clone of them. This includes various measurements and features."
100CP,Echo,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to control and collect nearby sounds into
constructs resembling music notes before projecting them, causing them to bounce around
and make noise.
The note repeats the sound sealed inside each time it impacts against something
allowing the user to literally “throw their voice"" or cause loud noises to go off in someone’s face.
The primary limitations of this Quirk are the limited number of bounces for each
note, and only being able to rely on nearby or self-produced sounds. The user’s ears may
pop a bit with repeated use."
100CP,Echolocation,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk’s ears and vocal chords are specially adapted,
allowing them to project infrasonic screeches that bounce around the environment before
returning to them.
The sounds they get back give them a clear picture of their surroundings, allowing
them to navigate even in an otherwise void of sensory deprivation.
Materials that can absorb sound and loud, constant noise that can drown out your
screeches can render the sense hazy and hard to use"
100CP,Engine,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk has an engine-like structure in their calves and muffler-like
protrusions that are the source of incredible leg strength. This improves the user’s running
speed and kicking power.
The engines are fueled by orange juice and shorted out by carbonated drinks. The
user is able to switch through multiple “gears"" in order, each raising the Quirk user’s leg
strength.
Overheating or jamming the exhausts of the user’s legs can cause the engines to jam,
temporarily immobilizing their legs until the problem is solved."
100CP,Food,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user is able to bite, chew and digest almost anything they can get
their jaws around, even snapping off chunks of reinforced steel and swallowing it with ease.
Due to the effects of this Quirk when in use, the user digests things extremely fast,
allowing them to eat and eat and eat as if running on an empty stomach.
Of course, the user has to actually be able to bite something for this Quirk to come
in handy, and toxins can still make them sick, but otherwise this renders their jaws insanely
dangerous."
100CP,Gatling,My Hero Academia,"Gatling bestows gun-like organs on their arms with the ability to shoot
claws made of keratin. They have similar destructive power and flight speed as genuine
bullets when shot and due to the numerous barrels on the gun-organs can be shot in rapid
succession.
Because of the slight curvature of the projectiles, they’re inaccurate beyond close
range, but remain useful for suppressive fire even at medium range. The user has a supply of
several thousand ‘rounds’ available to them a day and needs a good diet and sleep to
properly replenish their ammo."
100CP,Good Face,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user has the ability to warp an individual within their line of
sight. The target acquires a more charismatic and flamboyant behavior. They will also gain a
stoic, cooler appearance and sparkle under intense light, like the sun.
The target is entirely aware of what’s happened to them, but is unable to break the
effects or behave differently. Intense anger can temporarily disrupt the effects, however.
The Quirk user will find themselves keenly interested by the target while the effects are
active. Effects end after several hours."
100CP,Homing,My Hero Academia,"This Quirk allows the user to alter the trajectory of bullets or other
projectiles they personally fire or release, allowing them to almost always hit their mark.
The user is able to cause projectiles to accelerate somewhat and make several sharp
turns in the air before impact, but is ultimately limited by how well they can perceive their
own projectiles, the initial speed of the projectile after being fired and actually having ammo."
100CP,Hypertrophy,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to greatly enlarge one of their body
parts at a time, vastly increasing their strength and durability in the process of doing so.
A single arm could be grown to match the size of the rest of the body. Muscles are
greatly strengthened in the process of enlarging the body part.
The user is limited to one body part at a time, and enlarged body parts are still
vulnerable to possible injuries normal flesh is vulnerable too."
100CP,Infrared Ray,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to scatter infrared rays that they can
use to sense their surroundings in every direction well enough that they could function fine
while blind.
This increase’s one’s situational awareness. The Quirk picking up on things outside of
human perception allows a limited ability to sense someone’s emotions by focusing in on
them.
The sense is hazy unless focused however. The infrared rays may be scattered and
disrupted by certain kinds of electronics and sensors as well, nullifying its usefulness."
100CP,Jet,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk has holes in the bottom of their feet that can project
concentrated air bursts, allowing them to jump and move in bursts of high speed.
The primary limitation of this Quirk is the fact that the user only has the air they
breathe to rely upon. This Quirk can also be stressful on a weak body caused be illness or old
age."
100CP,Larceny,My Hero Academia,"This Quirk allows the user to steal any objects they can see on a target’s
body, including manifestations of their Quirk that aren’t permanent fixtures like a temporary
tentacle.
‘Stolen’ objects transport straight to the Quirk user’s hands, making it difficult, if not
impossible to stop them from taking whatever they have their eyes on.
Larceny cannot be used to steal anything too large, leaving them unable to take
large pieces of equipment and such. As the Quirk user needs to confirm a target with their
eyes, being blinded or blindfolded will lock off the use of Larceny."
100CP,Lock Down,My Hero Academia,"This Quirk allows the user to lock objects in space, essentially
immobilizing it. This is done by pushing the user’s finger, which gains key teeth protrusions,
into the desired object and turning that finger like a key.
This allows the user to prevent pieces of furniture from moving, stopping objects in
the middle of the air as a form of obstacle, stopping projectiles from continuing towards
them among other applications.
There are limits on size and force, making the task of stopping out of control trucks
or giant pieces of falling rubble daunting threats, especially if they lay on the edge of what’s
possible. This Quirk may not effect living things."
100CP,Longevity,My Hero Academia,"The possessor of this Quirk has functional immortality, being able to
continue aging with no real upper limit, similar to certain animals like lobsters.
The Quirk holder does not degrade over time like normal humans, being able to
collect a vast array of skills, experiences and knowledge over their long life. Those with
Longevity and the Hero or Villain may start with a decade or two of additional experience.
The holder of Longevity is in every other way a normal human, still potentially
vulnerable to dying via disease, accident or being murdered by someone else."
100CP,Lumber,My Hero Academia,"This Quirk allows the user to generate and control wood from their body.
This is effective for protecting the user, binding enemies and fortifying structures.
Due to this being a wood based Quirk, it is ineffective against fire and explosion
based Quirks, limiting its effectiveness in certain scenarios."
100CP,Magnetism,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to magnetize people around them,
temporarily turning them into extremely powerful magnets.
Men are polarized south, while women are polarized north. This can be accounted
for in strategies, such as allowing the user to launch one person using another of the same
gender.
The user of this Quirk is unable to magnetize themselves. The user is only able to
magnetize people within 4.5 meters of themselves, the effects wear off outside this range."
100CP,Mimicry,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user has the capacity to merge themselves with inanimate
objects to manipulate or shape those objects according to their whims. The Quirk user
cannot be directly harmed while possessing an object, and must be forced out first.
The Quirk user may move into objects much smaller than themselves, but not into
anything more than two to three times their size. The Quirk user is unable to perceive their
surroundings unless they manifest their sensory organs externally, leaving themselves
partially vulnerable."
100CP,Naval Laser,My Hero Academia,"The user is able to project extremely powerful laser’s from their
stomach. These lasers can be either short or long range, thin or wide, and have dramatic
kickback that can propel the user through the air.
This Quirk can only be used for 1 second at a time. Otherwise, overuse risks the
user’s stomach collapsing from the incredible recoil of the ability."
100CP,Perfume Bubble,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user has the ability to create bubbles from their body
resembling soap bubbles, with control over how they drift and fly. The Quirk user uniquely
has the ability to fill their bubbles with any scent they’ve smelled in their lives, at varying
degrees of potency.
With greater stress and less focus however, the Quirk user will lose control over the
scents they fill bubbles with, causing them to be generated with various bad smells."
100CP,Pliabody,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user’s body has extreme range of motion and pliability, like
dough with muscles. Through this range of movement and potential for contortion, they can
bend, stretch and flatten their body parts using their muscles as the shaping force.
If the Quirk user is overpowered, their body might contort against their will, leaving
them in awkward situations. There is a limit to the Quirk user’s pliability, and damage can be
incurred from being stretched or flattened past these limits."
100CP,Polaroid,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user’s eyes resembles the lenses of a camera, and a gray
circle sits in the middle of their forehead. The Quirk user has the ability to zoom their sight in
on targets several times over, though higher levels need time to acquire clarity.
The Quirk user also has the capacity to emit a bright flash from the circle on their
forehead which is bright enough to temporarily blind those who were staring into it.
The Quirk user, at any time, may “take a picture"" of whatever it is they’re currently
viewing. After a few seconds, something resembling a polaroid will eject from their mouth
with the image on it.
The Quirk user is sensitive to sudden changes in light conditions, other than their
own flash. Suddenly walking from a dark room into broad daylight, or being exposed to a
strobe light, can cause intense pain."
100CP,Pop Off,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk produces sticky spheres from the top of their head.
These can be used as projectiles, as when one is plucked, a new one quickly grows in its place.
Their stickiness is especially notable, applying themselves instantly to whatever they
touch besides the user, who is immune to their effects. Depending on the user’s healthy,
they could last up to a full day before their stickiness wears off.
The user can only pluck so many sticky balls off their head before the tissue they
grow from begins to be damaged and begins to bleed, requiring a period of rest after too
many get used in rapid succession."
100CP,Popcorn,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to expand the fat inside a target’s body on
contact. causing them to irregularly puff up just like the Quirk’s namesake.
Despite the above description, it is nonlethal on its own but can stifle breathing
somewhat. It’s also temporary, wearing off after the status is inflicted over ten minutes, but
leaving the target immobile for the most part in the meantime.
The reaction is fueled by the user’s blood sugar, requiring a diet high in candies and
junk food to utilize this Quirk in prolonged conflicts to its fullest."
100CP,Rocket Thrust,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user’s right fist is made of metal, and they are able to
send their right fist flying with rocket propulsion after punching with it. A second rocket
charge can deliver their fist back to them after it impacts with a target, where it can then be
reattached.
If prevented from returning, the Quirk user will need to manually go get their fist
back. Rocket fuel must be restored with body fluids, limiting daily usage."
100CP,Roughest,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to manipulate the texture and properties
of their own skin, making it rougher, smoother, softer, tougher or more elastic.
With this control over their skin they can adjust how they interact with their
surroundings, such as giving themselves small flesh hooks to grip on top surfaces and
improve traction like a lizard or sliding around on their hands and knees even on concrete no
problem.
The primary limitation of this Quirk is the actual health of the user’s skin, which can
become sensitive and peel if they change it too much. Creams and moisturizer are a must."
100CP,Shake,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to vibrate whatever they touch, including the
strength and speed of the shaking. This also makes the user more resilient to other vibration
based abilities.
Using this power, the user can shake apart and break brittle things quite easily,
change the shape of the battlefield, rattle an enemy and other things you would use
vibrations for.
The user of this Quirk is limited by the aftershocks of their own ability, becoming
stunned or even immobilized for an extended period of time if they shake something with
too much strength or speed."
100CP,Signal Pirate,My Hero Academia,"This Quirk allows the user to hijack electronic signals and
manipulate the audio and video of nearby electronics. This would allow them to broadcast
their face and voice over TVs, make themselves invisible to security cameras or blow out
speakers with top volume cacophonies.
This quirk has an effective range of just over 50 meters and obviously has few uses
when out of range of any suitable electronics to apply their Quirk on."
100CP,Size,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user is able to increase the size of objects they’ve interacted with
up to two dozen times over. The activation condition for this effect is the user touching their
five fingertips on each hand together, similar in nature to a prayer.
They may increase the size of objects from quite far away, even outside their line of
sight, providing they focus on their target(s). They may manually deactivate the changes
with the same gesture as before. The Quirk user is unable to affect living things such as
plants or people."
100CP,Snip Clip,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user has a strange power to cleanly cut most materials. In
order to do so, they must make a scissoring motion with their body, using their fingers, toes,

or possibly legs. The ability to cut is incredible, as even reinforced steel can be separated
cleanly.
The Quirk user must be able to cut from either side of their target in order for the
Quirk to activate properly. This limits usage against anything too much larger than the Quirk
user."
100CP,Storage,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user is able to take in objects in that they’re currently in
contact with, storing them inside a large space inside of their body. Oxygen is able to be
filtered through their skin into this place, providing fresh air for living creatures being stored
inside.
At any point after initial storage, the Quirk user is able to pull out what they’ve
stored. Limited storage space, unable to store overly large objects. Larger objects take more
time to store and retrieve. Volatile or resistant objects, such as an angry person, can
potentially force themselves out."
100CP,Sugar Rush,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user is able to convert ingested sugar into muscle power,
increasing their strength five-fold. This power-up lasts for three minutes per ten grams of
consumed sugar.
The Quirk user requires at least ten grams of sugar in their digestive system in order
to activate this Quirk. The longer this Quirk is active, the user’s cognitive abilities gradually
drop, lowering intelligence and inducing lethargy."
100CP,Telepath,My Hero Academia,"This Quirk allows the user to advise and instruct multiple people at
once through mental communication, even across great distance.
The primary limitation of this ability is that it’s one way only, as the user is unable to
hear the thoughts or responses of others, simply relay messages from her end."
100CP,Tongue Web,My Hero Academia,"This Quirk givers the user the ability to strengthen, extend, warp
and shape their tongue to an incredible extent. Spreading it out into a binding web, splitting
it into multiple long tongues, slapping the sense out of enemies from over several meters
away.
Major flaws include your tongue still having a sense of taste, and the innate
sensitivity of the human tongue. This makes using it in some scenarios. . .less than appealing."
100CP,Ultraviolet,My Hero Academia,"This Quirk gives the user the ability to see the ultraviolet light. This
allows the Quirk user to see colors that others can, enhance perception of certain chemicals
within their surroundings or locate objects in less than optimal conditions like certain insects
in the dark.
The utility in tracking and forensic analysis is not to be underestimated. The
downside is that it can’t be turned off, and the world wasn’t really designed for someone
with your eyes. You detect messes that others can’t see and that can be real gross.
Ignorance is bliss."
100CP,Urn Pell,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able generate ceramic from their body in the
form of plates, jars and other simple shapes and constructs.
With this Quirk, the user is able to protect themselves in ablative armor or make
heavy urns to collect water or simply crack enemies over the head.
Production of ceramics is mildly slow, taking minutes each, and seems to rely on the
Quirk user including copious amounts of olive oil in their diet. This means planning ahead of
time is a necessity."
100CP,Watchmaker,My Hero Academia,"This Quirk grants the user microscopic vision that can be used to
inspect whatever the user is looking at in extremely fine detail. If desired, the user would be
able to scan each individual pore on a target’s face, or observe microscopic organisms like
amoeba.
As an added benefit, the user has the ability to make excessively fine, controlled
movements for use in interacting with the details the user is able to observe.
Due to the nature of the ability, the user tunnel visions extremely hard when in use,
causing them to lose perspective even over things in front of their face. Takes a moment to
zoom in on features, requiring steady observation."
100CP,Water Balloon,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to alter the surface tension of liquids
within their surroundings and keep them that way. They’re able to leave the surface of a
liquid hard, rubbery, soft, velvety, even abrasive, or just return them to normal.
Inventive applications include literally walking on water, trapping someone in a
liquid jail by making it impossible to breach, even handle useful liquids like adhesives or
poisons by turning them into water balloon style projectiles and altering their properties at
the last second.
Being so reliant on outside resources can prove troublesome. The Quirk user’s
influence extends to the surface, not below, reducing their total options somewhat."
100CP,Weld,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to “weld"" inanimate objects together
seamlessly at the atomic level, binding them into a single object at the point of contact.
This Quirk allows the user to easily make repairs or fortifications simply by welding
things together without need of some form of adhesive or binder.
The Quirk cannot be activated unless the user is touching both desired objects when
attempting to weld them together, and cannot “un-weld"" something after welding it."
100CP,Zoom,My Hero Academia,"This Quirk allows the user to zoom with their eyes to see farther away with
greater detail and clarity, with a maximum range of 5 kilometers.
The user of this Quirk narrows their peripheral vision as they zoom, causing them to
potentially miss things readily apparent in their default line of sight while focused on
something far away."
100CP,Flight,X-Men Evolution,"Whether by granting you wings like an angel or something else under your own 
power, taking to the skies is now within your grasp. You move roughly at speeds that are the 
same as your running speed with the same endurance as well. "
100CP,Melding,X-Men Evolution,"You have the to ability meld with the surrounding surfaces to travel along them 
and assume their colors akin to a chameleon to blend into the environment perfectly. This does 
not mask your scent but everything else is fair game. "
100CP,Phasing,X-Men Evolution,"You have the ability to indefinitely phase through matter organic and inorganic 
alike at will and can solidify your body in an instant. This power can be granted to any object or 
person so long as you touch the object such as a train phasing it through another one."
100CP,Teleportation,X-Men Evolution,"You can teleport and spam it like there is no tomorrow with no danger to 
telefragging or being telefragged yourself. You can teleport objects along with you so long as 
you are touching them. The only limit at the beginning is a 2-mile radius and having prior 
knowledge of your location or sight of it. With time or training you’ll increase your radius, the 
amount of stuff you can carry, and can remove the line of sight necessity."
100CP,Toad,X-Men Evolution,"As the name implies you now have the abilities of a common toad you disgusting 
freak. The superhuman jumping abilities are neat though as you can leap over buildings in a 
single bound. Although your tongue is freakish as it can be extended to a maximum length of 
approximately 25-feet and can even grab objects. Your mouth can deaden your taste buds, is 
immune to anything you lick, and also secretes a slime that can be spat out. It wraps around 
people and dries instantly, incapacitating them unless they can break free. Finally, your hands 
and feet can ooze a sticky solution that allows you to stick and climb up walls or ceilings."
100CP,Angel Wings,X-Men the Claremont Years,"You possess a pair of
feathery wings sprouting from your back. These wings allow you to fly at a cruising
speed of approximately 70 mph, and a sustainable speed of more than twice that for some
time. To help you adapt to these wings you have hollow bones, and increased
musculature putting you near peak human in physical abilities, with aerial
maneuverability and reaction times beyond it. Barring drawbacks you may grow or
retract these wings at will taking time similar to changing between alt-forms.
For an additional -400 CP (discounted if this was) these wings are now techno-organic
constructs. With razor sharp and resilient enough to resist bullet fire, they provide
significantly greater speed and maneuverability, as well as being potent weapons and
shields in their own right. You may also launch feathers from these wings as metallic
flechettes, moving at high speeds with razor sharpness and coated with potent
neurotoxins which attack the nervous system to disable control of the body."
100CP,Cipher,X-Men the Claremont Years,"You are able to quickly decipher any written
or spoken language, whether those of living creatures or machines. By default this only
applies to written and spoken languages, like Doug Ramsay’s powers in this period.
For an additional -300 CP (discounted if this was) it now functions like Cipher’s powers
would eventually evolve outside of the scope of this jump and also applies to body
language and movements, allowing such feats as predicting an opponent’s movements in
combat by decoding their body’s motions, or being the ultimate reader of people’s poker
faces."
100CP,Hound,X-Men the Claremont Years,"You possess the ability to detect mutants out to a 25 mile range. You are able to differentiate known mutants with this
ability allowing you to track specific mutants. In future jumps this works for possessors
of biologically based superpowers, or some other specific species or genotype chosen at
the start of each jump (for example ‘people with type O blood’).
You may buy Wall Crawler and/or Brute Strength at a discount."
100CP,Mastery of Trajectories,X-Men the Claremont Years,"Like Cyclops you have an instinctive understanding of angles and trajectories, able to sense how something will
ricochet or move with a certain amount of force. This makes you a master at pool, and
pretty good with geometry.
If you bought this power discounted you may also discount Energy Blast. In addition if
you have both powers you can ricochet and bounce your energy blasts off of surfaces."
100CP,Wall-Crawler,X-Men the Claremont Years,"Like some sort of spider you have the ability to crawl along walls and even ceilings with ease. Maybe it’s due to
mutant fingers and toes which can grip these surfaces or something else. Whatever the
case, in addition to this wall-crawling ability you seem to be more agile and dexterous
than before, by default increasing you to peak human. Optionally this power comes with
a prehensile tail which can be used to grasp objects or even wield a sword."
100CP,Agelessness,Young Justice,"Like Vandal Savage, and his son Arion. You possess an endless
life span. As soon as you reach your physical prime, you will not age. Meaning you can
live for the next 50,000 years without aging a single day."
1200CP,Slot Machine,Generic Super Academy,"Not unlike a certain hero from Worm, you have the power to arbitrarily gain other 
powers. Or, as many would put it, you hit the superpower lottery jackpot. You have a limited 
number of slots that can be filled with random powers, and that take a short time to charge up to 
full strength once you fill those slots, and you slowly gain a better awareness of what the power 
can be used for as it charges up, with full awareness coming at full charge. If your current slots 
are filled and you want another power you must first give up a power in one of your filled slots, 
though you can easily recall powers that you’ve previously used, giving you virtually unmatched 
versatility when it comes to powers.  
You are not limited to only the powers seen in this jump. However your slots can’t be 
filled with general purpose powers, such as ​Versatile Power​, and while you can emulate the 
effects of Power Packages such as ​Mind Over Matter​ or ​Super Attribute ​groups you must 
devote an additional Slot to them. You obviously cannot fill a slot with another ​Slot Machine 
power. The tiers are not cumulative, you only receive the slots for the tier you purchase. 
At Street Tier you have two slots that can be filled with any “street tier” power, your 
powers take about seven minutes to charge up to full strength, and you have little control over 
what power you will gain beyond something at least somewhat tangentially related to what you 
were aiming for. 
At National Tier you have three slots that can be filled with any “national tier” or lower 
power, your powers take about five minutes to charge to full strength, and you have some 
control over what powers you gain. 
At Global Tier you have four slots that can be filled with any “global tier” or lower power, 
your powers take one to two minutes to charge to full strength, and the powers you gain are 
reliably close to what you were aiming for. 
At Cosmic Tier you have six slots that can be filled with any “cosmic tier” or lower power 
except Slot Machine or similar powers, however cosmic tier powers require two slots each. Your 
powers take only seconds to charge to full strength, and you have precision control over what 
powers you gain."
1400CP,SHAZAM!,Young Justice,"You can take on a divine form like Captain Marvel and Mary do by
saying the word ""SHAZAM,"" which grants you the powers of significant figures from
various Greco/Roman Mythologies. These powers alone make you a worthy adversary
against a full-grown Kryptonian.
● Wisdom of Solomon
● Strength of Hercules
● Stamina of Atlas
● Power of Zeus
● Courage of Achilles
● Speed of Mercury"
400,Brick,Marvel Age of Krakoa,"A pretty common power set, superhuman strength coupled
with superhuman durability. For 200 points you can lift ten tons, shrug off small caliber
gunfire at point-blank range, and withstand an explosion comparable to a frag grenade
going off in your chest. You can pay an extra 100 CP to increase both your strength and
toughness by a single order of magnitude, or an extra 200 to increase it by two orders of
magnitude."
300,Fireworks,Marvel Age of Krakoa,"This is one of two powers. The first, for 200 CP, is the ability
to generate small balls of plasma that explode with concussive force, ranging in size
from marbles to beach balls. At the smallest size, they’re virtually harmless, suitable for
pranks, while at the maximum size, they can take out trees. The other, for 300 CP, lets
you generate multicolored “sparks” of plasma that explode in more sparks. While
seemingly harmless, their intensities vary and at full power a blast with this power could
detonate matter at the subatomic level, releasing enough energy to obliterate everything
for several meters. You can buy both powers, but each counts as a separate purchase
when applying discounts."
300,Therianthrope,Marvel Age of Krakoa,"Choose an animal. You can now shift between your
normal form, the form of that animal, and a hybrid form that grants enhancements over
your default form appropriate to the animal in question. For an extra 100 CP, you gain
the ability to become a hivemind of five of your animal form as a fourth form."
2500,Elemental,Marvel Age of Krakoa,"This is a pretty freeform power. Choose one of the following: Air, Darkness, Earth, Fire, Force, Light, or Water. For 200 CP you have a
minor, specific version of the power. For example, someone with “Fire” might be able to
fire blasts of plasma or heat rays while someone with “Force” might be able to charge
objects with kinetic energy or create transparent force fields. You aren’t limited to
output, incidentally. You’re just as capable of choosing to absorb it, its properties, or
associated energies and then release it for a variety of purposes. Or instead of creating
merely manipulating what is already present. For 400 CP, you get all three, or
alternatively have only the one but with every possible form of that element and its
associated energies. For 600 CP, you can have both the whole element and all three
means of using it.
By default, this power starts at a rather small scale, range of line of sight, blasts
comparable to conventional artillery, absorbing small bits at a time, or shaping up to
your own mass or volume in matter/energy, but it can be trained up with time and
effort. Or you could just pay an extra 200 CP to scale your area of control up to the size
of a small city, the potency of your blasts up to advanced modern siege weapons, or wide
area demolitions. Or 400 to give yourself a range comparable to a small country and an
output comparable to a “tactical” weapon of mass destruction with a comparable ability
to absorb or manipulate. Or 600 CP to give yourself planetary range and potential
energy output and/or corresponding ability to absorb or manipulate to match. Please
don’t freeze and/or immolate the Earth. Just because you can doesn’t mean you should.
Upgrades in this section are mutually exclusive, you cannot buy all three versions for
stacking benefits.
For an extra 200 CP, you can gain the ability to generate any necessary “baggage” for
your powers to work, like Oxygen or other gasses for a fire user. A separate Extra 200
CP will let you have a “hybrid” element, for example combining Earth and Fire to get
Magma, which will also give you control over the appropriate forms of the base elements
for free but to a lesser extent.
You can purchase more than one element, but each discrete element is a separate
purchase for the sake of discounts.
Finally, for a flat 2500 CP, you can skip the bookkeeping and effectively gain every
Element with a full suite of upgrades, plus the ability to generate, absorb and
manipulate literally any kind of energy, including cosmic energy and the energy of other
superhumans. You won’t be able to use them all to that level immediately, when it
comes to output and manipulation one or two will come more easily than
others—Gabriel summers, on whom this power is based, tends to default to variations of
heat and flame and sometimes lasers—but time and effort will let you reach that level
with every form of every element and combination thereof and energy in general. This
last option is mutually exclusive with any other purchase of this power.
A purchase of this power discounts an appropriate purchase of the Non-Living Form
power."
2000,Telepathy,Marvel Age of Krakoa,"One of the most common powers among mutants,
telepathy is the ability to extend your thoughts and feelings beyond yourself to interact
with the world around you. For 200 CP, choose a single form of telepathy from the
following: Traditional telepathic abilities such as mind reading or memory alteration,
psychic constructs such Psi-Lock’s blades which leave no physical damage but inflict
numbness or phantom pain, technopathic traits like controlling or communicating
remotely with electronics, empathic abilities like sensing or influencing the emotions of
others, or psychic illusions that let you project images on empty space or influences the
senses and perceptions of others. You possess that ability with a maximum range of line
of sight. The effects you can produce are weak at the start but can be steadily expanded
with time and training. For an additional 200 CP, you can purchase an additional form
of telepathy, or upgrade your starting range in one form to the size of a small city while
increasing the potency of the effects you can manage. An additional 200 CP on top of a
previous upgrade to range and potency will expand your range to cover a significant
portion of a continent and produce masterful effects on a large number of targets.
Another 200 CP on top of that will give you a planetary range and allow you to affect
every target in range. Upgrades to range apply only to a single application, but no matter
how many upgrades or applications you possess it only counts as a single purpose for
the sake of discounts. Purchasing all forms of telepathic abilities at the planetary scale is
cut to a flat 2000 CP, however."
1000,Telekinesis,Marvel Age of Krakoa,"Mind over matter, an iconic power. For 200 CP you
can lift solid objects, move them around, and throw them with great force using only
your mind within a range of your line of sight. You start out small, maybe something
with the mass and volume of a can of soda, but this ability scales up fast with practice,
and with time you’ll be able to levitate, blast cars off the road, juggle dozens of objects,
or catch bullets as long as you know they’re coming. For 400 CP you start with that level
of skill and power as well as a range comparable to a small city and enough of a soft
touch to manipulate liquids and gasses while retaining the ability to train your powers
up to greater heights. For 600 CP you start with a range comparable to a major
metropolitan area, and your control becomes precise enough to manipulate matter on a
molecular level and manipulate energy. At this point, you may be able to pass yourself
off as a minor reality warper by reshaping matter or else imitating other powers like
falsifying superhuman strength or toughness with tactile telekinesis, or redirecting
blasts of lighting, or starting fires by pumping energy into a substance while exciting
their molecules. With practice, you may be able to make solid constructs out of psychic
energy. For 800 CP your range becomes akin to a small nation and you gain the ability
to manipulate matter and energy at the atomic level. As an example of what you may be
capable of, Charles Xavier was once murdered by a sniper’s bullet to his brain, and the
telekinetic Exodus brought him back to life by putting every single atom that used to be
part of his head exactly where they were before he was shot. For 1000 CP, your
maximum range is planetary, and your control of matter and energy reaches down to the
smallest levels conceivable. At this level knowledge of quantum mechanics might help
you get the most out of your powers."
400,Organically Inorganic,Avengers Vs X-Men,"You have the ability to take on a different state of being at will, transforming your body into an
organic inanimate material of some kind, such as diamond like Emma Frost or metal like Colossus,
though this may not include special metals such as Adamantium or Uru. In this form, you have
greatly enhanced physical abilities, enough to lift several tonnes and run at the speed of most cars.
Your stamina becomes effectively limitless and you have no need for rest or food. You do not need
to breathe and you become immune to psionic powers that target your mind while in this form. Your
durability is the most impressive aspect, as even a being as strong as the Hulk would require an
extended beat down to begin to damage your form, as well as being extremely resistant to both temperature extremes.
By paying an additional 200 points, you can also gain vastly enhanced physical strength, like Colossus
has, that enables him to go toe to toe with the average incarnation of the Hulk or even briefly
holding back the original Juggernaut, though not defeating him. This strength also results in greatly
enhanced speed and jumping ability, though you can get pretty destructive when going all out.
Non-Mutants may purchase this power at either tier, such as Mettle or The Thing having similar
powers. The price remains the same."
400,Light & Dark,Marvel's Kid Heroes,"You have a number of abilities relating to “light” or life-force. Within
you is either a font of unending light or a bottomless abyss of
darkness. If the former, you can gently channel this light into
people to heal them, or form blades that when stabbed or thrown
into a person stuns them. If the latter, you can transform your
body into a hole in existence, where people fall and their light
is consumed as they experience terrible nightmares. You can
pull yourself and others into and through this space as a form
of teleportation. If you choose Light, you must have a way of venting large
amounts of your Light, lest it overpowers and kill you. If
Darkness, you must feed on the light of others regularly, lest
you be yourself consumed. Or you can pay double points for both,
and become totally self-sufﬁcient with the added bonus of
being able to protect people from the dark when transporting
them."
400,Love & Fear,Marvel's Kid Heroes,"You can show people either what they love, or fear, most of all.
Either with an illusion or by physical transformation. For
double points, you can manifest both desire and terror."
200CP,Beast Man,Avengers Vs X-Men,"One of the many beast men mutants found in the world. You’ve taken on the traits of one animal of
choice, enhanced to superhuman degrees. A monkey would be able to lift dozens of tonnes of
weight and move with speed and agility to outpace any natural animal with ease, similar to the X
Men’s famed beast. A toad would share such agility but have strange tongue and slime based
abilities. Whatever the case, your body will naturally heal at a much faster pace, even broken bones
and serious cuts healing up in days of rest, and will periodically undergo additional mutations that
somewhat enhance your existing animalistic abilities, grant new ones connected to the animal you
are based on or even grant a new animal to draw on traits from. Such transformations happen every
few years, provided you use your abilities often."
200CP,Cry Havok,Avengers Vs X-Men,"The energy of the cosmos is a part of your very cells. You absorb cosmic energy passively around you
at all times, slowly siphoning the limitless energy of the universe into your body, where it is stored
and able to be unleashed at your will, creating either enormously strong concussive blasts or beams
of super hot plasma that vaporise most things in their path. The more energy you have stored, the
more powerful your energy attacks will be as they drain more and more from your stores, at full
storage you could at least equal Cyclops’ in destructive power. You can also absorb any other form
of energy outside of the universal energy you passively absorb, with no real upper limit in a
temporary form. Being thrown into a star would be an astonishingly poor idea on your enemies’
behalf. Your long term storage is not without limit however and you reach that limit with passive
absorption every 16 hours. Going over your limit will not harm you but it will result in the energy
leaking out of your body in destructive bursts unless you consciously control it with greater and
greater effort. You may absorb more than your normal capacity and control it for a short time, such
as absorbing very high power energy attacks to throw them back at the enemy, but more than a few
seconds results in the uncontrolled bursts described above."
200CP,Cyclopean,Avengers Vs X-Men,"Your eyes have gained a connection to a plane of seemingly infinite energy, able to let out that
energy in the form of immensely powerful blasts. These laser-like beams of energy are long ranged
and powerful, able to destroy large areas of land quickly and even slightly harm beings like the Hulk,
but they are uncontrolled. You are currently unable to open your eyes without firing these blasts and
so a set of special glasses and visors have been provided that let you open your eyes without firing
the energy. You yourself are immune to the energy you fire and, with time or external
experimentation, can eventually learn to control your beams of energy after firing them or increase
the power further. You may choose whether your beams draw on concussive force like Cyclops’ or
some other energy of equivalent power, such as heat beams or beams of cold."
200CP,Domino,Avengers Vs X-Men,"Through an extremely subtle and unconscious telekinetic power, you find that probability works in
your favour to near impossible levels.This power only works when you take action, standing in front
of a firing squad without moving will kill you as normal, but taking action has an enormous effect.
Even attempting to dodge that firing squad will result in you dodging every bullet with perfect
movements, even if you were untrained and no faster than a normal person, or even each bullet
bouncing off of each other to take out the firing squad with their own shots. Lightning bolts striking
your enemies, pressing the correct combination on a massive digital lock on your first try,
unnaturally lucky blows against your foes and absurdly unlikely malfunctions or slip ups from your
enemies. You’re one of the most dangerous people in the world and if you put in a very great deal of
effort and time, you could learn to start to control this lucky effect."
200CP,Kinetic Battery,Avengers Vs X-Men,"A simple battery but one far more effective than light or sound or heat when applied with the
intelligent mind of a trained mutant. Like the Black King Shaw, you have the ability to absorb kinetic
energy, and any form of energy from heat to magic but kinetic energy is most efficient, and use the
absorbed energy to temporarily increase your power in other aspects. Making yourself stronger,
faster and tougher is simple, while your body will naturally heal faster, restore you to your youth and
replenish your energy as you absorb outside energy. It is extremely difficult to harm you with kinetic
attacks, as you absorb the energy of those attacks as they hit you, and most other attacks that rely
on lots of energy are similarly weakened or negated. It is possible to surpass your rate of draining
with enough power however, such as the full power of beings like the Hulk."
200CP,Living Sun,Avengers Vs X-Men,"You are a living solar battery like Sunspot, draining in all light, heat and fire that you come into
contact with and storing it within you. While this drain is constant and passive, resulting in your body
being cloaked in darkness at all times, the energy you drain can be re-channeled into new purposes.
Increasing your physical abilities, flying at high speed, producing and controlling heat or fire or light
and even firing blasts of raw kinetic energy. It is nigh impossible to harm you with fire or light, as
your body has an enormous absorption rate, and this energy also supplies all your vital functions."
200CP,Spider Person,Avengers Vs X-Men,"From a radioactive spider or genetic experiments or something weirder still, you’ve joined the ranks
of the Spider People. There are two ways you can choose to have this animal-linked power manifest
but each way shares certain benefits. Super strength, enough to lift 5 or more tonnes, incredible
agility and speed, the ability to crawl on walls like a spider or bend and flex more than any human
could imagine doing, enhanced healing abilities and a very powerful immune system. The Spider-
Man basic package. You can choose to either go deeper in on the Spider Man side, taking on his
famed Spider Sense and gaining access to a similar suit to his during this time period and a wide
variety of handy spider-gadgets. Or you can focus more towards Spider Woman, giving up the

advantage of technology and gaining several new abilities, such as discharging strong electrical blasts
from your hands, gliding through the air at will, enhanced senses of hearing and the ability to secrete
pheromones that influence the emotions of those around you. Either ability costs the same."
200CP,Super Soldier,Avengers Vs X-Men,"Whether it be the original Super Soldier serum or the Heart Shaped Herb, you’ve been made a man
that stands above all other men. Every attribute of your natural human body has been increased to
the very peak of human ability. Strength, Agility, Stamina, Reflexes, Healing and more. In fact, many
may confuse your abilities as that of a low level Superhuman, forgetting how far a normal human
can come in this world. To go along with your powers, you have received extensive military and
athletic training, making you a very dangerous combatant in a fight and extremely skilled military
operator. If you choose to have the Super Soldier serum, you may choose to have served alongside
the original Captain America or even have temporarily taken up the mantle in the past. With the
Heart Shaped Herb, you can be of T’Challa’s line and have officially worn the Black Panther title at
one point, though not presently.
Alternatively, you can choose to undergo the Burstein process, the same procedure that gave Luke
Cage his powers. While you won’t gain the military training with this option, you do gain far greater
physical abilities. You’ll easily lift upwards of 50 tonnes into the air and grow even stronger now and
then, along with possessing a body so hard bullets will bounce off you and even a few hundred kilos
of explosives won’t bother you much.
You can buy one, two or all three options presented here and they will stack with each other,
excluding the training. That you only get once."
200CP,Superior Being,Avengers Vs X-Men,"Sometimes the simplest way really is the best way. Similar to Warpath, you lack any strange abilities.
Instead, your raw physical abilities are all far beyond the normal human level and grow even more so
in time. Your strength is enough to lift twenty tonnes with ease, you have the speed to outrace any
ordinary land vehicle, stamina to fight for days, incredible agility, reflexes and senses of sight and
sound. Even brutal injuries can be healed in hours, like being crushed by a massive cyborg horse. You
can also fly, even if that doesn’t really make sense, at supersonic speeds. All your capabilities slowly
but steadily grow over time. With enough time, Warpath was once able to tangle with the Hulk
himself in strength."
200CP,The Wolverine,Avengers Vs X-Men,"Like your namesake, you’ve taken on powers befitting a fierce and relentless hunter. Your healing
factor is the stuff of legends, capable of bringing you back from being reduced to a mere skeleton in
just minutes, healing missing limbs and organs, keeping you young and in your prime for centuries,
even reverting magical transformations like that of lycanthropy or vampirism. You have superhuman
physical abilities, primarily focused on your speed and agility, though no normal human could hope
to match your strength and your senses are all heightened to far beyond the human norm. Much like
Wolverine, your skeleton has been covered in Adamantium, including the long bone claws that you
can extend from your knuckles at will, making your bones almost unbreakable and your claws able to
cut through nearly anything."
200CP,Knowing Yourself is the Beginning of all Wisdom,Batman Arkham Knight,"Some might not call being gifted with the hands of a surgeon to be a power in and of itself.
However, those who see you at work might disagree. Your skills are nigh-unmatched when it
comes to the operating theater, capable of feats such as healing the spine of a man who would
otherwise never walk again, giving a mute back his voice, and turning a half-burned nightmare
into a regular face. However, those are merely paltry applications of your skill. If you wished,
you could apply your skills to yourself just as easily as you can others, perhaps give yourself an
entirely new face, or even copy someone else’s, modify your vocal chords to sound entirely
different, and effectively become a new person. There is, however, a singular flaw in your skill.
You have difficulty replicating entirely unique features you cannot access. Fingerprints, eyes,
patterns of speech… those are beyond you to replace without access to the original. But save
for that… well… your skills are matched by only one in this world."
200CP,Concealment,City of Heroes,"At first you'll learn the ability to hide yourself a little better and perhaps how to hide others. When you 
master this power set you'll be able to phase for short amounts of time at high energy costs and have full 
invisibility for a great deal of concentration."
200CP,Flight,City of Heroes,"In City of Heroes, flight isn't very impressively fast, however it does allow a great deal more control than 
most other travel powers. Advancing this power set allows you to grant flight to nearby allies and pull off 
aerial attacks and maneuvers that you wouldn't otherwise know. If you already know how to fly, consider 
this power set the ability to master the art of combat flight."
200CP,Leaping,City of Heroes,"You gain the ability to leap over buildings in a single bound and to also change course slightly while in 
mid-air. On top of being able to leap, you also gain knowledge to apply your acrobatics and jumping in 
combat, bouncing off walls into a serious head butt or dropping from the sky to Goomba Stomp enemy's skulls."
200CP,Speed,City of Heroes,"You gain the ability to run at 200 mph and the ability to work with that speed. Should you choose to 
spend a greater deal of energy, you can attack twice as fast as you normally could or whip yourself up into 
an actual tornado, sending foes flying left and right. While you have decent control with this speed now, 
adding more reflexes would do wonders."
200CP,Teleporation,City of Heroes,"One of the true fastest ways to travel, you can teleport hundreds of yards away as long as you can see 
where you'll end up. Further more, you'll soon gain the ability to teleport friend and foe alike, even calling 
eight willing allies to your side with one simple maneuver."
200CP,Enhanced Healing,Generic Super Academy,"Like it says on the tin, you’ve got a healing factor. What precisely it can do and restore 
depends on the tier, but regardless of what type you have you age gracefully, and can expect to 
live for hundreds of years at least. 
At Street Tier you’ve got a healing factor capable of recovering even from severe injury 
in no more than a day, and you can recover from minor injuries in a few minutes. 
At National Tier you can recover even from critical injuries in an hour or so, and minor 
injuries heal so fast you can visibly see the wounds mending. 
At Global Tier you have full on regeneration, and can replace even missing limbs in a 
matter of minutes. Losing your head or your brain will neither kill you nor impare your memories, 
and you could regenerate even from a single drop of blood. You’d need to be completely 
atomized in one go for someone to be sure that they killed you. 
At Cosmic Tier you regenerate all wounds effectively instantly, and you can not be killed 
by purely mundane methods. Only truly potent effects, powers, and abilities have any hope of 
killing you for sure, such as powerful god-slaying weapons, Cosmic powers based around 
destroying things, or similar such extreme methods of destruction. "
200CP,Inviolate Mind,Generic Super Academy,"Your mind belongs to you and no other, and any that would attempt to gainsay this are in 
for a very rude surprise as your mind actively rebuffs them. 
At Street Tier you are highly resistant to attempts to mentally control you, attempts to 
read your mind can be resisted with an active effort, and supernaturally boosted attempts at 
persuasion are less likely to work on you. 
At National Tier attempts to read, control, or contact your mind against your will face a 
tremendous uphill struggle, and those using supernaturally persuasive arguments find that even 
the most silver-tongued devils have trouble when it comes to talking you into doing things to your detriment. 
At Global Tier you are completely immune to attempts to mentally dominate, control, or 
contact you against your will. Those that use supernaturally boosted persuasion are equally 
stymied, being forced to rely on simple mundane arguments against you as anything beyond 
that flatly fails to work. At this level you cannot be located or tracked via detecting your mind, 
whether by its presence or absence. You are also immune to memetic effects or the maddening effects of eldritch beings. 
At Cosmic Tier you have everything in the Global Tier, except now you also reflect such 
attempts back at the person that made them. Those that try to mentally dominate you find their 
own powers falling upon them, those that try to contact or read your mind find you have now 
contacted and read theirs, and those that use supernatural methods to boost their powers of 
persuasion find their own arguments and words flying back in their faces."
200CP,Pocket Dimensions,Generic Super Academy,"You have the ability to create personal dimensional spaces. These spaces are protected 
from outside interference, but a sufficiently powerful dimensional effect or traveller might be able 
to breach such a protection. 
At Street Tier you effectively have a personal inventory, similar to a video game. Nothing 
can be placed inside that is larger than your own body mass, but an unlimited amount of such 
items can be stored. You always know what is in your inventory and can always pull out exactly 
what you desire. Items stored in this Inventory are in stasis and nothing living can be placed inside it. 
At National Tier you can create additional spaces like your Inventory, either anchored in 
place or attached to another person or even an object. You can designate who can access 
these spaces, which can be specific people or can include various conditions to be allowed 
access. The contents of these spaces are still in stasis and restricted to non-living objects. 
At Global Tier your Pocket Dimensions go from simple storage to small worlds. They can 
be no larger than a large city, and the environment inside can be shaped as you wish, including 
the creation of non-sapient lifeforms that are restricted to this pocket world and are under your 
control. Living beings can now be allowed to enter these worlds and you can either attach the 
world to yourself or anchor it in a manner similar to the National Tier spaces. Physical laws in 
these worlds are effectively identical to the outside world. If you enter a world attached to you, 
you will be in the same place when you exit it, barring the use of other dimensional travel powers. 
At Cosmic Tier you can create a full size dimension, play with the physical laws inside as 
you wish, grant other people similar though lesser control over the dimension or do pretty much 
anything else inside your dimension. You are effectively the God of this personal dimension. 
You are limited to only one of these dimensions, but can still create the lesser worlds."
200CP,Specific Immunity,Generic Super Academy,"You are completely immune to harm or negative effects from a specific source or type. 
This could be a particular element, attacks from a specific species, or type of effect such as 
being knocked back or tripped. This can be taken multiple times, but you cannot take multiple 
Specific Immunities that combine into complete invulnerability.. 
At Street Tier this protects from a single element such as fire or cold. It could make you 
immune to being tripped or thrown off your feet. 
At National Tier you could be immune to attacks from the “classical” four elements or 
similar groupings. You could be immune to any form of firearms or to explosions, or to disease or poison. 
At Global Tier you can be immune to large categories of effects, like magic, technology, 
or psychic powers. You could be immune to all kinetic attacks, all biological attacks. You could 
even pull off a classic “No man born of woman can harm me” protection. 
At Cosmic Level you could be immune to divine attacks, or non-divine attacks. You could 
be fully immune to all physical attacks or all mental attacks, or even conceptual attacks."
200CP,Super (Re)Size Me,Generic Super Academy,"You have the power to either grow to extreme heights, or shrink to incredibly small 
scales. For those that grow larger their strength, durability, and speed increase proportionally to 
their height, whereas for those that grow smaller their physical stats remain just as effective as 
they would be when they are their normal size. Either way both types of power ignore the 
square-cube law, and equipment worn or carried resizes with the user. You may purchase this 
power a second time to have both options. 
At Street Tier you could grow to around sixty feet tall, able to easily lift and throw cars, or 
shrink down to only a few inches. 
At National Tier you could grow to a few hundred feet tall, your strength enough to easily 
smash buildings, and potentially break the sound barrier while sprinting… with catastrophic 
effects on your surroundings. You could alternatively shrink down to only a fraction of an inch 
tall, comparable in size to some forms of extremely small insects. 
At Global Tier you could potentially grow to thousands of feet tall, with proportionately 
increased physical abilities. At this level it is likely you will cause considerable destruction to 
your surroundings if you aren’t careful. Alternatively you could shrink down to the size of an 
atom, though the world would likely be near unrecognizable to you at that size. 
At Cosmic Tier you could potentially grow in size large enough to crush a city 
underneath your boots, and could cause catastrophic damage with even your smallest 
movements, an exhalation from you being more akin to hurricane force winds than anything 
else. If you can shrink you instead could go down all the way to the femto scale, so small as to 
be undetectable to anything short of Cosmic senses, and who knows what you might 
experience or discover at such a tiny size."
200CP,Super Stretch,Generic Super Academy,"Like Stretch Armstrong himself you have the ability to stretch your limbs and body into all 
sorts of normally impossible shapes, sizes, and lengths. 
At Street Tier you could stretch your arm across a street, have increased resistance to 
blunt force trauma, and could easily contort yourself to fit through spaces far smaller than would 
be possible for a normal person. 
At National Tier you’ve basically got the same stretching abilities as Mr. Fantastic 
himself, able to stretch over the length of a football field with each limb, have huge resistance to 
blunt force trauma, and can fit through impossibly small spaces for a human. 
At Global Level you’re just as good as Plastic Man himself, able to stretch over truly 
massive distances, have near immunity to blunt force trauma, and at this point the plasticity of 
your body has reached the point you could achieve practical shapeshifting, though your 
coloration won’t change and you don’t really take on the properties of the things you transform 
into beyond the most simplistic of mechanical benefits (such as a propeller plane). 
At Cosmic Tier you could potentially envelop an entire world with how far you can 
stretch, and are immune to the negative effects of blunt force trauma. Your body is so pliable 
you could take effectively any shape, including that of complex mechanisms that have actual 
mechanical benefits (such as a gun that actually works as a gun) if, of course, you had the 
requisite knowledge of that mechanism."
200CP,Bolts of Fury,Kingdom Come,"You have the force of a power plant pulsing through your whole body, able to turn into lightning itself.
Powering electronic devices is a simple task for you, and you can kill a human with only a small amount of
the force of electricity that flows through you. But you can also use it to stun living things with only a blast,
create force field bubbles, and produce literal black lightning empowered by your fury, and you can also
produce a lightning storm. An electric force field that blankets your body (But can be taken away) at all
times that absorbs the force of bullets, rendering them harmless onto you."
200CP,Self-Molecular Rearranging,Kingdom Come,"You have super strength, and the ability to rearrange your own molecular structure. Making yourself
lighter or heavier or changing your height is possible with your abilities, and your strength grows and
shrinks with your height. Right now this is the only way to increase your strength, but maybe if you’re
smart you could think of other ways to increase your strength without needing to become bigger. You
have no theoretical limit to what you can grow or shrink, but 60 feet is the maximum height you can
maintain for a significant amount of time as of your current mastery of this ability. Further training is
needed to expand it. You can also manipulate your molecular structure to let you phase through walls as
well, in case you need to sneak somewhere instead of punching holes in walls.
You could also extend this ability to shift between the different states of matter, but to enter the state of
plasma will require an external energy source other than what this power provides. Furthermore,
changing your state of matter is past your current mastery of this ability, and becoming plasma is a state
of matter that has to be achieved separately past the other states of matter."
200CP,Shadow Manipulation,Kingdom Come,"You can manipulate shadows, merging with your own to slide across the ground or fly in the air and
possessing the shadows of others. You can also grow to a huge size as a shadow and create physical
items and shapes in a way similar to that of the Green Lantern ring. Your body also resists antimatter to a
degree as well, thanks to your exposure to the Shadowlands.
You also have telepathic abilities to a minor degree, able to speak in the minds of others and have them
reply back. No mind control, for one exception. You can make someone see the depths of their evil side.
All their horrifying thoughts, desires, and dreams. This could drive them to the brink out of remorse and
regret for their actions, or horrifically traumatize them. Or both."
200CP,Super Senses,Kingdom Come,"You’re not as strong as Superman or as fast as him...but you are his equal in one respect. You posses
super senses of his strength. Not only that, you’re able to freely dull or focus them if they become too
overwhelming. You’re able to hear clouds scrape together, to see tiny bacteria squirm on the ground,
heart the heartbeat of a man over half the world away, and other such wild feats thanks to your super
senses. But your senses are different from Superman in one respect--you have a sense for magic. You
can see and feel magic, and identify it. The strength and what sort of magic it is. You’ll have to gain
knowledge of magic to sense it, but that’s a nice ability still."
200CP,Wind Powers,Kingdom Come,"People will go on and on about how weak wind manipulation is, until they’re on the ground choking to
death and their mighty jets helplessly rolling in the winds at your mercy. Creating a hurricane is as easy
as breathing with your power. Your entire body can turn into wind, and carries all the immunities it implies.
You could level a building in seconds at the 350 miles per hour winds at your control. But unlike Red
Tornado, you have no android body.
But you can turn into wind to compensate. To harm you would be like harming the wind with all the futility
it implies, and you cannot be moved in this state except through your own will. People cannot use fans or
any other way to control your movements. You are an unstoppable force, and they will kneel to you. You
could also separate your windy self and escape through any cracks in this form, or turn parts of your body
into the wind. Become the greatest tornado of their nightmares."
200CP,Botanical Evolution,Marvel Age of Krakoa,"Whenever you’re injured, you heal back composed of
plants fungi, algae or moss, lichens, or similar things adapted to resist that type of
damage or otherwise create some small improvement.  The faster you can heal, the
faster this happens. The adaptions scale to what happened and are relatively minor to
start, unless a significant portion of your body is destroyed you won’t see more than
negligible improvement from any one instance of this, but adaptations stack on top of
each other and can snowball quickly: Over the course of billions of years the thresholder
Grove became the living continent Okkara and when killed her remains regenerated into
Krakoa and Arakko the living Islands. Rarely you may develop new abilities from this,
like Krakoa’s ability to control the properties of the plants and fungi it is composed of
and alter their growth at will or its ability to feed on psychic energy. Since you’re paying
CP for this, you can revert from your botanical form and return to it at will and limit its
size or how inhuman it becomes, if you aren’t interested in being a kaiju or genius locus,
and suppress any inconvenient adaptions until they’re needed. Even if your entire
nervous system is destroyed and replaced, you will still be you with full continuity of
memory, personality, cognition, and existence, and your botanical form and its
component organisms will contain your original self’s biological information and all of
its traits. You can control the cosmetics of your botanical form, and adaptions are saved
and automatically applied when other body parts are damaged.
Best of Both Kingdoms (100 CP, Required Botanical Evolution): Rather than
have a separate Botanical Form, you have a single form that combines the best traits of
your Botanical state and whatever you’d be without this power. You retain the ability to
appear “normal” at will, but other than factors of size or deviations in body plan this is
purely cosmetic with you retaining any adaptions you did not suppress and you can
manifest aspects of one form while in the other at will."
200CP,Cyberpathy,Marvel Age of Krakoa,"Your brain combines the best features of an organic brain and a
highly advanced supercomputer. This doesn't make you “smarter” per se, but it does
mean that you can store and perfectly recall an infinite amount of information without it
being distorted, process far more information from your senses than you otherwise
could, perform strenuous mental tasks for longer, and think at far faster speeds—twenty
times peak human at a minimum. The exact benefit scales up with your intellect and
combines synergistically with any and every other mental enhancement you might
possess."
200CP,Explodey,Marvel Age of Krakoa,"You have the power to generate fiery explosions centered on
yourself, with a radius of a few meters and power comparable to a conventional
incendiary explosive. You’re immune to the heat and force of your own explosions."
200CP,Aftershock,Marvel's Kid Heroes,"You can generate large amounts of electricity, and absorb the same. Toss around
electric blasts, give anyone grabbing you a bad time, even turn
into a person made of electricity to arc short distances or run
yourself through wires or metal surfaces, which you can also
stick to."
200CP,Aftershock,Marvel's Kid Heroes,"You can generate large amounts of electricity, and absorb the same. Toss around
electric blasts, give anyone grabbing you a bad time, even turn
into a person made of electricity to arc short distances or run
yourself through wires or metal surfaces, which you can also
stick to."
200CP,Brick & Mortar,Marvel's Kid Heroes,"You can turn into a person made of concrete, but can decide at any given moment how solid or liquid any part of it is."
200CP,Energy,Marvel's Kid Heroes,"You can disintegrate things and absorb some energy from them, glowing brighter and
brighter as you do so. With a charge, you can ﬁre power-balls
from your torso which arc however you’d like at launch and
explode on impact. Since a power-ball would be fantastically
lethal against a human target, you can instead ﬁre off multiple
smaller power-balls that only stun. You can even learn to ﬁre
off a power-ball that explodes into dozens of little stunners.
Finally, you can power up by absorbing energy straight. There
is an upper limit to how much you can absorb, after which you
cannot disintegrate things, and absorbing more energy would
cause you to bulk up, destabilize and eventually explode unless
you vent some of the power."
200CP,Hardball,Marvel's Kid Heroes,"You can create spherical forceﬁelds of varying size within a
relatively short range. You could give yourself boxing gloves,
or protect you or a few people nearby. You can also create
electromagnetic balls that disrupt electronics."
200CP,Human Torch,Marvel's Kid Heroes,"You can engulf your body in ﬂames, then ﬂy, and create ﬁreblasts, ﬁreballs and
very simple pyrokinetic constructs. You absorb heat
automatically and cannot be injured by it."
200CP,Ice Guys Finish First!,Marvel's Kid Heroes,"You have cyrokinetic powers letting you create ice and snow, to freeze things over a wide
area, even become a person made of ice."
200CP,Loa,Marvel's Kid Heroes,"You disrupt matter, allowing you to pass through.
Like the phasing, but things you pass through crumble to dust
right after."
200CP,Phasing,Marvel's Kid Heroes,"You can turn intangible, and apply this effect to a couple of people you’re touching. In this
state you can ﬂoat. Passing through electrical systems causes
them to short out, and you can wipe hard-drives this way."
200CP,Acid,My Hero Academia,"Acid allows the Quirk User to produce corrosive fluids from their skin,
adjusting its solubility, viscosity and acidity. This acid is strong enough to melt through steel
and stone at max.
The properties of this fluid can allow it to take both glue or lubricant, and even so
viscous it can form a temporary yet powerful wall. On the downside, it may melt your
clothes or other things it touches you don’t wish to melt if you aren’t careful."
200CP,Animal Mimicry,My Hero Academia,"The one born with this type of Quirk has an appearance, traits
and abilities based on an animal in the natural world, one you may choose upon purchase.
The various special abilities bestowed upon the one with this Quirk vary based on
animal selected, tending to be exaggerations of that animal’s natural abilities taken to the
next level.
Examples of such would be a Frog Human with a powerful extending tongue, wall
crawling, camouflage, super jumping and super swimming abilities.
Another example would be an Orca Human which would have great strength and
durability, as well as the power to emit concussive sound blasts.
The major limitations of this Quirk are based on the animal selected, but usually
severe. Aquatic Animal Humans need to keep hydrated for their own health way more than
other, while cold blooded animals often become extremely lethargic and weak in the cold."
200CP,Assault,My Hero Academia,"A simple Quirk, this one allows the user to increase the speed and power
of their punches. Scaling off of the initial power of your punch, even a weakling could
pulverize brick with a single bullet fast blow. Those who work on power and form will see
incredible gains in return.
Outside of the destructive potential of the user’s arms, the rest of their body lacks
the offensive presence and protection, opening up potential for brutal counters."
200CP,Black Cat,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk causes a target to generate a pulling/weakening
field in a cylinder pointed up around them after tripping them as they walk or run and
making them fall.
This field makes it appear as if the target has been given bad luck, as random
miscellaneous close to them or above them get pulled their way, such as statues or branches,
and can make projectiles fired at them drawn in, causing them to be more accurate and hard
hitting.
The weakening field isn’t very strong by comparison, but puts enough stress on
supports like nails, rope and otherwise that the first effect can break them and make things
fail for or around the target.
The user of this Quirk, besides the strange activation method, is also limited by
minor backlash the longer they keep their Quirk active. Like karmic backlash, they’ll develop
the same effects over time until deactivating the Quirk."
200CP,Blood Knight,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user has minor regeneration and heightened blood
regeneration that allows them to lose multiple times the blood that would be lethal to any
normal human. Additionally, it holds unique coagulation properties.
Whenever the Quirk user is injured to the point of drawing blood, their blood
instantly spreads and coagulates in the form of flexible plate armor. The more the Quirk user
is injured, the more seriously they’re injured, the more armor of blood they’ll gain making
them harder to hurt.
At the moment the user is wounded and the blood first starts to coagulate, it still
has the capacity to block small arms fire before hardening into a much more protective state.
Attacks powerful enough to push through before the armor fully hardens can brutally harm
the user before their protection goes up."
200CP,Brainwashing,My Hero Academia,"While you are willing it, anyone who verbally responds to you will
have their body fall under your complete control, forced to do what you say.
Refusing or being unable to respond to you allows them to avoid the effect, and the
effect may be broken by a sudden great deal of pain. Victims are vaguely aware they’re
being controlled."
200CP,Brick,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user has a more powerful and efficient physiology compared to
the average man or woman. Musculature weaving, bone structure alteration, there are a
number of complexities, though in basic terms it means they’re much stronger, faster,
tougher and enduring than others.
The Quirk user could throw cars through the air, outrun them on the interstate, and
just feel pretty sore if they actually got run over. The Quirk user has a higher metabolism,
requiring them to eat more than others. Takes active practice to reign in their strength for
delicate work."
200CP,Cement,My Hero Academia,"This Quirk gives power over cement and cement-like materials simply by
being in contact with them, able to exert a great deal of control over a large quantity of
material at once.
The user of this Quirk is able to even expand, grow or repair the materials they’re
using as well. While powerful and convenient in urban settings, this Quirk falls off hard in
places lacking in concrete."
200CP,Clones,My Hero Academia,"This Quirk allows the user to expel glowing, ectoplasm-like slime that can
then be transformed into clones of the user. The user can either create numerous clones of
the same size as the user or expend more ectoplasm to make bigger clones.
The number limit is normally in the tens for same size clones, but can fluctuate
depending on mood. A good mood increases the number a bit, while a bad mood decreases
the number a bit."
200CP,Dead Zone,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user is able to reduce the electrical conductivity of
everything in the area around them down to zero. This effectively applies nigh immunity to
lightning and other forms of electrical damage to the user and others in the area while in
effect.
Electronics and other electricity reliant objects in the area will also shut down while
the Quirk is active, of course. The user can extend or contract the dead zone to the
maximum range of around half a kilometer or down to just the user’s body.
Dead Zone doesn’t penetrate living beings, unable to shut down nerve signals in
humans and other animals. The user is unable to affect the shape of the dead zone, just the
size, rendering them near incapable of shutting down specific electronics if that’s their
desire."
200CP,Dental Manipulation,My Hero Academia,"The user is able to enlarge, shape, and control their teeth to
form dangerous branching blades. The user of this Quirk’s teeth are also made many times
stronger.
The user of this Quirk is able to pick themselves up and move around by their
branching teeth with no apparent discomfort. Knocking out the user’s teeth can cripple this
Quirk."
200CP,Diagnosis,My Hero Academia,"This Quirk can be used to give the user incredible amounts of varied
and specific knowledge on the body of those visually observed.
With this power, the user is able to get precise measurements of all kinds, age,
medical conditions, broken bones, birth marks and more. The longer the user continues to
observe a target, the more details they are able to learn, almost endlessly.
Useful for locating enemy weaknesses or applying medical treatment in equal parts.
The user must continue observing for additional details and observe a target in person.
Collected details through this Quirk can be remembered incredibly well."
200CP,Dupliarms,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk bares two tentacles on each side of their body
connected to the arms by webbings of skin. These tentacles have the ability to replicate
enhanced versions of the user’s body parts.
Ears would be more sensitive, vision of eyes more acute, hands having stronger grip
strength, mouths having stronger teeth and jaws and so on.
These tentacles can sprout more than one additional body part each, but each past
the more sprouted, the less efficient they become."
200CP,Dust Bunny,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user has powerful, highly refined control over dust and
similar particulates over a wide area. With this ability, they may simulate the power of a
sandblaster to grind away at things with abrasive powder or obscure the area around them
by kicking up a dust storm.
The Quirk user may also create ‘dust bunnies’, which are filthy, fluffy constructs with
the capacity for flight and carrying people on the air.
Overuse of Dust Bunny causes the skin to chafe as the ability eventually attempts to
shed dead cells faster to supply the Quirk user with more material."
200CP,Earphone Jack,My Hero Academia,"This Quirk manifests as a pair of elongated, prehensile earlobes
ending with appears to be earphone jacks that can penetrate and insert themselves into all
sorts of things.
The user can channel amplified sounds of their heartbeat into a penetrated target to
wreak internal havoc with vibrations, or listen in to faint sounds on the opposite side of an
object.
The earlobes can stretch up to 6 meters and even be used as stone shattering whips.
Aside from obvious limitations, louder sounds can damage or cancel out Earphone Jack’s
effects."
200CP,Easter Eggs,My Hero Academia,"The user of this strange quirk is able to cause bizarre, speckled eggs
to pop out of their hands. These eggs, coming in three varieties, have explosive properties
when cracked open.
Blue eggs with red spots explode in a plume of flame and smoke, the yolk continuing
to burn and produce red smoke for a short time after triggering. This smoke doubles as an
irritant.
Green eggs with orange spots explode in a spray of sticky orange slime that behaves
almost like glue, aggressively clinging to anything it touches. The more victims struggle
against it, the more resilient it is.
Purple and yellow eggs will produce a small, localized tornado with vacuum like
suction that pulls those nearby into it for a short time. Crackling thunder periodically booms
from inside.
Eggs are always made in a specific sequence, Blue to Green to Purple to Blue again
and so on. This quirk uses calories as a resource. The yolks themselves carry these effects,
take that as you will."
200CP,Elasticity,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user is able to bestow elasticity to whatever they touch,
including large objects, the ground and even the air. This can be used to manipulate the
environment to one’s advantage, such as creating trampolines for 3D movement, or trapping
others in air-based rubber walls.
The Quirk user is unable to affect living things with their Quirk, limiting them to
environmental and object-based manipulations. The Quirk user may not manually disable
the effects of their quirk. Objects affected will instead return to normal after a moderate
amount of time has passed."
200CP,Erasure,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to shut off the target’s Quirk simply by
staring at them. While powerful and unable to be resisted, it has a number of weaknesses.
The effect wears off when the user closes their eyes or loses track of the target.
Quirk users with passive Quirks like Mutation or Animal Mimicry types are immune.
Finally, prolonged usage can dry out the user’s eyes on account of needing to keep
them open to prolong the effects."
200CP,Explosion,My Hero Academia,"The user is able to excrete sweat similar to nitroglycerin from their
palms and ignite it to create various explosions at will, which includes propelling one’s self
through the air.
The more the user sweats, the more powerful the explosions. During cold weather,
the nitroglycerin-like sweat requires more time to ignite, as opposed to heat, where
conditions are optimal for ignition.
The user needs to be able to sweat to create explosions. Additionally, the user’s arm
and shoulder aren’t fully immune to the kickback of the explosions, wearing them out with
repeated use in a short period of time."
200CP,Extend-o-Hair,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user has incredible control over their own body hair,
allowing them to grow and manipulate it with great ease. Hair is exceptionally healthy and
strong, allowing them to leverage it for offense, defense and utility. This includes self-
enhancement or enemy incapacitation.
The Quirk user grows hair from most everywhere to supply the Quirk. The Quirk
user’s hair is prone to tangling, which can prove painful at times."
200CP,Fiber Master,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to freely control and manipulate
textiles. This gives them an advantage against anyone that wears clothes, which is to say
most everyone.
The user is able to textiles as completely intact clothing, or unravel clothes or cloth
into fibers and strings for alternative uses such as setting traps or binding enemies.
Notably, this power can also be used to aid allies by moving them out of the way of
an enemy attack. This power is notably tricky to use and difficulty varies by the type of
textile, working best on denim, while sweats remain tricky."
200CP,Flashback,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user is able to record the area and events around them,
either a single moment like a snapshot or an extended recording. At any time after that, they
play this recording back in their mind and inspect it from new angles, walking through this
recorded memory.
Listen in on secret conversations that were too far at the time to hear, inspect
details again and again for some clue, navigate a crime scene as it progressed for the
identities of all those involved. Time slows to a crawl as you have this “flashback"" allowing
you to see things again and again.
There is a range of approximately forty meters maximum in an orb around the user
that may be recorded. They may only record thirty minutes of time at a time. The more
recordings kept, the harder it becomes to navigate them."
200CP,Foldabody,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to control the thinness of their own body
and stretch, allowing them to spread or unfurl themselves while becoming thin as paper or more so.
This allows the user to pass through incredibly narrow passages or strike completely
undetected. The primary limitation is the time it takes to transform, and movement is a bit
tricky after doing so."
200CP,Forced Activation,My Hero Academia,"This Quirk gives the user the ability to manifest branching black
spears with a circuit pattern from their body to harmlessly jack in to a target’s body. Once
connected, the user is able to forcefully activate and control the victim’s Quirk as desired.
This can be used to turn enemies on their allies, gain the aid of unconscious allies of
your own or directing the quirk of another in a way beneficial to the user such as forcing a
captive with a unique Quirk to go along with demands.
The branching spears of this Quirk aren’t the most powerful, durable or fast things
around and as such it’s highly difficult to make use of them on a resisting target. If the user
has no idea what the target’s Quirk is or how it works, they can’t use their Quirk nearly as
well."
200CP,Fuel Siphon,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user is able to inhale and absorb the stamina/energy of
whoever they’re touching. This can quickly drain a victim to the point of incapacitation if
contact isn’t broken.
Drained stamina can be used not only to reinvigorate the Quirk user, leaving them
fully refreshed. An overabundance of drained energy can also be channeled into temporarily
increasing the Quirk user’s size, strength and durability, leaving them even more powerful
than before.
As previously stated, there are two conditions for this Quirk. The user must breath in,
taking a deep breath, and sustained contact is required for the duration of this time.
Breaking contact or preventing the Quirk user from breathing in can interrupt this Quirk’s
effects and leave a victim with a chance."
200CP,Glamour,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user may emit a mist from their mouth, which can then be
manipulated to form complex visual and auditory illusions over a wide area. Sound and
appearance with a bit of thought can reach lifelike realism or become a fantastic spectacle.
The Quirk user must emit their mist before forming illusions. The Quirk user’s mist
will dissipate given enough time, cancelling the illusions in place if not replenished."
200CP,Handyman,My Hero Academia,"This Quirk allows the user to mentally grab and manipulate the pieces
of a broken object before putting it back together, the object regenerating additional
damage upon doing so.
Handyman gives a period of around one minute where the Quirk user has full
control over the broken pieces before they’ll fly together and attempt to reform the original
object.
Objects must be broken before they may be “repaired."" This quirk is unable to affect
the pieces of an object that has been almost completely destroyed/pulverized/molten
down/etc."
200CP,Harpoon,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to project steel spikes on lines resembling
rope from their body at bullet like speeds, the spikes growing barbs to anchor themselves
upon penetration.
The user is able to retract the barbs and/or reel the spikes back in with similar
intensity to their projection. The user is also able to fire additional harpoons from the lines
of other harpoons.
In completion, the user is able to use this power to swing and pull themselves
quickly or attack from multiple angles. There is a fair share of limitations attached however.
The spikes are formed from a deposit of iron collected from the user’s blood. This
means they can only project ten at any one time, and if any are lost, such as the line being
severed, they’ll need to be replaced over the course of several days."
200CP,High Spec,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user acquires incredible intellect that allows them to
systematically solve problems in moments that a normal human might find perplexing even
after a week.
Those with High Spec may figure out how to operate most machinery in moments
with a bit of analysis, formulate technically sound battle strategies with Plan Bs and Plan Cs
and understand new concepts quickly.
The user is also able to quickly gain leadership skills just by figuring out psychological
tricks to inspire and command through normal social interaction. All this intellect is useless
without the proper knowledge and resources to back it up, and there is no inherent skill to
go along with the intelligence."
200CP,Horn Cannon,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user passively grows curved horns, which they may
detach and regrow multiple times in rapid succession. The Quirk user has great control over
their detached horns, allowing them to send them flying through the air, lift objects at a
distance or pin down enemies.
The Quirk user may have difficulty focusing on more than a few pairs of horns at a
time. The Quirk user may be put in a tough situation if their horns can’t be detached, such as
through being trapped or by being held in place."
200CP,IQ,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user is able to greatly increase their intelligence by drinking tea and
closing their eyes. While their eyes are closed, they may mentally envision holographic text
with which they can use to track compiled information, and more easily calculate equations
or solve problems.
Different forms of tea increase different forms of intelligence, though which does
what is a process of trial and error. These intelligence boosts are focused, but excessively
potent. As the Quirk requires both fresh tea and closed eyes, it’s quite difficult to use in a
limited timeframe, such as active combat."
200CP,Landmine,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user has the capacity to turn anything they touch into an
explosive, including other people. After that point, they may remotely detonate that
explosive with just a whim. Anything detached from the original object, person or thing will
detonate still.
The explosions themselves are actually fairly weak. While they may be rendered
dangerous with numbers, most things with moderate structural integrity can remain in-tact
even after detonation."
200CP,Lie Detector,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user is able to detect a number of things from nearby
individuals, including their heartrate, breathing and perspiration. These tells and how
they’re processed allows the Quirk user to determine the current mood of those around
them, as well as if they’re currently lying.
The Quirk user is unable to turn this power off, often feeding them too much
information about those around them. A world without lies isn’t what it’s cracked up to be."
200CP,Lizard Tail Splitter,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk use is able to split their body apart into pieces,
which may each be telekinetically manipulated through the air. Despite various organs being
separated from each other, all bodily systems will continue to function as normal while separate.
After a moderate amount of time, the Quirk user may fracture themselves and
control more pieces than when they started. The Quirk user needs to rejoin their pieces
after enough time has passed or risks losing control over them. Body parts that don’t contain
vital organs may be regenerated over time."
200CP,Muscle Augmentation,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user is able manipulate and amplify their muscle
fibers, and even have them harmlessly protrude from the Quirk user’s skin.
Through these abilities, the Quirk user is able to massively increase their power,
speed and resilience. They may also use their muscle fibers as makeshift tentacles to bind
others or manipulate nearby objects in their surroundings.
The Quirk user is only able to amplify their existing muscles so much, requiring
exercise that can build up their base musculature to make the most out of this Quirk. The
Quirk user is only able to amplify their muscles, leaving other parts of their physiology
vulnerable."
200CP,Need For Speed,My Hero Academia,"This Quirk allows you to slow or accelerate any moving object
the user comes in contact with by a factor of up to twenty, including yourself.
This allows the user to slow an attacking enemy to a crawl, speed thrown projectiles
to bullet-like speeds, accelerate suddenly as desired or produce danger, hanging obstacles.
As an interesting side-note of this Quirk, objects slowed by it keep their momentum,
impacting as they would at normal speeds if something touches them. Does not alter the
perception of time for those affected, for good and bad alike.
The effects only last as long as an object continues moving, ending when it stops. It
may only affect a moving object, meaning it can potentially be planned around by someone
who becomes experienced with it. Either from repeated encounters or during battle."
200CP,Outburst,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk can impair the cognitive and motor skills of
targets that they can force to laugh, forcing them to continue and worsen their laughter in
the process.
Victims of this Quirk will be hard lined into thinking and feeling like they got told the
funniest thing ever, even if their initial reaction was a mild chuckle or giggle.
Fighting through it to do other things is exceptionally difficult. The target will
continue in gut busting laughter as their diaphragm experiences pain and they become short
of breath, potentially passing out.
Breaking the effect is possible if the joke told is forgotten for a moment, also
meaning the effects wear off if they’re knocked unconscious. Of course, the user of this
Quirk is also limited by getting their target to at least scoff at their joke."
200CP,Queen Bee,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to produce and command bees from
their body with small syringes for stingers, allowing them to suck up and /or inject various
fluids.
This can allows the user to carry plentiful amounts of varying drugs to either
peacefully tranquilize enemies, poison them, induce mysterious symptoms and so on.
The major limitation of this ability is their relative fragility and the fact that damage
and pain transfers somewhat back to the user of the Quirk when they’re destroyed."
200CP,Recovery,My Hero Academia,"This Quirk allows the user to rapidly accelerate a target’s natural
healing by extending their lips and kissing the previously mentioned target.
With this, even grave injuries that would have taken months to heal can be healed in
a matter of seconds, although not without a cost.
The target pays for this healing with their own stamina, causing severe exhaustion if
an injury is, or injuries are, too serious in nature. This means traditional healing may be
required or recommended in some cases, or applied in small doses over time."
200CP,Repulsion,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to manipulate a repulsive, invisible force
that bounces anything that comes in contact with it away, like magnets with the same polarization.
The user is capable of either wrapping it entirely around them or shape it into
various invisible shapes like bars, barriers and varying geometric shapes to protect
themselves or others.
The major limitation is that while the force cannot be broken, it can be overpowered
and pushed through if enough force or weight is behind something it tries to repel, and the
user will be subjected to intense vertigo should this happen."
200CP,Scouts,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to manifest a creature with a long, round,
segmented body like a centipede with numerous legs, each with paws hosting retractable claws.
The creature is about the size of a long but small dog, with senses far more acute
than a human’s in every way imaginable. It’s also gifted mentally, like a mixture of an
obedient pet and computer in one.
It skulks about at the Quirk user’s discretion, able to deduce and learn from what it’s
five incredible senses feed it like some kind of fictional crime scene analysis computer.
The creature is able to split in half to multiply, growing shorter length-wise with a
maximum of eight two-legged creatures running around at once. They, even small, host the
combat abilities of a feral dog.
When the creature(s) returns to the Quirk user, the Quirk user learns everything
they perceived, analyzed and learned while out and about, accommodating for the influx of
knowledge perfectly.
The creatures created by this Quirk can still quite easily be killed if targeted with
malicious intent. This pains the Quirk user greatly, and prevents them from summoning the
segment(s) killed for several hours as they heal, the time stacking as each individual segment
must wait until the previous heals to start.
(Note: Exact color and appearance of the creature is left in the hands of the buyer,
such as giving it scales, feathers, fur or whatever.)"
200CP,Skateboard,My Hero Academia,"The user is able to apply wheels to whatever they touch and make
them spin and turn in place to make the object locomote as desired, throw objects at high
speeds and so on.
The user of this Quirk is able to apply wheels anywhere between the size of a roller
skate’s to the size of an average minivan’s and cause them to spin as quickly as an average
car’s top speed.
The user of this Quirk is unable to raise their legs while using their Quirk. Should
they do so, they’ll get road rash on random parts of their body of intensity based on the
speed of the wheels they were spinning at the time."
200CP,Snake Hair,My Hero Academia,"The tips of the Quirk user’s hair is made up of snakes. The user shares
their senses with these snakes and can use their various excellent senses to track things
around them.
The lineup of senses allows them to “see"" heat, enhanced touch that’s sensitive to
vibrations, greater than human smell and taste that works both in and out of water.
The primary limitations involve all these senses being focused on the user’s snake
hair, and the snakes being sensitive to the cold despite the user’s warm-blooded nature."
200CP,Softness,My Hero Academia,"This Quirk allows the user to soften anything they touch, allowing them
to make wreckage easier to remove or destroy, or turn the ground into quicksand.
This Quirk’s effects can travel along a surface from the initial point of contact in
whatever direction the user desires, allowing them to only soften a line to the side or in
front of them, or everything for several meters from the point of contact.
The user is unable to affect living matter such as people, animals or plants. They also
seem limited by body moisture somewhat, becoming dehydrated with prolonged or
repeated use in a short timeframe."
200CP,Somnambulist,My Hero Academia,"The quirk user is able to produce a highly potent, sleep-inducing
aroma from their body on command that can quickly propagate through an area. Even highly
aggressive individuals may soon lose consciousness upon getting a wiff of it.
The sleep inducing aroma does have the weakness of enemies needing to actually
breath it in for it to work, meaning those who can avoid doing so will remain unaffected. The
aroma is more effective against the opposite gender compared to the same gender of the
quirk user."
200CP,Synesthesia,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to perceive what one sense can sense
through any other sense in a way and vice versa, a form of super synesthesia.
Your vision would be able to do things such as perceive tastes or sounds, hearing
would be able to allow you to feel it, smell it, taste would allow you to put together an
image and more.
With all five senses working together, you’ll be able to obtain a unified super sense,
allowing you to perceive things more clearly and accurately than any normal person could
even understand.
The major downside is sensory overload that can render the user stunned and in
pain. This happens when something particularly strong to one sense hits you, such an
incredibly putrid stench, a deafening sound or a blinding light. They can also get lost in
pleasant senses."
200CP,Tape,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk possesses tube-like elbows with openings that can be
used to eject various kinds of cellophane tape-like material in great quantities.
The released tape can either be cut and used or retracted back into the user’s
elbows. Multiple stands can be projected at once, and tape can be produced with one side
or both being sticky.
The tape is strong enough to immobilize enemies and allow the user to swing
around on it. Overuse of this Quirk can dry out and crack the user’s skin."
200CP,The Hand,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user is able to summon a massive hand from their body that
mimics the appearance of their dominant hand. It is twice the size of their body, and many
times stronger than their actual hand even if it was scaled to similar size.
The hand is able to float, crawl and swing at high speeds with highly dexterous
movements. The hand is semi-autonomous, following the will of the Quirk user as best it can.
Hand strength scales upwards with the user’s. If harmed, damage transfers to the
user’s hand at a reduced rate. Range is limited to a few meters, where the hand leashes to
the Quirk user."
200CP,Tool Arms,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to sprout additional arms ending with all
manner of tools and/or power tools, including hammers, drills and functioning chainsaws.
The user is able to retract these tools back into their body at any time. The primary
limitation is that the tools are subject to metal fatigue if they take too much a beating or if
the user has low blood iron content, requiring a diet rich in iron and a healthy sleeping
schedule."
200CP,Trajectory,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk casts a 20-meter by 20-meter cube shaped grid
of awareness around them made up of numerous smaller blocks just four centimeters wide each.
The user of this Quirk measures speed, rotation, mass, shape and trajectory of
anything that passes through one of the six walls of one of these smaller cubes, allowing
them to calculate where it came from, where it’s going and how fast it’s going to get there.
The more walls something passes through, the easier it becomes to predict and
react to it. This Quirk can quickly allow the user to measure and adapt their motions to
become more and more precise.
The nature of this Quirk means information doesn’t come in smoothly. If something
for whatever reason instantly changes direction while inside a cube, the user’s predictions
can actually cause them to be caught off guard."
200CP,Twin Impact,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user has the capacity to secondary impacts at the site of
any observed impact. This secondary impact is many times stronger than the initial impact,
allowing even smaller impacts to transmit considerable force.
The Quirk user need not be near, or be the one who caused any initial impact, simply
being required to observe the impact in person to double it. They may not, however, double
any impact more than once. Secondary impact force is highly difficult to moderate."
200CP,Vines,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user grows numerous vines from their head instead of hair, each
covered in soft thorns. These vines may be multiplied and manipulated freely in order to
capture enemies, defend the Quirk user or navigate their surroundings.
Although the vines are very resilient, they may be cut or otherwise destroyed. If the
Quirk user is deprived of them, they must apply water and sunlight to their scalp to make
them sprout back up over time, as if caring for an actual plant. The Quirk user is unable to
force regrowth."
200CP,Water Accumulation,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to exert extremely fine control
over water, able to pull moisture from the air in order to supply themselves.
The user is able to make fine, detailed shapes out of water such as functional hands,
letters, signs, recreations of someone’s face, drills and paddles.
This Quirk is focused around the user’s hands, limiting them if their hands are bound.
Dry and arid places make application of this Quirk extremely difficult."
200CP,Zero Gravity,My Hero Academia,"This Quirk gives small pads on the ends of each of the user’s fingers
that can be used as a medium to “shut off"" an object or person’s link to gravity, making
them weightless.
The effects of this Quirk may be cancelled at any time by touching the pads on the
user’s fingers together. The primary limitations are weight and using it on one’s self.
If the user activates their Quirk on a combined amount of objects higher than a
certain weight (around three tons) they’ll begin getting sick to the point of vomiting. Using
this Quirk on themselves will cause this effect much faster."
200CP,Zombie Virus,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user is able to produce pink gas that, when inhaled,
transforms victims into ‘zombies.’ Those afflicted acquire heightened endurance, heightened
strength, and the ability to pass on infection through bites, but have their cognitive abilities
dulled.
Their vocalizations are replaced with moaning, their skin becomes gray, and their
faces become warped. Those affected will perceive others with zombie-like appearances as
allies and ignore them, even if they’re not actually infected.
The infection fades within several hours of infection. The Quirk user is not immune,
and may be zombified by the gas or bites of the infected if the proper protection is not
obtained."
200CP,Kitty Kat,Spiderman PS4,"The Hardy family has always been special and for a lot more than just the sneaky crimes they get up
to when night falls and people hit the hay. The two Black Cats have superhuman agility and strength,
which lets them bound from building to building with ease and knock out or even kill ordinary
people with a single punch. Now you have a chance to get these enhanced feline capabilities too,
letting you dance your way across the nighttime skyline and, if you want, even be a part of this
criminal family for real."
200CP,Air Control,Worm,"Don’t laugh at it, the power to sense and manipulate air within a 
large radius is incredibly potent. The range of your power is roughly several city blocks, 
and its strength is enough to shred stone within an instant and metal shortly after. Of 
special note is your ability to compress air to the point that it’ll act like a liquid or solid, 
granting it incredible strength from the raw pressure. Releasing this compressed gas 
makes for incredibly dangerous aerokinetic explosions. Your power’s strength and control 
is much greater in areas with large open spaces and strong winds. If an airborne opponent 
was stupid enough to fight you high up in the atmosphere in the global slipstreams you’d 
be a living force of nature."
200CP,Alexandria Package,Worm,"You have the standard flying brick powerset, insane strength, durability, and flight. You can toss around over 30 tons, your strength enough to 
tear through solid steel like tissue paper. Your durability is incredible, requiring high 
explosives before you even start to feel it; and your flight tops out at around five hundred 
miles per hour. As a secondary power you possess enhanced intelligence and perfect 
memory. Your power also enforces the Manton Limit on things that try to effect you, 
meaning that even elsewhere a telekinetic can't pop your brain, or somebody who can 
conjure flames burn you from the inside out. Yes, this explicitly includes Behemoths kill 
aura, and will even protect you from Ziz's telekinetic brain fuckery. "
200CP,Assimilation,Worm,"You are capable of merging technology or non-living materials into 
your body, your power recording their properties and allowing you to manifest them at 
will. These objects require a little time to digest, but once that is done you can manifest 
them with your body in any way you care to imagine. Assimilate titanium and turn your 
bones into it, turn your arms into weapons, bud computer systems along your nerves to 
add processing power, and overall transform into an ever-shifting cybernetic monstrosity. 
Larger pieces of technology are possible but you’re limited to being about five times your 
base size, space ships and the like are probably beyond you. Expendable resources will be 
provided by your power assuming you have assimilated a sample of them. Ex: Bullets, 
fuel, etc. Doesn’t work on magic, but does on magi-tech, since it is sufficiently “science”. "
200CP,Ballistic Transmission,Worm,"Objects you touch can be launched along a trajectory of 
your choosing (simple ones only, slight curves are fine, figure eights are not) at several 
thousand feet per second. You can effect objects up to the size of a large truck, and size 
has no effect on the speed reached. Unfortunately you can't make targets fire slower, so 
any use of your power is almost by default highly lethal and destructive against anything 
other than extremely durable targets. If you don’t think this is all that impressive them sit 
down and do the math when say...that car over there hits something moving at speeds 
equaling that of a high velocity military round. "
200CP,Biosculpter,Worm,"On touch you are able to sense every detail about living matter 
you're in contact with, and can shape it with a thought. You are only limited by your own 
(admittedly great even just with this powers senses) knowledge of what you're doing, the 
amount of biomass you have to work with, and physical laws. As long as it is organic you 
can weave it like a master musician would a masterpiece from the violin, or like a 
sculptor would mold their masterpiece. Contact means you're at least touching part of the 
living being you're wanting to effect. Requires direct flesh to flesh contact on your part, 
doesn't work through clothes or coverings, and doesn’t work on yourself. This power isn’t 
instantaneous, although it’s still extremely quick."
200CP,Blink,Worm,"You are capable of teleporting to any location within two hundred yards 
with only an instant's thought. When you Blink you may modify your physical orientation 
and momentum to anything that is physically possible for you or for you to achieve for 
your target. This power is especially suited to rapid teleportation chains, and you are 
immune to any disorientation or imbalance that might result from this. Secondary 
Thinker aspects grant you the superhuman spatial and situational awareness needed to use 
this ability to its fullest, along with the capability to handle sensory input faster than 
possible for any other human being. You can also Blink targets you’re touching, or take 
them with you. These targets can be people or objects up to five times your size."
200CP,Boogie Manimal,Worm,"You are able to produce a strange fog like substance which you 
can then shape into creatures, their natures being limited only by your imagination and 
how you craft them. These are under your mental control, and you can sense everything 
they do. The more of the fog you invest into a creature, and the longer you take in its 
creation, the stronger and more powerful it will be. Creatures may have certain abilities 
of their own based on how you've made them, and at any time you may invest more fog 
into them to modify or strengthen them further, with no (in theory if maybe not so much 
in practice) upper limit. Creatures default to a completely loyal if predatory mentality 
unless you make them otherwise. The fog itself is mostly transparent to you and your 
creations, and can be pumped out to cover large areas. "
200CP,Browbeat,Worm,"How does personal biokinesis, a protective force field, and tactile 
telekinesis sound as a power set? You're nearly impossible to completely incapacitate or 
subdue due to your combination of powers, and any one facet of your power being 
negated tends to be covered by the others. Nullifying your force field and telekinesis 
doesn't change the fact that you're already shifted into a super-humanly strong hulk, and 
at any other time you're a juggernaut who can wreck opponents with just the tiniest 
glancing blow. Strength for your telekinesis is 30 tons over your base physical strength, 
and your force field is durable enough to casually tank...well a tank. The creative uses of 
your biokinesis are nearly limitless."
200CP,Complete Arsenal,Worm,"You are a poor man’s Eidolon. You have three slots which if 
given a minute will be filled with a power that somehow fits your current desires or needs 
in some way, starting out at mid range for a parahuman and growing to high mid range 
over the course of five to ten minutes. You have no control over the specifics of these 
powers beyond keeping or releasing a power, and while they will always be of use to 
your needs and wants these are not tailored to your exact whims. This doesn’t change the 
incredible versatility this power grants you, but these powers won’t be on the same level 
as the others on these lists. You have an innate understanding of what these powers are 
and how to use them as normal."
200CP,Compounded Computation,Worm,"Whenever you are dealing with a problem, your 
intelligence scales based on its complexity and scale. The bigger and/or more complex 
the problem, the easier it is for you. Aside from researching the data to do so, creating a 
plan to eliminate world hunger would take only as long as necessary to type it all up. This 
power allows you to make impossibly effective plans, and is even more valuable when 
dealing with large scale issues. Managing an intergalactic empire’s logistics would be as 
easy as simple arithmetic for you, and it continues to scale from there. This power is 
basically useless on small and simple things however. Do note that while you could easily 
think up a plan to solve world hunger, actually putting it into effect is a whole other story. 
You need resources and skill to actually use what your power provides you, but you’re 
easily able to handle things that would be impossible for anyone else due to their sheer 
scale and complexity."
200CP,Contractor,Worm,"You are capable of granting people you touch powers, up to ten 
people at a time. These can be normal people or those who are already parahumans, and 
you can decide what these powers are. At any time you can revoke a power you’ve 
granted, regardless of where the target is. You have no special control over those who you 
empower, cannot empower yourself, and you cannot stack more than one granted power 
onto somebody. These powers are roughly mid-range for parahumans, nothing 
impressive, but nothing bad. Alternatively you can drop the amount of granted powers 
you can have out at any one time down to five, with those being the equal of those 
granted by the Cauldron Vials in the gear section."
200CP,Corrosive Contact,Worm,"Your touch hyper-accelerates and optimizes entropy in targets, 
which for most means they almost instantly disintegrate. This power can effect 
contiguous material up to five yards away from the point of contact, and your precision 
with it is enough to do things like casually carve out new doorways with a tap. This 
power is enough to almost ignore simple physical durability, although beings like the 
Endbringers will ""merely"" be hurt pretty bad by it. Works on energy just as easily as 
matter, and you lack any Manton Limit to stop you from effecting living beings. You're 
completely immune of course, and have perfect control over this ability. "
200CP,Decoy,Worm,"You're capable of ""tagging"" living beings on contact, and for several hours 
afterward as long as they are within a mile radius of you then you can shunt anything 
effecting yourself onto them instead. This can range from the bullet striking you entering 
their brain instead, to that poison you just downed like a jello shot. Shunting an effect is 
almost effortless as long as you're mentally aware, needing only the intention to do so. 
Your power can only remotely transmit things that are happening to you ""right now"". 
Targets apply their durability and other traits to the suffered effect normally. If you don’t 
have enough tagged targets to take the damage then you suffer it yourself, and overflow 
from a killed target will hit you if it has nowhere to go. Surprise attacks likewise will be 
difficult for you to defend against with this power. "
200CP,Doormaker,Worm,"You are capable of opening portals to any destination you can think 
of. These portals may remain until you decide to dismiss them, and their size is limited 
only by your powers growth and the effort you put into them. These portals are capable of 
crossing dimensional boundaries, and into alternate mirror worlds. Post Jump you can 
still reach such destinations, but note that peculiarities of the particular world may change 
the fundamental nature of how these might function. Post-Spark these portals can connect 
anywhere in the multiverse/omniverse. "
200CP,Energy Shadow,Worm,"Your power allows you to absorb energy, a process which 
empowers you based on how much you take in. This starts as becoming stronger, tougher, 
and healing damage, but swiftly begins to transition you into a living energy being that 
can keep growing stronger and larger as long as there is enough energy to fuel your 
growth. The only form of energy you can’t absorb is the kinetic energy in solid objects, 
meaning you’ll have to rely on your durability to protect you from physical assault. Your 
power absorbs most energy automatically if it would be dangerous to you, but over a 
certain threshold you need to focus to properly absorb it all. You are capable of 
expending energy in the form of intense blasts, the nature of which is under your control. 
You are capable of being overwhelmed, and note that your power is constantly eating 
absorbed energy to fuel your strength, durability, and healing."
200CP,Enhanced Mastery,Worm,"Your ability allows you to master any skill or field of 
endeavor you care to name at an incredible pace, and to keep growing your skill from 
there. Within a few days of studying or practicing something you’ll be on the level of the 
professionals in the field, and within a week you’d be among the experts. Your growth 
slows down from there but your ability to learn means that you always see noticeable 
increases in your skills whenever you put effort into them, with continual refinement 
always possible. Aside from that however your ability to learn and improve your skills is 
superhuman. You also possess perfect technical retention and execution, meaning that 
your skills and knowledge never degrade, and you always perform at the top of your 
game. As a rough guideline treat hours as months for learning and training time. This 
power only effects your skills, developed attributes like strength or energy pools aren’t 
affected."
200CP,Friction Modulation,Worm,"You are capable of not only ignoring friction, but reversing 
its effects to increase your speed and momentum instead. This can continue with no upper 
limit, and any negative effects you would suffer from the forces involved are negated. 
This includes kinetic force that would cause damage to you from your own actions, so 
despite your speed you cannot strike with anymore force then you can safely handle. Your 
control over your movement and inertia also allows you to redirect your momentum and 
inertia in any direction at any time, allowing you to zip and bounce around a battlefield at 
insane speeds effortlessly. Your reaction time and reflexes scale with your speed, 
allowing you to act and react normally. May also be extended to people and objects you 
are touching to bring them along with you. You have perfect balance and poise while 
under the effects of this power."
200CP,Geist,Worm,"At will you can shift into a ghost like state where you are completely 
intangible, invisible, and inaudible, and can fly at three times the speed you could sprint 
without effort. Aside form being effectively undetectable and untouchable, you can also 
possess targets that you can touch, controlling them completely, and able to access their 
memories and thoughts. This control is perfect, you'll never have a host make a mistake 
that results in people noticing that something is off. Possession works on any living 
creature, although note that particularly powerful beings and wills might be able to resist 
your control. You can selectively ignore your intangibility, letting you physically interact 
with things without revealing yourself. Note this has the potential of leaving you 
vulnerable however, and in addition your intangibility might be overwhelmed by 
sufficient levels of energy or exotic effects."
200CP,Gravity Manipulation,Worm,"You can manipulate gravity, increasing it immensely or 
completely nullifying it. Your ability to change its direction also means you can do things 
like fly, make it so that along a particular street people can walk on the building’s sides 
like it was a sidewalk, and much more. The effects of this power on an area can either be 
temporary, or last until you reverse them or they are disrupted by another effect. The 
upper limit of how strong you can make gravity increases with time. You start with five 
times earth gravity being your upper limit. This powers range is a radius equal about two 
city blocks around you, which will increase slowly over time. "
200CP,Imaginary Form,Worm,"You’re capable of warping your physical form into a mental 
projection, which can be roughly anything you can imagine up to roughly twenty feet tall, 
or proportionally larger of your base size differs from human norm. This form doesn’t 
need to biologically or physically viable, a swirling nimbus of light or a massive beast 
made out of fire is perfectly fine, and will interact with the world as those forces 
normally do. Your body itself is able to be casually reformed from any damage it might 
take, but you still possess a core somewhere within it that will result in your demise if 
destroyed or significantly damaged. Reforming your body is relatively quick but takes 
mental effort, and doing so continuously will fatigue you. Note that while you can 
become anything you can imagine, this doesn’t mean you can just imagine “A thing that 
does X” and have that ability. An understanding of physics will allow you to get the most 
out of this power. "
200CP,Inference Engine,Worm,"Your power provides you with a massive subconscious 
database of everything you have ever experienced, and is constantly examining all of the 
various data to come to make deductions based on the facts you have. Your power feeds 
these conclusions and the relevant information to you, providing you with nearly perfect 
inference and deduction capabilities, far beyond what is possible for even the smartest 
human being. Your power is able to work off of incredibly small bits of data and 
information, most times seeming to pull information out of thin air, but inaccurate 
information can result in incorrect conclusions. Your power is unbelievably accurate 
though, and constantly corrects itself, meaning you should only come to false conclusions 
if you push it past the things you have data points for. Sherlock Holmes in his wildest 
dreams looks like a toddler compared to you, and not a very bright one at that. "
200CP,Inorganic Avatar,Worm,"You can draw in material to cover and fuse with you, and 
manipulate it to effectively turn things like stone and steel into an extremely powerful 
body that you can control. You can shape and mold the material that makes up your form, 
modifying its form, shape, and composition, limited only by the material you’ve taken in. 
With this power you can grow to around ten time your base size as your upper limit. 
You're far more durable then the sum of your parts in this form, but not invincible. Enjoy 
turning yourself into a living Golem."
200CP,Internal Charge,Worm,"While stationary you're able to ""charge"" yourself by focusing, 
with said charge then able to be spent for 5 seconds of nigh-invulnerability, super 
strength, and super speed per second you’ve been charging. You're the equal of pretty 
much any other brute or mover while this charge is active, being incredibly difficult to 
harm and faster than even most electronic devices can track, but once you run out you're 
just a normal human until you generate more. Stored charge beings to slowly dissipate 
over time after awhile, and you'll only be able to hold about five minutes worth of charge 
at any one time. "
200CP,Iterative Improvement,Worm,"Each day you gain a certain amount of charge, which you 
can spend to effectively “enchant” objects with superpowers. The more charge you invest 
in a particular object, the more you can improve and expand its abilities. A single days 
charge would give an object a minor power, but over time you can increase it with no 
upper limit beyond your investment. These objects only work for you unless you make it 
otherwise. As you use your power, experiment with it, and it matures from conflict and 
experience, the amount of charge you gain per day will increase. You can hold about a 
month’s worth of charge at any one time, any more will be wasted."
200CP,Mathematical Calculation,Worm,"You are now completely aware of the numbers and 
math in the world around you, from the trajectory of the bullet whizzing past you, to its 
measurements, vector, and the probabilities of the shooters actions. Your ability with 
mathematics is superhuman, allowing you to do even the most theoretical and advanced 
forms of math instantly with the same ease that you’d breath. Combined with your 
powers senses this lets you do things like deflect a bullet with your cuff link so it 
ricochets to strike the shooter, know exactly where the rubble from the explosion will 
land and where to move to avoid it, surviving very large falls by landing perfectly to 
dissipate the force safely, and much more. Potentially far more useful though is the 
manifold uses of this power in areas other than combat. Seriously, your power is math 
now. The uses of that are incredible. Keep in mind that Thinker headaches are a bitch 
though, even with your power doing most of the heavy lifting."
200CP,Medical and Biological Science,Worm,"You know how to cure cancer, AIDS, and pretty 
much everything else. The working of flesh and bone is casual to you, with even the most 
difficult procedures capable of being performed half asleep and blind in one eye as easily 
as you breath. You're the perfect medic and doctor, but your skills and knowledge extend 
much further then that. You could create some truly incredible monsters if you wanted to, 
whether out of whole cloth or test subjects. Lets not even get started on biological 
warfare. Biology and anything to manipulate or interact with it are all within your 
capabilities. From genetic engineering, to human enhancement, to even cloning with the 
proper samples and resources. "
200CP,Memory Blanking,Worm,"When active, your power actively blanks you from the 
memory of everybody around you, including short term recognition. You could walk right 
up to someone with a knife in broad daylight, and cutting them would leave them 
wondering how that happened, completely unable to register your presence. This power 
works only on living beings. Sensors, cameras, and robots will be able to perceive you 
just fine. Other exotic senses may bypass this as well, although that depends on their 
nature, but otherwise people are completely incapable of registering your presence and 
actions. Imp for example walked right into a villain’s office, hammered a board full of 
nails onto the floor behind his chair, tied a rope to said chair, and he only noticed her 
when she deactivated her power and calmly let him know that if he did anything funny he 
was one tug away from leaking like a sieve."
200CP,Miniaturization and Efficiency,Worm,"You can miniaturize anything down to levels that 
any sane man would consider impossible. A fusion reactor the size of a watch battery 
would be the absolute minimum of what you are capable of, and you'd be able to make it 
far smaller than that. Your power also makes you a master of technological efficiency, 
anything you make needing barely any energy to run compared to what it should and 
continue to do so for a very long time. These specialties also make you a master of 
nanotechnology and similar pursuits. Of course you aren't barred from building 
something big like a giant robot, just that it'll be impossibly efficient and crammed full of 
more weapons and subsystems then should be possible. "
200CP,Orbital Lock,Worm,"Your power lets you lock a target’s position relative to something 
else. No matter how the object moves, whether that be normally, through teleportation, or 
other exotic means the target will always remain in that exact relative position. You can 
also only lock parts of its relative position, letting it rotate or move along particular axis 
while denying others. You’re strong enough to lock up to large buildings with your 
power, and targets remain locked until you either release them or something manages to 
disrupt the effect. Unless you make it otherwise targets under the effect of this power are 
incredibly durable, the spatial lock rendering them almost immune to kinetic damage. 
Other forms of damage are not impeded in the slightest. "
200CP,Personal Force Manipulation,Worm,"Within a the space around an inch from your body 
you are aware of all forces currently active, and you may magnify or lessen them. This 
lets you turn blows against you into mere taps, while increasing your own into incredibly 
destructive attacks. You can extend this power to targets you are touching, up to the size 
of a very large vehicle. You’ll get more bang for your buck by increasing or decreasing 
multiple forces at a time, like increasing the kinetic force of your strikes while decreasing 
the physical resistance of the target at the same time. This requires no small amount of 
finesse, but if properly mastered you’d be a nightmare. "
200CP,Phase State,Worm,"You're able to transition into a immaterial state that is incredibly hard 
to see, and is completely untouchable by any physical force or object. In this state physics 
hold on you is very loose, letting you leap incredible distances and glide and float. You 
can transition things you touch into this state as well, at which point you can interact with 
them as normal, not counting the nature of their new state. Objects and other targets 
revert back after awhile based on how much juice you put into changing them, with very 
nasty consequences for anything they happen to be passing through at the time. You can 
also do the reverse, with the targets having insanely more pronounced effects on their 
surroundings, almost like whatever they hit was only partially real and substantial 
compared to them. You can do this to yourself as well, at which point you could probably 
walk through solid steel like it was melted butter."
200CP,Power Well,Worm,"Within you resides an immense reserve of energy that you are 
capable of calling up and expending in incredibly powerful blasts. You can shape these 
and to a certain extent manipulate their nature, from kinetic force, to thermal energy, to 
electricity and more. These are powerful enough to level a city block should you go all 
out to your upper limit. You also possess the capability of flight, at around two hundred 
miles per hour. Despite the incredible raw force of this ability, do note that use drains 
your reserves, and while they are significant when you are fully charged intensive use of 
your full capacity will require over a week to recharge to suitable levels. Your mobility 
and raw destructive power also do nothing for your personal durability. Barring other 
abilities you are just as fragile as a normal human. "
200CP,Programming and Computer Science,Worm,"Supercomputers are your bread and butter, 
and Artificial Intelligence is your idea of a PDA. Data, programs, and digital devices are 
your playthings, not to mention that your understanding of such systems mean you can 
hack anything that could possibly be hacked. There isn't really any limit on the extent you 
could push computing hardware, and any kind of software you can imagine is within your 
grasp. Please do note that flaunting this is likely to attract some attention from a few 
major players in particular. Then again that might not be a bad thing depending on your 
disposition and plans."
200CP,Quantum Evolution,Worm,"Your body exists in a perpetual state of quantum uncertainty, 
and suddenly warps and evolves based on the stimulus around you to better fit your needs 
and desires, primarily survival. Falling off a building would result in you growing wings, 
bullets find themselves flattening on bio-armor that wasn't there when the weapon was 
fired, and strikes in combat will find natural weaponry perfectly suited to their target 
shaped by the time they land. The nature of this power means you can casually switch 
back to your base form, and regenerate at high speeds. Retaining a change will result in 
its constant refinement and enhancement, the effort and energy that would be spent on 
adapting instead being constantly funneled into improvement. Issues like muscle memory 
and being unused to your forms changes aren't a problem, you are able to use them 
instinctively. You can exert conscious control over your power’s changes, either total or 
simply guiding it in your preferred directions. Your power can evolve anything physically 
possible for a biological system, although its an admittedly generous definition. Your 
power is a lot like Crawler’s, you’re just not permanently mutated. You do not possess a 
core, relying instead on your regeneration and adaptation, though you’ll never suffer 
negative effects from needing to regenerate your brain or similar issues. Too much of you 
being destroyed or damaged at once can still end in your death if you’re not careful. "
200CP,Queen Administrator,Worm,"You have an absolute awareness of and control over not 
only insects, but pretty much any and all invertebrates in a radius around you that begins 
at roughly the size of four city blocks and will grow with time. You receive their sensory 
input and are able to flawlessly interpret it despite the differences between you. Your 
control even extends down to involuntary processes of your targets, such as breathing, 
heartbeat, and hormones. This power comes with infinitely scaling multitasking, letting 
you keep track of any number of different things at once and micromanage your swarms 
down to the movements of each individual limb. This also means you're incapable of 
being overwhelmed by the vast amount of sensory input your power gives you. Targets 
can be made to continue to follow a single order or directive even after they’ve left your 
range until its either complete or no longer possible."
200CP,Relationship Modification,Worm,"Imagine being able to make it so that anyone was your 
best friend, trusted confidant, or loyal servant. Well you can now, people effected by your 
power having their social and emotional relationship to you modified either temporarily 
or permanently to whatever you desire. This can either be a change in how they act, or all 
the way up to them suddenly having appropriate memories clear as day that makes them 
believe that it was always this way, although sufficient willpower can allow them to resist 
it or break through over time. You’re not limited to just the relationships between the 
target and yourself. You can make a man hate his best friend with murderous rage, leave 
his beloved wife the same way he’d walk away from a stranger on the street, or loyally 
and fervently dedicate himself to a cause he didn’t even know existed yesterday. This 
power can affect any number of people as long as you can directly perceive them, and 
you can roughly sense a person’s currently existent relationships when you pay attention."
200CP,Reverse Engineering,Worm,"While you still possess an amount of scientific knowledge 
beyond the curve of modern society, your base technical knowledge is far less than other 
Tinkers. This is however because your power lets you reverse engineer the principles and 
workings of anything you can get your hands on, and then apply that knowledge and 
understanding to your own work. Just seeing a device and watching it function gives you 
a vague idea as to how it works, and examining something means you can derive the 
hows and whys as to its functions. This requires time and effort on your part, in addition 
to the time and resources it’ll take to actually implement this new knowledge, but as long 
as you put in the necessary investment you can always understand virtually any new 
technology. Your Tinker abilities will continue to expand as you gain access to new 
technology and knowledge, with potentially no upper limit as long as you can keep 
gaining samples to work with."
200CP,Sensorium,Worm,"You can paint very large areas in an invisible field that allows you to 
hijack and manipulate the senses of those within. You can make them perceive and 
experience anything you can imagine, covering all possible senses. Blatant use allows 
you to effectively create holodecks wherever you will it, while subtle use allows you to 
misdirect and deceive with unparalleled finesse. Exotic senses will require attention on 
your part to account for, although your power has no trouble spoofing these just as easily 
as normal ones. As a secondary ability your imagination and creativity is enhanced, along 
with effectively perfect internal visualization."
200CP,Soft Physics,Worm,"You're able to ""soften"" physics on targets, whether that be yourself, 
or another person or object. This is really fascinating as you're basically scaling up 
quantum improbability to the macro-scale and using the resulting physical uncertainty 
to...ugh. Look, the long and short of it is that you basically run on Looney Toon physics. 
Expect some really odd stares and reactions from people. I guess you don't really care 
about the sheer raw potential that lies in how your power actually manages to pull a giant 
hammer out of your formerly empty pocket, or how the resulting data would 
revolutionize physics. For the love of god please use this responsibly. I don't know 
exactly what will happen if you fold somebody up, then trap them in a can and leave, but 
I know that it is not going to be healthy for the poor bastard. Also while use of this power 
makes you the next best thing to unkillable, it only functions while you’re conscious, and 
non-physical effects (like mind control) aren’t impeded in the slightest. If you want I’ll 
throw in a yellow suit and a green mask for free. "
200CP,Stasis,Worm,"At a touch you're capable of freezing things into a temporal stasis, for up 
to ten minutes at a time, minimum thirty seconds. Effected objects are completely 
invulnerable, immovable, and otherwise immune to being effected by anything. Should 
another absolute effect (such as Sting for example) contest this, then both effects are 
nullified. Additional touches allow you to reset this timer for any duration up to your 
max. You are capable of effecting contiguous matter, although this is much harder, able to 
work only about five yards out. The Manton Effect prevents you from freezing only 
portions of a living target, at least for the duration of this jump."
200CP,Stellar Fusion,Worm,"High temperatures within a small space around you (roughly a one 
to two foot radius unless you limit it or turn it off) are nullified to around sixty-seventy so 
degrees, and for a very good reason. Your power lets you create a miniature sun, which 
may reach up to the size of a very large truck. Continued effort can continue expanding it 
but doing so results in diminishing returns and can tire you out. The temperatures 
generated by this can be enough to lay waste to everything around you in seconds if 
you’re not careful, and to vaporize stone and steel in almost an instant if you’re openly 
pushing it to happen. You’ll have to keep your sun small if you want to use it without 
causing insane amounts of collateral damage and wanton death, but when purposefully 
guided towards destruction there is very little even among parahumans that is capable of 
resisting its effects. The range you can control and move it within is roughly two hundred 
yards around you from the sun's core to yourself."
200CP,Sting,Worm,"By unfolding an object through nigh infinite dimensions it becomes 
capable of ignoring all forces that would effect it, including the physical resistance, 
durability, or other effects that would meaningfully impede it. You apply this effect on 
touch (and you're immune to being harmed by this power) on objects up to the size of a 
large truck. The length of time this remains in effect on an object depends on how much 
juice you put into it, and when the power wears off the object will physically fuse with 
whatever it is currently going through. This power allows you to tear through almost any 
and all defenses like they didn't even exist, only other absolute effects like a time locked 
object can resist it, at which point both effects simply cancel each other out on contact. 
Explicitly bypasses all dimensional barriers, boundaries, and defenses. You also have a 
nigh perfect sense of timing and trajectories, giving you superhuman aim and accuracy. 
As a special concern for Jumpers, note that magical, conceptual, and other supernatural 
effects work just fine when it comes to defending against this power, they don’t 
automatically lolnope it, but unlike everything else they have a chance."
200CP,Thanatos,Worm,"At will you are capable of conjuring up a phantom whose appearance 
and nature seem to be influenced by your personality. This phantom is capable of being 
intangible, and begins with peak human physical capabilities. Anytime it kills a living 
being, it assimilates properties of that being to improve itself. Even adding new 
capabilities and shifting it’s form. Normal people typically only gain it skills and small 
increases in physical abilities, while parahumans and those with unique powers or 
abilities will see those abilities integrated into the phantom. Killing a pyrokinetic would 
result in your phantom shifting into a more demonic or draconic appearance, and granting 
it the ability to conjure and manipulate flame for example. At all times you sense what 
your phantom does, including its mental processes, and control it as easily as you control 
your own body. Improvements are permanent and remain even if you dismiss it. Your 
phantom's range begins at around four city blocks away from you, and will increase with 
time. Note that the upgrades it receives aren’t necessarily a one for one copying of the 
target’s power (although that is also possible), simply an integration of aspects of it that 
improve the phantom. These upgrades are always good, but killing a god isn’t going to 
make it a god, although a massive upgrade related to that god’s domain would be 
perfectly viable. "
200CP,Thought Implantation,Worm,"You are capable of sensing all minds within a several 
hundred yard range, along with their emotions and their thoughts, conscious or otherwise. 
You can implant emotions and thoughts into peoples’ minds, which from their perspective 
are indistinguishable from their own. These can be conscious or subconscious, and as 
complex as you yourself are capable of imagining. Note that thoughts include a lot more 
than just mental dialogue. Subtlety and finesse will pay off more than brute force with 
this power, but you should never underestimate the ability to just overwhelm somebody’s 
mind with a particular emotion or thought. As a side effect of this power you have an 
incredible understanding of how the mind functions and the nature of emotions and 
thought."
200CP,Topography Manipulation,Worm,"You are capable of warping and manipulating 
topography. You can warp things so stepping across a football field takes only a single 
step, loop space back on itself, make circles square and squares circles, and other uses. 
Living matter makes it harder to warp space when present in large quantities, and 
potentially disrupts your power if suddenly introduced into warped space. If Times 
Square was empty it would be your personal playground, but when its in the middle of 
rush hour you'd be limited to ""just"" warping it into a loop, or basic widening/shortening 
of space. Lesser quantities of living matter still has an effect, but only enough to prevent 
you from turning somebody into a human pretzel. Has extremely large range that only 
grows with the lack of living beings in the area."
200CP,Transporter,Worm,"While technically a Thinker ability, it's use means we're putting it 
over here. You basically have full-fledged Contessa level Path to Victory...as long as said 
victory is getting something from point A to B. These are always the quickest, safest, and 
most efficient ways to do so unless you specifically wish otherwise. As long as it is in 
some way possible for you to do so, you can, and do it perfectly. Thinker headaches are 
also a thing. Anything beyond transporting a target to its destination is beyond the scope 
of this power, although that doesn’t mean that clever thinking can’t make this of this 
offensively in combat. Bullet A into Person’s Brain B is transportation after all. Just 
remember that these targets have to be physical things, so don’t try any conceptual or 
wordplay bullshit to game this power. "
200CP,Warp Spasm,Worm,"By activating your power you are able to enter a berserker rage that 
warps you into a monstrous and incredibly destructive form wreathed in fire and 
lightning. This transformation continues to build over time, with no upper limit as long as 
you don’t calm down, and have the stimulus to feed your aggression. Lacking actual 
meaningful danger will cause your growth to stall, while lacking any form of conflict or 
stress will cause your power to reverse its effects quickly. This rage doesn’t impede your 
intelligence, skills, awareness, or cunning, perhaps even sharpening them as time goes 
on, but while you are in this state the only methods you can bring yourself to use involve 
violence, aggression, and destruction. You can snap yourself out of this rage at any time 
you want, although this doesn’t stop you from losing yourself in it if you are not careful. 
The exact details of your monstrous state is up to you, whether you want it to be a 
demonic winged monster, dragon like, or something else. The intense heat and electric 
discharge you are generating is controllable by you, and gets stronger as you do."
200CP,Avalanche,X-Men Evolution,"You generate powerful seismic waves from your hands which can cause 
highly destructive effects. These waves cause any form of inorganic matter to shatter or crumble 
to dust. When directed at large objects, like a building or the Earth itself, these waves create 
effects similar to those of an avalanche or an earthquake within localized areas. With enough 
time spent you’ll crumble entire skyscrapers with your quakes.  This gives you a limited degree 
of geokinesis as well given the waves can be used to create thrusting pillars of rock for ranged 
attacks, create trenches or earthquakes, and even redirect earth-based substances to an extent."
200CP,Boom Boom,X-Men Evolution,"You create orbs of plasma, fiery-like energy which often takes the form of 
yellow and orange spheres, which range in size from marbles to large beach balls. These 
spheres can be then detonated within a 2-10 second time period after being created. These 
bombs explode with concussive force, but the amount of power depends on the size of the 
bombs you create, from palm-sized ones creating small pops to larger ones generating massive 
explosions. You can reabsorb the bombs if need be and are immune to their explosive effects. "
200CP,Healing Factor,X-Men Evolution,"You possess a high-rate of cellular regeneration with far greater speed 
and efficiency than a normal human. This healing factor allows you to heal from superficial to 
deep and serious wounds in a couple seconds along with missing limbs or anything internal in a 
at most a minute. Even falling from an airplane, landing face first on the ground, and breaking 
every bone in your body won’t keep you down for more a few seconds. This regeneration also 
makes you immune to all forms of illnesses, poisons, and diseases. You are nigh-impervious to 
age & cellular decay via constant cellular regeneration so expect to live a few centuries in your 
prime before starting to see slimmest glance of aging. "
200CP,Molecular Acceleration,X-Men Evolution,"You take the potential energy stored in an object and can 
convert it to pure light, kinetic energy, thus “charging” that item with highly explosive results. The 
only real limit of this ability is the time required to charge as the larger the object is, the more 
time it takes to charge with most charging taking place through direct skin contact. The power of 
the explosions is dependent on the mass of the object you are charging, as a charged playing 
card explodes with the force of a grenade while a bus will cause a huge explosion. You can also 
accelerate an object's kinetic energy instead of converting its potential energy; for example, 
charging a Bo staff with enough kinetic energy will have enough power to level a house."
200CP,Red Beams,X-Men Evolution,"Your body is able to absorb certain types of electromagnetic energy such as 
light and internally metabolizes it. At your command, you can then release a red ruby beam of 
destruction from your hands or eyes. At first, this destructive power is enough to destroy cars 
and tanks but with training you'll be able to destroy entire asteroids like Asteroid M."
200CP,Shapeshifting,X-Men Evolution,"You can alter the formation of your cells allowing you to shapeshift into 
any human, animal, humanoid or semi-humanoid being of either sex. This power can lets you 
mimic any kind of clothing, as well as other materials, producing shoes, glasses, watches, etc. 
You are able to imitate retinas, fingerprints, scent and voice patterns perfectly. While you won’t 
replicate powers you can mimic the physical capabilities of whatever form you take, gaining the 
power of flight as a bird, fangs, and claws as a wolf, etc. 
With training or time, you’ll gain the ability to split into multiple shapes, such as a swarm of bats, 
gaggle of snakes, or several scorpions. You could even disguise yourself as a puddle of water, 
liquify parts of your body to avoid attacks, regrow new limbs, reshape your body to flatten, 
stretch out and expand, and can change your body to have claws or hammers for hands. The 
general rule is that you can go no smaller than a mouse and no bigger than a fairly large bear. 
Finally you have a template of who you originally were at all times. "
200CP,Spyke,X-Men Evolution,"Congrats on getting a self-replicating exoskeleton. These incredibly-dense bones 
can be extended, retracted, and fired from nearly any point on your body in varying sizes. Your 
body instantly seals the wounds and heals the bone projections. With some training or time 
you’ll learn how to heat up the ends of the spikes you produce to increase their  damage and 
make them pierce or cut through steel. In addition, you can form an almost-indestructible 
exoskeleton on the upper and lower body, which will protect you from high caliber bullets along 
with being able to climb up walls."
200CP,Bone Spikes,X-Men Movies,"You can fire bones the size of railway spikes from your wrist at just under the speed of sound. Holes painlessly open and close in your skin for this, meaning you don't have to worry about 
tearing wounds into your hand every time you use your power. "
200CP,Phasing,X-Men Movies,"You can become intangible at-will, and stay that way as long as you can go without 
breathing. You can bring other people or items with you while phasing, but doing so is tiring. If you 
solidify while in inorganic material, the material in the space you're inhabiting will be displaced into 
another dimension or something, but if you do so while inside another living creature you'll create a 
horrible fusion of flesh - do not reccomend. "
200CP,Precognition,X-Men Movies,"You've got a built-in danger sense. You'll feel a tingly sensation whenever something 
bad is about to happen to you, and while you won't consciously know what's about to happen, this 
power is tuned into your reflexes - meaning that, unless you consciously prevent it from doing so, it'll 
automatically make you move to dodge or counter whatever's about to happen, even if you don't have 
time to process it. "
200CP,Super Vision,X-Men Movies,"You have the ability to see the entirety of the EM Spectrum, telescopic vision, and the ability to see through objects and people. You can switch between any of these and normal eyesight 
at-will, and can also adjust the specifics of them. "
200CP,Venom Claws,X-Men Movies,"You can extend your nails into three inch long claws capable of shredding stone. In 
addition, they're coated in a potent venom capable of paralyzing a man in seconds."
200CP,Wall-Crawling,X-Men Movies,"Spider-Man, Spider-Man, does what only a...what's that? Sorry. I've been informed 
I'm not allowed to mention that there, due to copyright infringement. In any case, you gain the ability to 
reorient your personal gravity to treat any surface the way you'd normally treat the ground. You'll never 
be disoriented by hanging upside down, and you can run sideways on a wall as easily as you normally 
could on a floor. In addition, you can double-up on the effects of this to root yourself in place - stay on a 
car speeding down the interstate or even a plane in flight. "
200CP,Animalistic,X-Men the Claremont Years,"There’s something a little bestial about you. You
possess superhuman senses, hearing which is notably beyond a human’s, and a sense of
smell which shames most dogs. In addition you find that your strength, stamina,
durability, and agility are all increased to peak human, perhaps even a touch above,
levels. By the standards of super strength around here you’ll be fairly weak - even
Proudstar is stronger - but it still will give you the leg up compared to your non-powered
peers. If you desire you may also have clawed fingertips and sharper teeth.
If you bought this power at a discount you may also buy Healing Factor at a discount."
200CP,Famine,X-Men the Claremont Years,"You gain the ability to project from your hands a cloud-like beam of energy which rots crops and withers organic materials,
causing living creatures to take on an emancipated and starved appearance while also
weakening them. Inorganic materials can be used as a shield against this material - like a
piece of aluminum wielded as a shield."
200CP,Human-form Shapeshifting,X-Men the Claremont Years,"Like Mystique you are an accomplished shapeshifter able to take on a wide variety of human forms. You gain no
special powers from these forms, only gross physical changes, and while you do not need
to remain identical in mass and volume you must remain close."
200CP,Immovability,X-Men the Claremont Years,"While your feet are planted on the ground you cannot be moved. You can still be damaged, but your feet will
remain firmly planted on the ground unable to be shifted from where you are standing.
This does not protect you from having the ground moved out from beneath you, or from
being moved if you are flying or airborne. If you bought this power at a discount you may
buy Proudstar or Brute Strength at a discount."
200CP,Luck Discs,X-Men the Claremont Years,"Like the Hellion Roulette you are able to produce red or black discs of probability altering psychic energy. By
throwing one of the red discs you cause something fortunate to happen for the target, and
by throwing one of the black discs you cause misfortune. Unfortunately there are
limitations; not only do you have to hit the target or instigator of the fortune/misfortune
with the disc, as far as probability manipulation goes this is one of the weaker ones
sometimes simply not being able to bring forth enough luck to make a difference."
200CP,Lycanthropy,X-Men the Claremont Years,"You gain the ability to turn into an animal of your choice from the size of a medium sized dog to a somewhat larger than a
human, as well as a bipedal hybrid form with that animal. While in this altered form you
gain senses and physical enhancements as from Animalistic, but have no such
improvements when in your normal, presumably human, form.
If you bought this power at a discount you may also buy Healing Factor at a discount.
For an additional -200 CP (discounted if this was) you can go a step further. Like how
Wolfsbane learned to not only transform into a wolf but also a wolf-human hybrid, you
may transform into a merger between 2 or more of your alt-forms taking on a mix of their
traits and qualities. This mix will usually possess somewhat greater physical abilities than
any of the alt-forms would on their own, but be visibly and noticeably inhuman unless all
of the forms could pass for human."
200CP,Proudstar,X-Men the Claremont Years,"Like Thunderbird and his little brother you are simply better. Strong enough to rip steel plating from a jet, with durability to take blows
that could kill a man with only moderate discomfort, hardened skin to help resist bladed
weapons, stamina to function at peak exertion for hours without tiring, and the ability to
extract a greater proportion of oxygen from the air allowing you to go longer without
breathing."
200CP,Riptide,X-Men the Claremont Years,"You have the power to spin your body. You may choose to exclude your head or upper torso from this spin, but as shown in this
period it always ran along the main vertical axis (so no spinning 1 arm). While spinning
you can create a vacuum that pulls things in, or use this spin to launch small objects at
high speed; you could launch shuriken or pieces of metal at velocities sufficient to harm
Living Steel."
200CP,Solar Powered,X-Men the Claremont Years,"Like Sunspot you are able to somehow transform solar radiation into super strength. This is, by default, comparable to
his powers in this period giving strength officially equal to Proudstar, but typically
shown to be somewhat greater although with lesser durability and stamina. Its advantage
lies in the fact that, like with Sunspot, this power can be increased in certain other realms,
such as Asgard, where the sun is mystically more powerful.
If you bought this power at a discount you may also buy Elemental Kinesis (Fire/Solar
Energy) and Flying Brick at discounts to help represent aspects of what Sunspot’s power
would eventually evolve into. If you do so you gain a limited ability to absorb energy of
other types, while this won’t completely protect you from energy attacks it will help, and
resistance to fire."
200CP,Brick,Young Justice,"You are quite strong, Jumper. Like Kaldur, you are capable of lifting a
couple of tons, wielding heavy weapons, and dish blows with heavy hitters for a short
while. While you are far from being a true heavy hitter yourself, you’re still capable of
trading blows with them. (Free for All Races except Humans)

For an additional 200cp, this increases your strength to the level of true heavy hitters,
enough to rival some of the strongest teenage heroes, enough to match Aquaman
(Orin), Superboy, and Wonder Girl. At this level, you can lift tanks, are bullet-proof, and
even heavy artillery fire cannot hurt you. Who knows if Superman was weakened with
red sunlight, you might even break his arm. (Free for Kryptonian Hybrid and Demigod)

For another additional 200cp, this boosts your strength to the level of an Earth-16
Kryptonian under a yellow sun. You can support the weight of an entire building with
ease, casually carry school buses, and even throw giant plants into the sun. (Free for
Kryptonian, Discounted for Demigod)"
200CP,Energy Blast,Young Justice,"Like a certain boy scout, and a great many others, you are
capable of unleashing a destructive blast of energy from some part of your body
(chosen when you take this power, can’t be changed later). By default, this power is
roughly as powerful as Superman’s Heat Vision. Powerful enough to destroy most
Parademons, blast a hole in a ship, and even give Fully Upgraded Bricks a pause. (Free
for Kryptonian)"
200CP,Fire Breath,Young Justice,"Like a certain demon bound to an old knight, you are capable of
breathing fire that can seriously injure even the likes of Superboy and Wonder Girl.
Provided they are tormented to your flames for long enough."
200CP,Frost Breath,Young Justice,"Your lung capacity has increased to allow you to unleash a
powerful breath, capable of blowing even the likes of Superboy and Wonder Girl away
with gale-force winds or quickly freezing them into solid blocks of ice. (Free for
Kryptonian)"
200CP,Healing Factor,Young Justice,"You possess a healing factor. It is potent enough to resist
most infections, effectively fight off alcohol or disease, and let you heal flesh wounds in
minutes, and serious wounds in hours, but it is not powerful enough to regrow organs or
limbs. This also slows down your aging process considerably. (Free for Kryptonian,
Kryptonian Hybrid, Demigod, and Martian)

For an additional 200cp, your healing factor is comparable to Vandal Savage. You are
capable of healing flesh wounds in seconds, serious wounds in minutes, and regrowing
missing organs and limbs in a couple of hours. And to truly kill you, someone would
need to destroy the majority of your body."
200CP,Marine Telepathy,Young Justice,"Like the Current King of Atlantis, you can telepathically
communicate with sea life, delivering warnings of danger, or recruiting their aid in battle.
(Discounted for Atlantean)"
200CP,Martian Blood,Young Justice,"It seems you have been injected with the blood of a Martian,
this allows you to transform into any non-sapient animal you have seen before, even
those who are from outer space. You gain their abilities, and powers, although this
transformation can be overwhelming if an animal has innate rage issues."
200CP,Super Hearing,Young Justice,"You possess superhuman hearing, allowing you to pick up the
faintest of sounds over long distances, as well as high frequencies not audible to regular
humans. Initially, this will start at the range of a city block but can reach the same level
as Earth-16 Superman. (Free for Kryptonian and Kryptonian Hybrid)"
200,Mind Over Matter,Generic Super Academy,"You have one of the classic powers of the mind such as Telekinesis, Telepathy, or 
Clairvoyance. You are able to use these over as wide a range of things as you can sense and 
are primarily limited only by creativity, and the maximum amount of power you can use. 
At Street Tier you can throw cars, mentally link about a dozen people at once and use 
your clairvoyance as a danger sense for a few seconds into the future. To actually control the 
mind of a person would require you to focus all of your psychic might on them exclusively.  
At National Tier you can break smaller buildings and lift houses, you become capable of 
mentally linking hundreds of minds or dominating the minds of dozens. Your clairvoyance allows 
you to see up to a few hours into the future, though it gets less clear the farther you look, and 
you begin to be able to do more esoteric things like using your Telekinesis to simulate having 
super strength or durability, or as a separate sense entirely. You can view memories and 
potentially tamper with them. 
At Global Tier you can use your Telekinesis to lift and destroy entire skyscrapers, you 
are able to link and contact tens of thousands of minds at once and mind control thousands of 
people. Your clairvoyance will stretch months into the future, again being less clear the farther 
you look. The skill you have with your abilities has grown as well allowing you to use them to 
sense things around you and do things like manipulate individual cells of a being. Memory 
modification is now simple to perform, if time consuming to do well. 
At Cosmic Tier you could lift continents, mentally contact entire worlds, or mind control 
billions, given effort. Your clairvoyance now stretches forward for decades into the future, again 
being less clear the farther you look, and your skill and finesse with your powers has allowed 
you to do things like manipulate atoms themselves. You can potentially actively remove yourself 
from the memories of others in real time, giving you a form of ‘mental stealth’."
200,Super Attributes - Mental,Generic Super Academy,"The mental attributes represented here can be narrowed down to three categories. 
These are Intelligence, Wits, and Awareness. Intelligence can be summed up as the ability to 
recognize and perceive the options available to you, alongside the necessary ability to actually 
perform them (intellectually at least). It is general intelligence, not just science and technology. 
Wits however is the ability to determine which option you should actually be taking from the list 
of options available to you, and represents an intuitive ability to recognize good ideas from bad 
ideas and general quick-thinking skills. Awareness is simply a matter of your senses, and 
determines what you can perceive and in what way you can perceive them.  
A person with high Awareness might be able to notice a certain unknown and mysterious 
energy, a person with Intelligence might be able to build a device to study and interact with that 
unknown energy as well as being able to understand the theories about that energy, and a 
person with Wits might realize from the get go that they probably shouldn’t have been poking 
that mysterious energy with a stick in the first place. 
At Street Tier with Intelligence you’re the smartest person in the room (baring other 
super intelligent individuals) at all times, and have an instinctive grasp and understanding of 
science of all kinds and how to use that understanding to create low-tier gadgets and devices, 
for example blaster rifles, low-end power armor suits, etc. You are generally superhuman at any 
intellectual task, such as solving puzzles or pattern recognition. With Wits you have the ability to 
keep calm in even the most calamitous situations, though this calm may seem strange or surreal 
to others that witness it, and intuitively avoid making bad decisions even if you don’t quite know 
why, manifesting as general “hunches” that you should avoid certain actions. With Awareness 
you have senses far beyond the regular human, approaching animals specialized in those 
senses, and additionally may have extra senses such as a sense for where the magnetic poles 
are in relation to you or similar. 
At National Tier in Intelligence you could make robots that any military would pay good 
money to license from you, and are generally on the cutting edge of “regular” science, and just 
beginning to break into “comic book science” such as creating cold guns, personal force fields, 
true ‘stealth’ tech, and similar. You could also develop algorithms to predict large scale human 
behavior or being able to mentally picture and understand objects with more than three or four 
dimensions. With Wits your ability to discern bad ideas from good ones has magnified, and you 
now generally have a fair idea of what the choices you make will lead to in the immediate sense, 
and a general idea of what they might mean long term if you have enough information. With 
Awareness you’ve surpassed the best the animal kingdom can manage and have several 
extranormal senses. You might have ‘x-ray’ vision, the ability to sense lifeforce, or perhaps even 
perceive magic or other supernatural energies directly. You are immune to overstimulation of 
your senses, and can actively “dial in” any sense you have from full strength down to completely shut off. 
At Global Tier in Intelligence you’ve hit the big leagues, able to make personal armor 
suits comparable to modern tank battalions, teleportation grids, mind-control tech, working 
super prisons, weather control devices, and more. You could actually understand quantum 
mechanics with ease, and even the most complex mathematics are as simple as addition and 
subtraction to you. With Wits you now intuitively understand the immediate consequences of 
your actions in detail, and can narrow down the objectively ‘best’ option you are aware of in a 
combat relevant timeframe. Your long term predictions are also much more accurate in general 
so long as you’ve got access to enough information to formulate an initial guess. With 
Awareness you could hear someone cry for help across a country, make out the fine details of 
tiny insects from miles away, and have a general awareness and perception of your 
surroundings for hundreds of meters in every direction. At this level you can no longer be 
surprised short of effects that originate in places beyond the range of your senses (such as 
someone teleporting something next to you from a place you can’t perceive). Further your 
senses work in conditions and at ranges where they really shouldn’t, such as being able to hear 
a bullet when it is actually fired, rather than after the bullet has reached you. 
At Cosmic Tier with Intelligence you are one of the smartest beings in the universe, 
compared to titans of intellect such as Reed Richards, Dr. Doom, or Brainiac. There are 
practically no limits to the devices and technologies you could create given time, study, and 
resources, or the theories or concepts you could discover. You could eventually safely 
comprehend non-Euclidean objects and the thought processes of eldritch abominations, just by 
building and applying the proper mental models. With Wits you now know, instantly and with 
absolute certainty, the objectively best option you could take in any situation, and have an 
intuitive understanding of what each possible option will lead to in the immediate and short term 
future. You no longer need actual information to base your guesses off of in the short term, 
having certain feelings of uncertain origin whenever something is about to happen that you 
otherwise couldn’t possibly have planned for or predicted. With Awareness you could hear 
people talking on Earth while you’re on the Moon, with the rest of your senses equivalently 
boosted, and there is practically nothing beyond your ability to sense short of similarly Cosmic 
stealth based powers and abilities."
200,Super Attributes - Physical,Generic Super Academy,"The physical attributes represented here can be narrowed down to three categories. 
Strength, Endurance, and Dexterity. Strength represents physical force and lifting capacity, 
Endurance represents actual endurance, durability, and overall general health. Dexterity 
represents physical agility and dexterity, alongside reflexes, response times, and finesse in the general use of physical abilities. 
At Street Tier with Strength you’re as strong as Spiderman, able to lift and throw cars 
with comparative ease and smash through brick walls. With Endurance you can easily finish a 
strong-man competition without being winded and shrug off small arms and smaller explosives. 
With Dexterity you’ve got fine control enough to perform brain surgery unaided (if you know 
brain surgery), have reflexes dozens of times superior to a regular person, and are 
superhumanly graceful in your movements (though not yet obviously so). 
At National Tier with Strength you can lift and toss around tanks with ease, break 
through the armor of those tanks with little effort, and things tend not to fall apart under their 
own weight when you pick them up though they might suffer superficial damage. With 
Endurance you could potentially go for a week of hard concentrated physical effort without 
flagging, shrug off tank shells and high explosives, and you’re unlikely to get ill from any normal 
disease or sickness. With Dexterity you have near machine like precision, apply exactly the 
amount of force you intend to with any physical action you take, your reflexes allow you to 
simulate bullet-time and your movements, when you want them to, are obvious in their superhuman grace and precision. 
At Global Tier in Strength you could pick up and throw an aircraft carrier and smash 
through even the most fortified bunker virtually effortlessly. With Endurance you could shrug off 
small nuclear devices and no longer feel fatigue from physical labor no matter how much you 
indulge in, you are utterly immune to any mundane disease or sickness. With Dexterity your 
precision is beyond even that of a machine, capable of precision movements even at the atomic 
scale (if for some reason you needed to do something like that), it is impossible to throw you off 
your balance no matter what conditions you are put in, and you can actively dodge bullets after 
they’ve been fired. At this level you can selectively ignore certain physical laws and can walk normally on walls or ceilings. 
At Cosmic Tier in Strength you could shatter tectonic plates with your punches. With 
Endurance you could endure repeated blows from someone with the Cosmic version of Strength 
and have functionally infinite physical stamina. With Dexterity you are capable of absolute 
precision control of your physical movements and abilities at any scale, could potentially dodge 
even relativistic projectiles if you are aware of them, and can perform feats of agility and 
dexterity that should be flat out impossible such as running on air."
200,Super Attributes - Social,Generic Super Academy,"The social attributes represented here can be narrowed to three categories. 
Manipulation, Charisma, and Appearance. Manipulation is the ability that governs being able to 
manipulate other people to do as you desire, to lie, to fool, to trick, and to otherwise cajole 
people into doing things for you in an underhanded manner. Charisma is the ability to get 
people to do things for you and to follow you without underhanded methods, raw force of 
personality, straightforward social acumen, and convincing people to do things based on the merit of that thing.  
Appearance is perhaps as simple as it gets, and is a representation of your actual looks. 
This differs from the Most Common Superpower in that you are genuinely and actually 
supernaturally attractive, and can easily have knock-on effects with the other social attributes. 
At Street Tier in Manipulation you could easily enough run circles around groups of 
professional con-men without them having even a hint of awareness. With Charisma you could 
potentially lead or organize a group of downtrodden and hopeless people to believe in whatever 
you want them to believe given a bit of time and even the slightest shred of evidence that what 
you’re saying isn’t just empty words. With Appearance you are simply the most beautiful person 
anyone has seen (that doesn’t also have Super Appearance). People walking into things on 
accident when you walk down the street are common occurrences and your looks naturally draw the eye of others. 
At National Tier in Manipulation you could run rings around groups like the CIA, NSA, 
and other intelligence agencies, having them believe just about whatever you want them to 
believe, knowing just how to set things up to have them lead to the conclusions you want them 
to have with a bit of set up and effort. With Charisma you could easily be the most popular 
President or leader to ever live, winning hearts and minds with wild abandon. With Appearance 
it is entirely possible to cause traffic accidents just by being near a road, and people cannot help 
but rubberneck when they see you. You further gain the ability to slowly ‘adjust’ your looks to 
appear like different ethnic groups, and can even “tone down” your beauty to less awe inspiring levels. 
At Global Tier in Manipulation you could rig the US Elections while working as a 
bartender in South America doing nothing more than talking with your bar patrons, and can pass 
off impossible lies without proof so long as nothing is actively and obviously contradicting you. 
With Charisma you could be elected World Leader with a near universal approval rating if you 
tried, and could convince just about anyone to take your words on faith alone. With Appearance 
your looks are so incredible that just the memory of you is enough to drive others to distraction, 
and your good points are highlighted in the perceptions of others while potential downsides 
(such as height, weight, skin color, etc) are downplayed or ignored. At this level your 
super-social attributes even work through recordings. 
At Cosmic Tier in Manipulation you’re basically Thanos but without the self-sabotage. 
You could set up long reaching plans and manipulations that are all but self sustaining and 
could manipulate impossible amounts of people into believing whatever you want. With enough 
effort you could even convince someone of something despite active and immediate evidence to 
the contrary. With Charisma you could easily be elected Emperor Of Space For Life, and have 
the social presence and acumen to either keep all your subjects happy or at least convince 
them that they’re happy. With Appearance you are impossibly beautiful on a level that you could 
ensnare people if they get even a single glimpse of your person. Instant adoration and love/lust 
is all but assured for any but the most legendarily willful and stubborn, and in their memory you 
stand out as being a figure of perfection so great that it actively ruins their ability to appreciate 
lesser beauties, as they forever know they will never see anything else as lovely as you."
300CP,Super-Soldier,Batman Arkham Knight,"They said the procedure failed… mostly… mainly because it didn’t succeed in its original goal.
You have been subjected to an experimental medical procedure designed to render you immune
to truth serums. It… didn’t quite give the expected result. Your physiology has been augmented,
making you strong enough to lift up to two tons without effort, run at 65 mph and swim at up to
25 Knots. In addition, you’re now agile and reflexive enough to dodge most strikes from normal
opponents, and even dodge bullets with enough warning or catch a fly in midair with a pair of
chopsticks. Your senses have been heavily enhanced as well, all of them pushed well beyond
the capacity of a normal human’s. Finally, your enhanced biology grants you vastly accelerated
natural healing abilities. This allows you to completely regenerate lost or damaged tissues in
several moments. Your physical condition is constantly kept at its peak thanks to your
regeneration constantly reverting you to a healthy state, granting you nigh-inexhaustible stamina
and vitality. On top of this, you are effectively immune to almost all known poisons, toxins,
viruses, bacteria, and even radiation. Unfortunately, you are not totally immune to truth serums."
300CP,Body Mastery,City of Heroes,"You hone your physical control and muscle memory to fine tune your accuracy. You also gain the 
ability to use your powers with the least amount of energy spent, strike your opponents with the exact 
amount of movement and energy you wish to place into each attack and... Umm... you get lazer eyes for some reason."
300CP,Elemental Masteries,City of Heroes,"Despite the name of this power set, it will only give you basic and limited control over the element of 
your choice. If paired with a true elemental power set then it will synergize to allow for finer control over 
that particular element. Choose one of the following: Fire, Electricity, Darkness, Force, Sonic, Water, 
Cold, Earth and Psionics. You gain a few tricks with the chosen element but not enough for it to stand 
entirely on it's own. Can be purchased multiple times. "
300CP,Experimentation,City of Heroes,"With this, you've twisted your genetics and have the power to twist others with complex operations and 
injections. Off the bat, you start off with just above peak human speed and reflexes due to the muscle 
fibers and adrenal glands you've added to yourself. As an added precaution, you carry failed mutagens on 
your person to toss at enemies, these have a wide variety of debilitating effects from blindness to straight 
up bubbling skin away."
300CP,Force of Will,City of Heroes,"Rather than boost your Willpower, this set turns it into a weapon. You can use bursts of Will as bolts of 
force and you are able to demoralize your opponents with your sheer bravado. Your ability to leap is also 
increased and when you master your Force of Will you can unlock an ability that gives you a minute of 
doubled strength and speed once per day. "
300CP,Cloning/Duplication,Generic Super Academy,"You have the ability to multiply yourself in some way. This could be an innate power, you 
could have a flash-cloning device implanted in you, maybe it is a spell, or you are summoning 
doubles from extremely similar alternate realities. Regardless, your clones will obey your 
commands, will flawlessly coordinate with you, and will always acknowledge you as the original. 
They appear around you, spreading out as space fills and they possess all of your abilities 
except this one and they possess any items that you are wearing or holding, up to your own 
mass in weight, but these items disappear if taken from the clone. A clone that is killed is 
unavailable until it regenerates, which takes about an hour, but that time can be lessened by 
Regeneration powers or abilities. Fanwank responsibly, please. 
At Street Tier you can create up to two full copies of yourself that can last as long as you 
wish, or up to twenty copies that can only last up to thirty minutes before disappearing in some way. 
At National Tier you can create up to twenty copies of yourself that can last as long as 
you wish, or up to one hundred copies that can only last up to thirty minutes before disappearing 
in some way. You also possess a full hive mind with your clones and can freely share their memories. 
At Global Tier you can create up to fifty copies of yourself that can last as long as you 
wish, or up to five hundred copies that can only last up to one hour before disappearing in some 
way. Also, you can switch places with any of your copies with just a moment of concentration. 
At Cosmic Tier you can create up to one hundred copies of yourself that can last as long 
as you wish, or up to one thousand copies that can only last up to one hour before disappearing 
in some way. Any of your clones can become the new real you if your original body is 
destroyed, meaning you can only truly die if all copies are dead."
300CP,Elemental Kinesis,Generic Super Academy,"You have the ability to control, manipulate, and generate a specific natural element. 
Examples include fire, water, air, earth, lightning, light, plants, metal, etc. Nothing truly exotic, 
that’s a different power. You may buy this multiple times for different elements. 
At Street Tier a person with the fire element could easily act as a human flamethrower, 
and a water user could generate and manipulate water on the level of a powerful fire hose or 
water-cannon such as might be found on an anti-riot vehicle. 
At National Tier a wind user might be able to fly and knock down houses with 
concentrated gusts, and Earth users could create large sinkholes, break apart buildings easily, 
and send huge boulders flying through the air, while Light users could fire off huge lasers and 
simulate super-speed by briefly shifting into light. Master Avatar the Last Airbender elemental 
benders are often at this level. 
At Global Tier a plant user could potentially overrun a city with vines and plant life given 
a bit of time, a metal user could conjure up and shape huge amounts of (regular) metals for all 
sorts of different purposes similar to an Earth user such that creating a replica of the golden 
gate bridge (if they had the right architectural skills and knowledge) would not be out of the 
realm of possibility. The ability to become a living golem of your Element is possible at this level. 
At Cosmic Tier depending on your element you might be able to flood worlds, set 
atmospheres on fire, shift tectonic plates, overrun entire planets with plant life, or possibly send 
forth gargantuan torrents of lightning and light that could scour worlds down to the bedrock 
given a bit of time and effort."
300CP,Exotic Force Manipulation,Generic Super Academy,"You have the ability to control, manipulate, and generate a specific force, energy, or 
concept, such as magnetism, gravity, the strong or weak nuclear force, temperature, time, 
space, darkness, holy energy, corruption, or weather. You may buy this multiple times for 
different forces. You have an intuitive understanding of the force you control. 
At Street Tier this force can be powerful enough to easily destroy a large automobile or 
can shield against similar attacks. Manipulation of the energy is basic, not allowing for fine 
control. 
At National Tier this force can destroy buildings, create powerful protections, or allow 
manipulation at the same level as a human hand. At this level, this force can often be used for 
flight, usually topping out around 100mph. 
At Global Tier this force could be unleashed on an entire city, calling up massive storms 
or crushing things in extreme gravity. Fine control is at the microscopic level, and you can easily 
sense the force you control, detecting gravity or magnetic fields. At this level you are immune to 
direct harm from the force you control. 
At Cosmic Tier you could warp the magnetic field of an entire planet, drag the moon out 
of orbit with your gravity, permanently alter the weather patterns, or similar feats. You can 
control this force at the subatomic level and detect it clearly enough to replace your regular 
senses."
300CP,Exotic Striker,Generic Super Academy,"You have an ability that requires you to touch your target. This could be a corrosive 
touch, a healing effect, power suppression, vicious adamantium claws, or a variety of other 
things. These effects are often more powerful or more versatile than ranged attacks at the same 
power Tier. This can be taken multiple times. 
 At Street Tier this could be a powerful stunning or paralyzing touch. It could be a healing 
touch capable of closing wounds and stabilizing critical patients, or a corrosive touch on the 
same level as sulfuric acid, or perhaps a set of claws or talons capable of piercing steel. 
At National Tier you could lock someone in time and space relative to the planetary body, 
restore a severely injured person to full health, or eat through steel like it was cotton candy. 
At Global Tier these effects are often more versatile. This could transform a person into 
an animal, function as biokinesis, disintegrate any normal form of matter, or turn off powers of 
equal or lesser potency. 
At Cosmic Tier this could transmute matter at the atomic level, disintegrate even 
supposedly indestructible super-materials, disrupt enchantments laid down by the gods, or turn 
matter into antimatter."
300CP,Illusion,Generic Super Academy,"You have the ability to project illusions. This could be sophisticated holographic 
projectors, illusion magic, psychic sensory manipulation, or light manipulation. This power 
comes with whatever creative talent needed to make them believable. You have perfect mental 
visualization and enhanced creativity no matter what tier of this power you have. 
At Street Tier this limited to a single sense at a time. You can create your illusions 
anywhere you have line-of-sight, and they can be as large as a single-story suburban home or 
the equivalent for senses other than sight. Anyone in the area can perceive the illusion. You 
must keep some attention on an illusion to maintain it, causing illusions to fall if you are asleep, 
unconscious, being tortured, or something similarly distracting. 
At National Tier you can affect the five common senses all at once, and your illusion can 
be as large as you wish, though you must have line-of-sight on the whole thing. You can also 
program movements for the illusion to make, and the illusion will persist without constant attention. 
At Global Tier you can affect any sense a human has, as well as any sense you 
personally possess. Illusions can react and move as if they were the object, creatures or 
otherwise that they appear to be, and you can choose who does and does not perceive the 
illusion. You can make illusions so believable that people react as if they were real when 
interacting with them, such as feeling the heat from a dragon’s breath or the pain of a woman’s 
slap. Illusory attacks could cause someone to feel pain or go unconscious. The illusions still do 
not have actual physical substance. 
At Cosmic Tier you can affect senses you do not share and can create illusions that 
stretch out of your own sensory range, as long as you can perceive where the illusion starts 
from. You could cover an entire planet if you chose to do so. You can also make smaller 
illusions that are so believable that a person killed by them will actually die. Finally, you can 
make small, simple illusions that are real enough to fool reality itself, allowing you to create 
non-living objects that can be up to a single-story suburban home in size, and can function as 
long as you have a good idea of how the real object would work."
300CP,Ranged Blaster,Generic Super Academy,"You have the ability to send out blasts of energy, or perhaps some sort of kinetic attack, 
as you desire. These are almost always abilities and powers focused on the application of 
destruction force, but not always. A healing ray is a viable choice instead of a laser cannon, 
though the specifics of your power must be determined at the start of power creation. Your rate 
of fire can either be a slightly less powerful, but continuous, beam or instead individual shots 
that usually take a second or two to charge up, though higher Tiers may be able to increase that 
firing speed. All tiers have precision control of their blasts level of strength, from full power to 
barely more than a light tap. This can be taken multiple times. 
At Street Tier your blasts can core straight through cars and the walls of your average 
building, with a range comparable to a modern rifle. 
At National Tier your blasts can gut tanks, and could hit out to the horizon. They might 
have active tracking effects at this point, or be formed of exotic energies that make traditional 
defenses less useful. 
At Global Tier your blasts could sink battleships and tear through skyscrapers, and you 
could hit someone in California from New York if you were aware of them. Your blasts can 
potentially make hard turns at this level, and might be able to split up into smaller and less 
powerful blasts or beams to hit larger areas or make dodging more difficult. At this level you 
have much greater control over the effects of your blasts, and could do things like making lasers 
that freeze, burn, stun, disorient, or other sorts of effects, not unlike the hero and Triumvirate 
member Legend from Worm. 
At Cosmic Tier you’re basically rocking out Omega Beams like what Darkseid has, your 
attacks are incredibly hard to avoid and only those with Cosmic defenses could hope to resist 
them. Secondary effects of your blasts can have very exotic effects, and their power is enough 
you could Base Delta Zero a planet given a bit of time."
300CP,Shapeshifter,Generic Super Academy,"You have the ability to alter your physical form, gaining the physical capabilities of this 
new shape. You could be a werewolf, the avatar of some cosmic energy linking all animal life, a 
macro-sized sentient virus capable of taking virtually any form, a liquid metal robot or a number 
of other things. Basic use of a new form, such as standing and moving around, is instinctive. 
The single alternate form versions of this power can be taken multiple times. 
 At Street Tier you can either take on the forms of beings mostly similar to you in mass 
and shape, such as being able to look like a different person, or you have a single alternate 
shape that can be substantially different, such as taking on the form of a specific animal or 
machine. Other options are to be able to decrease your body’s density, turning you into a gas, 
or to increase it, making you as tough and sturdy as stone. 
 At National Tier you could change into any of a group of forms, such as any animal or 
any plant, or be able to alter your shape at will as long as you maintain the same mass, like 
growing claws or wings. Other options are to be able to decrease your body’s density, making 
you incorporeal to physical effects but still affected by energy, or to increase it, making you as 
tough and sturdy as steel or diamond. 
At Global Tier you can change into virtually anything made of matter, with mass no 
longer being an issue or have single alternate form that is more exotic, such as stable such as 
being made of light or pure magic. Alternately, you could change into a large swarm of creatures 
and maintain a single mind in control of them. Another option is to be able to both decrease your 
body’s density, turning you incorporeal, and increase it, making you incredibly tough and sturdy 
beyond most known materials. 
At Cosmic Tier your form can be virtually anything, including energy, and can change at 
will. You could be a ball of light or a wave of gravity, or even something that technically does not 
exist, such as a field of darkness."
300CP,Super Speed,Generic Super Academy,"You have the ability to go fast, effectively making you what is frequently referred to as a 
“speedster”, in comics parlance. You have the requisite reflexes to use your speed no matter 
what tier you are at, though these boosted reflexes are only in effect when actively using your 
speed. You also never get tired while running. If you have some other form of exotic movement, 
such as flight, this power works in conjunction with it. 
At Street Tier you can run at several hundred miles an hour, and no longer need to worry 
about the potential downsides of moving at super speed no matter how fast you go. Your 
metabolism ensures you always stay fit and lean, regardless of how many calories you take in. 
At National Tier you are easily supersonic in speed, and can safely move other people 
and objects around with you while moving about. 
At Global Tier you are hypersonic, and objects you interact with may, at your discretion, 
have the kinetic force of your speed transferred into them. You might break your hand punching 
a wall, but that wall would turn into high velocity shrapnel. You have absolute control over this 
effect, meaning you’ll never accidently use it. 
At Cosmic Tier you are a genuine knock-off Speed Force Speedster, comparable to the 
Flash. You can easily run faster than light and can do all sorts of speed related tricks similar to 
what the Flash might do, potentially including (not terribly accurate) time travel. This does not 
make the Speed Force (or similar, like Quickness Force or whatever) a thing in your setting, 
though it could if you want it to. By default, the assumption is that you have powers similar, but 
not precisely the same mechanically, as the Flash."
300CP,Technopathy,Generic Super Academy,"The power to control technology via supernatural methods, typically shown as similar to 
telepathy but working on machines, though obviously you may decide to have it operate 
differently. The primary focus of this power is to control and usurp technological devices to 
serve your own ends. All tiers of this power grant the user an intuitive understanding of the 
workings of the technology being manipulated and enhanced multi-tasking, increasing in depth 
and scope in terms of the speed of understanding and the number of things the user can focus on the higher the tier. 
At Street Tier you could easily crack any mundane computer security given a bit of effort, 
and can ‘connect’ with technology up to a hundred feet away from yourself, you can focus on 
about a dozen things at a time, and you could reasonably discern the workings of any purely 
mundane technology within a few moments, and low-end super-gadgetry given a few minutes to concentrate. 
At National Tier you could make a good run at understanding and subverting low-end 
“super” technology in a combat relevant timeframe, and face no trouble at all when dealing with 
purely mundane devices. At this level you’ve unlocked low-end telekinesis specifically useful 
only for interacting with technology, such as pressing buttons or moving levers on mechanical 
devices. Your range caps out at around a thousand feet away from you, and you can focus on 
several hundred processes at once. 
At Global Tier your range is increased to a distance of several miles, and you can 
potentially extend this range via networked devices. You can disable and subvert AI at this point 
if you’re careful about it, alongside mid-level supertech, and your technological-telekinesis has 
shifted to the point you can cobble together semi-haphazard devices from random bits and 
bobs, so long as you’ve got roughly the right amount and type of materials and know what 
you’re trying to put together, and you can split your focus thousands of times over. 
At Cosmic Tier you are the (metaphorical) god in the machine. Your range could easily 
cover an entire planet, and only the most powerful AI or similar digital entities could hope to stall 
or stymie you, letting you use your abilities on all but the most extreme hypertech with near 
impunity. Your technological-telekinesis is precise enough at this level that so long as you’ve got 
some base materials to work with you could readily construct even super-tech devices without 
the need for tools, workshops, clean-rooms, or similar such things assuming you have the 
requisite knowledge. Your multitasking at this point is sufficient that you could run the logistics of an entire planet by yourself."
300CP,Teleportation,Generic Super Academy,"The ability to move from one place to another without crossing the intervening distance. 
You may either personally teleport or you may create portals, but the other version is discounted, including Tier costs. 
At Street Tier you can teleport to any place within one hundred meters of your current 
location, either via a personal teleport or the creation of a short lived portal made immediately adjacent to you. 
At National Tier you may teleport to any location within line of sight or a place that you 
are extremely familiar with, or create a portal within ten meters of you to achieve the same effect 
which will last for a few moments if you want it to. 
At Global Tier you can teleport to any place you’ve been or can perceive, and your 
portals last as long as you concentrate on them. At this level you can potentially teleport or 
portal to other nearby dimensions, if such exist, perform (small) group teleports, and are 
immune to being telefragged or other teleporting accidents. You may additionally telefrag 
others, though beings and things with exotic defenses might be able to ignore or resist the attempt. 
At Cosmic Tier you can teleport anywhere so long as you have at least some minimal 
awareness of it (a picture or description is good enough), ignore most things that would normally 
stop your teleports from working, perform large group teleports, and can create free-standing 
portals that last as long as you want them to without needing to concentrate. These portals can 
be formed independent of your location, such as creating a portal near an ally to let them go 
somewhere else, even if you don’t specifically know where they are as the description of “near 
my ally” is good enough to work. Your telefrags work on just about anything without a comparably Cosmic defense."
300CP,Time Travel,Generic Super Academy,"You are capable of traveling backwards and forwards in time. You may either personally 
time-port or you may create portals, but the other version is discounted, including Tier costs. 
Your time travel always occurs at the location you are physically at, or the nearest available safe 
place if your destination spot is uninhabitable. To combine both time and space travel, you must 
buy Teleportation as well, but in that case they count as a single power, so you only have to pay the Tier costs once. 
At Street Tier you may travel backwards and forwards a short distance in time, up to 
several days at most. You have an exact sense of your position in the timestream and a perfect 
clock in your head. You are also immunized vs. any time paradoxes that you may cause to 
yourself by careless or clumsy actions in the past. You cannot use multiple jumps to exceed your maximum range. 
At National Tier you may travel backwards and forwards longer distances in time, up to a 
century. Your immunity from time paradoxes extends to full timestream protection; you become 
immune to being retroactively un-existed and if your personal timeline is changed by either your 
actions or any others, you will remember both versions. You may make multiple jumps to go 
further back or forwards than you can reach in a single jump, but you can only do so a limited 
number of times before you start getting too deep into the timestream to navigate safely. 
At Global Tier you may travel backwards and forwards over a span of time measured in 
millennia. Pretty much the entire span of recorded history or the distant future is available to 
you. You may start to explore alternate timelines but not other dimensions. Your only limit on 
multi-jumps is now is your endurance and your patience. 
At Cosmic Tier you put the TARDIS to shame. The full reaches of time are available to 
you, all the way back to the Big Bang and forward to the heat death of the universe. You can 
reach any alt-timeline even remotely conceivable for your local multiverse. You are conceptually 
immune to temporal manipulation of any kind that you find inconvenient. You can make as many 
jumps as you want but since you can hit any-when from any-when in a single leap, you won't often need to."
300CP,Darkwing II,Invincible,"You have the ability to teleport 
through shadows. Each and every shadow that exists 
around you can be used as a portal to the 
Shadowverse, a parallel dimension that now attaches 
to every universe you visit. The Shadowverse attaches 
all shadows to each other through it in the universe, 
allowing you to gain the appearance of teleporting 
through the shadows as in reality you move to the 
Shadowverse where distance is meaningless and can 
pop out through any shadow in existence. The 
Shadowverse is a featureless black expanse inhabited by invisible Shadow 
Creatures, strong enough to kill young Viltrumites, and with some time even 
veteran Viltrumites. Normally they would attack you as well, but thanks to jump 
fiat they now ignore you. 
For an extra 400 cp, you now gain the ability to summon Shadow Creatures at 
will into reality, and they appear as pitch black moving silhouettes. After gaining 
this new power you have absolute control over all Shadow Creatures both inside 
and outside of the Shadowverse. "
300CP,Martian Man,Invincible,"You have gained the ability to shapeshift in a huge way: 
you can alter your appearance as well as mold your body into new and fantastic 
forms. You can alter the shape of your body in any way and 
into pretty much any organic substance, allowing you to do 
things like grow gills to breathe underwater or grow wings 
and alter yourself to fly. This power comes with a pocket 
dimension full of mass that you can add or subtract from in 
order to aid you in your shapeshifting. There are a few 
thousand pounds here that you can put to use or that you 
can feed any amount desired into. Any mass that gets 
destroyed from this dimension regenerates in 24 hrs. These 
shapeshifting skills allow you to change yourself into other 
matter and colours allowing you to disguise yourself as a 
vacuum cleaner or similar if you so desire.  "
300CP,Power Plex,Invincible,"​You are able to absorb energy of any 
sort and convert it into electricity at your discretion. Explosion, 
kinetic energy, really anything can be absorbed and converted 
by you. You are able to contain and control your powers so 
that you do not need any technological aid, and with some 
practice you will even be able to use these powers to fly. The 
blasts of electricity you can create, while extremely powerful, 
tend to not be effective on those with extreme durability, as a 
young Viltrumite would be able to survive you and a veteran 
would barely feel a tickle. You are weak to crushing attacks 
and your powers could potentially overload and turn off if you 
try to absorb something on the level of a nuke in a second. Your powers 
overloading does not directly deal damage to you but they turn off for a few 
minutes and ‘reboot’. "
300CP,Red  Rush,Invincible,"​You have become a 
speedster. Due to an accident when you were a 
teen you gained the ability to move and think at 
massively hypersonic speeds, on par with a 
veteran Viltrumite in an atmosphere. You 
naturally generate an aura that protects you and 
those around you from the effects of your speed, 
while also allowing you to interact with objects 
semi normally. If you punch a concrete wall at 
top speed, your hand would be bruised as if you 
punched a wall while standing still but the wall itself would exploded into shrapnel 
from the sheer kinetic energy. This general augmentation also comes with 
stamina needed to run for immense distances, and lengths of time.  "
300CP,Rex-Splode,Invincible,"​You have been enhanced and 
powered up jumper. Not only have your physical abilities 
been enhanced to just beyond peak human and into 
superhuman for every category, you have also gained the 
ability to charge up objects with explosive energy. You can 
decide how this occurs, whether you had cybernetics 
implanted in you or whether you simply have been 
augmented in a different fashion. When an object is charged 
you can throw it (or run) and then trigger it to explode at will.  The amount of 
energy that can be contained in an object is determined by its size with larger 
objects taking more time and energy to charge while also resulting in a larger 
explosion. "
300CP,Dreams of Sand,Kingdom Come,"Like Sandman, you receive prophetic visions in your sleep, and can use these visions to stop whatever
you see. These dreams will always be helpful, and you might be receiving tips from Dream himself based
on who or what is involved in these visions. He has given you his blessing (Maybe he’s bored and has
decided to help you out on your journey to while away the time). Perhaps you were a fan of Wesley
Dodd’s himself and that is what lead Morpheus himself to bless you. Your body also seems to be able to
produce sand and a natural gaseous sedative at will thanks to this blessing, unless Wes who needed to
invent guns to produce them."
300CP,Flying Brick,Kingdom Come,"You can fly and punch things, and you’re super tough. Bullets just tickle you. That’s basically a standard
package, but unlike Superman you’re not solar powered. You may also choose one power for free out of
the following choices; super speed, super senses, eye beams (Choose between x ray vision or heat
vision) or super breath (choose freeze or fire breath), hand blasts (can range between pure light, holy
blasts, magic blasts, or any other) although if you want to purchase more choices, they cost 50 CP each.
While you will never reach Kryptonian level, you do not need the sun’s rays, kryptonite only affects you it
does a normal human (Repeated exposure will make you sick but only if you keep it around on you for a
long time as it does with humans, other than that it does nothing), and magic does not bypass your
invulnerability."
300CP,Plastic Body,Kingdom Come,"Your body is truly fantastically elastic and plastic! Your bouncy body is hard to harm as a result. Able to
bounce back from most hits and your shapeshifting is second to none. Turning into a fun bouncy ball,
stretch your arms (and rear end, among other body parts) everywhere, bullets bounce off you, is there
nothing you can't do or turn into?"
300CP,Gravity,Marvel's Kid Heroes,"You can negate or increase the effects of gravity on yourself and any person or
object you’re touching. You can sort-of ﬂy with glider wings by
turning the gravity on for a few moments, just mind momentum,
or perform quite the acrobatics by managing your weight. By
increasing gravity you can pin the strongest of opponents, or
by injecting them suddenly via “posi-gee punch” send people
ﬂying. With time and practice, you can learn to affect things
without touching them."
300CP,Husk,Marvel's Kid Heroes,"You can turn your base body into
just about anything. Sand, magma, steel, diamond.  You just have
to shed your skin. And when you’re done, the skin of your new
form peels off revealing you beneath. You can dispense with
minor, surface injuries by shedding your skin, along with dirt
and sweat and so on."
300CP,Powerful,Marvel's Kid Heroes,"You’re really strong. Strong enough the best comparisons people can make are in
relation to Thor or the Hulk, though you’re not quite as
powerful as either.  Yet."
300CP,Prodigy,Marvel's Kid Heroes,"You can either copy the skills and technical or academic knowledge of
others telepathically, or learn skills from seeing them
performed. The ﬁrst requires close proximity while the latter
can work ﬁne through a TV or recording, but does not come with
knowledge, merely physical skill. You do not forget things you
learn this way any slower than you would other things you
learned."
300CP,Roulette,Marvel's Kid Heroes,"You can create discs the size of a frisbee and hurl them. White ones grant incredible
good fortune, black ones curse the target with terrible luck.
The effects only last a couple of minutes, and yes, you can smack
yourself with them."
300CP,Safety First!,Marvel's Kid Heroes,"You can project powerful forceﬁelds, about on a par with the Invisible Woman. These default to
bubble/dome shaped, but can form panes, blades, pillars, etc."
300CP,Slapstick,Marvel's Kid Heroes,"Your body has been reformed into
electroplasma, essentially a living version of the unstable
molecules Reed Richards invented for the Fantastic Four’s
costumes. You are very nearly indestructible, able to stretch or
deform almost endlessly, like an old time cartoon. You also have
a personal hammerspace. In essence, Toonforce."
300CP,Thundercat,Marvel's Kid Heroes,"You can control electricity within a fair radius around yourself,
cannot be harmed by it, can shock people and even manipulate
metal with some effort. At its fullest extent, your electric aura
forms the shape of a great cat around you, and can run, leap and
ﬁght with yourself safely ensconced inside."
300CP,Acceleration,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user is able to temporarily accelerate both their physical
movement speed and perception up to the point that it appears most things around them
simply aren’t moving.
Although in reality this only lasts the barest fraction of a second, the Quirk user by
their perception has several seconds to do whatever they feel like doing, such as throwing
multiple hyper speed punches, disarming enemies who have them surrounded, dodging a
massive attack right at their neck and so on.
The level of heightened speed and perception is so great that there is a small
cooldown between uses where the Quirk must recharge."
300CP,Atmosphere,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user gains incredibly powerful, high capacity, high
efficiency lungs. The complex nature of their lungs and unique attached organs allows them
to synthesize all but the most toxic, deadly gasses breathed in into perfectly safe oxygen.
Conversely, this same system can transform whatever air is inside their lungs into
numerous other gasses and aerosolized chemical cocktails.
With these things in mind, the Quirk user gains super breath that can blow people
off their feet, inhale with vacuum force, puff themselves up with helium to temporarily float,
knock enemies out with sleeping gas, submerge as long as a whale with a single breath and
more.
With all of the Quirk user’s varying abilities being tied to their lungs, they must be
facing enemies for both offense and defense. Even with the super lungs, the Quirk user is
unable to breath while submerged. Sealing the Quirk user’s mouth deprives them of most
applications."
300CP,Auto-Pilot,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user gains a secondary intelligence within their brain that
scans the five senses of the user to the absolute extent of what is possible for them to
perceive, even if the user doesn’t understand the information like it does.
If danger is detected by this intelligence, it will temporarily take over and help the
Quirk user dodge or counter. While less than impressive in words, it offers supernatural
levels of threat and damage avoidance that may see the Quirk user walk away from a stroll
through a battlefield unscathed.
The Quirk user may shut off or suppress their autopilot if needed. The Quirk user
may synchronize with their secondary intelligence, massively enhancing their senses and
processing power for a short time. Synchronization however is extremely taxing on the mind."
300CP,Black Hole,My Hero Academia,"This power allows you to generate small black holes at the tips of your
fingers. The black holes can suck up and disintegrate any matter at the atomic level as well
as certain forms of energy such as light.
This Quirk is highly volatile and can easily be used to kill people or cause large
collateral damage if not regulated properly, or even be turned back on the user."
300CP,Blackjack,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to forcibly bend anything they grab up to
90 degrees without compromising its structural integrity, this can even include people.
An object or person may be bent and crumpled multiple times from different
starting points in order to shape things more intricately. The user may crack their knuckles at
any time to undo their bends and this power’s sustaining of the object’s structural integrity.
The user has one sole weakness of their about, needing to place their hands on both
sides of the object they’re attempting to bend so they can bend it."
300CP,Bottled Lightning,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to manipulate electricity with fine
control, pulling it from their surroundings and flowing it around them for melee range
offense and defense.
While exerting dominance over electricity, it moves relatively slowly and smoothly
around them, appearing more like glowing, rushing water than captured lightning but
maintaining its dangerous qualities and capabilities.
The user of this Quirk is unable to continue manipulating electricity more than a few
meters away from them. They can, however, attempt to release it in a general direction as
an improvised ranged attack, allowing it to retake its natural speed.
The primary limitation is simply getting the electricity together, but that’s not too
difficult as the Quirk user may siphon small amounts of electricity from their own body and
the atmosphere itself.
The dangerous part of this ability is when the user inevitably needs to release their
hoarded electricity, as it becomes dangerous and unpredictable while trying to disperse."
300CP,Canopic Jar,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user has the ability to safely move their vital organs and
bodily systems through their body, and collect them in quick forming jars of bone and tissues,
ejecting them once finished. This leaves behind a hollow body which now moves under
telekinetic control.
The Quirk user’s body in this state is entirely redundant and moves under outside
forces, allowing them to leverage it in extremely dangerous situations without the risk of
incapacitation or death.
What would kill or cripple a normal person has no effect on the Quirk user in this
state. The only way to kill the Quirk user in this state would be the find and target their
organ jar, which need not be near.
After 24 hours without their organs, their control over their body will begin to fade.
Over the following 24 hours, preservation and control slips until the body will “drop dead.""


If the Quirk user returns and takes in their jar before that point, they will be fine,
and rapid healing will trigger to seal or repair most wounds sustained while separate. If the
Quirk user does not return, their jar will instead begin a slow process of rebuilding their
body. This leaves them highly vulnerable."
300CP,Chakra,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user can perceive odd electromagnetic fields, seeing them as
various colored auras emanating off of all things. The greater the electromagnetic activity,
the greater the user can sense something, although even that which has no activity has a
perceptible aura.
Electronics, machinery and living creatures (due to their nervous system) all show up
well to the Quirk user, appearing even at long range and through obstructions within their
sight.
The Quirk user’s senses are so acute to subtleties in aura that they could tell
individuals apart, current stress levels, health/state of repair, and composition of objects
based on familiar materials.
Ever-present detection of auras and their consistent presence leaves other senses
less reliable, and the world a shifting rainbow. Extremely powerful electromagnetic fields
can be disorienting."
300CP,Clairvoyance,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to mark and hijack the senses of any
living creatures within 300 yards of the user that they can perceive.
The mental load is dispersed across the user and all connected targets, like some
kind of hive mind without direct control over or interaction those marked by this Quirk.
Using this Quirk gives the user a vast understanding of their surroundings if they’re
able to mark numerous targets, which isn’t difficult if they can perceive them in some way.
Conversely, if the user is trapped or stranded somewhere that they can in no way
perceive another living creature, their Quirk is unable to be used."
300CP,Comic,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user has a strange power relating to language. They may choose
while vocalizing onomatopoeia to manifest giant letters with varying effects based upon the
sound they’re calling out. Words like “Blam!"" might create giant letters that crash through
an area like a wrecking ball.
Something like “Boing"" could be vocalized to make letters with elastic properties,
bouncing whatever comes into contact with them like rubber. Any language that the Quirk
user can speak is viable, though the onomatopoeia must already exist for the Quirk user to
form word blocks out of them.
Power and range of effect grows with vocal training. Likewise, this Quirk puts great
stress on the vocal cords with continuous use, and potentially lose their voice if they go too
hard, too long."
300CP,Compress,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to “compress"" anything in a spherical
area into a small marble without actually damaging it, with a touch.
It can be used with extreme stealth, without noise, allowing the user to entrap and
take enemies out of the fight before their allies are able to even notice.
The weight of the compressed objects is reduced considerably, making it possible to
carry them in one's pockets or even in one's mouth. The user can release a single marble by wishing it, or all of them at the same time by
snapping their fingers. It can also be used to affect the user and to avoid attacks and disengage.
The only limitations of Compress are its touch based range and the fact these
compressed marble prisons can be broken from the outside by allies of the targeted."
300CP,Creation,My Hero Academia,"This Quirk allows you to produce different objects from any exposed
part of your body. Apart from living things, you can create virtually any object.
Due to the incredible power, there are a few requirements however. To produce an
object requires knowledge of its atomic configuration ahead of time.
The Quirk user’s body breaks down fat at the molecular level, reconfiguring into the
various objects produced with this Quirk. Larger objects need more exposed skin,
necessitating light clothing."
300CP,Dark Shadow,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is born playing host to a sapient symbiote
made of dark energy that they can manifest and stretch out, or contract back into him freely.
The creature a humanoid upper body, the ability to exert physical force, speak and
stretch its body and limbs but has an energy limit that causes it to need rest every now and then.
Dark Shadow’s personality, abilities and power vary based on the emotional state of
the user and current light conditions. The stronger the host’s negative emotions and the
darker it is, the more unruly, larger and more powerful Dark Shadow becomes, potentially
possessing the user.
In its weakest state it’s still quite strong, flexible and peaceful, but can be beat in a
fight by humans with professional fighting experience. In its strongest state, it’s a berserker
that can carve through swaths of fully grown trees with single swipes of its giant arms.
Dark Shadow, in addition to previously mentioned drawbacks like weakening while
submersed in light, becoming harder to control in the dark and having energy limitations, is
weak to light generating attacks such as electrical or fire types."
300CP,Daw Mour,My Hero Academia,"The one with this Quirk is gifted with a long, prehensile tongue, no
bones in their arms and numerous small, complex mouths scattered across their tongue and
arms.
The small mouths have specialized hinges attached to the jaws and teeth, creating
an unfolding/launching/grabbing action when they bite with a maximum distance of a full
foot away.
These mouths can take repeated quick bites out of even tempered steel and stone
faster than most can see. The user’s arms are hyper muscular and attached to their digestive
system, flexible like a pair of tentacles. Fully functional despite lacking a rigid support
structure.
The user can quickly get full if they overeat with their various shredding, scraping
mouths, needing either careful use or regurgitation when they get full. Otherwise they can
digest most materials harmlessly."
300CP,Drain,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to create a “drain"" on whatever they touch
that greedily sucks in surrounding or ambient moisture and then force feeding it into
whatever has the drain.
Additionally, the Quirk user gains especially elastic skin and a strange internal
reservoir. When used on the Quirk user, they’re able to potentially balloon themselves with
a deceptive amount of water and spray it freely from their hands with condensed cutting
force.
Due to the way the drains work (one way suck) and water not pairing well with
compression, this Quirk can easily be used to pop someone’s head like a balloon, fracture a
wall or erode the ground.
All drains are sealed when the user clicks their tongue. The user also has a limit to
how much water they can hold, potentially bursting, and their upper limit is also rather
awkward to move around with."
300CP,Dreamcatcher,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user is able to pull anyone who they acquire eye contact
with into a shared, mental realm where the user controls the laws of reality, as if in a lucid
dream. While unable to do physical harm to their real body, the user can make them feel
everything as if it was real.
The potential for psychological torture, mentally exhausting someone, interrogation,
holding private conversations, trading information and more is incredible.
The Quirk user can hold a target within this mental world for as little as a minute, or
up to twenty four hours inside their minds, with only seconds passing outside. The user will
feel no fatigue from this passage of time, acclimating perfectly.
This Quirk comes with a cooldown equal to one second per one minute spent inside
the mental world, with a full stay causing the ability to go on a whole twenty four minute
cooldown."
300CP,Earthflow,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to exert a great control over large
amounts of earth at once for a variety of effects such as causing landslides, digging and so on.
In addition to more straightforward uses, the user is also able to make sentient
creatures with animal level intelligence out of dirt and stone known as Earth Devils that can
prove quite formidable.
The only limitations are fatigue and needing a source of earth nearby, which it often
is unless you’re adrift on a boat at sea."
300CP,Edge Master,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user has the ability to create and project bladed
implements and weapons from their body ranging from swords and axes to chakram and
guillotine blades.
Projected bladed objects can potentially be sent flying at high speeds towards a
designated target along straight or curved flight paths, though they’re unable to fly in a
complete circle unaided.

All bladed objects are made out of some form of high quality iron alloy that has the
capacity to sheer through solid concrete without chipping or deforming.
The Quirk relies heavily on the user’s focus in order to form the bladed objects
above. If distracted or just careless, the constructs can come out warped, brittle, deformed
or otherwise lower quality.
Mental exhaustion may become a problem for those mentally weak. Otherwise,
Edge Master takes minimal stamina for continuous production."
300CP,Fat Absorption,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user gains a large amount of fat that leads into the true
abilities of this Quirk. The user has incredible defensive potential, adhering too and

absorbing objects with their fat including, but not limited too, bullets, swords and entire
enemies providing they’re small enough.
It is as if the attacks hit a giant, malleable marshmallow, stopping upon contact
before being sucked in. Although powerful, even this defense has limits for what it can take.
At the expense of burning fat, Fat Adsorption is even able to capture kinetic energy however,
which can be returned all at once.
Fat Adsorption lends less defensive potential the less fat the Quirk user has. Fat
Adsorption lends no unique ability to gain fat in any meaningful way, requiring heavy meals
for top efficiency."
300CP,Fiber Body,My Hero Academia,"The one born with this Quirk is made of millions of interwoven fibers
which can stretch, writhe, weave, heal and be controlled by the user’s will or instincts.
The fibrous composition of the user’s body knits itself back together when an injury
is sustained, granting a form of regeneration that means even severed body parts can be
reattached with ease.
The user of this Quirk is able to extend fibers from their body several meters like
numerous super thin tendrils to manipulate things in their surroundings, each weak but
together like additional arms.
With training, the one with this Quirk may be able to alter the properties of their
body fibers, binding them together to make thick ropes or compress and strengthen them to
make them like bladed wire.
The user’s body is naturally stronger and more flexible compared to a normal
human’s. The nature of the fibers leaves them extra vulnerable to extreme temperatures, as
well as things like ice and fire."
300CP,Fierce Wings,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user is born with two large, powerful wings with their
choice of feather color on purchase. The Quirk user is able to telekinetically manipulate each
of their feathers, allowing the Quirk user to fly at great speeds or detach the feathers for
individual tasks.
The Quirk user’s feathers are stiff, yet flexible, varying in size and strength and
capable of great feats even on their own. The Quirk user retains sensory input from
detached feathers, allowing them to be commanded at a distance. Detached feathers may
be reattached.
The Quirk user’s feathers work best when employed together, and will be weaker if
spread out. Feathers that end up destroyed will regrow over time, taking several days."
300CP,Foresight,My Hero Academia,"The holder of this Quirk is able to see the entirety of the target’s future,
second by second, for one whole hour. The user sees the future like frames of a film, and can
only see the target from a third-person perspective as well as their surroundings.
This has multiple conditions for activation and limitations due to its immense power.
The Quirk user must touch their target, then make eye contact with them to activate the
Quirk in the first place.
The user of this Quirk can only activate this Quirk one per day, but the futures they
see are 100% accurate barring outside of context circumstances."
300CP,Fungal Growth,My Hero Academia,"This Quirk allows the Quirk user to detect, manipulate, condense
and rapidly grow even light traces of fungus or fungal growth as they desire.
Everything from spreading athlete’s foot over someone’s entire body to causing
mushrooms to grow car sized and smash through concrete becomes quite possible.
The range of influence for Fungal Growth is around ten meters, granting them the ability to
take even a single spore in that range and spread it out into a number of viable weapons.
Alcohol acts like a virulent poison to fungi grown by this Quirk."
300CP,Gamma Maximum,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user has the ability to spit glowing, green slime
from their mouth, either as gentle as a low pressure garden hose or with the force of a
cannonball that can crack stone with one or two blasts.
This slime exudes a unique form of radiation that causes invertebrates such as ants,
spiders or shrimp to mutate and grow many times their natural size. Mantises the size of
bears and bees the size of tigers are just the tip of the iceberg.
Due to a unique pheromone produced by the Quirk User, invertebrates mutated by
this power are obedient and capable of surprisingly complex actions, especially hive insects.
Mutant invertebrates will shrink back to normal after ten minutes. Mutants will gain
independence if over a mile away from the quirk user due to this being the effective range of
their pheromones, whereupon they’ll act like a normal insect of their size with all that
entails."
300CP,Gigantification,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to grow to titanic sizes, being as tall
as most office and apartment buildings at their full height with appropriate strength and durability.
The major limitation of this power is having no middle, either staying at their normal
size or transforming into full gigantic size, which is measured around 2062 centimeters."
300CP,Hatcher,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user has the dangerous ability to form monsters, like the
mythological Echidna. To begin, the Quirk user must “activate"" their Quirk, which causes
anything they consume to be diverted away from their digestive system into a slow forming
construct.
At any point in time after initial activation, they may “deactivate"" their Quirk and
regurgitate a bizarre looking egg that varies in appearance from instance to instance. This
egg must be cared for over the course of several days to several weeks depending on its
developmental period.
It will eventually hatch, revealing an organism that will rapidly mature into a
monstrous beast that follows the will of its progenitor. Its physiology varies wildly depending
on what the Quirk user consumed and contributed to its form.
The Quirk user has a great, though general, control over the final product during the
Quirk’s active period. Quirk user may activate a form of catabolysis, contributing their own
fats and tissues to the egg in order to bestow human physiology cues, and pieces of their
memories or skills.
The Quirk user can keep the Quirk active however long they desire, but is vulnerable
to starvation if they push themselves too hard, as everything consumed is filtered into the
egg.
Water can still be imbibed to the User’s benefit. The catabolysis ability is highly
dangerous, but may be deactivated independently. The time requirements can be heavily
inconvenient."
300CP,Impact Recoil,My Hero Academia,"This Quirk allows the user to reverse the impact caused by an
opposing physical force, sending the force back into whatever, whoever or wherever it came
from.
This Quirk can be applied not only to one’s self, but to nearby allies as well, allowing
the user to potentially protect them or use them as meat shields.
There is a small windup before its activation necessitating a bit of prediction. It can,
of course, only work against physical impacts and doesn’t help with things like fire or
electricity"
300CP,Layers,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user is able to stretch and densify inanimate materials to form
them into sheets. These sheets are highly flexible and have several times the strength of the
original object or material due to being condensed. The Quirk user is able to lift and
manipulate sheets with ease.
The Quirk user can convert large amounts of material through the original point of
contact, providing it is the same material. They may also bind sheets together, layering them
on top of each other. Sheets become much heavier and less flexible when not being directly
manipulated.
The shuffled mass that allows the Quirk user to swing and move the sheets around
with ease produces energy that can cause the Quirk user to begin overheating if
manipulating too much densified material at a given time.
The heat can instead be filtered back into densified material, but the Quirk user has
no direct heat resistance, and effects may vary based on that material. The Quirk user may
cancel their treatment of a material to have it expand to how it once was."
300CP,Mania,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user is able to fully manipulate the five senses of up to two
people within line of sight, allowing the user to control what they see, hear, smell, taste and
feel to a complex, realistic extent as if bathing them in a world of illusion.
The victims will essentially be subject to the reality the Quirk user decides for them.
Clever use of this Quirk would allow for intricate manipulation of individuals, even pinning
them against each other or allies, or gaining their cooperation over an extended time.
Victims of Mania will show white eyes as a side effect of Mania’s application.
Although near every sense may as well be as the user defines for the victim, pain can still be
triggered against the user’s designs, causing victims to feel phantom pain when injured that
may tip them off about something."
300CP,Manifest,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to manifest the body parts and/or
characteristics of any animal they eat. They are even able to sustain multiple
transformations at the same time.
Manifestations of consumed beasts are somewhat flexible compared to their donors,
such as octopus tentacle fingers are capable of extending as an example.
The major limitation of this Quirk is that the user is only able to manifest
characteristics of animals they eat in the last 24 hours, potentially rendering them powerless
if they go hungry for too long."
300CP,Maximum Security,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user has a great deal of control over iron and iron
alloys as well as the ability to command it over a wide area, over one hundred meters.
Although they have full power to manipulate and shape such material, they have a
natural inclination/talent towards forming it into bars and chains, being able to perform
more complex actions when manipulating iron using these shapes.
They don’t actually have the power to sense iron and must be able to find it
themselves to assert control. Manipulating truly massive amounts of iron can quickly
become tiring. It’s easier to hover iron over a surface, horizontal or otherwise, than
suspending it in the middle of the air."
300CP,Meatball,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to manipulate and change the shape of
raw human flesh, including their own, for a variety of effects.
The most common application of this Quirk involves harmlessly compressing
people's bodies into powerless, ball-shaped lumps of flesh. The user is also able to
harmlessly cut off pieces of their own body, remotely controlling them and mixing them
together to form larger constructs.
There are two major limitations of Meatball, the first being that the user is unable to
control a target’s flesh until their own flesh meets them. The second is that the effects, such
as body compression, break if the user receives too much damage."
300CP,Melting Point,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user may dramatically lower the boiling/melting point,
or raise the freezing point, of any inanimate objects and materials in sight within the area.
This would allow them to cause water to boil into cold steam, then freeze it once the
condensation clings to the body of an enemy, all at room temperature. Alternatively, the
user could just melt the armor and guns of an enemy at a glance.
Objects that do not have the capacity for these qualities cannot be given these
qualities, such as wood being unable to melt even at extremely high temperatures."
300CP,Myth,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user has the ability to transform into a larger and more powerful
form. This form emulates the appearance of a mythological creature of choice, selected at
the time of purchase, and bestows a number of physiological changes and abilities based
upon that choice.
The choice of a dragon could give protective scales, wings, fangs, claws, and a tail, as
one example. The choice of a kraken could enable the ability to breath underwater and
bestow a number of powerful and dexterous tentacles, as another.
Otherwise magical abilities based upon those creatures like immortality or passing
through walls are not included with the transformation. Physical abilities within this form, no

matter the choice, are far greater however. This form is often between the size of a bus and
a two-story house.
This transformation is more stamina consuming than the Quirk user’s base human
form. Specific weaknesses such as gaps in natural armor or inability to handle certain
temperatures vary depending on choice of creature made."
300CP,Noise,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk can cause whatever they touch to generate one of
two different unique types electromagnetic fields “disruptive"" and “attractive.""
A disruptive field scrambles electronic signals internally while scrambling photons
externally across the surface of whatever touching, making it appear to be covered in
television static.
An attractive field siphons electrons from existing electronic fields to charge the
object in question, causing it to seemingly produce electricity from nothing and glow.
This Quirk is excellent for giving the user a steady supply of electricity, setting
electrical traps, shutting down electronics and even immobilizing people by scrambling
nerve signals.
While this Quirk is active, the user is susceptible to being jolted through contact with
metal. Disruptive fields hold no real effect on objects with no relation to electricity.
Attractive fields weaken considerably when away from any notable electronic fields."
300CP,Overhaul,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to disassemble and reassemble anything
they can touch with their hands, either restoring it to its previous state or an entirely
different one at the user’s discretion.
With this Quirk comes an endless variety of applications. Instantly obliterate people
or obstacles, fix a broken object, cure chronic ailments, heal severe damage, warp terrain to
the user’s advantage, fusing materials or objects together, even reviving the freshly
deceased good as new.
Overhaul may even be used to fuse people into new, composite entities or fuse
people with objects to give them a hellish existence. Notable, is that any living being,
including the Quirk user, will experience excruciating, terrible pain whenever affected by
Overhaul either partially or completely.
Overhaul’s extreme control over the reassembly process is only able to work with
what it has on hand. As hand contact is required to apply the effects of Overhaul, enemies
that are able to attack while avoiding the Quirk user’s hands can avoid being obliterated."
300CP,Peek,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to slow down their perception of time to a
crawl and look up to ten seconds into the future, running a simulation of events.
The user is able to act as if experiencing things in intervals of 10 seconds, testing
what reaction there is to the actions they take until they’re reverted to their starting point.
The user is able to test multiple scenarios while paused to see which course of
action may work best for them. When finally resuming time, they’ll also be able to mimic the
actions of a future they played.
The limitations for such power are severe however. The user can experience intense
headaches with prolonged use of this “slowed time perception."" Additionally, the user only
has 100 seconds total per day that they can use to see and decide their future."
300CP,Rage,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to inflict headaches and a kind of “input lag""
on the target’s nervous system by having them become angry with the user while focusing
on them.
The effects start off rather minor at first, but become more severe the angrier the
target becomes, not just at the user but in general. The lower end might be easily ignored,
but the top end is nightmarish.
The target will experience searing migraines and their body will seem to move
several seconds after their mind tells it too, putting them in a perpetually tedious, painful
state that worsens their mood.
The only limitation is that the effects can wane and even break if the target manages
to calm back down to normal."
300CP,Rewind,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk has the ability to turn back the body of those they
touched to a previous state. This can be used altruistically to seamlessly heal an individual,
or maliciously by rewinding old wounds open again, or rewinding them out of existence
entirely.
This is a very potent ability and even before active training has the potential to turn
someone back minutes or hours in mere moments.
With intense training, it has the potential to reverse only parts of someone or
something. Intense training would be required either way however, as Rewind is difficult to
control by default. It works on activation, being easy to turn on but difficult to stop at first,
leaving control a serious issue."
300CP,Ring Fingers,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user is able to transform their fingers into metal rings and
control them with their will. Each finger is able to turn into six rings of about the size suitable
for fitting on that size of finger.
Rings are able to be manipulated into flying through the air at high speeds and
deliver impacts like a professional boxer’s haymakers. With a potential sixty rings total, this
can be extremely threatening.
Additionally, if the Quirk user is able to slip one or more of their ring fingers on the
fingers of an enemy, they are able to exert control over the victim’s body. One ring alone will
often times not be sufficient for complete control, but multiple will usually do the trick.
Unless the rings are currently being worn, the rings of this Quirk must dock and take
the form of a finger again after a maximum of fifteen minutes to recharge or the user will
lose control of them, causing them to fall to the ground. The user always knows the location
of their finger rings."
300CP,Rubber Body,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user gains a body with the properties of rubber. This
allows them to bend, stretch, contort and flex to normally impossible extents. This also
provides extreme resistance to veritably any form of electrical or blunt damage, the user
being able to ignore bullets entirely.
As the user is able to completely ignore usual issues with overexertion of muscles
and recoil from physical strikes due to the properties of their body, the Quirk user can also
seemingly summon up inhuman strength in their strikes.
Bodily elasticity seemingly never fades, meaning the Quirk user’s body won’t deform
from stretching too much or too far. The Quirk user’s usual defensive abilities are utterly
ignored by edged weapons, leaving them as a dangerous vulnerability."
300CP,Search,My Hero Academia,"This Quirk allows the user to track and monitor and observe up to 100
people at once, including their location relative to the user and physical weak points.
This gives a complete awareness of what each of the marked targets is doing, albeit
with more or less attention on their activities depending on the priorities of the user.
The user is vulnerable to being ambushed before having time to mark a target, a
maximum of 100 people as previously mentioned, and loses focus of anyone who travels too
far away."
300CP,Sentry System,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user is able to grow small gray seeds and plant them,
the seeds sinking into flora, dirt, concrete, electronics, automobiles and so on.
Once planted, the seeds will eventually mature, spreading roots throughout the
object they were planted in. Once mature, these ‘sentries’ create a field of awareness that
allows the Quirk user to perceive the area around the object or location.
The user can produce ten seeds a day, and more if they push themselves, though
this is tiring. Ten fields of awareness planted within the area a day. Eventually it will seem as
if they’re almost omniscient.
Sentries can be destroyed if found, and will “die"" regardless after six months once
mature. The Quirk user may have trouble keeping track of the input of too many sentries at
a time."
300CP,Sleeper,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to plant a copy of their consciousness in a
target, like a seed that they can cause to bloom on command, causing a secondary self to
take control temporarily.
To do so, the user must apply their sweat to the target’s eyelids somehow, planting
a piece of their consciousness that can be activated as desired later on, simply by willing it.
Upon doing so, it’ll be as if a mental copy of the user wakes up in control of the
target’s body with access to their knowledge, memories and abilities, ready to act like them
or work with the user.
After activation, the copy only has twenty minutes before they disappear and the
true owner of the body wakes up, unaware of what they were doing. There is no limit to the
number of seeds the user can plant, but a second cannot be planted in a host that already
has one."
300CP,Sludge Form,My Hero Academia,"The one born with this Quirk has an amorphous body composed of
a thick substance reminiscent of sludge or mud, rendering them immune to most physical
attacks.
The one with this Quirk, despite their texture, isn’t what you could call wet and is
able to compact themselves well enough to wear clothes or disperse themselves for travel
through cracks.
Additionally, this Quirk allows the one with it to wrap around and possess a target,
taking control of their body and abilities, though this takes around a minute to perform.
While immune to most physical attacks, they’re susceptible to being blown apart,
and if dispersed too much can be rendered unconscious. If trapped, they have a tough time
pushing outwards to escape."
300CP,Soundgarden,My Hero Academia,"The user of this quirk is able to manipulate a large amount of sand
and glass at once with the sound of their voice, giving commands in a way that sounds like
song more than orders.
This Quirk, aside from just manipulation, also allows the user to seamlessly shift
sand into glass and back again, turning sand into glass with higher pitch vocalizations and
glass into sand with lower pitch vocalizations.
An exceptionally low tone bellowed and sustained can cause any sand under the
user’s command to pack itself together, attempting to condense and squeeze anything in
the way.
An exceptionally high note vocalized and sustained causes glass to reverberate and
eventually explode/shatter. Shaping glass into “blooming"" constructs like flowers seems to
be easiest.
The major limitations are lack of protection to the abrasive and cutting abilities of
their own power, as well as the condition of their throat. Prodigious overuse of the ability


has predictable results in scratching up and damaging vocal chords, making continued use
difficult."
300CP,Super Regeneration,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user is able to recover from most forms of damage
and disease at extreme speeds, including the recovery of missing limbs and usually vital
organs in seconds. There is no innate downside to the ability, nor may it be shut off due to
its passive nature.
Of the few forms of damage that are difficult to repair, cauterization by extreme
temperatures or volatile chemical burns are the most notable. Affected areas must be
removed before regeneration can proper healing may begin."
300CP,Temperature Modulation,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user is able to survive extreme temperatures.
More notably, the user has the power to manipulate their own body’s temperature leave
their body hot enough to melt steel with their bare hands or freeze water with a touch.
What’s more, the Quirk user can either let their body’s adjusted temperature
radiate or isolate it to their body or even a specific body part. Takes a moment to ramp up or
lower temperature, making it hard to use it in a reactive capacity, which can prove
dangerous."
300CP,The Purple,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user is able to spread a bizarre electromagnetic field
through inanimate objects that alters their physical properties. Objects affected become a
vibrant purple color as long as the Quirk’s effect is ongoing.
The visual representation of the Quirk’s effects transmits signals into the brains of
living creatures observing affected objects, making the object hard to ignore or shift
attention off of.
Objects and materials affected also gain a kind of super-tangibility that causes them
to express themselves on their surroundings to a greater extent. A playing card under this
Quirk’s effects would behave as if stronger than steel, as one example.
The Quirk user is able to interact with affected objects as normal, leaving gloves to
remain flexible on their hands, for instance. The Quirk user may passively leave objects
affected, but may only spread this field out to so much at any given time.
This Quirk will automatically spread to any inanimate object in contact with the
Quirk user over prolonged periods of time, if applicable, such as clothing worn throughout
the day."
300CP,Transfer,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to partially or fully transform their body
into an inanimate material by touching it, consuming the material in the process.
Additionally, the user of this Quirk can pass near instantly through a material they’re
currently composed of to any other surface of that material.
This power would allow the user to touch a sidewalk to become concrete, then
appear down the block on that sidewalk in less than a second as if teleporting as long as they
keep contact with the sidewalk.
This user is limited by needing an amount of material equal to how much of
themselves they need transformed and the material being lost in the process. The user’s
range of movement with the mobility aspect of this Quirk is limited at first to around the
stated example but will grow with training."
300CP,Transfusion,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user has a number of oddities in their biological makeup
revolving around cell memory and the rapid shifting of their body and the bodies of others
back and forth between a stem cell state. It all begins when making contact with another
person.
The Quirk user is able to phase their body parts through organic matter, exchanging
cell memories with the target in the associated body part. In basic terms, the Quirk user may
exchange injuries or physiological conditions with a target.
Flesh and bone warp near instantly when the bodies are then separated. Broken
bones of the Quirk user become broken bones of the target. A target’s stab wound becomes
the stab wound of the Quirk user. The Quirk user does have some ability to displace injuries
on themselves, however.
The Quirk user is able to inflict injuries they’ve had in the past on their targets, the
memories of these injuries kept behind in their cells. Despite their body modification powers,
they can’t actually eliminate injury, just shuffle it around."
300CP,Trigger,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user’s tongue is able to stretch up to a dozen times in length,
the tip thinning and sharpening into a strong, mosquito proboscis-like tool that can be used
to inject a chemical cocktail into victims.
This injection targets the target’s Quirk gene, rapidly and potently mutating the
Quirk user’s Quirk into a powerful new form. Fire breath could develop into large scale fire
manipulation; a strong punch Quirk could develop into something street shattering in force.
In all cases, the target’s quirk becomes far more threatening, but may also mutate in
unpredictable and not always beneficial ways. In addition to Quirk mutations, physical
mutations will occur based on the individual’s Quirk.
While under this Quirk’s effects, targets suffer from reduced cognitive abilities, as
well as varied mental defects. This may include heightened aggression, mood swings,
delusions of grandeur, and/or delusions impending doom. The effects of this Quirk normally
fade after one to two hours.
Through this Quirk’s targeting of the Quirk gene, it can activate dormant genes
within the Quirkless in order for it to take effect. This can be dangerous in such cases and
may leave permanent alterations or damage to those affected. The Quirk user is immune to
their own chemicals."
300CP,Vector,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user becomes profoundly aware of kinetic energy, momentum
and vectors of movement within their environment. The Quirk user is also aware of how
much energy they can generate, the ways they can move and how to do so.
This provides the Quirk user with great insight on how to exert force, traverse any
given area, and how to redirect the forces at work around them. With great effort and no
superhuman ability, the Quirk user would be capable of catching bullets with their bare hands.
The Quirk user still has normal senses otherwise, and is only aware of the forces at
work above. This means the material composition of objects in their environment is up to
them to figure out, leaving them open to mistaken approaches, and tricks devised by clever
foes."
300CP,Warp Gate,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to create and manipulate a dark fog that
acts as a portal. When the user produces a mass of the dark fog, it transports anything it
comes in contact with to a nearby location. It can also be used to obscure the user’s identity.
The portals that are created are based on coordinates and thus to open them means
one must be able to pinpoint the exact position where they wish for each portal to open up
into.
The main limitations of this power are its precise, coordinate based nature, and the
fact that the owner’s body is always present in some manner even if they seem immaterial
at times."
300CP,Wave Motion,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user is able to convert their vitality into pure energy and
project it from their body in the form of spiraling shockwaves. Able to control the output
and project these shockwaves from anywhere on her body allows for a variety of
applications.
Weaker shockwaves from the feet can allow for a form of pseudo-flight. Pulsing
them from the body can be used to make hairpin turns or sudden dodges in the face of an
enemy attack. Then there’s the most straightforward use, extremely threatening energy
blasts.
As an innate property, the shockwaves always travel in a spiraling flightpath that
causes them to travel slowly and awkwardly. As the user is converting stamina into power,
fatigue is a potential threat. The greater the user’s vitality, the greater their potential power
and endurance with this Quirk."
300CP,King of the Streets,Spiderman PS4,"It’s not superhuman but it doesn’t look like anyone else can really tell the difference. Through hard
work or genetic tampering, you’ve reached the peak of human capability and it’s a lot more than you
might expect. Standing at almost 7 feet tall, you’ve become a mountain of muscle equal to the
Kingpin himself in power. You’ve got enough strength to exchange blows with Spider-man, smashing
through concrete walls and shrugging off multi-storey falls without any effort at all. You’re pretty
fast too, all that strength lets you propel yourself at speeds a fair bit beyond what any normal
human could hope for.
Alternatively, you can choose to have the same capabilities as Tombstone, rather than Kingpin. You’ll
be a fair bit less physically strong but your durability will be a lot higher to compensate, bullets
literally bounce off of you and even Spider-man is going to have a tough time giving you bruises.
If you’re willing to pay an extra 300 points though, you can go right beyond either of these. Like the
Rhino him/itself, you’re a living titan of pure power. Even without some fancy tech suit, you can run
straight through a bank vault without slowing down and fling large rock boulders over a couple city
blocks. Even Spider-man is going to just daze you at best with his punches and you’re almost as fast
as him in a straight line. Short of someone firing a tank shell in your face, there really just isn’t much
that can hurt you. You’re immune to all but the most extreme temperatures, acids and electrical
shocks too. And given you’re about 7’5 feet tall, not many people are even going to try to fight you."
300CP,Warmaster,Spiderman PS4,"Born to be the best, you’ve got a mind that’s just about perfect for combat. Not only do you find it
effortless to learn anything related to combat or war and master those skills, you also have a
superhuman memory copying ability. Your perfect photographic memory allows you to instantly
understand and replicate any combat maneuver you see, though you may lack the needed abilities
to physically perform the moves, as well as instantly come up with countermeasures against those
moves, though again you may lack the ability or resources to actually pull those counters off."
300CP,Bamf!,X-Men the Claremont Years,"Like nightcrawler you are
capable of teleporting yourself. You may perform this teleportation quickly and in quick
succession appearing and disappearing rapidly with a small sound and a puff of
brimstone. Teleporting 30 or so feet is easy, but much further and you will have to train
and work up to it. With training you could eventually routinely teleport yourself 1 or 2
miles, and potentially further as an extreme act of exertion. You may carry others with
you when you use this power, but it becomes increasingly difficult the more mass you
attempt to teleport, and carrying more than another person will likely be trying or
impossible initially, though eventually you may be able to teleport entire small vehicles.
These difficulties compound each other so attempting to teleport miles carrying someone
is likely if not impossible then lethal. Finally, while this power has subconscious guiding
elements to help aim away from solid objects, you must either know a location or be able
to see it to teleport in safely.
If you bought this power at a discount you may buy Wall-Crawler at a discount as well.
If you also bought Stepping Discs, then the two powers can combine somewhat. While it
will still be more difficult to carry others or go further, you will find that you can in effect
use the superior range and carrying capacity of Stepping Discs through this teleportation,
taking yourself and what you carry miles, even continents with ease. Freestanding discs
still have the normal slower appearance and formation."
300CP,Blasting,X-Men the Claremont Years,"You can produce a jet-like surge of energy
from your lower body which can be used for providing yourself with lift and acceleration,
moving you forward at great speeds. While blasting you become much more resistant to
harm, allowing you to survive attacks that would kill a normal human, or crashes at the
speeds provided by your power, helping you to crash through walls or send enemies
flying."
300CP,Brute Strength,X-Men the Claremont Years,"You’re strong, Jumper. How strong? Like Beast, after he had his ‘upgrade’ from one of Apocalypse’s horsemen, you’re strong
enough to rip out support pillars and swing them as clubs, and tear apart buildings with
relative ease. While not in the big leagues by this world’s standards, you’re still capable
of punching through a tank if you have the need. If you bought this at a discount you may
also buy Wall-Crawler at a discount.
For an additional -200 CP (discounted if this was) this increases to strength at the full
level of a full Flying Brick enough to match Rogue, Captain Britain, or the strongest
Marauders. Who knows if Thor was cursed with frailty you might even manage to break
his arm."
300CP,Dazzler,X-Men the Claremont Years,"You possess the mutant ability to convert
sound into light. You may produce this light as a psychedelic light show, blinding flashes
of light, or even lasers. In a normal battle you will find this power weaker than Energy
Blasts for sheer destructive might, though by straining yourself to the point of
self-damage and burnout of your power you could produce a laser powerful enough to
stun the Juggernaut, but it provides additional versatility and some useful secondary
super powers. You are effectively immune to being blinded by bright lights, and you may
absorb normally damaging sounds to increase your power. With strong enough sources of
sound - like Blackbolt’s voice - you could be a threat to the Hulk, or potentially more and
stranger things."
300CP,Elemental Kinesis,X-Men the Claremont Years,"Select one element such as ice, fire, earth, microwaves, sound, or magnetism. You may produce this element from
environmental sources (condensing ice from the air) and/or have limited control over it.
This allows you to create blasts of the element, walls, or other simple objects. If it is a
physical element, you may also cover yourself with the element as a form of armor
without suffering damage from it. By default this gives you enough power to fill a room,
and with effort and/or time makes you a danger to the entire city block around you,
possibly further depending upon the element (for example geokinesis might allow you to
create earthquakes with less localized offensive punch but greater range); roughly as
powerful as Iceman was before Loki altered his powers.
A wide sweeping element such as magnetism or Banshee’s control of sound,
Rictor/Avalanche’s control of seismic vibrations costs an additional -100 CP

(discounted if this was), and elements broader than magnetism (such as gravity, or time,
or anything of the like) cannot be chosen.
For an additional -200 CP (discounted if this was) you have the same power upgrade as
Iceman would receive from Loki’s attempt to use him as a weapon; using ice as an
example you could flash freeze a skyscraper, turn summer into winter across New York
City, and be considered an Omega Level Threat. For a further -200 CP (discounted if
this was) your power level is increased further to where you could realistically expect a
worldwide range - if not at full power. You become equal to Magneto in your power and
potential mastery of your chosen element.
You may add additional elements for -200 CP (discounted if this was) each. These
elements may also combine in certain ways such as how Magma’s pyrokinesis and
geokinesis function together to allow her to create and manipulate magma."
300CP,Energy Blast,X-Men the Claremont Years,"Like Cyclops, Havok, or really a good number of other characters - really this power is about as common as super strength
or being pretty - you have the ability to project a destructive blast of energy from some
part of your body (chosen when you take this power). By default this power is set roughly
to the same strength as Cyclops had in this period. More than the average for these
comics, enough to damage or destroy most sentinels, put a dent in Magneto’s magnetic
shields, or blast a hole in a ship, but you will not be doing major environmental
restructuring with it, or destroying adamantium robots. For an additional -100 CP
(discounted if this was) instead of releasing as a destructive beam you create some form
of delayed explosive; either a flowing energy light show like Jubilee or energy grenades
like Boom Boom. For an additional -500 CP (discounted if this was) you can get the full
power of eye beams that Cyclops would later demonstrate when cutting loose as hinted at
in this run when he destroyed Mr. Sinister with a single glance; this is a power capable of
destroying adamantium reinforced sentinels, cutting paths through mountains, and
overwhelming Mr. Sinister’s forcefield which held up against multiple attacks from the
other members of X-Factor and the X-Men working together and reducing him to a
skeleton or less in a single blast."
300CP,Force Field Projection,X-Men the Claremont Years,"Through concentration you are able to project a forcefield outwards from around yourself. This field is centered on yourself,
though it may contain other people, and requires intense effort and concentration to
maintain. It is powerful enough to withstand most energy blasts or withstand blows from
a superhuman for a time.
For an additional cost of -400 CP (discounted if this was) this forcefield becomes
much easier to maintain. While it still is not effortless, you will find yourself able to
maintain it for longer and while performing other tasks. It also becomes more powerful,
able to withstand stronger blows, and blasts from multiple foes at once; though it’s not
without limits as Cyclops demonstrated to Mr. Sinister.
For a separate additional cost of -400 CP (discounted if this was) you now possess a
frictionless forcefield which clings tightly to your body - over your clothes at your option
- which prevents others from grabbing hold of you, and provides substantially improved
protection, though only for yourself (you may still project a forcefield as before). This
forcefield requires no concentration or effort to maintain. If you also bought the other
upgrade its power increases still further."
300CP,Healing Factor,X-Men the Claremont Years,"You possess a healing factor like that of Wolverine’s from this time period. It is potent enough to resist
brood infestation, effectively fight off alcohol or disease, and let you heal flesh wounds in
minutes, and serious wounds in hours, but it is not up to the level his powers would
eventually reach in later comics.

For an additional -500 CP (discounted if this was) you possess this power at the levels it
would later show up with Mr. Sinister, Apocalypse, and to a lesser extent Wolverine.
Able to heal wounds in moments, and revive yourself from near total destruction; you are
the next best thing to immortal."
300CP,Psychic Vampirism,X-Men the Claremont Years,"You possess the ability to drain the life force of others with a touch. While this drain of their life force won’t give you their
powers (you need Power Absorption for that) and seems significantly slower than that
power, you can get portions of their memories seemingly without the personality shadows
of the other ability. If you fully drain a target then they will die, becoming nothing more
than a dessicated husk.
The real power is that you can use this drained life force to reinforce your body, restoring
your youth, granting you superhuman speed (maxing out significantly below Mach 1),
strength, reflexes, and durability. Nothing great compared to some of the other options
available, but noticeable. Finally, once you have drained a target without killing them it
grants you some modicum of telepathic control over them; again not a match for a true
telepath, but enough to put them into a hypnotic trance, block other minor influences, or
force them to walk into a volcano. And while under this hypnotic spell if they die you
gain the remainder of their life essence."
300CP,Valkyrie,X-Men the Claremont Years,"You are able to see a ‘deathglow’ about individuals which increases as their nearness to death rises. In addition to giving you a
heads up as to which of your allies is most likely to be fatally wounded soon, you have
been granted another boon: the right to challenge death for the fate of the dying. When
the local psychopomp comes for a creature you may, if you’re there, challenge them to a
fight. Win and they’ll leave."
300CP,Super Speed,Young Justice,"You possess Superhuman Speed, initially you start on par with
Kid Flash (Wally), speeds approaching Mach 1, but can eventually rival the likes of
Superman and Captain Marvel. This speed extends to your speech and perception,
enabling you to speak at higher frequencies and see objects at speeds far higher than
what the typical human eye could perceive. (Free for Kryptonian and Demigod)

For another additional 300cp, this boosts your speed to the level of Barry Allen and
Bart Allen. Which allows you to move at speeds approaching the speed of light. While
there is no Speed Force in Earth-16, this power also grants a minor durability boost to
avoid taking damage from running too fast."
300CP,Teleportation,Young Justice,"You are now capable of teleporting. Initially, you can only
teleport within your eyesight, but with enough mastery of your powers, you can teleport
without having to see, and bring multiple people with you."
600,Canon Power,Generic Worm Fanfiction,"The ‘let Wildbow do it for me’ option. For 400 CP, Pick any power possessed by a cape in
canon except for Path to Victory, and other powers on the level of Panacea, the
Triumvirate or the S-class threats.
For those, well except PtV, pay 600 CP. You get that power, with tweaks to appearance and
useability to keep you from being too much of a cookie-cutter clone. Removing
substantial limitations or changing core functionality requires taking it as an Altpower or
Freeform Design.
Yes, this does include Queen Administrator…as of the start of canon."
600,Bodily Control,Marvel Age of Krakoa,"Like the Mutant En Sabah Nur or the Deviant Mutate
Kro, you have perfect mental control of all of your bodily processes down to an absurd
level. Not only does this give you effective eternal youth, but with your control of your
body, you can reflexively purge your body of disease and toxins, harden yourself against
harm and heal your own injuries. You can still be killed by violence, but the threshold
for lethal wounds is much higher. Additionally, your flesh is malleable, allowing you to
shape it like putty for a variety of disguises. However, for 400 CP you can only make
limited changes to your skeletal structure and cannot alter your mass. For 600 CP,
however, neither is a problem and your control extends down to the molecular level.
This will let you shrink, grow, stretch, reshape yourself, and even liquefy or pull apart
like taffy. With practice, you may even be able to fashion blades or bludgeons that
imitate stone or steel or temporarily rewrite your DNA to gain minor powers."
600,Green Thumb,Marvel Age of Krakoa,"You possess the powers of Florakinesis, the ability to
control and manipulate plants, fungi, and related organisms. This includes inducing
growth or altering their forms and properties to say, turn the grass beneath someone's
feet into super strong tendrils to grapple them with or a sunflower into a fanged maw, or
crafting weapons out of still-living hardwood. This is a pretty free-form power, the more
you practice the more applications you’ll find. Additionally, you receive sensory
feedback based on what the plants and fungi perceive. While not sentient as we
recognize it plants and fungi can pick up a surprising amount of information and
exchange it across a symbiotic network of roots and mycelium that might as well be a
nervous system and all of that is available to you… Which also allows communication
with sentient plants that lack the power of conventional communication. Your range
starts out relatively small, line of sight tops, but could eventually cap out large enough
for you to synchronize with every bit of flora on a large jungle-island nation. For an
Extra 200 CP, you can fire blasts of heat and kinetic energy from any bit of plant matter
on your person. A purchase of this power discounts an appropriate purchase of
Non-Living Form."
600,Optic Blasts,Marvel Age of Krakoa,"Behold. You can fire beams of colored light and kinetic
force from your eyes, with varying amounts of power in them. For 400 CP these blasts
range from completely non-lethal to able to pulverize reinforced concrete. For 600 CP
you can vary the width of the blast from a foot wide that goes for miles to a cone that can
encompass a few acres, and your maximum output of energy is enough to shred an
ordinary human to atoms at its narrowest or scrap a 2000s era standard model Sentinel
in one go at its widest."
400CP,Elemental,Avengers Vs X-Men,"The power of an element flows within you, giving you enormous power and a new form, like Iceman.
Pick an element such as ice, magma, lightning or some other natural element that can be found on
Earth, excluding special or supernatural elements such as magic or adamantium. You now are able to
create, control and transform into a form made of that element. Your control and power with this
element is enormous. Ice would enable you to freeze things down to individual molecules and with
enough power to stop a nuclear explosion from occurring or cover entire countries in ice. The ice is
unnaturally powerful, capable of temporarily holding the Hulk at bay, and it also allows fro the direct
control of temperature instead of only ice, as well as some influence over water. In your elemental
form, you have no biological needs and can continually reconstruct your body from almost any
damage, provided the environment allows for you to work your element. Too hot and dry may
prevent ice powers from working well for long or at all, for instance. Uniquely, you can spread your
awareness through any part of the element you are currently controlling to more easily manipulate it."
400CP,Giant Man,Avengers Vs X-Men,"The power of pym particles that now rest within you have granted you incredible size changing
abilities. You can grow or shrink your body at will, retaining your abilities when smaller and growing
even stronger when bigger. There are few limits on how far your size powers can go, as you can
shrink to sub-atomic levels and enter a lower universe beneath ours in that size or grow well beyond
the height of the tallest Earth buildings and eventually into a higher dimension, where the cosmic
beings of the universe reign."
400CP,Goddess of Winds,Avengers Vs X-Men,"Like the Gods of old, you now have dominance over the very weather itself in the same way that
Storm of the X-Men does. Both earth weather and from other worlds or even space itself, you can
create and control the wind, rain, lightning, temperature and more, even things such as solar winds.
Your powers are immense, manipulating the weather over entire continents at once, but they grow
as your emotions become more intense, potentially even affecting whole planets. You have control
on both the macro scale and on a fairly fine level, such as freezing individuals or controlling the wind
within a person’s lungs. You have a natural flight ability, even outside of your weather control, and
you have an innate connection to nature due to your powers that lets you sense and communicate
with the natural world on a far deeper level than most can dream of. Optionally, you may be part of
the same semi-divine lineage as Storm herself is."
400CP,Quick Like Silver,Avengers Vs X-Men,"Fast beyond all reason, you’ve become a speedster mutant. With speed equal to Quicksilver, any
place on Earth is rarely more than a few seconds movement away and few can hope to keep up with
you in combat, especially when you lay out a thousand punches for every one they return. You’ve
got the reflexes and physical durability to manage your speed like any normal human would manage
their normal speeds. This has result in you being much stronger than normal humans, especially in
your legs, but don’t expect to be lifting multiple tonnes. Your mental processing speed is far beyond
normal people, letting you read dozens of books in minutes, and you also heal several times faster
than humans do. Lastly, you can destabilise and accelerate molecules to accomplish effects like
becoming intangible or disintegrating and/or exploding matter on physical contact, among other strange effects."
400CP,Technolord,Avengers Vs X-Men,"If it’s made of an inorganic material, it’s yours. Or it will be soon. You’re able to alter, manipulate
and reconstruct any inorganic material you can see over a short period of time, including remaking it
into anything you can imagine, so long as you can actually imagine that in detail. Making metal into a
gun is easy when you know how to make a gun, less so if all you can picture is a gun you saw on
television.This control works down to the atomic level and you even have the ability to utilise any
blueprints or information for this transmutation from the minds of people you are in physical
contact with. You have the ability to mentally communicate with machines and electronic beings
over a wide distance and can even phase into machines and directly possess them, as if you had
directly become the machine.
Additionally, you have a natural ability to invent things, similar to the mutant Forge. Unlike the
genius of Stark or Richards, your inventing ability does not necessarily tell you the process of what
you are making and you will often need to take apart your creations, made in fits of inspiration, to
understand how they actually work. Your intuitive design abilities are still enough to make some very
impressive technology, from power armour to mutant nullifying drugs to time travel devices."
400CP,Transport Discs,Avengers Vs X-Men,"Nowhere is ever very far from you, including nowhere itself. You have the ability to create special
Stepping Discs, which can take you and others on those discs across space and time, travelling
between galaxies, dimensions or even to the future or past in an instant. It is difficult to control time
travel exactly however and without much practice, your abilities will often be inaccurate. Your discs
can be made quite massive if need be and used as a form of defense, teleporting away attacks that
hit them if you prepare in time. You must have some visualization of where you want to go, even if
only having seen it in a picture or video."
400CP,Reptilian Atavism,Batman Arkham Knight,"Originally confused for a severe case of Harlequin Ichthyosis, your condition is anything but
normal. Firstly, your body is much larger than an average human’s, starting out at around seven
feet, and is also mostly covered in thick scales capable of resisting low to mid-caliber bullets.
Your teeth are much sharper and harder than a normal human’s, and your jaws can bite down
with enough force to punch through steel. You are also strong enough to rip the door to a vault
off of its hinges, assisted by your claw-like nails. But… this is just the start.
All of these mutations are secondary to your feats of regeneration, capable of even restoring
lost limbs over time. You do not merely heal. You adapt. Years of being shot with average bullets
would render you immune to even the highest calibers normally available, while having a hand
cut off would result in it growing back with greater armor and more powerful claws.
The more damage you take, the more your body will grow, eventually starting to become more
crocodilian, perhaps even gaining a tail to assist in swimming, or larger, more efficient lungs to
stay underwater longer. Be careful though, too many adaptations can make it difficult to maintain
human posture, and you will steadily become more and more beastial. Post-Jump you may
choose to make this crocodilian form an Alt-form"
400CP,Leviathan Master,City of Heroes,"You're one with the briny deep, able to call upon abominatons of the sea for assistance as well as 
mutate tough, shark skin and acidic bile. This also counts as Water Mastery, allowing for limited control 
over water for those who purchase this alone or fine control for anyone taking a water based power set."
400CP,Aquatic Hero Package,Generic Super Academy,"You are a hero uniquely designed for aquatic superiority, though these abilities can often 
be of use on land as well. You are capable of breathing water as easily as air, can swim with 
incredible speed, maneuver easily in water, and are stronger and tougher than a normal human. 
At higher Tiers, you gain control over aquatic animals and even over water itself. 
At Street Tier you are strong enough to lift and throw cars with comparative ease and 
smash through brick walls. You are tough enough to resist small arms with just bruises and can 
swim at up to 100mph. You are immune to the bends and similar conditions. 
At National Tier you could lift a tank or break one with a punch. You can handle artillery 
shells without difficulty, can swim at near-sonic speeds, and are immune to the high pressure of 
the oceanic floor. You can also see even in total darkness and your senses work underwater at 
least as well as they would on land, and can communicate with aquatic animals of all sorts. 
At Global Tier you could lift an aircraft carrier (it was in your way) and smash through 
fortified bunkers with ease. You can handle small nuclear devices, swim at supersonic speeds, 
and ignore any environmental conditions common to the oceans. You can control aquatic 
animals from extreme ranges and can manipulate any surrounding water itself as if it were part of you. 
At Cosmic Tier your strength is like a tidal wave focused to a single point and your 
durability is equivalent. You can move almost instantly through any body of water, sense 
anything happening in that body of water, and can control an entire ocean as if it were your own body."
400CP,Brit,Invincible,"You have become physically invulnerable: nothing of this universe 
can damage you physically any longer. You can tank the punches of a Regent 
Viltrumite, walk through lava, and even geniuses on the level of Robot Rex are 
unable to figure out a way to harm you. Thanks to this invulnerability your body 
has also been increased and improved. You always maintain your ideal body 
shape as long as the minimum amount of caloric intake is maintained and you 

never gain unwanted weight. You have increased 
agility slightly beyond peak human with the flexibility 
of a professional gymnast. Your senses have been 
augmented, allowing you to see like a hawk, smell 
like a dog, and hear like a bat, with no risk of 
damage from overloading them. Finally your 
strength has been increased allowing you to access 
100% of the power of your muscles at all times. This 
allows you to access the full potential power of the 
human body without your muscles tearing your 
tendons off of the bones. With this you could pick 
up, or with effort throw, a sedan. You may optionally 
choose to have this power give you snow white hair. "
400CP,Dupli-Kate,Invincible,"Through a mystic curse you 
have been empowered to be able to use 
Bio-fission, able to at will make clones of yourself 
and absorb them. You are able to make an 
enormous number of clones, each a perfect copy 
of you, who innately exist in a sort of hive mind 
(no one being superior to the others, and all 
working together). When you first activate this 
power you’re limited to making about a hundred 
clones, with time and practice however you will 
discover that you are able to make as many 
clones as you want.  The clones are permanent fixtures in reality and once 
created, they remain unless absorbed and reintegrated into your body, meaning 
that if they get crushed they are a pain to clean up. So long as any single clone 
survives, so will you in your entirety. I suggest you hide one somewhere no one 
else will find it. "
400CP,Green Lantern Powers,Kingdom Come,"Alan Scott has long since stopped caring about Earth’s problems. But space still has issues, and he must
deal with them. In the meantime, you seem to be some strange science experiment by the Guardians to
see if they could create a being with no need for the Green Lantern Ring. You were the result, but they’ve
placed you on Earth as they found it cruel to expect you to serve them without you having a say in the
matter. If you want to be a part of the Corps or not is up you. They had gotten their answer with you, anyway.
You possess all the powers of the Green Lantern ring without needing the ring in the first place, even
those unlisted. Examples include using own willpower for fears such as hurling blasts, creating hard light
constructs, flying, and breathing in space! Along with being a universal translator. You may also access
the massive computer of knowledge on Oa and do complete scans of the entire galaxy at maximum. You
have no weakness to wood or the color yellow. As a side effect you’ll have green skin for the entirety of
the jump. Post jump, you can keep it on you or do away with it as you wish.
But more than that, you don’t need to actively maintain your constructs. You could make a huge space
palace with your own green light without needing to actively maintain it with your will. Anyone could live in
them. Just make sure your cool new space palace doesn’t hit Alan Scott’s. He might not be too pleased
with that."
400CP,Champion of The Great Web,Marvel Age of Krakoa,"You’re a Spider-Totem. Specifically, your
powers are akin to Peter Parker’s. Superhuman strength sufficient to lift ten tons
overhead and sustain that indefinitely and toughness and stamina to match, reflexes
sharp enough that you can more or less fight on autopilot, agility and flexibility at least
four times greater than the finest gymnasts, and perfect balance and equilibrium at all
times no matter how you’re oriented in regard to the force of gravity. Casual control of
molecular bonds lets you form an unbreakable seal between your hands and feet, even
though thin layers of material, and other surfaces to let you crawl or even walk on walls
and ceilings.  Finally, you possess a form of extrasensory perception, a combination of
precognition and clairvoyance, that warns you of danger. For minor things, you aren't
really consciously aware of it, it’s just a matter of reflexes, instinct, and intuition. You
don’t have to look both ways when crossing the street, you’ll just know when it’s safe to
walk. For more pressing things, that require your active evasion, you’ll be alerted by a
tingling or tickling sensation at the back of your head and a general sense of where the
danger is coming from and where to move to avoid it.
Chasm (200 CP, Requires Champion of the Great Web): You took a bath in some
psyhcoreactive goo, and it had an interesting reaction to your powers. Your body can
at-will emit sickly trails of vapourlike psychic energy, which solidify into a psychokinetic
attack against anything that sets off your Spider-Sense. Additionally, you can form
psychic tendrils that, when connected to someone, will drain the memories right out of
their mind, giving you their knowledge and emotions at the cost of inflicting amnesia
and psychological damage on the victim—Eddie Brock lost well over twenty years of
character development in a few minutes—though this can presumably be repaired.
Finally, you have a degree of psychic control over anything this matter is infused into."
400CP,Cosmic Power,Marvel Age of Krakoa,"You wield the power of the cosmos, Jumper. Maybe you’re
the host of the Starbrand? Or you had an encounter with The Black Vortex and it didn’t
wear off like it’s supposed to? Or an alien super-soldier treatment imbued you with the
power of the sun? Or maybe you’re just an unusually powerful Eternal? Regardless, the
cosmic energy that saturates you is a very versatile power, able to do… Almost anything.
At first, using it will be easiest in the form of energy blasts, flight, or protecting yourself
in hostile environments but given enough time and practice there’s virtually no limit to
what you can do with it… Now, note, you’re not… that powerful. A human with this
power would start out on par with a typical Eternal in terms of the raw energy they have,
though it can be made to increase slowly."
400CP,Force of Nature,Marvel Age of Krakoa,"There are two versions of this power. Either you have
control over all aspects of the weather, the power to fly by hoisting yourself aloft with
the wind, and the ability to generate blasts of lightning from your hands, or else you
would gain control over the elements of the earth, including magma, as well as plants
and fungi. In either case, you have a connection to the biosphere that lets you sense the
flow of life energy through a planet and anything on it within your area of control. You
start with an area of effect roughly the size of a city block and can train it up to a large
metropolitan area. This can be purchased twice to gain both versions of the power, but
each counts as a separate power for the purposes of discounts."
400CP,Master of Disguise,Marvel Age of Krakoa,"You have psionic-metamorphic physiology. That is to
say that your cells are highly mutable, responding to your thoughts to alter themselves
or even move around in your body. This allows you to freely alter your bodily
appearance on every level changing your apparent age, your physical sex, your skin hair
and eye colors, height, build, apparent weight… The only hard limit is that your mass
must stay roughly the same. You can also shape clothing from your biomass, but it’s
hit-and-miss. Some textures are harder to imitate than others, it can be hard to get
buttons and zippers to look right, and a big poofy petticoat made of your own flesh will
do nothing against the cold of a dark London night. Finally, you possess a form of ESP
that allows you to subconsciously memorize even the finest details of someone’s body
allowing for perfect impersonations and a mastery of vocal mimicry that will let you
perfectly replicate someone’s voice and mannerisms after just a few lines of natural
dialog."
400CP,Speedster,Marvel Age of Krakoa,"You’re fast, Jumper. Very fast. With this perk you can manipulate
your momentum or personal time flow or something along those lines, allowing you to
casually cruise along at supersonic speeds. Naturally, you have the enhanced perception,
reaction time, stamina, metabolic efficiency, and durability—especially concerning
tendons and ligaments—for those to work properly. With time and effort, you might be
able develop all sorts of cool tricks involving your speed or the effects that cause it.
Eventually, you might even be able to run at relativistic speeds."
400CP,Density,Marvel's Kid Heroes,"You can disperse your molecules, becoming a kind of cloud person who cannot be hurt,
and can ﬂy and ﬁt through tiny cracks. Or condense to become a
tiny person with your full weight.  You might transform this
way in midair as an attack. You can also affect the density of
air or water around you, creating and controlling sponge nets,
cushions (perfect for catching falling people) and shields out
of air bubbles that compress but do not pop."
400CP,Embiggen!,Marvel's Kid Heroes,"You are a Shape-shifter able to alter your appearance,
stretch your body parts to great lengths, and alter your size,
ranging from action-ﬁgure to the size of a small building."
400CP,Ink,Marvel's Kid Heroes,"You gain different powers depending on what is
tattooed on your ﬂesh. A red cross or a caduceus might give you
healing powers, but healing of self, or others? You’ll need to
experiment to ﬁnd out. You can’t copy the greatest of forces,
like the Phoenix Force or Power Cosmic this way, but you can
create shallow imitations which will likely have a high energy
cost."
400CP,Majesdanian,Marvel's Kid Heroes,"You’re an alien who is powered by the sun, no, not that one. You glow with all the
colors of the rainbow, able to ﬂy and ﬁre energy blasts, which
you can also shape into shields or very basic constructs."
400CP,Pheromones,Marvel's Kid Heroes,"You can give off subliminal scent-cues that can have a powerful inﬂuence on
people’s mood, in particular making people suggestible."
400CP,Speed,Marvel's Kid Heroes,"You’ve got it, the ability to run at Mach 4 or more, plus the expected incidentals,
the reﬂexes to avoid smashing into things at speed, the
toughness to mostly be okay with smashing into things,
immunity to heat from air friction, etc."
400CP,Spider,Marvel's Kid Heroes,"You were bitten by a
radioactive arachnid, and now have the powers of one of the most
famous teen heroes. Proportional strength of a spider,
wall-crawling, vastly enhanced reﬂexes and agility, and a
danger sense. There are also various add-ons worth 50 cp each.
- Organic Webbing Just like the Raimi ﬁlms, you can produce
webs from spinnerets in your wrists, in case you don’t like
web-shooters for some reason.
- Ultimate Besides the base powers, you can turn invisible
on command and deliver an electric “venom-blast” by touch.
- Spider-Woman You can glide, are immune to most poisons,
create pheromones that may attract people depending on
gender and mood, and have ranged bioelectric
venom-blasts."
400CP,Wild-Child,Marvel's Kid Heroes,"You know the drill, drastically enhanced senses, healing factor, adamantium
sheathed bones and pop-out claws. As long as you have no more
than six to a limb (Ultimate Sabertooth was lame) I don’t
particularly care if they all come out your hands, or wrists, or
feet, elbows or knees.  Just… try not to hurt yourself, alright?"
400CP,Living Lightning,Spiderman PS4,"It’s like the most powerful amp in the world just took up residence inside your body. You’re a living
lighting man, a person who can straight up throw bolts of electricity like the gods of old. As a living
electrical capacitor, you’re able to generate more than 1000 volts a minute and store up to a million
volts at a time inside of you, just to start. Your can emit and control this electricity, using it in deadly
blasts to tear apart living beings or blast your way through brick walls. You can even fly through the
air at great speed by using your electricity this way and perhaps stranger uses are yet to be found,
should you gain some more control over your powers. It’s also possible for your powers to grow
even more, perhaps to the extent of becoming literally living lightning, though you might need some
outside assistance."
400CP,Cryokinesis,X-Men Evolution,"The power of ice is a formidable power once properly used. By 
manipulating thermal energy to create extreme cold you can freeze anything, create cold winds 
that freeze things within seconds, and more all while being immune to anything cold related. It’s 
not just all about freezing though as you can create snow to form barriers, bridges of ice, and 
other things. The ice you use can form a variety of things from tools, structures, constructs, and 
even a full-body armor that increases physical stats, but still allows free movement. Lastly since 
you freeze everything on the atomic level anything you touch with your ice can be made fragile."
400CP,Duplication,X-Men Evolution,"You can create identical, physical, and living duplicates of yourself with any 
items on yourself or are touching included as well. Rule of thumb is that if you can carry 
whatever you’re touching then it can be replicated. This process is spontaneous and requires 
zero effort. The duplicates think, feel, and act independently, though are usually guided by the 
original. You are telepathically and empathically linked to your duplicates with no regard to 
distance nor plane of existence. Should your clones make any gains or become stronger than 
the original you don’t have to worry. Any experiences, abilities, etc are returned to the original 
upon their death or if you reabsorb them.  

 

You can create up to eight clones at the start that are as powerful as the original and can 
instantly create a clone as soon as its destroyed. With training or time you’ll be able to create 
even more full power clones until there’s a vast army of you’s and can go much further beyond 
even that. Although your clones can’t use this specific duplication power there is nothing 
stopping them from using any other cloning ability you have to make more clones. Have clones 
that create clones that create even more clones and so on."
400CP,Leech,X-Men Evolution,"When no one has powers everyone is normal. You can release a unique type of 
energy pulse over a city block at the start or in concentrated blasts. This pulse disrupts all 
energy fields in the surrounding, shutting down all energy-based systems in the immediate 
proximity for only a short while although there is no cooldown to how many times you can let 
loose a blast. A wide range blast last usually around a minute while concentration can extend 
the blackout duration. This also suppresses even the Mutant X-Gene, temporarily rendering any 
mutant hit by the pulse powerless. In other universes, people that have powers due to some 
genetic mutations will be suppressed. (Aliens don’t count.) "
400CP,Magnetism,X-Men Evolution,"You generate and control magnetic fields and various magnetic forces. 
Metals can be manipulated to levitate or moved in a manner similar to telekinesis and even 
limited flight can be done by using your own magnetism. As a side effect you generate powerful, 
electromagnetic pulses capable of shutting down electrical systems around yourself. Things 
such as manipulating the terrain of a construction site from easily a mile away on the roof of a 
city skyscraper, levitating multiple military tanks and jeeps, and extending your reaches to the 
outer edges of the atmosphere to grab hold of satellites are child’s play. Due note that you won’t 
be reaching the comic’s version of Magneto anytime soon. "
400CP,Organic Steel,X-Men Evolution,"You have the ability to transform your entire body into a form of ""organic 
steel"". In this armored form, your gain superhuman stamina, durability, and strength that is 
allows you to as toss buses and monster trucks into the air. It’s comparable to even the 
unstoppable Juggernaut of this universe who stopped a speeding train with a simple slap. While 
in this state you lack any biological needs of a human like food, sleep, air, etc to sustain 
yourself, and are extremely resistant to injury. High-impact assaults, large caliber bullets, falling 
from tremendous heights, extreme temperatures, and electricity no longer phase you.  With 
training armor can be selectively formed over portions of your body instead of all of your body. "
400CP,Telekinesis,X-Men Evolution,"Mind over matter as the saying goes. You have the ability to move objects 
with your mind. Using this you lift objects such as cars, trains, people, and even yourself to fly. 
You project a great force with your mind which includes such things as powerful shockwaves 
and force fields (strong enough to hold back the water flow of a broken dam or contain a 
massive train explosion). With training or time, you could juggle helicopters with ease and 
possibly even alter the shape of inorganic materials on the molecular level."
400CP,Telepathy,X-Men Evolution,"The power of the mind is truly a powerful thing. You are able to read and 
control minds, pick up psychic screams, project your thoughts to others, create powerful 
illusions that trick all the senses, and can scan locations to find specific minds. Along with that 
you can influence both cognitive and motor functions in others making them do things they 
wouldn’t normally do. Altering memories although highly grey can be done as well if you can stomach the ethics.  
At the start you’ll be able to alter the minds of dozens of individuals at once. With time or training 
you’ll be able to affects a packed sports stadium which ranges from the hundreds to thousands. 
Your psychic abilities will improve to the point where you can project your mind outside your 
body to travel the astral plane, gain the power to fly, and the the ability to create psychic energy 
constructs/weapons, such as a scythe, swords, and horses. "
400CP,Weather Control,X-Men Evolution,"Just like the shamans who used witchcraft to control the weather you 
too have received the ability to control natural forces thanks to a psionic connection to air 
currents, water vapor, and natural electrical energy. In simple terms this means you are able to 
manipulate and control all forms of weather on both a large and small scale usually no bigger 
than a city at the start. You can sustain flight at high speeds in low atmospheres and are 
immune to greater levels of heat and cold without any ill-effects. Modifying the temperature and 
humidity of the environment by controlling the air molecules, controlling all forms of precipitation, 
flash freeze people, forming tornadoes, blizzards, tsunamis, and bringing down lightning are just 
basic skills you’ll manage and with a bit of creativity can come up with much more."
400CP,Animal Morphing,X-Men Movies,"You can take the form of any earth animal, living or extinct. Eventually, you may 
be able to learn to take the form of alien animals, but only things on par with earth animals - you can't 
transform into a dragon or something with superpowers. "
400CP,Energy Blasts,X-Men Movies,"You can now fire energy blasts from one part of your body. Can either be extreme 
heat or concussive blasts. Heat beams can easily cut through solid steel and concussive blasts can punch 
through the same. Order now and you can choose any color for your energy to be! "
400CP,Healing Factor,X-Men Movies,"You heal real fast. In addition to normal healing being sped up, this also means 
you'll be in the prime of your life for centuries and you'll never need to worry about mundane diseases 
or - to a lesser extent - poisons. Pretty much the only way to completely kill you is to destroy nearly all of 
your body, destroy your whole brain, or decapitate you and move your head away from your body. "
400CP,Inorganic Form,X-Men Movies,"You can shift into an inorganic form. Maybe it's steel, maybe it's diamond, maybe 
it's rock, who knows? Whatever the case, it's much more durable than the material would normally be. 
While in this form, you have strength in the 25 ton range, durability enough to ignore being hit with an 
RPG, and essentially limitless stamina. However, it's all or nothing - you can't just transform parts of your 
body. "
400CP,Technopathy,X-Men Movies," You can sense and control technology. Your range is around a mile, but your powers 
work through wifi and over the Internet. No technology is truly safe from you, but more advanced 
systems can stall or even stop you. 
Essentially, a VI or extremely advanced security program can slow you down, an actual, full AI could stop 
you, and something extremly advanced could melt your brain. "
400CP,Teleportation,X-Men Movies,"You can teleport and you can do it fast. Your max range is around 5 miles, but you 
can quickly chain them together to move farther. You'll never be thrown off by teleporting, but other 
people will often puke the first few times they take a ride with you. "
400CP,Astral Shadow,X-Men the Claremont Years,"Any telepath can astrally
project themselves, but most remain tethered to their corporeal body. You, on the other
hand, are capable of existing as a purely astral form, leaving your corporeal existence
behind and surviving in the world of the mind. While in this astral form you cannot affect
the physical world without taking over a host, allowing your mind to overcome and

occupy theirs, but neither will most physical effects affect you; you are a living
manifestation of pure mental energy on the plane of thought. Be warned, though, that
while taking a physical host may allow you to interact with the world, if your host is
killed it will destroy your astral form as well.
Once per jump (or 1 per 10 years in longer jumps) if you are destroyed you may reform
from this astral manifestation. This is neither a comfortable or quick process taking at
least a year, and usually years.
This power alone does not grant you an ability to possess others. You have your original
body for free, and if you leave it you must find your own way back to the physical plane.
To help you, however, if you bought this power at a discount you may also buy
Telepathy and/or Possessive at a discount.
Alternatively you may pay an additional cost of 200 CP (discounted if this was) to gain
Malice’s ability to possess a host by bringing out their emotional shadowside. This can be
resisted, or broken by the strong willed, and you can only possess a single host at a time."
400CP,Cybernetic Body,X-Men the Claremont Years,"Your body has been almost completely replaced with cybernetics. This robotic form grants you super
human speed, durability, endurance, and strength; enough to overcome someone who was
Animalistic and throw them about if your skill in battle was equal, or surpass a
Proudstar in all fields except endurance. You still are not as strong as someone with
Brute Strength and someone made of Organic Steel could rip you limb from limb given
the opportunity. However your cybernetic form makes you particularly receptive to other
attempts to technologically augment your form, easing your attempts to technologically
upgrade yourself. You may import pre-existing CP backed cybernetics, or additional CP
backed cybernetics you obtain later as part of this body.
You may choose to have this power be a mutant power which allows you to somehow
shift between a normal form and that of a cyborg, there’s been weirder, or to be purely
technological in origin. If the latter it will be unaffected by abilities that shut down
mutant powers, or otherwise influence your biologically derived superpowers. Regardless
of which option you choose you may choose to import any man portable items you
purchase here as part of your cybernetic form. If you have bought an Adamantium
Skeleton, for an additional -200 CP (discounted if this was) you may choose to have
this robotic form be armored in adamantium, while this doesn’t make you invincible -
joints and wiring remain vulnerable - you will be very very resistant to harm.
If you bought this power at a discount you may also buy Healing Factor and/or Energy
Blast at a discount."
400CP,Empath,X-Men the Claremont Years,"You now have the ability to understand and manipulate the emotions of others within a certain radius around you.
With but a thought, you can psionically control one emotion (at a time) affecting those
within your range, the degree of manipulation you can cause is also within your control
allowing you to limit your hold over others. For example with anger you can cause others
to be a little ‘ticked off’ or be a hair trigger away from full-blown homicidal rage."
400CP,Gravity Increase,X-Men the Claremont Years,"You are able to increase the effect of gravity on an object or creature. The longer you maintain this power the more strain it
puts upon your body but you are able to geometrically increase the force upon an object
by gravity. Harold Leland, the canon possessor of this ability, was able to cause
Wolverine (already heavy due to his metal skeleton) to break through floors quickly,
cause Colossus to become so heavy he began to sink into the ground, and increase his
weight to the point that even turning human once more did not save him, hold down the
advanced sentinel Nimrod, and decelerate a man launched into the air before
re-accelerating him downwards to hit with the force of a small meteor although the strain
killed him. Most likely as a healthy and fit individual, unlike Leland who was
substantially overweight to the point of heart issues derived from it, you can do more.
Leland was able to with great difficulty extend this power out to a maximum of 4 objects
simultaneously.
For an additional -200 CP (discounted if this was) you may also reverse this effect
making objects lighter, and the pull of gravity upon them less noticeable."
400CP,Illusion Casting,X-Men the Claremont Years,"You are able to project illusions into the minds of others. This can cause them to see, feel, and perceive
something as real even if they know it is an illusion. A strong enough mind can overcome
this power - especially when aware of it - and while possible to project the image into
more than one mind simultaneously it can miss people when doing so. The power of
these illusions is not limitless; someone perceiving a wall might be able to push through
it with strength enough to break through a wall, and it’s better used for making a wall
than something to hit them with as while they may perceive the force it does not create
any actual force."
400CP,Kinetic Charging,X-Men the Claremont Years,"Through skin contact you are able to charge an object causing it to turn (at least some of)
its potential energy into kinetic energy in a large explosion. The larger the object the
more time and energy from you needed to charge it, so you’re unlikely to explode the
Earth with just this power, with objects like playing cards being somewhat weaker than

Energy Blasts, and larger objects like quarterstaffs being a bit stronger; in general if you
charge a larger object you get a larger explosion.
For an additional cost of -200 CP this ability is improved to be able to include more
diverse forms of energization, similar to the Marauder Harpoon’s power, allowing objects
to be charged to paralyze targets, disintegrate living matter, or simply stun targets."
400CP,Miraculous Longshot,X-Men the Claremont Years,"Now with this you’re just plain lucky. Or not. Like the Mojoverse native Longshot, you have the power
of good luck. Events and things just happen to go your way, fly a jetpack through a laser
defense field on your first try, just happen to vault an electric fence where you knock out
the power system of the place you’re breaking into and allow your unpowered and
unskilled companion to walk straight in, and other even more improbable events go in
your favor. This is not necessarily an always active power, you can toggle it off or on as
you desire, and there are two reasons you might want to. The first is that the luck comes
from somewhere for you to be lucky someone else has to be unlucky. This doesn’t
necessarily strike those near you, and in many cases it’s as simple as good luck for you
being bad luck for your opponent. The second is that this luck is reliant on the purity of
your motives. The more pure your motives the luckier you will be, and if you’re selfish
and greedy in your motives using this power may instead bring you misfortune."
400CP,Mirage,X-Men the Claremont Years,"You have the power to project images of the greatest fear of those around you. This image seems real to the individual it’s drawn
from, but to others it will seem to be no more than a half-real illusion. With training and
experience you can project other images, such as their greatest desire or what they love
most, as well as passable illusions of things that you merely wish for people to see - such
as creating the illusion that you are dressed in a manner befitting a high class restaurant -
or images which each individual sees separately as their own greatest fear. This power
also gives you an empathic connection with non-sapient animals, perhaps they’re just
more in touch with their fears and desires. If you bought this power at a discount you may
also take Valkyrie at a discount.
For an additional 200 CP (discounted if this was) you can create a single projection
with physical substance, manifesting it as if it was real. It draws its power from your own
psychic strength, so its durability and power can meet upper limits. You can change this
projection when you desire, and while it must remain a singular concept, it’s possible to
create such things as a car, a bow and arrows, or a swarm of miniature demons.
Separate of the above upgrade, you may pay an additional 100 CP (discounted if this
was) to gain the ability to create arrow/dart like projections of psychic energy which can
disrupt target’s neural pathways by forcing them to relive past trauma, and with time and
effort even physically affect objects with them."
400CP,Organic Steel,X-Men the Claremont Years,"You are able to transmute your skin into living steel. Far stronger than regular steel, you become extremely resistant to harm
and damage in this form, easily as powerful as someone with Brute Strength, and with
increased endurance. While you’ll still be weaker than a Flying Brick by a noticeable
margin, your strength should not be underestimated, and your durability is if anything
more impressive. Be warned that this living steel form does leave you vulnerable to
ferrokinetics and magnetokinetics, though it does come with a great deal of resistance to
other damage; you may not even have a heartbeat, and being heated to white hot and then
covered in several trucks full of liquid nitrogen might lock you in a near dead state but


you could survive it if your powers were somehow deactivated and you were given a
healer’s touch.
For an additional -200 CP (discounted if this was) like Colossus when he was locked
into his iron form your strength is increased; now roughly a match for a Flying Brick’s,
but that is a minor benefit. His living iron form made him disruptive to the magical might
of the Adversary. A trait that has been haphazardly applied in comics since. For you it is
not a haphazard effect; you are now resistant to magic while in your organic steel form
and able to disrupt its effects with your presence. This is not total immunity, it is still
possible for harmful magic to affect you, but it is still enough to create a chance to defeat
a primordial force of multiversal chaos and to make otherwise infallible effects have a
sizeable chance of failure.
If you have bought an Adamantium Skeleton, for an additional -400 CP (discounted if
this was) you may choose to be organic adamantium, applying the durability of
adamantium to your entire body. Not only does this render you nigh immune to physical
harm, you will find your strength increased to approximately the level of a Flying
Brick’s, or closer to the first upgraded level if bought with the previous upgrade to this
ability."
400CP,Phasing,X-Men the Claremont Years,"You possess the ability to phase through physical objects. In this state you are unaffected by gravity, able to move
in three dimensions as if moving up and down stairs. You may extend this intangibility to
clothing and even held objects or individuals. The more mass you make intangible the
more effort is required; similarly the longer you maintain this power the more effort is
required. This intangible phasing state has a special reaction with electronics causing
them to short-circuit when passed through."
400CP,Plague,X-Men the Claremont Years,"You are able to cause extremely devastating diseases with a mere touch; deadly enough to bring down Sabertooth and
cause him to remark that without his healing factor he’d be dead. This power may on
occasion interact oddly with superpowered metabolisms; Beast was infected with this
power and combined with his mutation and the drugs he had been forced to suppress his
mutation he developed increased strength which grew greater with every use at the cost
of locking away more and more of his mental abilities."
400CP,Power Shutdown Field,X-Men the Claremont Years,"You are capable of producing a field that shuts down mutant powers of those
within the range, roughly 10 yards. This shuts down all mutant powers within the area,
sometimes with side-effects depending upon the nature of the affected power, and in
future jumps will do so for any biologically derived ‘superpowers’ not possessed by the
species as a whole."
400CP,Power Shutdown Touch,X-Men the Claremont Years,"You can shut down the paranormal and superhuman powers of others with a touch. This shuts down a target’s
mutant and mutate powers for 1 minute per 1 second of skin contact made while using
this power. In future jumps this will shut down any other biologically derived
‘superpowers’ not possessed by the species as a whole.
Of note, being touched by a mutant with a Power Absorption power or similar ability will
scramble both powers temporarily, turning them both off."
400CP,Visual Telepathy,X-Men the Claremont Years,"Like Artie, or Arthur Maddocks, you possess a unique take on telepathy. Rather cruder than most while
it allows you to make mental links (like normal telepathy), paralyze beings through these
links with intense concentration and difficulty, and to scan minds, it does not seem
capable of implanting thoughts, memories, or any but the crudest manipulations of
others’ (see paralyzing beings). In fact it does not let you directly read minds. Instead you
may project the thoughts of yourself or those whose minds you are scanning, presenting
physical representations of what is being thought. The larger the image the more energy it
takes, and creating an image visible across a city would be your limit, and the more
detailed an image the more difficult as well, but these images can be used to deliver
messages, hide yourself or others, or a variety of other purposes limited by your
cleverness."
400CP,Elemental Kinesis,Young Justice,"Select an element such as fire, electricity, ice, earth, plant,
or darkness. You may produce this element (condensing ice from the air), and/or have
limited control over it (make gigantic plants grow from seeds). This allows you to create
blasts of the element, walls, or other simple objects.

For an additional 200cp, you may control one more element, and combine them to
create a variety of effects.

For an additional 200cp, you are capable of turning into the element you can
manipulate. Similar to what Mist does."
400CP,Telekinesis,Young Justice,"You possess fairly powerful telekinetic powers. Able to create
protective force fields, send telekinetic blasts no weaker than the Energy Blast, hold up
small buildings, move vehicles, move tree-sized pillars, increase your physical strength,
etc. At the start, your telekinesis rivals that of Miss Martian but has the potential to grow.
(Free for Martian)"
400CP,Transmutation,Young Justice,"You can change the state of elements from solid or liquid, into
gas. Although you cannot reverse this process, and it does not work on living tissue.
Meaning you cannot turn a person into gas."
400CP,True Shapeshifting,Young Justice,"You can change your form on a cellular level, completely
altering your physical appearance, including your organic clothing, allowing you to
mimic other people or animals and other creatures. At first, you will not be able to take
on a form of your opposite gender but eventually can master them. Your power is not
restricted to humanoid forms; you can grow several extra arms, grow gills, a mermaid
tail, and much more. The only restriction you have is that you can’t change your mass.
Comes with a free Bio-Suit, capable of changing form with you. Advanced applications
of this power include density shifting, although that could take years for you to learn.
(Free Martian)"
100,Know What I Wish?,Grrlpower,"You have the power to instantly refill any drink or mundane liquid. No magic potions or super-serums. This comes with the side-benefit of replacing your own or others' blood. You cannot refill a large lake, but a village well is likely alright and a gas tank or oil drum is just fine. You cannot use this power to create molten metals or freezing water, nothing too off room temperature.
For an extra 50CP: Remove the above restrictions, super-serums and magic potions are fine, as is a range of temperatures from liquid steel to liquid nitrogen, just remember you need a sample or a flask that once contained them. Still can’t be used for massive amounts."
100,Wasn't There A Movie?,Grrlpower,"You can absorb sonic energy to make yourself temporarily stronger or release it as a wave-attack. 
Consequently, you are immune to harm from sonic powers or weapons. If this sounds incredibly situational, that’s because it is. 
For an extra 50CP because defense alone is kinda sad, you can now emit waves of sonic force. 
Deafening is the easiest use, but by tuning vibrations properly you can shatter steel and concrete."
500 CP,The (Potential) Power of Shazam!,Kingdom Come,"Billy Batson made a deal with a powerful wizard, known as Shazam. You were Shazam’s apprentice, and
learned the secrets of calling on the powers of a god from him. While you learned many magical secrets
from Shazam (And possess considerable magical talent yourself, standing heads and shoulders above
the typical magic user.), Shazam never granted you the powers he gave Billy. However, he did teach you
how to gain them. You start out with two boons from two DC gods or godlike entities like one of The
Endless in your new form. (Permission from said being already granted, somehow.) You may not start out
with contracts to omniscient beings or metaphysical forces like The Presence or The Red. However you
may fill the slots you start out with similar beings Shazam has made a contract with, such as Zeus or
Solomon. You may not start out with a contract with any superhero.
Now you can, in future realms, call upon the powers of a local god or spirit or any other skilled person to
copy their best aspects when you forge a contract with them. If the god or godlike being dies, you lose
this power. You do not lose this power when you leave the world. When you forge a contract with them,
you add their power to a pool you may draw on. This functions as a form of power copying, but you still
need to maintain the connection until you leave the jump, and then you no longer need a connection.
You may only have up to six bound aspects to yourself at a time, and the first letters of the beings’ names
will make up a magic word you can call upon. When you gain access to other beings, you may swap in
and out the powers of other beings from this pool of contracts. You will have no more access to their
power until you swap them back in from the pool.
You may also draw upon this power by shouting this magic word, like Shazam, and transform in a
powerful form that uses these powers. It can manifest in the classic lightning bolt (which can be
weaponized if you shout down the name) or some other elemental display, like spikes of crystal or
obsidian to represent earth or a blast of fire to represent fire. Or flower petals or some other plant display
to represent nature. These will count as magical.
You can grant your contracts to others you have deemed worthy, although they will not be able to pick
and choose powers like you can. You will be the one deciding which gods or entities they derive power
from. Granting parts of or entire contracts to people will make you lose the portion of the contract you
have granted, and granting the entire contract will make you lose them.
You may forge a contract with all-powerful, omniscient beings like The Presence with this power, and
forging a contract with metaphysical forces like The Red is also allowed. However, you may not gain
reality warping abilities with this skill, but gaining any other power is allowed. You will not be any stronger
than an avatar of the metaphysical forces you make a contract with. You may forge a contract with literally
anyone as well."
600,Feral Gene,Marvel Age of Krakoa,"A genetic complex that interacts with the
X-Gene, shaping the mutant’s powers. This power counts as a package bundle of the 100
CP version of Superhuman Senses focused toward smell, the 600 CP version of Healing
Factor, and the Fang and Claw power, the price is reduced for buying them together.
You cannot purchase those powers separately if you purchase this one, though you can
pay the price difference to upgrade individual aspects of it to a higher version. For an
extra 100 CP, you have an adamantium skeleton and the claws to match."
500CP,Flying Brick Package,Generic Super Academy,"You have the classic flying brick powerset of flight, invulnerability, and super strength. 
You also have increased senses, an innate understanding of 3d movement, do not suffer any of 
the typical complications of moving through the air at high speed, and your reflexes are always 
of a sufficient level to make full use of your speed. You tend to have leverage even when you 
really shouldn’t and things tend not to fall apart under their own weight when you pick them up, 
though there might be some superficial damage. 
At Street Tier you can fly at least around a hundred miles an hour, have senses at least 
twenty times superior to a regular human, can bounce small arms fire, small explosives, and 
some lighter heavy weapons and have strength enough to smash through brick walls easily. 
At National Tier you can fly just short of the sound barrier, have senses at least fifty 
times better than a regular human, and can reliably bounce tank shells and high explosives. 
Your strength is sufficient to smash through reinforced steel without noticeably slowing down, 
and you could potentially juggle jumbo jets. 
At Global Tier you are easily supersonic, have senses hundreds of times superior to any 
human, can shrug off small nuclear devices, and your strength is sufficient enough that you 
could pick up an aircraft carrier and throw it at someone. Additionally at this level (or higher) 
your senses can now operate at ranges and in conditions even when they really shouldn’t. 
At Cosmic Tier you could cross from one side of the world to the other in moments, could 
potentially fly to other planets in a reasonable time frame when in space (if you had the means 
to survive in space, of course), have senses many thousands of times superior to regular 
humans, can shatter tectonic plates with your punches and have the durability to take those same sorts of hits in turn."
500CP,Atom Eve,Invincible,"Somehow the government experimented on you as a fetus. 
As a result of this you are now able to innately understand ​everything​ to do with 
chemistry, and the make-up of molecules, while also having the ability to 
transmute matter at will. 

This can come in many forms, everything from generating constructs of energy, 
that could even allow you to fly, all the way to manipulating the atoms of 
non-living matter. You could create a piping hot cheeseburger from a brick, but 
you could not generate a living being or alter one. Hell 
you could generate a mansion and plenty of fine dining 
level food just from detritus around you. You cannot 
control living things, however, as the government that 
created you also implanted mental blocks that prevent 
you from altering them. These blocks do not naturally 
degrade except temporarily during times of extreme 
emotional stress (like if you were dying after having a 
Viltrumite punch a fist sized hole through your 
abdomen and spine) where you will be able to use this 
power on anything for a few seconds at most.  When 
activated they automatically heal you to the prime of 
your health as well as anyone else nearby whom you care deeply about. These 
powers do activate as you die of old age: congrats, you are now physically 
immortal. 

A secondary aspect of this power that is both positive and negative is that as you 
use it results in rapid caloric depletion and the shunting of unused atoms into 
your digestive tract. While this will never be damaging to you, so long as you use 
your powers regularly you will always stay thin and remain unable to put on 
weight past your desired body type no matter what you eat. The secondary and 
less pleasant aspect of this is that if you use your powers ​very​ heavily you will 
need to go to the bathroom several times a day. With practice and mastery you 
may be able to learn to prevent this from occurring. 

Normally you would be unable to use your powers while pregnant as their use 
would put a strain on and potentially kill any foetus that you carry, meaning that if 
you got pregnant you would have to go 9 months without using this power. 

However thanks to the power of jumpchain this issue is no longer there allowing 
you to use this ability anytime without fear of damaging a foetus. 

Energy constructs default to bright pink, but as you are buying your power here 
you can decide what colour they are when you buy this perk.  

A person with this perk would be capable of creating constructs or manipulating 
matter that could block a young Viltrumite, and given years to train might even be 
able to survive against a veteran Viltrumite in combat. While the mental blocks do 
not naturally degrade, you could break them given the appropriate powers or 
tech. If the powers are ever unblocked, then even a Regent level Viltrumite would 
need to fear them as you could easily turn them into literal swiss cheese. For an 
extra ​400 CP​ you can get these powers without the mental blocks, allowing you 
to affect living beings.  "
500CP,Bulletproof,Invincible,"​Almost as fast as Red Rush, as 
strong as Invincible when he first got his powers, with 
durability almost on par with Omni Man himself, you have 
been empowered by esoteric energy in a similar way to the 
hero, Bulletproof. What this actually means is that you can 
fly, you are almost as fast as Red Rush himself, strong 
enough to shatter skyscrapers and break small mountains, 
and are far more durable than a young Viltrumite as well. 
Where a young Viltrumite would be killed by the force it 
takes to shatter a small mountain it would require Mt. 
Everest shattering levels of power to harm you.  "
500CP,Doc Magmanite,Invincible,"You have gained several powers through a mystical 
empowerment. You gain the ability to control and produce potent sonic blasts, 
enough that you could kill a young Viltrumite with some effort or destroy a 
building, as well as increased physical ability to the point that you could match 
the Immortal. Finally you are able to summon 
and control the Magmanites wherever you are. 
These are a race of earthen creatures that can 
be summoned by you to break out of the ground 
while following your every order. 

For an extra 100 cp, your body is elementally 
empowered allowing you to generate huge 
blasts of your chosen element and control it in 
your environment.  
This empowerment results in you taking on an 
elemental empowered form, which you are able 
to toggle on and off at will, with the elemental 
abilities only being 
available to you in your 
empowered form. Your elemental abilities are enough for 
you to slightly wound a veteran Viltrumite or kill a young 
Viltrumite. You may buy multiple elements here for an extra 
100 cp per element.  (All elements must be generally 
natural with no esoteric ones allowed. Earth, Air, Lava, 
Lightning would all be acceptable choices. Magic, Gravity, 
Light, Shadow, Time, Energy, etc… would not). Any additional elements are 
integrated into your elementally empowered form and you can use all elements 
at once."
500CP,Immortal,Invincible,"You my friend have been 
cursed by an extraordinarily powerful being. 
You are immortal, unageing, forever in your 
prime. You may fly, no longer need to breathe 
and have physical abilities at just about half of 
those of a young Viltrumite. You are able to 
destroy buildings and take building destroying 
blows, along with flying at supersonic speeds, 
with the stamina to operate full bore for about 
48 hrs before needing to rest. You are also 
able to survive and fight in a vacuum. The greatest ability you possess however 
is your regeneration. You can heal from anything that damages you, regenerating 
so fast that people can watch it happen in real time. If your heart is plucked from 
your chest it regrows, as would a cut off arm or anything that is similar. The only 
weakness that your regeneration has is that of removing your head from your 
body. Should this occur, you will fall into a coma akin to death until the head is 
touched once more to where it was removed. Should your head be completely 
obliterated it will regrow with no memory or personality loss. The only way to 
truly, and permanently, kill you is to rip you apart atom from atom to the extent 
that there is nothing left to regenerate from. Still, if you are in a state where your 
head has been removed from your body and you are in a coma when a jump 
ends, you will lose the chain as if you had died. "
500CP,Monster Girl,Invincible,"You have been cursed by a Witch of tremendous power. 
Her curse allows you to change into a hulking green monster with tremendous 
strength and durability whenever you wish. Every time you change into your 
monster you regress slightly in age meaning that every transformation causes 
you to get younger, with your monster form increasing 
in strength the younger your natural form is. This 
increase in strength does increase the size of your 
monster form slightly. Thanks to the magic of cp 
however you can turn this age regression off or on as 
desired. If you are physically 18-20 years old your 
monster form would be strong enough to beat a young 
viltrumite to death with durability on par with a veteran 
Viltrumite. If you ever let yourself regress in age to an 
infant your monster form might become powerful 
enough to fight or even defeat a Regent level 
Viltrumite one on one.  While transformed you have 
unlimited stamina. "
500CP,Themiscryan Amazon,Kingdom Come,"Much like Diana Prince, you too are made of clay, created by an Amazon who desired a child. Your
mother had done many great deeds in the name of the Greek Gods, and so they sought to reward her.
The gods breathed life in the sculpted clay body to show their gratitude. You are a literal gift from the
gods, and the envy of your peers growing up (except for Diana, who was always your equal). You have
the boons to match.
You also have her exact same powers and strength. Given how similar you were birthed. You carry
genius level intellect, you may fly (At incredibly high speeds), your healing is accelerated, you have
empathic abilities that enable you to discern someone’s needs and current emotional state. Ending entire
wars between countries is within your abilities of negotiation. A star diplomat, you are Diana Prince’s
equal in almost every way, including when it comes to diplomacy. You also have advanced vision, and
you are trained in the fighting style of the Amazons. You also possess super strength, up to levels that
could threaten even Superman himself.
If you’re a man, you’ll still be given their training. Since you were created by an Amazon, you will be seen
as kin by them for the duration of the jump."
500CP,Elixir,Marvel's Kid Heroes,"You control the biology and genetics of all life you touch, including yourself. You can heal
anything short of death, and occasionally even that, if you get
there quick enough. Your touch can as easily kill as mend."
500CP,Green-Thumb,Marvel's Kid Heroes,"You talk to plants, though only a few reply. You can make huge trees and whipping
vines shoot out of the ground, even in the middle of a desert and
plants obey your every command, though they may need rest after
too much strenuous movement."
500CP,Tarot,Marvel's Kid Heroes,"You can animate the ﬁgures on playing cards, allowing them to rise up, grow and ﬁght as
temporary constructs under your command. Not sure why you’d
use tarot cards when Magic and Pokemon and other CCG games
exist, but I suppose they’re safely public domain."
500CP,Technopath,Marvel's Kid Heroes,"You can mentally control technology at least as sophisticated as an internal combustion
engine over a huge radius, most of a continent. You can mentally
access information from and command computers, and speed-code
faster and better than most AIs. Iron Man better watch out."
500CP,Negativity,Spiderman PS4,"A strange energy was discovered within you as a child, a sort of dark electrical power that appears to
be fueled by the negative emotions of the wielder, enabling many superhuman feats that will grow
in power as your inner darkness does. You have the ability to generate and control this negative
energy from within your own body, drawing on any negative emotion you have as it’s source, such

as guilt or hatred or rage, and the more negativity you have to draw on, the greater you grow.
Boosting your physical abilities is easy, as is launching your negative energy in destructive blasts or
enhancing existing weapons with them. You’re also able to corrupt or attempt to corrupt other
people with your energy, pitting your negative powers against whatever willpower to resist they
may have in their minds. Their failure results in them becoming loyal slaves to you, empowered by
whatever portion of your negative energy you gave out. If you could allow yourself to be consumed
with hate and guilt, you could be moving so fast you practically teleport and blow up entire buildings
with your blasts. Not so healthy for your mind though."
500CP,Masque Maker,X-Men the Claremont Years,"Like the mutant Masque you are able to reshape the flesh of others with your touch. By touching an individual you can begin to
mold and reshape their flesh almost like clay. You can reshape appearances to make
someone look like someone else you have seen with startling accuracy, even without a
photograph or a reference, or you can create more inhuman shapes like prehensile
tentacles or faces without mouths, eyes, or noses. While this power can work on fresh
corpses, it cannot affect yourself. You can revert changes you have made with a single
touch."
500CP,Super Speed,X-Men the Claremont Years,"Like Super Sabre you are
able to move at speeds much greater than human. You can run and act at speeds
surpassing that of sound, possibly even 3 to 5 times its speed. If you have a power that
grants flight this will make your flight speed significantly faster than your ground speed
(at least when at full velocity)."
500CP,Technological Transformation,X-Men the Claremont Years,"You are able to quickly transform nearby technological materials - metal, glass, and plastic - reshaping them into new forms, allowing you to control and transform nearby
technology. The range - as shown by the possessors in this period - is low, one being
limited to touch, the other not much further. Still you can cause these materials to
re-arrange to take on new forms limited by your engineering knowledge and available
materials. Coupled with an intuitive inventing ability (like Forgemaster) this could be
used to rearrange an automated wheelchair into a personal helicopter, or make your own
imitation fantasti-car, without it, you might be able to make on the fly modifications to
your gun quickly changing your load-out to reflect enemies’ powers and target if you
knew the necessary elements of engineering and design.
If you bought this at a discount you may also buy Forgemaster at a discount."
500CP,Vertigo Effect,X-Men the Claremont Years,"You possess a rather focused sort of mental ability; psionic waves of mental disruption. You can scramble the physical senses
of others at a range or in an area. This causes disorientation, nausea, and feelings similar
to vertigo. Those familiar with this effect will find it easier to resist, and those with
training and experience as acrobats or similar as well, but for the unwarned you can
quickly disable a group as the world seems to spin around them and their ability to stand
up straight - much less fight - grows disrupted."
500CP,Bad Luck Manipulation,Young Justice,"You can consciously use the probability fields, to
manipulate bad luck to your advantage. This can allow you to make your enemies trip,
or their weapons malfunction, powers to go out of control, and coupled with magical
training, this power can do far more."
50CP,Miscellaneous,Generic Super Academy,"This power is used to represent minor superhuman abilities, like Spider-Man’s ability to 
wall-crawl or shoot webs, the ability to summon a particular weapon to your hand, the ability to 
see infrared light, to breathe underwater, or something of a similar scale. This power is always 
Street Tier and it can be taken multiple times to represent multiple minor abilities."
50CP,No One Has Pointy Ears!,Grrlpower,"You have really good hearing. Some might call it superhuman. You can get at least a vague idea where people are by how they block ambient sound, and can eavesdrop on a conversation taking place on the other side of a large swimming pool."
50CP,Super Bite Man,Grrlpower,You can shapeshift your jaw and mouth to match that of any member of the animal kingdom. Bite with the awesome force of a crocodile or T-Rex.
50CP,Cipher,Marvel's Kid Heroes,"You are ﬂuent in every language. This offers
some hidden beneﬁts, your conscious awareness of body
language can give you a leg up in social situations or
predicting attacks, for instance. Fluency in programming
languages helps with computers and while you can’t just read
things that are encrypted, you’re astonishingly good at
deciphering them. Sadly, nothing crazy like understanding the
music of the spheres."
50CP,Crazy Legs,Marvel's Kid Heroes,"Your legs stretch to over sixty feet long! You can decide at any time if you want to stretch only the parts
above or below the knee, or distribute it. You also gain the
skills to balance on stilt-like legs. Great for kicking someone
from the other side of a room or reaching high shelves."
50CP,Fireworks,Marvel's Kid Heroes,"You can shoot little exploding sparkles from
your hands. Great for the Fourth of July, not so much for most
purposes. Could give people burns though, and maybe knock
something over."
50CP,Flight,Marvel's Kid Heroes,"A power every human has wished for at one point,
and yet one of the saddest powers to be the extent of a
superhero’s gifts. You can hover, turn on a dime and on the
straightaways break the sound barrier. You likely leave a
distinctive trail of some kind, ﬂames, rainbows or wisps of a
cloud you ride on.
- Cannonball (-150 cp, discount X-Baby) While ﬂying, you are
encased in a personal forceﬁeld making you virtually
invulnerable. Requires Flight, the entire package is
discounted for X-Babies, to 100 cp."
50CP,Hazmat,Marvel's Kid Heroes,"Your body emits radiation, both in a general
radiance and in focused blasts. Unlike Jennifer Takeda, you can
completely control this power and shut it off without a suit.
You are also immune to harm from radiation, only be careful of
your friends who might not be."
50CP,Lighttrakker,Marvel's Kid Heroes,"You can teleport! Only line-of-sight
though. In fact, you can only teleport directly in front of a
bright light, though even someone mirror-signaling with a
phone or metal tag will do. You lack the range to reach the sun
or moon, momentum is dispersed when you teleport. Unlike
Rebecca Littlehale, you are entirely in control of this power."
50CP,Project,Marvel's Kid Heroes,"You can create holographic images in the air.
With practice you can achieve something like basic illusions,
but close examination will pretty much always give the game
away."
50CP,Razor,Marvel's Kid Heroes,"Your skin, like a shark’s, is covered in
razor-sharp teeth-like structures. Your teeth and nails can
carve steel. Somehow you never seem to cut your clothes or
friends or anyone you didn’t mean to."
50CP,Skin,Marvel's Kid Heroes,"You have an extra six feet of loose skin you can
stretch, compress, deform etc. at any point on your body, from
giving yourself a springy-spongy armor about the head or
midsection to wrapping your ﬁngers all around something.
Unlike Angelo Espinosa, you may retract your excess skin into
your body."
50CP,Waker,Marvel's Kid Heroes,"You are immune to poisons and toxins of all kinds.
More, your body collects all such contaminants, storing them in
a sort of gland or node in your left armpit. You can then inject
them into people via a left-handed “death touch.” Your power
only activates by conscious effort."
50CP,Werebeast,Marvel's Kid Heroes,"You can turn into a wolf, or a half-human,
half-lupine transitional form. You gain enhanced senses and a
bit of physicality. Alternatively, your alternate form could be
a cat or other animal."
50CP,Wither,Marvel's Kid Heroes,"Your touch can cause organic matter to crumble
to dust. Unlike Kevin Ford, your power doesn’t “hunger” and you
always control it completely."
300,Psychic,Marvel's Kid Heroes,"You’ve got mind power! Not to the extent as X-Man or Legion, let alone Franklin, maybe,
but your telepathy can match a young Charles Xavier and your
telekinesis is a match for Marvel Girl. Should you wish, you may
take either the telepathy or telekinesis alone for only 300 cp."
800,Power Copying,Marvel Age of Krakoa,"When you are in the presence of other
superhumans, you can replicate their powers within yourself. For 600 CP your range is
several meters and you're restricted to one “category” of superhumans, such as copying
biological powers or technological enhancements. You start only being able to copy the
one, but with practice will eventually reach the point where you can hold an arbitrary
number of powers at a time. However, you can only hold power while the person you
copied it from is in range. For an additional 100 CP, you can copy any power from any
type or origin. For a separate additional 100 CP, you intuitively and instinctively know
how to use your copied powers and can synchronize them together with each other and
your own abilities, as well as helping those you are copying the powers of to synchronize
amongst each other."
600CP,Color Hulk,Avengers Vs X-Men,"Via a catastrophic infusion of gamma rays, you’ve turned into a big, strangely coloured, mean
monster. Or just another Hulk, as others would see it. You have the power to transform into a much
larger and much more powerful form like any of the Hulks, in a colour of your choice. In this form,
you have near limitless strength, stamina and physical durability, with these rising the more angry
you become while in this state. What little can harm you will find that, beyond the dangers of cutting
into a radiation infused being like yourself, you also heal quite exceptionally quickly and can survive
losing most of your head or many of your internal organs without much issue. Your body will slowly
adapt to any environment as well, coming to be able to survive and even thrive in it, even in space.
While you do not have an alternate personality in your transformed state, having already merged
mostly with it, you will find that it is far easier to get angry and become angrier still while
transformed."
600CP,Marvelous,Avengers Vs X-Men,"After having undergone the same machine procedure as Miss Marvel, you’ve gained the same
powers as her, becoming a strange Kree hybrid with whatever you were before plus a bunch of other
unexplained powers.
Your body possesses enormous levels of strength and durability, above most of the Marvel heroes
short of the Incredible Hulk, and you can move or fly through the air at outrageous speeds. You’ve
got matching reflexes and agility to your great speed, as well as healing exceptionally quickly. Your
most impressive powers relate to energy however. You have the ability to absorb almost any type of
energy, in enough amounts to drain a white hole rapidly, and can channel that energy to many
purposes, such as massively boosting your physical abilities or rate of healing. You can fire the
energy in destructive blasts from your hands or eyes and even use it to alter matter or energy
around you on the molecular level, at least with a bit of practice. The energy can also be actively
shaped and controlled, such as to make shields or blades, and it can replace your need for rest,
sustenance or air. Fighting in the void of space isn’t an issue if you dip into a star now and then. If
you drain enough energy at once, you’ll be able to temporarily enter a much more powerful ‘Binary’
form which will vastly enhance your energy manipulation powers."
600CP,Master of Magnetism,Avengers Vs X-Men,"Now you hold Magneto’s terrific abilities to control Magnetism within your body, allowing you to
manipulate magnetic fields and objects, even the entire planet’s geo magnetic field. Your finesse is
exceptional, allowing you to assemble complex machinery with your mind, and you can focus on
many different tasks with your power at once. Though it is far more tiring in comparison to your
largely effortless magnetic powers, you are also able to manipulate the Electromagnetic Force
directly, giving control over almost any form of energy instead of just magnetism."
600CP,Mimic,Avengers Vs X-Men,"What can be more powerful than the power to have more powers? You have the power to copy
other mutant powers, as well as the knowledge and skills of even normal people, should they be
within a several hundred foot radius of you. You can control which things you do or do not copy but
do not have any awareness of what is available to copy in your range, though you can choose to
automatically copy everything if you’re willing to risk it, as certain powers can be harmful for you to
take on. The irradiated nature of the Hulk would leave you with radiation poisoning, as an example.
Any powers, skills or knowledge you copy is only temporary, leaving you once the one you are
copying it from leaves your range. However, spending years of constantly copying a certain person
can leave you with their abilities permanently."
600CP,National Leader,Avengers Vs X-Men,"You’ve become a living conduit to energy from another dimension, like Captain Britain is to
Otherworld. This energy bursts out from within you but the gateway within appears to be
modulated by your current confidence in your own abilities. Being confident will increase your
powers and losing faith in yourself will weaken or negate them entirely. While the energy is at your
fingertips, even at a reasonable level of confidence, you’ll find yourself endowed with immense
physical attributes. You’ll have the strength to easily compete with and overpower Miss Marvel and
come close to the Hulk at his base, along with a maintained forcefield around your person that can
stand up to even the full Phoenix Force for a few seconds. The forcefield can be controlled to let
through specific substances, such as oxygen and light, without letting in harmful things or too much

of a specific material. Your powers allow you to travel at extreme speeds and even fly through space,
along with enhancing your senses the more energy is flowing through the rest of your body. The
inter-dimensional energy you make use of is nearly unlimited in amount and will remain accessible
to you in future worlds in this form."
600CP,Body of Eden,Batman Arkham Knight,"The result of a genetic experiment gone wrong, designed to fuse plant and human tissue into a
cohesive whole… but perhaps tapping into an even greater force. Your skin has become
chlorophyll green, and the veins closest to the surface will resemble vines under your skin. You
are now more plant than mammal, capable of receiving nutrients via photosynthesis, producing
pheromones that can mentally influence humans, and render yourself poisonous to the touch.
But, most impressively, and also most strangely, you have the ability to manipulate plants. You
can “Speak” with them in a way, shaping their growth. Your limits are few and far between, so
long as you have access to enough nutrients. Turn a simple flower into a building-sized
carnivorous monstrosity, make vines strong and fast enough to restrain a grown human in
seconds, or map out an entire city through the roots of trees. However, your condition also
comes with some weaknesses. You are particularly vulnerable to fire, and also especially to
herbicides. Also, during this Jump the general condition of plant life around you will have an
effect on your physical well-being. The healthier the plants are, the stronger you will be. The
more of them that are poisoned or dying… well, I’d try to fix that if I were you. Post-Jump you
may choose to make this plantlike form an Alt-form"
600CP,Archery,City of Heroes,"Who says bows are archaic? Well, no one ever said that to your face. You're supernaturally good with a 
bow and arrow, able to rain fist fulls of arrows or rapid shot them as fast as any semi-automatic pistol. 
While some may chuckle at first, they'll stop their snickering when you plug your arrow directly through 
a tank's hull. Your accuracy and utility with arrows is also increased, able to take the same shots a sniper 
can with the naked eye and able to accurately stun or wound opponents."
600CP,Bio-Armor,City of Heroes,"You now have a shell, a carapace made of smaller organisms. These tiny symbiotes regenerate quickly, 
creating an ablative layer between you and your opponents. Not only that but when they break and shatter, 
they release spores into the air. While not lethal they can imitate allergic reactions, effecting vision and 
respritory systems. You can also enter a durable cocoon to recover from near lethal wounds or to even 
gain a quick rest, an effective night's sleep in half the time."
600CP,Dual Pistols,City of Heroes,"You master the art of Gunkata, basically you're the movies ""Wanted"" and ""Equilibrium"" combined. You 
can bend bullets, calculate short term trajectories and basically gun-fu your way out of melee combat. 
This also makes you very adept at dodging close range bullets as you watch for muscle twitches and see 
the slight bends in barrels, it makes you seem like you're psychic in a mexican stand off. If you have 
Assault Rifle or are an Arachnos Soldier, you can convert your weapons into Dual Pistol form, granting 
them the same munitions flexibility but slightly less punch."
600CP,Elemental Armor,City of Heroes,"Choose an element: Dark, Electricity, Fire, Stone and Force. You now have nigh invulnerability to that 
element and your focus with it allows you to envelop your body and once you've trained to your pinnacle, 
you can become a manifestation of that element for a short time by expending an exhausting amount of 
energy."
600CP,Elemental Assault,City of Heroes,"Choose one of the following: Fire, Electricity, Darkness, Force, Cold, Earth, Psionics, Sonic and Water. 
You may not have finesse, you may not even have tact, but what you do have is the sheer focus and power 
to destroy with your chosen element, melting armor, punching water through steel, decaying tendrils of 
shadows ripping foes apart. When it comes to destruction from afar, you're a savant. Control is hard 
though, don't expect to heat your morning cup of coffee without melting it."
600CP,Elemental Control,City of Heroes,"Choose one of the following: Fire, Electricity, Darkness, Force, Cold, Earth, Psionics, Plants, Sonic and 
Water. Unlike Elemental Melee and Elemental Blast, you don't pack quite as big a punch. What you lack 
in power, you make up for in subtlety and control. Electricity could redirect the power in a system or 
Darkness can dim an entire room just enough to slip by un-detected, Earth could hold your enemies in 
place and Psionics could leave subtle suggestions and possibly full mind control with concentration and 
practice. At your zenith you may summon small elmentals of to cause chaos and battle in your stead."
600CP,Elemental Melee,City of Heroes,"Choose from the following elements: Fire, Electric, Darkness, Force and Earth. You can wield these 
elements to great effect when you're up close and personal. Rocky fists, chain lightning kicks, you're an 
elemental beast. As opposed to the blast option, melee elementals attacks generally have more damage 
and force behind them."
600CP,Empathy/Pain Manipulation,City of Heroes,"You control life energies and pain to heal to astonishing effect. You can heal minor wounds with but a 
wave of a hand or equalize pain and damage between a group of individuals. At the height of your power, 
your very presence gives increased endurance and passive healing to allies within a fifty foot radius of 
yourself. Last but not least, you can exhaust yourself once per day to raise a person from the dead who 
has fallen no more than a week prior."
600CP,Force Field Projection,City of Heroes,"FUCKING BUBBLES! With experimentation and practice you can make protective fields for all manner 
of things. A field that blocks kinetic force, Radiation, Sound, Heat, a great many things! You can also 
project force fields that detain enemies, locking them in a containment bubble. Repulsion is another thing 
you excel at, being able to generate repulsive waves from around yourself to knock back a sedan."
600CP,Gravity Control,City of Heroes,"You gain control over gravity and attraction between objects, initially enough to lift, repel and attract 
objects at roughly the same force of Earth's own gravity. (Still effective, you're basically making people 
fall in different directions) You can also destabilize molecules and make others intangible for a short time. 
At the height of your power, you double the force of your gravity control and can create an autonomous 
singularity which posesses many of your abilities."
600CP,Illusions,City of Heroes,"You gain the ability to project complex hallucinations, decoys and even autonomous phantasms that can 
produce even more illusions. You can even cause your enemies to faint or have heart attacks just because 
they think they were dealt some horrible injury, though watch out, they'll catch on when they realize the 
harpoon in their chest isn't really there."
600CP,Invulnerability,City of Heroes,"You are just straight up, one of the hardest people to kill. You don't gain any durability to mental 
attacks but everything else is just mosquito bites. Train hard enough and an RPG to the skull will barely 
mess up your hair."
600CP,Martial Arts,City of Heroes,"You learn all earthly hand to hand fighting styles and you gain the know-how to utilize them against 
super-powered opponents. Because lethality is an issue utilizing regular strength to combat these threats, 
you've become quite adept at disabling them through hitting pressure points or locking joints. When you 
train up enough, you can deliver the Eagle's Claw, a focused kick which can destroy an Abrams if  executed perfectly."
600CP,Radiation Blast,City of Heroes,"A particularly nasty ability, you fire radioactive particles and clouds at people. Sure, it might not hurt 
much initially but then the burning sets in, their eyes sting and their electronic equipment goes out. You're 
a walking war crime and it's hard for you to be a hero without some serious moral issues regarding how 
much cancer you're giving the enemy. In addition, you gain full immunity to harmful radiation."
600CP,Regeneration,City of Heroes,"You gain the ability to regenerate three times faster than a normal person at first and you can call 
upon bursts of healing if you focus and drain your body's nutritional reserves. When you complete 
training, you can enter a hyper regenerative state once per day for a minute that heals wounds almost as 
quickly as you get them and in this minute you have limitless endurance with which to use your powers."
600CP,Shield Defense,City of Heroes,"You become even more adept at defending others as well as becoming a master of shield combat. For 
whatever reason, a shield is just more durable in your hands, a trash can lid feeling like it's made out of 
pure steel when you block bullets and if you already have a good shield then you can swat tank rounds out 
of the way."
600CP,Storm Summoning,City of Heroes,"You're able to control the weather to create localized mists or gusts of wind. Your allies can gain 
boons from air quality control and natural barriers for escape. At the height of your power you can 
summon a storm cloud which will fire lightning and gusts at your opponents for you and you'll be able to 
calm full sized hurricanes and storms down to drizzles with enough focus."
600CP,Super Reflexes,City of Heroes,"Why bother being tougher or healing faster when you never get hit? Your body gets limited super 
speed and your reflexes jump up by a twice their normal rate. If the new passive buff isn't enough, you 
can also slow time for yourself in exchange for expending more energy."
600CP,Super Strength,City of Heroes,"Who needs swords and fire? You chuck cars like snow balls. When you hit your potential, the 
strongest of your punches will be able to stop a Kaiju in it's tracks."
600CP,Thorn Assault,City of Heroes,"Your body generates spines and thorns the same material as your bones. They carry with them a corrosive 
poison capable of crippling foes. You may fire spurs from your body or generate thicker spines to use as 
melee weapons."
600CP,Willpower,City of Heroes,"Gods need not apply, this power takes the will of the weaker man and makes them rise to the 
occasion. The more mooks pounding on you, the bigger the guy you're fighting, the more durable and 
enduring you become. You may not become stronger, but your body will only quit when your will quits, 
leading to fascinating displays of pain tolerance and energy."
600CP,Creation,Generic Super Academy,"You have the ability to create objects from nothing. You also have the ability to design 
the intended object as if you had a mental CAD system.  
At Street Tier you can create objects no larger than a small car. You do not need to fully 
understand how these objects work, but they are limited to mundane technology and objects. 
Nothing living, no magic, and no super-tech. 
At National Tier you can create objects up to the size of a small house. This can create 
any mundane object, as well as any super-tech or magic items that you understand well enough to construct normally.  
At Global Tier you can create objects up to the size of an aircraft carrier. You can now 
create super-tech or magic items that you have encountered before, even if you have no idea 
how to create it normally. You can also create mundane living beings, such as animals or plants. 
At Cosmic Tier you could create an entire city, or, with sufficient time and focus 
something considerably larger, possibly up to planetary size. You can create any super-tech or 
magic just like Global Tier and can even create living beings with magic or super abilities. "
600CP,Force Manipulation,Generic Super Academy,"The precise nature of the force you manipulate isn’t so important as to what you can 
achieve with it, whether it’s some sort of ’pure’ force, ‘emotional spectrum’, or something 
stranger still. Primarily this power deals with the creation of force fields and, at the higher tiers, 
the creation and manipulation of constructs of force. As an iconic example, at the higher tiers 
this power could be likened to something similar to what a Green Lantern might do. These 
powers generally require concentration to maintain or use effectively, and do not last for more 
than a few moments unless you actively maintain them. The one thing that tends to be true 
about all types of force manipulation is that it’s very obvious when they are in use, though 
individuals with extreme levels of finesse or experience with their powers may be able to use them in more subtle ways. 
At Street Tier you could create force shields or bubbles that could shrug off small arms 
fire and small explosives, though you can not create these fields much further than about a 
hundred feet away from yourself, and their size is generally no larger than a large truck. You 
can imbue your physical strikes with ‘force’ energy, allowing you to strike much harder than normal. 
At National Tier your force fields can be made within about a thousand feet of yourself, 
and can cover a medium sized house. At this level they could take repeated tank shells or high 
explosives before cracking, and you’ve unlocked rudimentary ‘force constructs’, such as simple 
tools or items, like a boxing glove for example. At this level the amount of force your constructs 
can put out is roughly equal to their defensive strength, and you can apply them as a skin tight 
force-field around yourself, allowing you to fly at subsonic speeds. 
At Global Tier your constructs can stretch or cover distances of many miles, and could 
take repeated hits from someone with Global Tier super-strength before cracking. You have 
unlocked the ability to use complex force constructs, and can make just about any type of 
construct you can imagine so long as no single part of its mechanism requires atomic scale 
precision to work and you have a general understanding of how that object is made if it requires 
moving parts. At this level you no longer need to concentrate to maintain your personal force 
field, and it actively recycles air (if you need air) and regulates temperatures and harmful 
radiation, potentially allowing you to operate in areas and environments normally hostile to life 
(such as space or the deep ocean). Additionally you can create blasts of your ‘force’, which are 
incredibly powerful and destructive but which have no true exotic effects, and can fly many 
times faster than the speed of sound. 
At the Cosmic Tier your constructs could potentially be used to tow a planet, and could 
allow you to simulate (low end) Cosmic tier strength and durability. Your force blasts are even 
more destructive, enough that you might eventually batter down a Cosmic tier defense given 
time and effort, though they still have no true exotic effects beyond simple destructive force. You 
no longer need to focus to maintain any of your constructs, as they will last until you dismiss 
them or they are destroyed so long as you are (relatively) nearby. There is no functional limit to 
how complex your constructs can be made, so long as you have sufficient working knowledge of 
the mechanisms required. At this level your flight could allow you to traverse from one side of 
the world to the other in moments, or fly to distant worlds in a reasonable timeframe when in space."
600CP,Hulking Brute Package,Generic Super Academy,"You are the quintessential brick, the mountain of muscle that stands toe-to-toe with the 
bad guys, taking their best shots and dishing out major punishment in return. You are incredibly 
strong and tough, even harder to move against your will than your strength suggests, heal 
injuries quickly, and can leap insane distances using your massive strength. 
At Street Tier you are strong enough to crush brick into fine powder and can ignore even 
large caliber armor-piercing gunfire. You heal from cuts and scratches at a visible rate and even 
severe injuries take no more than a day. You can safely and accurately jump from street level to 
the top of a 5-story building and are more than twice as hard to trip or knockback as you should 
be. You also possess an extremely high pain threshold. You also have incredible endurance 
and are resistant to poison and disease. 
At National Tier you can tear high strength steel like taffy and even an artillery barrage is 
not enough to harm you. Your regenerative ability is enough to heal crippling injuries in less 
than an hour, you can leap to a 15-story building’s roof with ease, are nearly impossible to trip 
or knockback and are immune to pain. Your stamina is limitless, and you are immune to disease and poison. 
At Global Tier you could toss a skyscraper, laugh at megaton explosions, regenerate 
limbs in minutes, leap 20+ miles in one go, and are impossible to move by anything not 
massively stronger than yourself. You can survive without food or water and are unaffected by 
almost all environmental conditions. 
At Cosmic Tier you could sink a continent with a few full-strength blows or shatter a 
small planetoid and are as durable as you are strong. Your regeneration is near-instant, and you 
could recover from a single drop of blood if need be. You could conceivably leap from one coast 
of North America to the other and are impossible to move against your will while touching the ground."
600CP,Angstrom Levy,Invincible,"You were born with the powers to open portals to 
step between realities. You can open portals to travel within the local multiverse 
of every setting you enter and can simply move from one to the other. The only 
problem with this would have been that 
while every setting has this local infinite 
multiverse and you’re are able to open 
portals to travel through it, you do not 
know where you are in the multiverse or 
where you are precisely within each 
universe. However thanks to the grace of 
jumpchain you now possess the equivalent 
to knowledge to what Angstrom Levy 
would attain through gathering up all of his copies, that of knowing innately where 
you are in both universe and multiverse as well as the general features of the 
universe in question. Thanks to this the portals that you open to parallel realities 
no longer have to be in the exact same physical location as where you are 
standing. This knowledge updates in future worlds.  You are also able to open 
portals to other parallel dimensions should they exist naturally in the setting, such 
as the Never Never in Dresden files, Heaven and Hell in DC, or parallel realities 
in Marvel for example. You are limited to the local multiverse until post-spark, 
upon which you can go anywhere.  "
600CP,Half-Blood Viltrumite,Invincible,"You are a Human-Viltrumite Hybrid. As 
humanity is very close in nature to the Viltrumites and that Viltrumite DNA 
overwrites lesser species, you can grow to be just as strong as any other 

Viltrumite out there. You will have super strength, super speed, super durability, 
and the power of flight. While you do not have super 
senses ‘per se’, your sight is comparable to a hawk, and 
somehow manages to operate perfectly no matter how fast 
you move (even if that is beyond the speed of light). 

Viltrumites have hyper-evolved and efficient bodily 
functions such that, holding a single breath of air is enough 
to last you for two weeks of vigorous physical activity, and 
you are immune to any and all diseases and ailments bar 
those that have been enhanced by something comparable 
to super or hyper science and tailor made to affect 
Viltrumites. Something like this would take the best 
scientists of an advanced alien civilization years if not decades to achieve.  

Viltrumites grow through stress and conflict, so you are able to train your physical 
abilities or improve through being damaged and healing from it at a comparable 
rate to if you had trained vigorously during that time. Viltrumites can heal from 
almost any trauma imaginable, able to get their guts ripped out or being ripped in 
half, with all it takes to put everything back together is for your bits to be in 
approximately the right place to heal perfectly, given the time. Due to this healing 
factor Viltrumites live for millennia, with their aging being comparable to human 
until they reach physical maturity at which point it slows dramatically. The only 
issue with this healing factor is that if the heart has about 50% of it destroyed the 
healing factor does not work, and while it can heal brain trauma (including 
memories), it caps out at about ⅓ of the brain destroyed. Also, as good as this 
healing factor is, it won’t replace lost limbs.  Either reattach them or get a prosthetic. 

With age Viltrumites remain semi-comparable to humans as their hair changes 
slowly to white, though they never get wrinkles, and are able to grow glorious 
facial hair. Although culturally Viltrumites limit themselves to a beautiful 
mustache.  Finally Viltrumites have a single inherent weakness, the complexity of 
the ear canals that evolved to allow them to balance while flying in space, this 
complexity means that the right type of sonic pulse could cause immense pain to 
a Viltrumite and potentially even death given a long enough exposure.  

No two Viltrumites are created equal. Their powers come from their extremely 
potent and dense tissue, and can be improved through their lineage or simply 
training. When you buy this perk you start off at the level of a young Viltrumite, 
able to hold your breath for hours at a time, and move or fly at hypersonic 
speeds. You are strong and durable enough to give and receive attacks powerful 
enough to shatter skyscrapers and break mountains. Given around a decade of 
natural growth (or less provided you train) you grow to the level of a veteran 
Viltrumite. Meaning you, with the help of a couple others of similar strength, could 
shatter somewhat weakened planets and receive similar attacks all while being 
able to move at well beyond the speed of light, although they tend to limit 
themselves to hypersonic speeds while in an atmosphere. They are capable of 
flying between habitable planets within a couple of weeks at their top speed, with 
the stamina to remain awake and aware through the flight. 

Given enough time and training you may even eventually be able to make it to 
the level of a Regent Viltrumite, though something like this would take about a 
couple decades (or equivalent) of dedicated hard work, and many life or death 
battles. Being healed to be better than before by someone with powers like Atom 
Eve may shorten this time further. A Regent Viltrumite is so strong and durable 
that a veteran Viltrumite could literally cause their own arms to explode into a 
bloody pulp from striking a Regent and have the Regent be completely 
unaffected. A Regent is so quick they could move without a veteran Viltrumite 
even seeing them, and so strong they could literally cut a veteran Viltrumite in 
half with a casual swing of their arms, like a hot knife through butter. Regent level 
Viltrumites are powerful enough that they could fight inside a sun, albeit while 
taking massive amounts of damage to the point of death or near-death if they 
stay there for about a half an hour or more. 

As a half-blood Viltrumite, you get an added degree of control over your 
backstory, you may choose to be Nolan Grayson’s (Omni-Man) child and Mark 
Grayson’s (Invincible) sibling. Or you may simply be the product of a government 
experiment using the blood Nolan left at the scene of a fight, or something else 
that fits thematically."
600CP,Jumper,Jumper,"Yeah, let’s get this out of the way ﬁrst. You’re now one of the eponymous teleporters, and a
very, very powerful one. You can move across the planet instantaneously, carrying along
with you anything or anyone you’re in direct contact with. This is as easy as walking to you,
taking no particular effort as long as you don’t try to move more than your limit.
Yeah, there’s one. While theoretically you could move any amount of matter with you, it
takes more effort the more stuff you’re trying to take along. Your own self takes no effort at
all, and with a decent amount of growth it’s just as easy to take upto a bus’s worth of
people/things with you. From there it gets more difﬁcult, though. It’s tremendous effort to
increase thus range, and it would take everything you have after several years of growth to
take along a whole apartment with you.
There’s no real way to judge how the ability grows, if the range increases, or where it stops
growing, or even if it stops at all. So fanwank responsibly for all that."
600CP,Light Manipulation,Kingdom Come,"The sun’s rays are your friends, much like they are to Superman. You are able to store and absorb light
for later use as energy or to rearrange as molecules in any form. (Sunlight gives you the most energy, but
any form of light will do even if it’s not optimal) You can also expel this light from your body, glowing and
manipulating it. Like Green Lantern, you are capable of creating hard light constructs. But this ability takes
a large chunk of your energy. Along with the standard flight and light shooting package, you can bend the
light around you to become wholly invisible and create illusions.
But what’s possibly unique about you is your regeneration. The effect may not be unique, but the way it
happens may be different than normal. For you are capable of entering a form made of pure light and
flying at the speed of light, and you have no need to breathe in this form. You could fly through space for
this reason. But this form is difficult to harm--they will have to harm light if they want to harm you, and
you’re not a hard light construct--and it regenerates you. You could be paralyzed from the waist down but
entering this form completely heals your flesh form. Of course, this form is capable of burning through
your light storage at a great pace--use discretion. Running out of energy will turn you immediately back to
your meat body and that can be inconvenient to put it lightly depending on where you run out.
Notably, scrubbing nuclear radiation from places is an easy if time-consuming task for you depending on
how large the irradiated area is thanks to your manipulation of light rays. Radiation also does not harm
you. A nuclear blast could be thrown in your face, but you would be fine as long as you had a way to
absorb the force itself and not the radiation. You are also considered ‘ageless’, and you no longer die of
old age or suffer any other problems of old age."
600CP,Psychic Powers,Kingdom Come,"You are a clone of Adam Blake, meant to become a super weapon by a weapons making company.
Adam caught wind of the plot and stopped it from yielding any meaningful fruit, but not before he found a
baby in the lab being exposed to simulated light from a comet. You, the only successful clone who lived
from this project. You displayed similar powers to him, but not at full strength given how you were only a
child. Having no ill will against such a child who didn’t choose to exist this way, he placed you in the care
of a friend to make sure you were raised correctly. If you being raised right or not and if you share his
morals remains to be seen--you are just as strong as Adam Blake, regardless.
Like Captain Comet, your brain is a psychic powerhouse. You can teleport over the distance of a planet’s
worth and see up to 100,000 years in the (Most likely) future if you concentrate hard. Able to emulate
super strength in lifting and manipulating things with your mind and empower your strength, mind control
people who fail to resist your power (Or just using telepathy and mind reading if you don’t like that), and
altering the molecular structure of matter. For example, creating and destroying clothing with no need to
touch it.
Your telekinetic power also allows you to lift yourself from the ground, flying at speeds high enough to
break from the grip of any gravitational force keeping you from breaking out of the atmosphere at a speed
to get you to other planets in only an hour in a system.
With this telekinetic power, you can create force fields around yourself that help you breathe in space.
You can also create forms of energy, like lightning bolts or fire or plain blasts of psionic energy. Your
clairvoyance applies to being able to glance in the future to see anyone’s powers when they use them.
Plus your vibrosense lets you sense someone’s emotional state and what they’re feeling.
Your brain also has genius level intellect and eidetic memory. Your super strength could threaten
Superman himself even if it’s not to the levels he has."
600CP,Destiny,Marvel Age of Krakoa,"You can see the future. Or, well, possible futures. You don’t really
control it, you just see the most probable potential future at all times in the back of your
head. It’s a little confusing at first but you catch on quickly. Over time your power will
grow to show you more and more possible futures and the likelihood of each occurring,
though these aren't prophecies, merely possibilities: Free will and random chance both
exist, meaning that your predictions can be wrong, and even if you reach the point
where you see all possible futures you won’t know with 100% certainty which will come
to pass until it happens. Not even your own actions are certain until you make your
choice at the moment. And, of course, it is entirely within your power to change the
futures you see, and even just seeing the most probable future is a major advantage.
Unlike Irene Adler, this does not innately cost you your mundane vision."
600CP,Hyperion,Marvel Age of Krakoa,"An Eternal from another planet, in another Universe… Or rather,
one of several. And recently, a duplicate was made by Mephisto for his own schemes.
Hyperion is… Okay, not gonna be coy, he’s one of Marvel’s knock-offs of Superman. Able
to fly at hypersonic speeds, strong enough to throw down with Thor, with vision so
sharp he can see individual strands of DNA from miles off. Like the Eternals of Earth, he
generates his own energy. Unlike them, he generates cosmic radiation which he can fire
from his eyes in blasts that cap out at city-busting… though radiation-negating effects
are to him as red sunlight and green kryptonite are to his inspiration. For 600 CP you
can have all of that, warts and all."
600CP,Genius,Marvel's Kid Heroes,"The crazy science and technology of the Marvel
Universe actually makes perfect sense to you. You can hold your
own in a technical discussion between Tony Stark and Reed
Richards, and with time and materials, do unspeakable things to
the laws of physics as understood on Earth 1218."
600CP,Hulk,Marvel's Kid Heroes,"You’re big and green, or at least you can be, transforming back and forth at
will between your normal state and a larger one with
phenomenal strength, toughness, healing and leaping ability.
Don’t worry, exactly none of the three teen Hulks have lost
their minds when transforming. Still, you do get exponentially
stronger the angrier you get."
600CP,Leech,Marvel's Kid Heroes,"You negate other people’s powers nearby, making you a terrible annoyance to your
teammates, and an absolute terror to your enemies. If you wish,
you can disable this effect."
600CP,Magnetic,Marvel's Kid Heroes,"You can control magnetic ﬁelds and ferrous metals, even ﬂy by by manipulating
your own relationship with Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld. Basically
everything you’ve seen Magneto or his clone Joseph do, with a
couple common sense exemptions like ﬂipping the poles or FTL
summoning a metal casket from space."
600CP,Nova Prime,Marvel's Kid Heroes,"A dying alien gifted you their power. Now, you are absurdly tough and strong, with a
healing factor in case anything actually manages to hurt you.
You can ﬁre energy blasts with great power and accuracy, ﬂy
and even create spacegates for casual interstellar travel.
Within you also rests the Xanthian Worldmind, a vast database of
all Xandar’s history, culture and technology that will advise
you and answer any questions you might have."
600CP,Singularity,Marvel's Kid Heroes,"You have gravity manipulation powers! Yes, yes, this came up earlier with Power
Pack, but you have gravity powers on a par with Graviton, who
regularly throws down with the Avengers."
600CP,Demolecularized,Spider-Man Trilogy,"You’d think that a highly dangerous experiment would have better protection than this, or at least a camera pointing at the site to check if it really is 
just a bird weighing the sand down. Or plant matter. Or something else. It does not neces-
sarily have to be sand, but whatever the material you can now shift your body into a state 
comprised entirely of a mundane and fairly common substance, in which you can 
shapeshift quite freely, and heal by absorbing your material. Should your material be light 
enough you can even fly around as a cloud of it. You can take your material into yourself 
and with a large enough supply of it assume a multi-story form with a commensurate in-
crease in strength. Through means unknown the clothes you are wearing and things you 
are holding can also be shifted, though only while you are holding or wearing them. As a 
warning, remember that your material, taking only this perk into account, is no more dura-
ble than it normally is - watch out for water as a Sandman, or fire as a Treeman for exam-
ple. This weakness is only in effect while you are ‘shifted’ into your material, although you 
can appear to be normal while shifted, and shifting back is instant so long as your body is 
coherent at the time. "
600CP,Spider Bite,Spider-Man Trilogy,"You’ve been bitten by a genetically enhanced spider, and, rather than 
dying a horrible death, have gained superhuman traits because of it. Your physical stats are 
boosted dramatically, letting you toss, and catch, cars, bounce around like a jumping spider, 
and take a hell of a lot more of a beating than any normal person could survive. This in-
cludes a low level healing factor, and the automatic correction of minor physical defects 
such as eyesight. You also possess extremely enhanced senses tied into your incredible re-
flexes that, so long as you physically can avoid danger, will almost always assure you will. 
The final changes of note are the growth of small patches of scar-like tissue on your wrists 
that generate large quantities of spider webs and can propel them at great speeds and into 
a variety of shapes, and retractable microscopic hooks you can use to stick to surfaces - 
somehow this even works through thin materials, though it’ll need to be essentially skin-
tight to work."
600CP,Once Bitten,Spiderman PS4,"A teeny tiny spider was all it took to change your life forever. One of OsCorp’s strange experiments
escaped and gave you a little jab, altering your body radically so that you would gain all the strange
powers of a spider in human form. Just like Spider-man, you now have a body that goes far beyond
the human limit, with superhuman physical abilities the likes of which few can imagine. You’ve got
enough strength to pull 40 tonne trucks or, with the right leverage, stop a speeding train in it’s tracks
over a minute or two. Fast enough to catch up to most cars just on foot and agile enough to fling
yourselves between buildings without need for webbing, you can even crawl on walls like an actual spider!
You’re incredibly tough, even being hit by a wrecking ball at speed just knocks you out for a few
seconds at worst, and you heal in amazing ways too. Broken bones and nasty stab wounds take just
hours to be good as new and you can be sure that any medical conditions you had from before will
disappear real quick, this also just happening to improve your senses to superhuman degrees too.
Lastly, you’ve also gained a Danger Sense that alerts you to incoming danger to you and the severity
of the danger, manifesting as a tingling in your spine. Combine this with your incredible reflexes and
you could even dodge bullets."
600CP,Destiny,X-Men Evolution,"You can see into the future! Obligatory reference out the way you have the 
power of seeing events weeks, months, and even years before they happen. These visions 
aren't perfect however as they don't get every detail down but are an extremely accurate 
guideline for things to come. These visions can be strengthened by reducing the time that you 
see into the future. The dial can be set forth from seeing months or years into the future to 
merely seconds. A few days is the average point where you will perfectly experience things as 
they will always happen if you don't do anything."
600CP,Hex,X-Men Evolution,"The power to manipulate and harness the power of probability like a witch. You can 
interfere with other mutants' powers, causing them to go haywire, temporarily remove them, 
rendering the mutants powerless or cause attacks to rebound back at the attacker. Hex bolts are 
auras of red-colored energy that can be used to trap opponents and disrupt energy fields. 
  
This power doesn’t stop there however as you generally cause bad luck for people, making 
them trip or drop things when under the influence of your powers. These powers also affect 
inanimate objects by making them come ‘alive’ in a way. For example street lamps will morph to 
ensnare opponents and cars will relentlessly chase down enemies. You may cause things to 
break, combust, explode, heat up, move (sometimes to accomplish a specific goal in a manner 
similar to telekinesis)"
600CP,Power Absorption,X-Men Evolution,"The mac daddy of the superpowers. Why have one superpower 
when you can have them all? Temporarily of course though. Like a certain Rogue, you too can 
gain the memories, skills, and powers of beings that you touch by absorbing their life force and 
weakening them, possibly into a coma if you aren't careful. Those that are stronger than you can 
resist this up to an extent although if they severely dwarf you in power then there is no absorption. 
You are able to select specific skills like dancing with a light touch but full on skin to skin contact 
will result in you getting the whole deal. Longer touching leads to longer usage of powers up to a 
24 hour period. If you’ve gone beyond and absorbed a person’s life force to the point of their 
death then that power is permanently yours for the taking and it can even be improved beyond 
what the original owner was capable of."
600CP,Super Speed,X-Men Evolution,"When others get moving you wonder why they all seem to frozen. In the 
beginning you’re able to move at speeds of Mach 10 with the reaction speed to match. Things 
such as creating mini tornadoes by spinning your entire body are able to be done. With some 
training or time you’ll move so fast that you could empty an entire exploding mansion with the 
furniture, people, and underground secret equipment while goofing off as well."
600CP,Adaptive Evolution,X-Men Movies,"Your body can rapidly adapt to nearly any situation to keep you safe. Someone 
trying to drown you? Grow gills. Thrown in lava? Look who has heatproof skin. Dropped out of the sky 
from 10,000 feet? Maybe your weight will drop and you'll just float to the ground. However, this isn't a 
perfect defense - it can be overcome by enough damage. And you also have no control over the 
adaptions; they just pop up when you need them and fade away when you're safe."
600CP,Elemental Power,X-Men Movies,"Choose Fire, Ice, or Eectricity. You can now generate and manipulate the one 
you chose. You'll start out being able to throw around house-sized fireballs, freeze a small pond, or 
generate bolts of lightning powerful enough to instantly char a man to ash, and you'll only improve from 
there. Eventually you'll be able to transform into your element, becoming a mobile ice sculpture, a 
human torch knockoff, or a living lightningbolt. "
600CP,Self-Molecular Manipulation,X-Men Movies,"You have complete control over your own molecular structure. This 
grants a very large degree of shapeshifting and the ability to regenerate from practically anything as 
long as your brain survives. The shapeshifting is extensive enough to allow you to grow and shrink, 
transform your limbs into weapons, grow new ones, stretch your body extreme lengths, and 
hyperdensify your body to become nigh-impervious to harm. Really, the sky is the limit on what you can 
do. "
600CP,Spatial Warping,X-Men Movies,"You can bend space. Stretch a room into a city block, move a mile in a single step, 
or shrink someone down to the size of an ant. You need to consciously keep the effects going, but they 
don't require much concentration to maintain. You can't warp the inside of a living being. You could 
shrink someone, but you couldn't make their heart explode from their chest. "
600CP,Super Speed,X-Men Movies,"Gotta go fast. You can move at Mach 4 and have proportionate reflexes. Your 
durability isn't increased, but you always keep proportionate durability to what it would be in normal 
speed; punching a wall at Mach 4 may break your hand the same as it would if a normal person did it, 
but it wouldn't turn your hand to paste, meanwhile the wall would explode. 
But that’s not all. See, how fun would it be if you had to always perceive the world hundreds of times 
slower than everyone else? You’d go insane right quick. So instead, you can not only alter your own 
perception of time from that of a normal human up to you max speed, but you can also extend your 
powers to other objects to some degree or another. You can have your iPod playing music fast enough 
to let you listen to it normally even as your perceive bullets slowing to a crawl and outrun sound itself. 
When applied to people, this doesn’t allow them to perceive time as you do, but it does allow you to 


interact with them without causing them to explode into fine red mist. "
600CP,Weather Manipulation,X-Men Movies,"You can manipulate weather over a dozen square miles. Summoning 
localized blizzards, thunderstorms, and small tornadoes is easy for you. You can also direct lightning to 
strike a certain area and and simulate limited flight by carrying yourself on wind currents. If you focus on 
a certain effect for a while, you can spread it over much larger areas - a couple of days of concerted 
effort could cover a large city in a hurricane or a record-breaking blizzard/heatwave. "
600CP,Flying Brick,X-Men the Claremont Years,"Nuff said. Well to add a bit more detail you’re able to fly, this is faster than a normal person on a combat
scale - if clumsy compared to some options here - growing significantly faster when you
are allowed to accelerate continuously in one direction (such as when flying
cross-country), and have the strength to match Rogue or Captain Britain and the
durability to match. This makes you stronger than Brute Strength or Living Steel and in
raw strength is the strongest of the unupgraded super strength options in this jump. At
your discretion this can, like Captain Britain’s own power, be influenced by ambient
magical energy and your self-confidence. At baseline this would still be equal to the
option above, but could dip significantly lower to almost nothing if there was no magical
power nearby and your self-confidence had tanked, or rise noticeably higher in a place
with high magical energy and you are brimming with self-confidence (think somewhere
from 0 to 1.5 times power, barring extraordinary circumstances such as having a
significant fraction of the entire multiverse’s magical energy pumped through you at
once).
For an additional -400 CP (discounted if this ability was) this power is upgraded. Now
like Carol Danvers after the Brood Experiments upon her you can supercharge your body
with some source of energy (the Brood linked her to a white hole) gaining increased
strength and resilience, enough to punch someone into space, the ability to breathe in
space, and energy blasts (comparable to an Energy Blast). With this power you could
destroy fleets of space ships, or lay waste to alien cities. If you took the Captain Britain
based version of Flying Brick this still allows similar feats, and a similar range of
maximum power variability. If you bought this upgrade you may buy the upgrades to
Energy Blast at a discount.
For yet another additional -400 CP (discounted if this ability was) on top of the previous
upgrade your abilities are further improved. Instead of Binary powers, your powers are
now more closely comparable to Gladiator in his showings in this period outside of the
X-Men titles (he has much better showings outside of X-Men). With this power, you
possess strength that can bring down the Thing in 2 blows, one-shot a weakened Binary,
and even shatter worlds, resilient enough to fly through stars, increased speed and
reflexes (possibly Mach 1), fly in space at least a hundred times the speed of light, ability


to follow interstellar (potentially intergalactic) spaceships through hyperspace,
superhuman senses where you can see vast distances as well as microscopic objects, and
super powered breath capable of tornado force winds; this is in addition to the powers of
the previous levels. You may buy Super Speed at a discount (he doesn’t show speedster
level speed on screen, but a guidebook lists Mach 1 speed for him in this period and he’s
faster than most), and will be faster than with it alone. If you took the Captain Britain
based version of Flying Brick you may choose to have your power reliant purely on your
self-confidence (with no regard to magic), if you do so you may choose to be a Strontian
like Gladiator."
600CP,Mastery of the Inanimate,X-Men the Claremont Years,"Like the mutant Selene Gallio you have a particular - potentially telekinetic - control of inanimate objects. You can
manipulate and move inanimate material from great ranges (at least by the standards of
telekinesis), drawing it in from across a Roman style city, cocooning foes in the earth, or
twisting materials. You’d probably not be able to stand up to Magneto in his control of
magnetic materials, but you make up for it with the breadth of materials you can control.
In addition, while you cannot perform transmutations of matter (so no turning stone into
gold), you can disintegrate inanimate materials, causing them to break apart into nothing
more than dust. And flames are considered inanimate objects for this power’s functions.
If you bought this power at a discount you may also buy Psychic Vampirism at a
discount."
600CP,Possessive,X-Men the Claremont Years,"By taking this power you gain highly limited telepathic and empathic abilities. These powers are nowhere near as, well,
powerful as those from the Telepathy power, but there is one place you truly shine. You
are a relative master at possessing others. You may telepathically project yourself into
another, possessing their body and gaining full access to their senses - but not memories -
putting their consciousness into a state similar to dreamless sleep. It takes time to
acclimate to a host, leaving your movements initially clumsy and awkward. With training
and time you may learn how to: possess multiple individuals at once, though this will
weaken your control of each and requires a great deal of multitasking; maintain the
possession from further distances though seemingly not into other dimensions; and alter
the thought processes and memories of those you possess, forcing them to divulge
information or conditioning their behavior. This power does not affect those of
sufficiently inhuman neurology; Warlock, a techno-organic lifeform, was immune even
when it was bolstered by the Shadow King’s control of Karma.
If bought along with Telepathy (not discounted), your powers improve to more closely
match those of Karma when she was possessed by the Shadow King. Able to possess
others with but a moment’s concentration, control entire teams - and possibly more - with
ease, possess those as strong willed and psychically resistant as Storm (notably more so
than many of the telepaths in the series) with ease though an individual such as Magik
while prove extremely difficult requiring at least your full attention, and possess a more
immediately acclimated control of their bodies. On top of all the normal powers available
through Telepathy."
600CP,Self-Molecular Manipulation,X-Men the Claremont Years,"You possess a shapeshifting power similar to that shown by the mutant Apocalypse. While Apocalypse
is typically seen wearing highly resilient Celestial battle armor, you can still use this
power to grow to gigantic size, shrink, increase your density, and shape your body into
wings, hammers, or other relatively simple objects. You can use this to grant yourself
some limited powers, such as flight, strength and durability (though without Celestial
battle armor you won’t be up there with a Flying Brick), and to mix elements of your
alt-forms together.
This power allows you to buy Energy Blasts and/or Healing Factor at discounts. With
Energy Blasts (or an equivalent ability) you would be capable of performing feats such
as turning your legs into jets to produce thrust through your Energy Blasts. In fact with
the right knowledge gained over millennia and power sources you could duplicate many
other powers with this one."
600CP,Stepping Discs,X-Men the Claremont Years,"You have the power to summon and open teleportation portals. It is easiest to make a portal directly underneath you intended to
transport yourself, but you can also make portals elsewhere either to ‘catch’ attacks or
foes, or to teleport a group of allies. The creation of these portals is fairly quick -
sometimes described as the speed of thought but typically slower than the teleportation
from Bamf! - and their range is theoretically unlimited but they become more difficult to
control the more distant the range; it can be very difficult to aim at the right planet on
interstellar scales so best to work up to it, though it is within your capabilities to learn to
do so. Somehow this remains true even when traveling through an intermediary
dimension which is not mapped 1 to 1 to the local dimension.
If you also purchased a Hell Dimension, these discs can serve as transportation to and
from it, and you can mentally scan it at any time to transport entities or objects from it to
you through these discs. Finally due to the Hell Dimension’s unstable relationship with
time you can use this power to travel through time; though be warned this is difficult, and
may throw you into alternate futures, and if used haphazardly may result in altering your
own past to prevent your current existence."
600CP,Telekinesis,X-Men the Claremont Years,"You possess fairly substantial telekinetic power, able to create protective force fields, hold up small buildings, move vehicles, move
support pillars the size of trees, etc. You are roughly as powerful as Jean Grey was at the
beginning of the X-Factor series, or when she first became Phoenix; vastly more
powerful than she was before being touched by the Phoenix entity, but still weaker than
Rachel Summers as Phoenix, and unable to perform atomic scale telekinesis.
If you bought this power at a discount you may also buy Telepathy at a discount."
600CP,Weather Control,X-Men the Claremont Years,"You possess the power to put on a passable impression of a weather goddess. Like Storm you have the ability to
control the weather around you. This power allows you to fire bolts of lightning, lift
yourself - and with difficulty others - on the wind, and of course call the storm. With
effort you could create a hurricane to blanket a city, or affect weather on a continental
scale - possibly world-wide given how every aspect of the weather system connects to
every other.
With this base purchase you are locked to the weather of Earth or similar planets. For an
additional -200 CP (discounted if this was), like Storm herself you are able to on
occasion draw upon the weather of space. This allows you to influence stellar winds,
cosmic radiation, and if you were in a place such as the galactic core which was
particularly full of life bearing planets and suns temporarily overcharge yourself. Such
power is not without risks, it could be possible to burn out your own body in the process."
600CP,Telepathy,Young Justice,"You are a powerful telepath. You start at the same level as M’gann
from the first season, and have the potential to rival, or even surpass her at her peak,
that is with the right training and enough time. If you consider someone else from the
show to be a greater telepath than Miss Martian, your potential rivals theirs. (Free for
Martian)"
700CP,Kryptonian Biology,Kingdom Come,"Much like Superman, you too escaped the explosion of Krypton, as a Kryptonian. Or maybe you were
some kind of weird science experiment to clone Superman. You are powered by the sun’s rays and weak
to kryptonite (From this realm, and unless you have a way to speed up the way your body reacts to
things, you’ll never gain an immunity to kryptonite through exposure with only the ten years you have
here, but after the jump only kryptonite from this realm will hurt you. See notes for elaboration) as well as
the red sun’s rays, but that’s nothing compared to the power you have. Kryptonite will also be hard to find
for your foes and will be difficult for people to retrieve. They won’t be able to make dragon statues out of
it, for example. You may not be at Superman’s level yet, but you have the potential to be in a few years if
you really start working at it. Hit the gym, and start doing those oats and squats.
What you make up in your standard “fly, heat and x-vision, super strength and invulnerability” package is
your sheer strength. What you lack in versatility, you make up for in raw power. You can use your x-ray
vision to see people down to the bone and see through everything except lead, and your heat vision could
spark entire cities ablaze if you felt like it. Your vision also ranges from microscopic to telescopic, able to
spy on planets in other solar systems, or spy squirming bacteria on the surfaces of anything you see. You
can control the intensity of your powers. You could fly and breathe in space, and your super speed is
faster than the speed of light. You also possess frost breath and can hold in oxygen for long periods of
time. Your hearing is also impeccable, able to single out a single noise among the noises a whole city of
people could make or hear the clouds scrape against each other. Your breathing is also hurricane force.
The strength you possess could eventually pull entire planets. As of now, you at max in terms of physical
strength could demolish entire metropolises in a rampage. Just...don’t actually destroy Metropolis.
Superman wouldn’t be very happy about that.
Your thought process is also super-fast, able to do complex calculations instantly and think up advanced
simulations in your mind of potential situations."
700CP,Shazam's Chosen,Kingdom Come,"The Wizard Shazam was forbidden from interfering in the current troubles by cosmic entities, but it’s not
exactly interfering in these affairs if he makes a new hero and offhandedly asks them to check up on Billy
Batson and perhaps help him out if he’s in trouble, yes? If you do this favor for him or not is up to you. He
can’t exactly take away your powers now if you just disobey him.
You have a powerful form you may call upon by shouting “SHAZAM”, manifesting in a great and powerful
display of nature. Such as whirling sands or a great burst of fire, or the classic lightning bolt. You may still
use this manifestation of nature to heal or harm as you wish, and it is magical in nature. You may also
share this power with others who are worthy, however expect yours to decrease in strength when you
share it until you get your powers back.
Your power is derived from the very gods themselves. With great strength and speed that threatens
Superman, you are a power to be feared. Possessing the Wisdom of Solomon, you have eidetic memory
and a vast intellect. Excelling at war tactics and mathematics among other subjects. You may also
comprehend and speak in any language you encounter, including magical ones as Solomon was a
powerful wizard himself. The Wisdom of Solomon also enables you to gaze upon all possible angles of a
situation and figure out how to turn disadvantages into advantages.
You can fly at fast speeds. You also have a vast well of willpower inside you. You also lack the need for
food, water, or sleep. You possess infinite endurance and stamina. You also resist powerful magic, such
as Zeus’s lightning bolts, but you also possess great magical talent. (You start out with no skill in it,
however. You’ll need to refine your powers.) Only the most potent of magic found here could harm you.
Finally, you have been given access to the Rock of Eternity, an interdimensional prison where you may
lock up any magical being you desire. Created from two rock formations from Heaven and Hell, it may
hold up to great magical beings such as the Three Faces Of Evil. You can also teleport to this place at
any time. This will be dragged with you from place to place, and you must be able to defeat them before
you can lock them up with you."
700CP,Forgemaster,X-Men the Claremont Years,"Like the mutant Forge you have been blessed with the power to invent ‘anything you can think of’. This power has more limits
than that, Forge often reminds us that Tony Stark was a better weapons designer than he
was, and there are many other characters in these comics whose inventions he cannot
replicate (without going into ones who were villains from other series such as Doctor
Doom). Still you possess an intuitive skill with technology, granting you a mastery of
reverse engineering and invention, able to create such inventions as a gun that neutralizes
a mutant’s powers permanently, a battle simulator capable of projecting hard light
holograms, or a version of Cerebro capable of being used without telepathic powers.
Importantly this power seems to soften physics for your inventions, helping you invent
what should be somewhat impossible.
If you bought this power at a discount you may buy Technological Transformation at a
discount as well."
700CP,Kinetic Energy Absorption,X-Men the Claremont Years,"You are able to absorb kinetic energy, the force of impact against you, and store it in your body. While this won’t
prevent you from being knocked flying or thrown, you are effectively immune to damage
from physical force and some forms of energy beams - such as Cyclops’s optic blasts - at
minimum to the equivalent of falling as a crater forming meteoric impact. In fact, instead
of hurting you, these blows and impacts charge your power granting you superhuman
strength, the ability to move with surprising speed, or use the stored power to replace
need for sleep or increase your endurance. This power will bleed off with time, seemingly
faster the more that is stored, but provides you with impressive durability and strength.
The protection is lessened against cutting/stabbing weapons, as the edge may still
penetrate you, but the force driving them forward will soon be absorbed and negated
making such blows typically superficial at most."
1600,Gamma Powered,Marvel Age of Krakoa,"Depending on your perspective, you’re either very lucky or very unlucky. You’re a hulk, a living engine of destruction and
a living, self-sustaining reactor generating gamma radiation in the form of an
Emanation, a mysterious third form of light that sits at the exact intersection of science
and sorcery. Or at least, you have the power to become such a being. For 800 Points,
when you transform your base level is on par with the “calm” state of the Hulk. That is to
say, you can leap for miles, shrug off small-scale WMDs or superweapons, possess
regeneration on par with the 400 CP version of the Healing Factor power, and casually
lift hundreds of tons. In this state, you do not need food, water, or air and can…
somehow speak audibly and be heard in a vacuum. You also, for lack of a better phrase,
“think in math,” that is to say you possess the skills of perception to make accurate
guesses at the properties and dimensions of various structures and could, for example,
figure out exactly how hard you need to punch a tank, from what angle, to break the
tank without hurting the people inside in the time it takes you to see the tank and throw
your punch… Though whether or not you can do those exact same calculations on paper
is a different story. And that’s just when you’re calm. The angrier you get, the stronger
you get, with the only practical limit being how angry you can get and remain functional.
For 1200 CP, however, your baseline power is closer to that possessed by Bruce Banner’s
“Green Scar” personality or Jen Walters after being empowered by a dying Celestial. In
this state, when at your angriest, you could shatter entire planets. Please be careful. You
can also emit bursts of gamma radiation to augment your physical blows or generate a
blast comparable to a tactical nuclear weapon centered on yourself. This is just energy,
not radioactive material, so it disperses quickly.
Regardless of which version you purchase, you can upgrade it. For 200 CP your gamma
rays were augmented by primal kirbons, the tertiary form of cosmic rays, making you a
Red Hulk. You can absorb just about any form of energy and store it within your body,
consuming it to augment your already impressive strength or to release it all in one go in
whatever form it was originally. Different forms of energy have their own “flavor” with
more potent or exotic forms “tasting” better. Additionally, as you get angry a contained
aura of heat and radiation will form around you growing more intense with your anger,
burning or irradiating anything that makes contact with you. Or, for a separate 200 CP,
you can gain abilities that Bruce Banner developed later in life after his powers had
evolved considerably: The Devil Hulk’s ability to control his limbs and organs, even
making them move in ways they should not, when they are severed from him and
reconstitute himself afterward, and the Starship Hulk’s ability to fire focused beams of
gamma radiation from his eyes. And of course, you’re allowed to buy both.
Regardless of which version you possess or what upgrades you buy, you’ll slowly but
steadily grow stronger over time by absorbing ambient radiation and can speed this
process up by being exposed to larger doses or grabbing a radioactive or
radiation-charged object, or being, and draining it directly. Gamma rays by default, but
Red Hulks can also absorb cosmic rays."
800CP,New Genesis,Avengers Vs X-Men,"A dark heritage, especially for mutants. You were made from the blood of the original mutant,
Apocalypse, and share his genetic template. Your primary power is a nearly unlimited ability to
shapeshift, controlling your molecular structure to a massive extent. Even now, you can grow to ten
times your normal size with ease, turn yourself into a machine of war covered in weapons, heal from
almost any injury and near instantly adapt to most situations and environments. As times passes,
you will grow naturally to reach the power of your father, eventually finding it relatively easy to shift
your biology and grant yourself new mutant powers, especially combined with proper knowledge.
The process will take several decades if left to proceed naturally."
800CP,Rogue,Avengers Vs X-Men,"Whats theirs is yours now, as long as you can touch them. You’re a thief of all things that belong to
the bodies and minds of other people, like the X Men’s Rogue. On skin to skin contact, you are able
to transfer powers, memories, skills, energy, physical abilities and more from them to you, retaining
them for sixty times as long as you were in skin to skin contact with them. You are in control of when
this occurs and can choose whether it is painless or delivers a shock that puts anyone short of the
Juggernaut out cold, potentially a long term coma for ordinary people. You can only absorb from
organic targets but there is no limit on how many targets you can absorb from at once. Particularly
strong willed targets can influence or even take over your personality. In certain situations, you may
be able to steal powers permanently, usually due to the unique biology of someone you are
absorbing from or in the case of absorbing the last of someone’s life force, resulting in their death."
800CP,Kinetics,City of Heroes,"You can control kinetic force, reduce inertia and siphon force out of opponents or attacks. With focus, you 
can meditate and create a sixty square foot area around you in which the kinetic force and speed of all 
enemies are reduced and all allies are increased. Your transferance rates begin at 25%, reducing force 
from one object and increasing it another by that percentage and at the height of your training it goes to a 
75% transferance rate."
800CP,Luminous,City of Heroes,"You gain a myriad of positive energy abilities. For one, you become more durable against all forms of 
damage, especially positive energy. You also possess the natural ability of flight which can be shared with 
your friends by imbuing a small amount of energy into them, the ability to heal yourself and others with a 
moment's focus, explosive wisps, focus positive energy into your fists or throw them as blasts, the ability 
to fly through solid objects and beings. You also gain the ability to ressurect a person who has been dead 
less than an hour, once per day. You now gain the Nova, Dwarf and Light Transformations 
Nova- You become a strange flying squid alien. In this form you are nimble and swift while also deadly, 
able to run and gun your positive blasts. You become less durable but this isn't a problem so long as you stay out of reach. 
Dwarf- You become a cross between a lobster, a human and a rhino. Much more durable and strong 
however slow and with limited energy projection. 
Light- This form is extremely taxing in terms of energy and tends to leave you drained after but a minute 
of use. Your energy projection abilities increase to an astounding degree and you're able to travel at near 
the speed of light. Unfortunately, once deactivated either manually or naturally it will leave you entirely 
drained for thirty minutes, only strong enough to attempt retreat."
800CP,Time Manipulation,City of Heroes,"Localized Time Control, an extremely powerful ability. You can slow or stop your enemies, speed up your 
comrades or project attacks from the future into the past or vice versa. This powerset is more draining 
than most but the abilities here are astounding. You'll never fully travel through time, but you can bend it 
to your whims in pockets of space, the greater the change and the greater the space, the more energy is needed."
800CP,Umbral,City of Heroes,"You gain a myriad of negative energy abilities. For one, you become more durable against all forms of 
damage, especially negative energy. You also possess a horrible negative energy aura that damages 
close-by foes over time, a shadow cloak that conceals your presence, an energy and life draining touch, 
the ability to phase through objects and people, a variety of dark energy blasts and attacks. You also feel it 
is easier to slip through space, telporting to any area within sight or teleporting allies and enemies across 
cities. If that's not enough, should you fall in battle and if someone substantially weaker than you is near 
by, you can automatically drain their essence in order to raise yourself. You also gain the Nova and Dwarf  transformations. 
Nova- You become a strange flying squid alien. In this form you are nimble and swift while also deadly, 
able to run and gun your dark energy blasts. You become less durable but this isn't a problem so long as you stay out of reach. 
Dwarf- You become a cross between a lobster, a human and a rhino. Much more durable and strong however slow and with limited energy projection."
800CP,Summoning,Generic Super Academy,"You have the ability to summon one or more minions. This may be a literal summoning 
of a supernatural force, it could be a metahuman ability to turn your shadow into a swarm of 
mini-xenomorphs, it could be a robotic bodyguard with a fast-response teleport system, or even 
a horde of loyal ninjas that are somehow always hiding somewhere nearby. These minions will 
obey your every command, even to the point of death.  
This power is for short-term summons, typically helping you with a battle or a single 
longer term project possibly lasting up to a day or so, such as searching a wide area or 
constructing something. Long-term minions are Companions and aren’t covered by this power. 
This power leaves a lot up to the Jumper’s discretion, so please fanwank responsibly. The 
summons you can call up/create never have a summoning ability of their own, and never have 
multiple powers per individual. 
At Street Tier you can summon up to a dozen minions that are on the low end of Street 
Tier in ability, or a smaller number of minions that are proportionately more powerful. 
At National Tier you can summon up to a dozen minions that are just barely National Tier 
in ability, or a smaller number of minions that are proportionately more powerful. Alternately, you 
can summon up to 100 Street Tier minions. 
At Global Tier you can summon up to a dozen minions that are just barely Global Tier in 
ability, or a smaller number of minions that are proportionately more powerful. Alternately, you 
can summon up to 100 National Tier minions, or up to 1000 Street Tier. 
At Cosmic Tier you can summon up to a dozen minions that are just barely Cosmic Tier 
in ability, or a smaller number of minions that are proportionately more powerful. Alternately, you 
can summon up to 100 Global Tier minions, 1000 National Tier, or 10000 Street Tier."
800CP,Tinker Plus,Generic Worm Fanfiction,"You’re not just a Tinker anymore, you’re the Tinker. The PRT rating scale isn’t really set
up to handle someone like you because it assumes that Tinkers will have specialties, and
you don’t. You are something never seen before; a genuine omni-Tinker, and one of truly
amazing capacity.
Your aptitude and intuition for all sorts of research, science, engineering, and design is
absolutely unbelievable. If a project is even halfway related to any of the “hard sciences”
then you can get it done, and do so with a speed and efficiency that makes even
experienced Tinkers working within their own specialities look like clumsy beginners.
And you can rapidly reverse-engineer other technology given sufficient opportunity to
study it, however complex or esoteric it might be. You can even study and analyze exotic
and anomalous phenomena, such as cape powers in action, to hopefully gain inspiration
for new Tinkertech.
You have a volume knob in your head for making your designs either easily reproducible
by mundane methods or totally blackboxed vs. any reverse-engineering or anything in
between. You can perform what would have required “clean room” levels of precision


assembly for mundane engineers with ordinary tools and under rough conditions.
Troubleshooting or repairing tech that you already understand is a job you could
practically do in your sleep, and anything you build or overhaul is maintenance-optional.
With time and practice your Tinker abilities can improve and grow indefinitely, without
any upper limit.
You can’t do things like ‘perfected social sciences’ or ‘auto-win personal interaction
methodologies’, though. That sort of thing is for Thinkers, not Tinkers."
800CP,Energy Absorption,X-Men Movies,"You can absorb most forms of energy, including kinetic energy, making most 
attacks innefective against you. This energy can be used to augment your own body, granting 
superhuman physical abilities, or release it into shockwaves and explosions. As long as you have 
sufficient stores of energy, you do not need to eat or sleep, and your aging is dramatically slowed. 
However, this does have a theoretical upper limit, is weak to energy outside of normal physical context, 
such as magic or psychic abilities, and doesn't help you against attacks with low kinetic energy - 
something that would cut you or simply harm you by applying extreme amounts of pressure would 
affect you as normal. The amount of energy you can absorb and store will increase over time, with 
potentially amazing heights, but don't expect to be tanking nukes any time soon. "
800CP,Gravity Manipulation,X-Men Movies,"You have extensive control over gravity. You can reverse or intensify it over 
an area or things, create small gravity bubbles to simulate clumsy telekinesis, fly, and focus it into a 
small ball to create a local gravitational pull that causes everything in the area to orbit around it. "
800CP,Magnetism Manipulation,X-Men Movies,"Guess. You have incredible control over magnetic fields, allowing you to 
control ferrous metals a slew of other things. You'll start out able to throw a car, and grow until 
eventually you're able to lift and move the Golden Gate Bridge - though that'll take a lifetime. Maybe 
with enough practive you'll also be able to manipulate it in more esoteric ways; you'll never be able to 
pull off the frankly ridiculous stuff like making a wormhole, but things like city-wide EMPs and 
channeling magnetism through your brain to augment your reaction times is possible. Your own body 
also counts as magnetic for the purposes of your power, allowing you to cling to other metals and 
potentially fly. "
800CP,Power Amplification,X-Men Movies,"This power, rather than amplifying your own abilities, instead allows you 
to empower others. You start out only able to amplify one person at a time, but that number will slowly 
increase with training. Once you empower someone, a link is created between you and them, and both 
the link and the empowerment remain until you remove the amplification effect. Removing the effect 
requires a few seconds' concentration. 

Effectively, anyone you use this on will have their power doubled, with some variance. 

Oh, and attempting to steal or absorb the buffed powers will result in the amplification being removed. "
800CP,Telekinesis,X-Men Movies,"Look Mom, no hands! You have the power to manipulate psionic energy to move 
things. You'll start out able to clumsily throw around a couple of people, but it'll grow in strength and 
precision until you're able to throw around dozens of cars, disentigrate people with a glance, and create 
psionic shields that can stand up to explosives and sustained gunfire within a few years. At the peak of 
your power, after a lifetime of training, you'll be able to suspend an entire neighborhood in the air, fly at 
supersonic speed, and channel your telekinesis through yourself to simulate superhuman strength and 
speed. "
800CP,Telepathy,X-Men Movies,"Mind reading, mind control, and everything vaguely related. You start out able to read 
the mind of a single person, passively scan the emotions of a crowd, have a telepathic conversation with 
a few people, with effort, completely control a single person and your range is a few miles. You'll grow 
over time until you're able to control dozens of people at once, flip through a mind like an open book in 
moments, and create an astral projection. Your range will also grow to hundreds of miles. Essentially, 
anything Xavier does in the movies is fair game. "
800CP,Vibration Manipulation,X-Men Movies,"All matter and energy is constantly in motion, creating tiny vibrations. You 
can now tap into, control, and amplify these vibrations. You'll start out able to release showaves or 
shatter things on touch, but at the peak of your ability, you'll be able to do things like cause earth 
quakes and tidal waves or gain extremely fine control over vibrations. "
800CP,Elemental,X-Men the Claremont Years,"You have the power to draw on the energy of
the Earth and nature. At sustainable levels this can allow you to fly and possess super
strength and durability roughly equivalent to that granted by Brute Strength, but can be
substantially increased by drawing deeper. While in your natural form (or an alt-form, but
not other shapeshifting powers), this power also allows you to manipulate elements and
magical energy in your vicinity to a limited extent, not able to match a dedicated
specialist in the field, but making up for it with versatility. This power also grants you
minor empathic abilities, enough to sense the general feelings and emotions of others
(including animals and plants), and provide a nudge towards others by sharing your own
emotions; though this is a far cry from the level of an Empath much less a true Telepath.
If combined with Metamorph (or Self-Molecular Manipulation) you can draw on this
power to copy the abilities of those creatures whose forms you take. As long as you have
the power available, and either a good enough understanding of them, or a living sample
to draw on empathically, you could copy most any other power available, even such
phenomenal powers as the Power Cosmic.
This power does have limitations though. The power comes from the energy of the Earth,
nature, and ambient magic around you, and drawing too heavily on it will damage the
environment and eventually you will run out of local energy and find your power
deserting you. Copying Galactus would drain the world dry well before meaningfully
combatting him.
If you bought this at a discount you can also buy Metamorph at a discount."
800CP,Metamorph,X-Men the Claremont Years,"You have near total control of your own appearance, able to shift your size and form to take on the appearance of nearly
anyone, or any living creature, even potential creatures (dragons), or modifications to
forms based on reactions to environmental factors or those around you. You are even
capable of taking the forms of animate water or sand, and the exact limits of such
transformational ability is untested. This shapeshifting ability also gives you limited
resistance to reality warping effects allowing you to fight off their influence on you
personally. You may use this power to combine and merge alt-forms you possess freely."
800CP,Telepathy,X-Men the Claremont Years,"You are a potent mutant telepath. By default you’re roughly equivalent to Psylocke (without Mojo boosting her)
in this era. You can rise to the equal of Xavier or whichever telepath (other than Phoenix)
you consider personally strongest from this period with time and training."
