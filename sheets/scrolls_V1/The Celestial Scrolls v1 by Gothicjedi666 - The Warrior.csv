0 CP,Basic Set ,TES: Warriors,"It wouldn’t be fair to send you out into such a dangerous world like Tamriel with no way to protect yourself. As such, you are now in possession of a brand new set of iron armor as well as a steel weapon of your choice. You will also receive a knapsack to carry any other valuables you may find in your travels."
0 CP,Frostbane Bear,TES: The First Council,"The Bear was one of the ancient Atmoran animal tokens, associated later with the Nord god Tsun, so the Frostbane Bear has historically been one of the most prestigious mounts a tradition-loving Nord could ride."
0 CP,Mixed Unit Tactics,TES: Warriors,"Sometimes, reading does help you win in a fight, especially when the book you read covers many different battle strategies for both large and small scale conflicts. This book not only covers them, but it also has a few notes written in the margins on different uses for various formations and such."
0 CP,Training Dummy ,TES: Warriors,"An straw dummy with targets painted onto it that is strangely durable and resistant to all damage, and will repair itself when no one is looking. Any weapons and combat training you do with this will be much more effective. Alternatively, it can look like a certain person of your choice if you’re feeling spiteful."
0 CP,Housecarl ,TES: Dovah,"Having been trained as a warrior from a young age, this Nordic woman has devoted herself to you, swearing to guard you, and all you own, with her life. Stoic and fearless, she will act as both your sword and your shield, taking care of many threats before you're even aware of them."
100 CP,Armored Combatant,TES: Warriors,"One does not often expect to rush into battle wearing nothing but their bare skin, with armor being so widespread across all cultures. You believe heavily in the utilization of armor, be it simple chainmail or a full set of ebony plate. For you, armor is much easier to wear and put on, and doesn’t weigh you down, allowing you to swim as if unencumbered even while fully armored."
100 CP,Barbarian ,TES: Warriors,"When you go about wielding a battleaxe or a warhammer, you’ve probably got one thing on your mind. Dishing out as much damage as possible. As such, whenever you use one of these two-handed weapons, you will be dealing twice as much damage as before."
100 CP,Dual Flurry,TES: Warriors,"The idea behind using two weapons at the same time is that you would be capable of dealing twice as much damage as before, so long as you can actually hit your targets. While you use two weapons at the same time, your attack speed is greatly increased."
100 CP,Dual Wielding,TES: Warriors,"Despite what many would think, using two weapons at the same time is a tricky thing, especially two different kinds of weapons. Not so for you, as your ambidextrous nature allows you to effectively utilize a weapon in each hand with the same level of skill as if you were only using one."
100 CP,Energetic Barbarian,TES: Warriors,"Though she may be short for a nord, this redheaded bundle of energy is a right terror in combat. Wielding a warhammer the size of a small child with surprising grace and agility, don't be surprised when anyone who gets in your way cries out over their lost kneecaps."
100 CP,Faithful Hound,Elder Scrolls Skyrim SB Jump,"Dogs have been considered man's best friend for ages and for good reason too. They’re able to help greatly when it comes to tracking a target, they’re loyal, and generally just nice companions to have. Which is nice since you now have a faithful hound of your own. Whether you bought it or found it roaming the wilds this dog is both a loyal and surprisingly capable compatriart more than capable of killing wolves and even bringing bandits down should they not be well armored. Though perhaps you just want the dog as a pet, either works. This acts as a follower and not a companion, if killed the dog will return given a few days and should you wish it your new pet can become a companion if imported later on."
100 CP,Iron Fist ,TES: Warriors,"It takes either a brave, skilled, or foolish man to face the foes of the world with naught but your bare hands, but you seem to be the former. Not only are your fists as durable as fine steel, but you deal thrice as much unarmed damage as you could have before."
100 CP,Ring of Vitality,TES: Warriors,"A very useful ring for any questing warrior, this golden band is engraved with the image of an ox. While wearing it, it will render you immune to all but the most potent or divine diseases, poisons, and paralysis. Even those that are capable of affecting you would be highly weakened."
100 CP,Rugged Beauty ,TES: Warriors,"Though war and battle wears down all who participate, be it mentally or physically, your heroic visage is comparable to the chiseled marble of a master craftsman. Your beauty is almost unparalleled, and any attempt to mar such beauty with wounds or scars will only see it be enhanced."
100 CP,Shield Wall ,Elder Scrolls Skyrim SB Jump,"Since dodging in heavy armor can be difficult, it makes sense to rely on your trusty old shield to tank the blows. You're very good at using it to weather any blow you can't dodge, sometimes even using it to your advantage by directing the enemy's thrusts to make an opening. You're in fact good enough to use it even against ranged attacks, like arrows and even magic, though do keep in mind that if the shield itself is flimsy then it won't be able to take a direct hit; you're not going to be tanking dragonfire with an ordinary shield of common iron, for example. But you will get as much use as is physically possible out of that ordinary iron shield."
100 CP,Sturdy Shield ,TES: Warriors,"The key behind using both a sword and shield is being able to take blows and then return the favor. It can be hard, though, if your opponent hits you hard enough to stagger you, giving them an opening. Thankfully, all shields you use will be able to negate a quarter of the kinetic force from all incoming attacks."
100 CP,Targe of the Blooded ,TES: Warriors,"Though it may only be made of steel and wood, this shield is a dangerous item in the right hands, all thanks to the multitude of spikes on the front of it. These spikes can predictably be used to damage foes, but they can also catch incoming weapons and, with a bit of finesse, rip them from your opponents' hands."
100 CP,Weapon Training,TES: Warriors,"You would be a poor warrior if you were without the proper skills. Not only are you fairly adept with your chosen combat style and in peak physical condition, but you know how to properly maintain your weaponry and armor."
100 CP,Nordic Armor,TES: The First Council,"Heavy armor made primarily from quicksilver, it is carved with imagery of bears. Not only is it more effective than steel, but it will also keep your temperature regulated, allowing you to be cozy even while in a snowstorm."
100 CP,Battle Cry ,TES: The First Council,"Upon the defeat of Alduin and their draconic overlords, the nords of Skyrim proved that their Voices, too, were strong. Such power infuses even the least of all nords, allowing them to let out a battlecry that causes those weak of will to flee upon hearing it, and causing a shivering fear into all who hear it."
100 CP,Guards and Servants,The Elder Scrolls Series,"Whether you're off travelling on the road, or staying home, it can get tedious doing all of this household maintenance yourself. Well, you no longer have to, as you now have people who do that for you. Under the supervision of a Steward and a Guard Captain, you've got servants to take care of your home and guards to protect it, as well as enough room to house them. The amount you gain is proportional to how large your home is."
100 CP,Armory ,The Elder Scrolls Series,"There are so many interesting and unique pieces of gear found on Nirn, so isn't it a shame that you don't have anywhere to display it? Well, not any more, as this armory is covered in armor mannequins and weapon displays, allowing you to show off the best of what you've got. Anything stored here won't rust or be affected by the passing of the ages, looking just as pristine as when they were placed here."
100 CP,An Adoring Fan,Elder Scrolls: Oblivion,"Maybe it was a stint in the arena, or perhaps the last job you did saved a life and earned someone’s deepest affection. Regardless, you’ve struck a chord with them earning the eternal enthusiastic adoration of a completely useless civilian. This could anyone from a bosmer lad to an argonian lass. Ultimately they are not very experienced in the ways of the world. But they’ll carry your weapons, shine your boots, and offer backrubs when the mood strikes. For some, this level of adoration could get a bit grating. It wouldn’t be out of character to hear, “You're the best! I'm going to follow you and watch you and worship the ground you walk on!” They are actually pretty dedicated to performing all the tasks they offer well though."
200 CP,Armoured Juggernaut ,Elder Scrolls Skyrim SB Jump,"Heavy armour is great isn’t it? The ability to wade into battle shrugging off arrows, magic, and blades alike, what’s not to like? Well one thing, it’s heavy as can be and will quickly tire out many given some time. This drawback doesn’t really apply to you. You recover from exertion at an astounding rate, to the point that even continuous and strenuous running or hiking in the mountains while wearing Daedric or Dragon bone armour wouldn’t phase you in the slightest, furthermore this unnatural endurance also applies to general health and strength as a warrior. Naturally you’re also quite skilled in the use of heavy armor, being able to make far greater use of it than most and being able to easily cover any weaknesses it has. Now go forth warrior, and let your enemies flee as your armoured form smashes their lines to pieces!"
200 CP,Bearclaw Helm,TES: Daedra,"Once belonging to a small Dunmer House, this helmet was crafted from the skull of a great beast, and now it is yours. While wearing it, you will find yourself stronger and more agile than before."
200 CP,Decorated General ,TES: Warriors,"Wars are very, very rarely ever won by a single person. They are won through the effort of numerous people, through armies and tactics and stratagems. You understand this, and have endeavored to master the art of war in a level few ever do. You are a talented general, on par with some of the best in history, able to eke out victories from some of the most hopeless of battles."
200 CP,Elemental Protection ,TES: Warriors,"While shields can protect against swords and arrows easily enough, magic is very much a real danger that could bypass or ignore your flawless defense. And now, you can ignore it right back, kind of. You will have both your magical resistance as well as your elemental resistances boosted, allowing you to ignore weaker effects all together."
200 CP,Mead Hall,TES: Warriors,"Every good band of warriors needs a place to rest their laurels, where they can drink as much mead as possible and embellish their tales of valor. This mead hall is just that, a place that gives off a constant aura of revelry and brotherhood as surely as the barrels of mead and other such spirits will never run dry. Now it's just a question of how everyone will get home when they're piss drunk."
200 CP,Strong Grip ,TES: Warriors,"As strong as your fists may be, it means nothing if your opponent can just move out of the way. Though it may not entirely solve that problem, when you get close enough there’s no way they’re going to get away, as you are a master of grappling and wrestling your opponents to the ground and keeping them held down."
200 CP,Troll Blood ,TES: Warriors,"Trolls are infamously difficult to take down, in part due to their special fat that absorb blunt blows, but also because of their potent regeneration. You seem to share in this strange ability, capable of regenerating from all wounds so quickly. Be wary, though, as this regeneration will be greatly slowed if the wounds were inflicted by fire, or were cauterized."
200 CP,Bands of Kwang Lao ,The Elder Scrolls Series,"These leather bands are said to have belonged to a fierce warrior hailing from Akavir. Wearing them not only increases your skill with unarmed combat, but increases the force behind your strikes and makes your fists as hard as ebony. Who needs a weapon when you have your fists?"
300 CP,Dual Defence,TES: Warriors,"Many think that a good offense is a good defense, and you have taken that proverb to heart. You are a master of blocking and redirecting attacks with your weapons, stopping an incoming axe and tossing it to the wayside where it won’t be cracking your skull open."
300 CP,Paralyzing Palm,TES: Warriors,"There are myths of some martial artists who are capable of striking specific points on the body, paralyzing, manipulating, or even killing them with just a few pokes and strikes. You know that these are not myths, but truths, for you are capable of all of them."
300 CP,Castle Jumper ,The Elder Scrolls Series,"Why would you have an ordinary house when you could have a castle instead? Your home is vastly increased in size, along with any additions you've bought. Your [Guest Housing] could now house up to forty people, while a [Vast Library] could contain enough books to put some universities to shame. Your home also has at least four floors now."
400 CP,Auriel's Shield ,TES: Warriors,"Said to be the shield of the elven god Auriel himself, this artifact is both a great defense and potent offense. When struck, it completely absorbs the kinetic energy of the attack, storing it for until you unleash it all in a wave of divine energy that pushes against all in front of you. Even when faced against magic, it still offers you amazing protection."
400 CP,Champion's Cudgel ,TES: Imperial Cult,"An enchanted warhammer given to General Falx Carius of Fort Frostmoth, it is a fitting weapon for one who fights for the Empire and all it stands for. Its heavy head can be used to crumple steel armor with ease, while its chaotic enchantment will randomly harm the target with either fire, frost, or shock damage."
400 CP,Chillrend,TES: Warriors,"Though one may think this blue blade emitting frosty mist is made from stalhrim, it is in fact a unique shortsword made from a rare type of blue malachite. Though, its enchantment means that it's easy to get confused, as not only does it unleash a massive amount of frost damage, it will also paralyze most opponents who are struck by it, as though they were frozen solid."
400 CP,Dragonguard ,Elder Scrolls Skyrim SB Jump,"Every warrior needs his companions and naturally you’re no exception. Following your lead is now a sizable organization of warriors and heroes of notable repute. The group can be designed however you wish and oriented around in a way that pleases you, want a band of dragon slaying Knights at your beck and call, great, or perhaps Vampire hunters like the Dawnguard are more preferable to you. This can even be as much as just being a group of people who congregate together due to a shared love of adventure, the point is that the sky’s the limit with this. The average member is just that, average, however there are a number of higher ranking members who are notably stronger and more capable to make up for this. Fortunately the group is also in a solid position to expand and grow should you wish that as well."
400 CP,Ebony Set ,Elder Scrolls Skyrim SB Jump,"Now we’re really starting to talk equipment; ignore that dingy iron or even the mastercrafted armor of the Dwemer, both pale in comparison. Ebony armor is some of the strongest on the planet and now you’ve got a full set including weapons, which in of itself would normally be well beyond what the average person could ever hope to afford. Where before iron would ensure encounters with the lesser enemies of the world were survival, but still an issue they’re now something of the past. Iron and even glass swords will bounce off and arrows will find themselves breaking upon your form unless they’re aimed expertly or enhanced in some form or another. Your weapons are of similar caliber, tearing through lesser materials with ease and being extremely well crafted to fit you just right."
400 CP,Mighty Fortress ,TES: Warriors,"For those of you who want more than just a bed at an inn or a sleeping roll, you can never go wrong with a sturdy fortress to call your home. Its walls are sturdy, its design focused towards defense and repelling invaders, it has the room to house dozens of soldiers, as well as enough supplies to arm them and keep them fed for as long as needed. The heraldry and aesthetics are ultimately up to you, but regardless of what you choose, this will be a tough nut that few could crack."
400 CP,Savage Strike ,TES: Warriors,"While the weapons you use may not possess as much weight behind them as a warhammer, it is just as important where you strike as it is how much force you strike with. In your hands, your weapon seems to slightly direct your movements, moving towards an opponent’s weak points."
400 CP,Shield of Ysgramor ,TES: Undead,"Used by Ysgramor and crafted for him by Ahzidal, this shield is a powerful artifact. Not only does it grant the wearer an increased resistance to frost, it also imbues them with a healing factor. But it’s ultimate ability is being able to unleash the frost of Atmora itself, coating the user in a powerful frost cloak that harms anyone and anything nearby."
400 CP,Wuuthrad ,TES: The First Council,"The battleaxe of Ysgramor himself, it was crafted using materials and techniques originating from Atmora, it was made specifically to kill elves as easily as possible. Your version is special, as it will deal much more damage to any sentient race of non-humans. It will also ignore any and all magical protections, even allowing you to cut ethereal enemies in half with a mighty swing."
400 CP,Titan Born,TES: The First Council,"It is often believed that the nords and giants share similar origins, having migrated from Atmora, so it is not unheard of for the two to procreate. You are one of these half-giants, though taking more after your giant side, being a foot taller than most nords while possessing enough strength to throw around an entire horse. This strength goes well with your newfound skill in unarmed combat, allowing you to easily pin down a snow bear, or punch its head clean off."
500 CP,Dual Savagery,TES: Warriors,"One of the greatest advantages of dual wielding weapons is the increased offensive potential one could possess, and you are undeniably proof of that. When you are in a fight, you become a whirlwind of death, becoming faster and faster the longer a fight goes on. Eventually, you may get to the point where you could slash individual raindrops in the middle of the air, and perhaps even further beyond."
500 CP,Unstoppable Force,TES: Warriors,"There are few opponents as dangerous on the battlefield as you, an unstoppable force that can crush any immovable object stupid enough to get in your way. Any attack you deal with a two-handed weapon will completely ignore a target’s armor, be they physical or magical, as well as bypassing damage resistance."
500 CP,Eagle Eye,The Elder Scrolls Series,"When people think of warriors, it's not often that they think of archers. It's not as memorable as a fully armored Nord with a battle axe rushing towards you, but your ability to accurately hit a target's eye a mile away is a great way to avoid being in that situation entirely."
600 CP,Champion of Skyrim ,Elder Scrolls Skyrim SB Jump,"If there was a Fighter’s Guild in Skyrim you’d almost assuredly be its champion. The skill and talent you have for battle is tremendous and fits more in the legendary tales of Ysgramor or possibly even Pelinal Whitestrake than it does reality. To you fighting is an art, an art you’ve mastered, weaving men’s innards like a tapestry with your sword and spear is as easy as dancing your way through the frontlines of a bloody battle without taking a single blow, while felling many of the enemy with ease. As a final boon and to ensure your body can keep up with your skill, your physical form is enhanced further and you’ll find that spending hours upon hours hacking your way through enemies is no issue, nor will shrugging off many wounds. You’re already the stuff Heroes are said to be made of when it comes to the martial way, and yet it seems you’ve still got room to grow. I wonder, how will future generations look back on someone such as you?"
600 CP,The Five Hundred Companions,Elder Scrolls Skyrim SB Jump,"There’s just something about you, a certain aura about your person that just draws people to you. While others may have charisma on a personal level you have it on a far grander level, that of a Warrior King or leader like Ysgramor. This is the charisma required to win over entire peoples and crown oneself king and where a personal level of charisma may be like honeyed words someone can’t resist, this is akin to a
roaring tempest that drags people to you. Warriors, mages and others will find themselves drawn to your banner should you raise it and you’ll quickly find yourself surrounded by competent advisors and companions like Ysgramor and his ilk were. This also comes with the knowledge to lead your troops in such a manner that would earn you the respect of grizzled generals and veterans, after all what’s the point of all these people if you can’t lead them?"
600 CP,Unkillable ,TES: Werebeasts,"There are rumors of entities that are unkillable, but you could actually pull it off. You have an incredible regeneration ability similar to that of a Troll, capable of healing most flesh wounds in seconds, while broken bones would take a few hours, depending on how bad the damage is. Unfortunately, you cannot regrow entire limbs, but in return you have become effectively immortal. You can live indefinitely, forever in your prime, until someone or something manages to kill you, which itself would be quite the feat."
