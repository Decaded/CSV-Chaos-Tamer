100 CP,Elementalist,TES: Magic,"Few schools can match the flashiness of the School of Destruction, nor can many resist the temptation to destroy your enemies in an elemental fashion. Choose one of the three classical elements, Fire, Frost, or Shock. Spells that utilize your chosen element will be twice as devastating, all while costing half the magicka cost they otherwise would have."
100 CP,Healer ,TES: Magic,"The art of Restoration is a perfectly valid School of Magic, and don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.

For you, healing spells are twice as powerful, all while costing half as much magicka."
100 CP,Life Extension,TES: Magic,"It is not unheard of for certain mages to live well beyond their race's standard life expectancy, simply look at Divayth Fyr for one such example.

100 CP,Staff Creator,TES: Magic,"Staves are extremely useful tools for mages, able to hold charges of spells, and even be used to focus and empower a user’s spells.

100 CP,Varla Stones,TES: Magic,"Crafted from meteoric glass by the now extinct Aelyids, Varla Stones are highly valuable resources that are similar, yet different, to Welkynd Stones. While they store magicka just like their smaller brethren, these are used to fully replenish an enchantment, or can even act like a magical power source.

Luckily, you have a stockpile of fifty of these stones, which will replenish weekly."

Mostly they busy themselves with attending lectures, strolling around campus, and doing their best to study up on the arcane arts. Currently they know a decent bit about Destruction magic, have some weak summon spells, and through errors in casting those spells have come to understand the value of their singular strong self-healing spell. What they have in intelligence they lack in force of personality. This student seems hesitant to speak much at all, even if they are excellent at following instructions. Perhaps they view you as a respected professor and are afraid to embarrass themselves?"
100 CP,Ice Queen,TES: Dovah,"An Altmer who studied at the College of Winterhold, she is a magewhose skill in magic is matched only by her arrogance.

200 CP,Dual Casting,TES: Magic,"The gods gave you two hands, so why not use both of them for your magic? When you use both hands to cast a spell, not only does the spell itself require less magicka to use, but it will also see a noticeable increase in potency.

200 CP,Magical Books,Elder Scrolls Skyrim SB Jump,"The art of spellcraft is one that requires an immense amount of dedication and in many ways talent as well.

200 CP,Personal Staff,TES: Magic,"A custom staff lovingly crafted to suit your own tastes and aesthetic, it will be a potent tool in your arsenal.

200 CP,Wizardly Studies,Elder Scrolls Skyrim SB Jump,"Wizarding is made out to be glorious, casting of fire balls and bolts of lightning, what they unfortunately fail to mention is that a large part of growing in magic is tedious study, research, and training that can become mind numbing.

200 CP,Ancient Ayleids,The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion,"A common sight around the landscape of the province, these ruins are all that remains of the city-states that once marked the Ayleid Empire. What is uncommon is that this site has great potential historical value, having been left essentially untouched since it was abandoned eras ago. Within can be found all manner of priceless art and insight into Ayleid life. There are also defenses, puzzles, and remaining treasures. The most notable of these treasures are the welkynd and varla stones that can be uncovered. These were crafted from fallen stars and used by the elves to replenish their personal magicka and the energy of their enchanted items. With the loss of Aldmer civilization the secrets to recharging them was lost too and these treasures crumble to dust when used. That is not the case here. At the heart of this abandoned city lies it’s Great Welkynd Stone which will serve to power any of the enchantments kept within the city. This ensures your various stones will be able to recharge keeping your magicka strong."
400 CP,Archmage,TES: Magic,"While there are many mages who are masters of their craft, with a skill and understanding of their chosen School that would be difficult to match, few are as suited for the role of Archmage as you. Your magicka reserves are, quite frankly, monstrous, which is not helped by the fact that they replenish at an incredible rate.

400 CP,Invisible Hand ,TES: Magic,"Arguably one of the most useful spells, there is a lot of versatility to be found in telekinesis, especially if the caster is a master like yourself.

Even those spells that are considered unique or restricted are just within your grasp, if you choose to reach out."
400 CP,Wizard's Tower ,TES: Magic,"Though it may just be a cliche, there is something to be said about owning your very own arcane tower. This property has multiple levels, each for a certain purpose.

It can bypass most magic barriers, though there might be a reason for them to be placed where they are, so exercise caution."
400 CP,Spellsword,The Elder Scrolls Series,"It is an unfortunate truth that sometimes pure might is not enough. You are quite skilled in supplementing your combat capabilities with the use of magic. Enhancing your physical capabilities, momentarily coat your weapon in mystical fire, or just using a blade in one hand and blasting lightning from the other."
400 CP,Lustratorium,The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion,"A substantial indoor and outdoor botanical garden offers a vast assortment of ingredients that would otherwise be hard to come by. You can plant anything here to grow it safely. Furthermore the area contains a full lab of alchemical equipment for producing potions from the supplies here.

500 CP,Diadem of the Savant ,The Elder Scrolls Series,"This golden circlet is gifted to anyone who is able to complete Shalidor's Maze, and overcome the trials within.

Through countless battles, you have refined your spell work to such an extent that damaging spells are thrice as powerful, with their effects lasting twice as long. And while the greatest enemy to a mage is those who are capable of resisting magic, they are of no concern to you. Indeed, your spells are now capable of ignoring magic resistances in their entirety. Let them feel your wrath."
600 CP,Arcane College ,TES: Magic,"If there is one thing that is most important to a mage, it is the acquirement and transference of knowledge, and there are few places better than this academy. A large structure that is capable of holding hundreds of students and faculty, it’s got all the amenities you would expect from a magical institute of learning. Most impressive is the extensive library, with innumerable tomes on all manner of subjects, ranging from the mundane to the magical. Should you decide to actually use this to teach, then all who come here to learn will see their progress rapidly increase."
600 CP,Legacy of Shalidor,Elder Scrolls Skyrim SB Jump,"Yours is a level of raw power and talent not seen in Skyrim for centuries, if not millennia.

You’ll also find that your natural ability with spellcraft has also lent itself to doing more than simply learning the old. Creating new spells is something you’ve gotten quite good at as well - after all it’s nice to be able to make up something new should specific issues arise. To supplement this your body and soul are able to handle immense amounts of magicka for casting allowing you vast reserves to call upon for any spellcasting needs. Go forth young mage, you’re a legend in the making and with work and research your name may yet stand with the greats."
600 CP,Lost Arts ,TES: Magic,"Well now, it certainly seems as though you have broken free of the preconceived limitations of the School System of magic. You may now count yourself as an unequaled master of a long forgotten, or extremely rare, form of magic. It could be the Thu'um, a type of magic that warps reality based on the words you speak. It could be the Tonal Architecture of the Dwemer, capable of innumerable effects that seem fantastical and impossible. Or maybe Tonal Magic is not your style, instead following in Azra Nightwielder's footsteps, becoming a master of Shadow Magic. Weather magic, blood magic, auramancy, even time magic is possible. Though you can purchase this option more than once, it will not be discounted after the first."
