Thankfully, there were miners like you, knowing how and where best to dig efficiently, making sure that the earth surrounding you is as sturdy and secure as possible.

The exact limits of what you can receive from this is unknown, though it seems the results are much better when utilizing a Sigil Stone."
200 CP,Cidhna Mine,Elder Scrolls Skyrim SB Jump,"Nobody escapes Cidhna Mine, that’s how the saying goes anyways. Cidhna mine is an extensive set of tunnels snaking into Nirn which the Silver-Blood Family uses as a prison and as a source of much wealth. Yours isn’t that same dreaded mine, though it’s similar in many ways. Placed in a reasonable location of your choosing is a copy of the mine, while the original was predominately used for silver mining yours is much greater. Throughout the mines are extensive reserves of just about all of the ores found in Skyrim at the time, ranging from Ebony to Stalhrim and will produce an incredible amount.

200 CP,Ebony Pick ,TES: The First Council,"Crafted from ebony and embedded with ancient runes, you are now the proud owner of an ancient nord pickaxe. Not only can it go through rock as easily as a knife through flesh, but it ignores any magical durability of the target. There is a reason this is one of the very few ways to get through Stahlrim."
200 CP,Enchanting Tower ,TES: Undead," If you aren’t a fan of going out and finding, buying, or looting powerful enchanted gear, then you'll probably be wanting to do it yourself. This tower is completely devoted to the art of enchanting, with a high-quality enchanting setup, many books on the subject, and a replenishing stock of soul gems.

Upon purchasing this you’ll be given a normal iron bound chest which contains within itself a constantly replenishing supply of crafting/smithing materials. This ranges from simple Iron and Copper to rarer materials like Stalhrim and even Ebony. Naturally without the skills to make use of the material it’s value is limited to barter and being sold off but I’m certain someone with some knowledge and the proper tools could do some interesting things with it."
200 CP,Smithy Area,The Elder Scrolls Series,"As fun as purchasing or finding various pieces of equipment is, sometimes it's just better to craft your own gear.

There's also more than enough storage for you to store all of your crafting materials and crafted gear."
200 CP,Stone Shaper ,TES: Undead,"Gargoyles are actually quite fascinating, as they are less creatures and more living statues. All it takes is a skilled sculptor and talented mage.

Hopefully, you could one day turn this skill of yours towards goals for yourself, rather than the cruel masters who hold your leash."
200 CP,Dwemer Forge,TES: Warriors,"Of all the races on Tamriel, the dwemer were by far the greatest smiths and architects, the sciences and magics behind their creations a complete mystery, such that even how they made their unique metal is unknown. But perhaps this forge offers a clue, as anything crafted with this brass-looking forge is rendered immune to the forces of time. Even if your works last millennia after you, they will still look just as they did when you first created them."
200 CP,Ore Vein,The Elder Scrolls - Skyrim,"An ore vein that is added to the warehouse or property. Replenishes daily but varies from type of

Not only that, you are also quite the skilled enchanter yourself, placing pretty decent magical effects on your creations."
400 CP,Airship ,TES: The First Council,"While they mostly lived underground, that does not mean the dwemer were not fascinated by the heavens. A wondrous craft that no other races have come close to replicating, like much of dwemer technology, this is a brigantine-type ship that can sail through the skies as easily as a normal ship sails through water, and is protected against lightning and rough winds. It even has numerous ballistas with replenishing ammo, allowing you to attach from relative safety."
400 CP,Animunculi Master,TES: The First Council,"The animunculi created by the dwemer are fascinating things, functioning perfectly fine for almost four millennia with little to no maintenance. And though they require either the presence of the Heart or soul gems embedded into them to function, your animunculi do not require such power sources. In addition, the AI you can grant them are true works of art. Though limited to being animalistic in intelligence at first, they are capable of learning and adapting to various stimuli."
400 CP,Dwemer Fireheart:,Elder Scrolls: Oblivion,"Not many can boast of having their own antique forge. This place is heavily enchanted to bring out the craftsman in anyone. Because of the power in this place, all smithing done here will be amplified in quality. A newcomer to blacksmithing would be able to fashion serviceable iron weapons here, to say nothing of what could be accomplished by a true artisan. Along with the forge itself are matrices to make armour and weapons from many of this world’s exotic materials. The molds for glass, amber, and bonemold aren’t easy to get a hold of. Of course, those wouldn’t be very useful without the supplies to fill them. While you begin with a stockpile of local metals (ex. steel, mithril, and orichalcum) you also arrange for raw material deliveries from across Tamriel and even the Shivering Isles. It won’t be cheap but you also won’t have to worry about a shortage of precious dwarven metal or ebony or madness ore. Even with the enchantment, it might be best to wait to work with glass, ebony, amber, or madness until you’ve at least familiar making elven and orcish equipment."
400 CP,Dwemer Lexicon,Elder Scrolls Skyrim SB Jump,"A complete record of the Deep Elves’s knowledge and technology, ranging from their mechanical monsters to tonal tech. This ranges from the things as simple as their standard architecture to their advanced automatons and things like the Aetherial items. Also for those already asking, the knowledge of how to in theory remake the Numidium is here, however you’ll notice it’s not going to give a step by step guide, and the requirements and skill necessary will be far beyond all but the greatest, and most legendary Tonal Architects. Make sure to use this with care, the Dwemer were among the most powerful races to live and the damage that could be done with their advancements is immense."
400 CP,Lunar Forge,TES: Werebeasts,"Though often overshadowed by the great Skyforge only a few miles away, the Lunar Forge is just as grand a forge, creating powerful weapons and armors. Anything crafted here will be of a higher quality than is natural, while the items and any enchantments you put on them will be thrice as effective under the cover of night."
400 CP,Master Smith,Elder Scrolls Skyrim SB Jump,"So, how many iron daggers did this take to get? Regardless of the answer to that question the results have surely shown themselves to you and everyone else. You’re a master of smithing and the working of metal, forging weapons out of Glass and Ebony is well within your capacity, and even Daedric items may be forged with proper equipment and materials. Your craftsmanship is nothing less than perfection and your talent for growth is great as well. Given times you may yet forge tools, weapons and armor that rival even the likes of Daedric artifacts."
400 CP,Runesmith ,TES: Warriors,"The art of runes has long since fallen out of favor, due to the easier alternative of enchanting, but you are one of the few practitioners still around. You possess knowledge of how to craft dozens of these runes, which may not be as powerful as modern enchantments but never run out of charge. Whether you make your creations with them or engrave them onto pre-existing pieces, the only limit in how many you can place is how skilled you are."
400 CP,Skyforge ,TES: Warrior,"Though its original creators are unknown, the steel it forges has long been useful to the warriors of Whiterun. The embers within the forge enhance any metal that it works with, making them stronger and more durable than before. A steel blade made within this forge would be the equal to any malachite blade, to say nothing of what the quality of an ebony or dragonbone weapon would be."
400 CP,Tools of Kagrenac ,TES: The First Council,"Crafted by the Chief Tonal Architect to harness the beating power of a dead god, these three tools were integral to his plan of crafting a Brass God. Sunder was created to produce a specific amount of power from the Heart. Keening was created to flay and focus the power that the hammer Sunder produced. Wraithguard was created to safely wield the other tools. Together, they can be used to safely harness any energy source, though it works best with those of divine origins."
400 CP,Behold Haxcalibur,Modded Skyrim,"Congrats, you broke the crafting system. Anything and everything you make, build, enchant, or otherwise create is now ten times better than it really ought to be. Make an ordinary dagger that does 12 damage? Now it does 120. Pick up an endgame weapon and enhance it for its supposed max of 200 damage? 2000. Guns that hold more bullets and do more damage, magic staffs that massively amplify your magic, armor that shrugs off OHKO's, potions that let you ignore 110% of fire damage, weapons with ten or twenty enchantments. And if that wasn't enough, you'll learn anything crafting related ten times as fast, just to blow the competition out of the water even more."
500 CP,Master of the Craft,TES: Magic,"Through long study and years of effort, you have become an undisputed master of your craft. In addition to all of your enchantments being five times more potent, you have learned a very valuable, and very difficult technique. You can add new enchantments onto already enchanted items, as well as further enhancing pre-existing enchantments! With your skill, you could even make those vaunted Daedric Artifacts more powerful than they already are."
500 CP,Master of the Forge,TES: Warrior,"You have reached near the peak of what mortals are capable of when it comes to your craft, capable of making gear so fine that most would consider them the stuff of legends. You are even capable of breaking down and enhancing items that would be considered as indestructible, making them into something even greater than before under your skilled hands."
600 CP,Aetherium Forge,TES: The First Council,"Created by the dwemer of Skyrim, not many forges are more famous than the creations made in its fires. Stocked with every tool necessary for the creation of powerful artifacts, the geothermal power it utilizes not only contains heat, but the divine essence of Nirn's creator, Lorkhan. Each item created or improved within this forge receives a bit of that essence, greatly enhancing the properties. It also contains a replenishing stock of aetherium, a blue luminescent crystal that possesses immense magical qualities."
600 CP,Chief Tonal Architect ,TES: The First Council,"There are few as talented in the art of Tonal Architecture as Kagrenac, the foremost arcane philosopher and magecrafter of the dwemer race. How strange it is, then, that you are every bit his equal. There are few avenues of Tonal Architecture you are not aware of and mastered, from their advanced machinery to the masterful stonemasonry. Indeed, your mastery would allow you to potentially start construction of your own Brass Tower."
600 CP,Underground City ,TES: The First Council,"Besides their magic, automatons, and intellect, the dwemer were primarily known for being one of the very few races who preferred a subterranean lifestyle. Carved from within the bowels of the earth and reinforced with dwemeri ingenuity and magics, not many places at the time could match a dwemer city like what you now own. In addition to its subterranean nature, it also has numerous animunculi acting as protectors and doing any maintenance that needs to be done."
