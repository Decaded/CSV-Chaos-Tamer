0 CP,Burial Urn ,TES: Undead,"What you now possess is a small urn with your name on it, only around the size of the average horse skull. Inside will always be a few gold coins, a gem or two, as well as the ashes of a dead person. These will restock when you place the lid back on."
100 CP,Ancient Nord Set ,TES: Undead,"You were entombed with your armor in death, and now it will protect you in unlife. You are now in possession of a high-quality set of ancient nordic armor and weapons, as well as daily replenishing arrows, each just as effective as the day they were forged."
100 CP,Black Soul Gems ,TES: Undead,"During your studies of necromancy, you have discovered that there were few items as useful in the dark arts than black soul gems. These are the only type of soul gems that can handle the souls of the mortal races. How lucky you are, then, that you are now in possession of twenty replenishing black soul gems, each filled and replenishing after a week."
100 CP,Life Return Ritual,TES: Undead,"Well then, it seems as though you have taken a page out of Falion’s journal, quite literally I might add. You are now in possession of a small book containing various rituals meant to return the various types of Undead back into their original mortal selves. This can also be used to affect undead creatures in any future worlds you may decide to visit. Not many who embraced undeath may be so willing to undergo such a ritual, though."
100 CP,Ancient Coins,TES: Undead,"Did you really expect that septims were the only currency found within Tamriel? No, many cultures before the Third Empire utilized coins as currency, and you now have proof of that. One hundred coins from some ancient or far off civilization, they're more valuable as collectors items then anything, but at least they'll replenish each week."
100 CP,Bone Hawk,TES: Undead,"These predatory birds are actually a type of undead creature, and can typically be found as pets or familiars to various undead. Yours is bonded to you, obeying your commands and allowing you to see through its eyes and ears. This bird especially loves it when given red meat, even though they don’t need to eat."
100 CP,Death Hound,TES: Undead,"Death Hounds are used as guardians by vampires. How they came to be is unknown, but their bite is as cold as the grave. This one in particular is exceptionally trained, and will obey your orders to the best of its abilities. Be sure to give it plenty of belly rubs, yeah?"
100 CP,Vampire Princess,TES: Undead,"Sealed within an ancient tomb in the frozen peaks of Skyrim, Serana is an interesting case. Quick-witted and sarcastic, she is a Daughter of Coldharbour, one of the few Pure-blooded Vampires, and trained in both Alchemy and Necromancy, though her skill in Destruction is nothing to scoff at."
100 CP,Skeletal Dragon,TES: Undead,"There are few creatures as mighty as the Dragons, and that strength permeates their very bones. Literally, as they are considered more durable as refined ebony. So I’m certain you can find some uses for this animated dragon skeleton, which is skill capable of flight, somehow, and can only use the shouts Unrelenting Force, Fire Breath, and Frost Breathe."
100 CP,Monstrous Gargoyle ,The Elder Scrolls Series,"Gargoyles are a race of living statues that have been animated by a wizard or vampire, often found guarding dungeons, castles, and ancient ruins. As expected, this powerful Gargoyle is extremely loyal to you, has skin as tough as stone, claws that can easily rend flesh, and is immune to poison and paralysis effects."
100 CP,Priestly Staff ,TES: Dovah,"An elegant staff carved in the likeness of a dragon, these were gifted to many of the Dragon Priests, and were highly treasured. Not only does wielding one of these staves reduce the cost of your destruction magic, but it will make any fire related abilities twice as powerful."
100 CP,Treasure Pile,TES: Dovah,"Though it may be a stereotype, there is nothing wrong with hoarding vast amounts of wealth. With each purchase of this, you will receive a pile of gold, gems, and jewelry that is worth around one hundred thousand septims."
100 CP,Kahvozein's Fang ,TES: Dovah,"A bronze dagger made in the standard fashion of the Dragon Cult, it was used in many arcane rituals utilizing Dragon Heartscales. Their draconic essence seems to have granted this dagger some manner of power, allowing it to completely bypass the natural defenses of dragons."
100 CP,Wolf Queen ,TES: Undead,"A scion of the Septim bloodline, cursed by the soul of a fel beast since birth, Potema grew to be an exceptionally powerful necromancer. Such was her talents that she threatened the Empire itself with her undead army, only stopping once she was slain. Now she follows you, either out of loyalty or lust for the power your journey will grant her."
200 CP,Ideal Master ,TES: Undead,"The power offered by the Ideal Masters of the Soul Cairn is a tempting prize, leading the ambitious and foolhardy necromancers to their certain doom. But you? You knew what you were doing, knew just how to deal with those entities, and are one of the few that prospered. You are able to summon the powerful undead found within the Soul Cairn, from the common Bonemen to the powerful Keepers, all at a fraction of the magicka cost it would normally take."
200 CP,Wisp Mother ,TES: Undead,"There are many legends of wisps, of how they lure the unsuspecting into the arms of ghostly women who feed on their life force. It seems like the legends are not incorrect, as you are capable of summoning wisps to your side. They can drain the health and stamina from enemies, healing you in the process. They can also disguise themselves as you, though it will only be an illusion."
200 CP,Phantom Armor ,TES: Undead,"When you died, you died in your armor. And when you returned, your armor returned with you, now possessing new properties. In addition to its new spectral look, it has brought the coldness of the grave with it. Whenever you’re struck by an enemy, the attacker will suffer frost damage equal to the damage they dealt to you."
200 CP,Royal Attire ,TES: Undead,"As an existence head and shoulders above mortals, it would only make sense that you would wear the best. Indeed, this elegant set of armor is just as useful as it is intimidating. Not only will you find that it’s much more durable than expected, but it is enchanted to boost your vampiric abilities, as well as lessening the effect the sun has on you."
200 CP,Durnehviir,TES: Undead,"Bound to serve the Ideal Masters of the Soul Cairn for eternity, this dragon has found himself free from that awful realm, all thanks to you. Durnehviir is a powerful necromancer, capable of summoning undead legions from the Soul Cairn and ripping out a person’s soul using the Thu’um. He also loves a good challenge, and would welcome any chance to spar with powerful opponents."
200 CP,Bloodstone Chalice ,TES: Daedra,"A relic created by a vampiric mage of old, this chalice is utterly unique in that it will never run out of fresh blood. But if that was the only draw, then it would be a rather poor relic. No, upon drinking from this chalice, a vampire would find their vampiric abilities doubled for three days. Drinking from it will also heal the vampire, as well as restoring any spent magicka."
200 CP,Shadowmere,Elder Scrolls: Oblivion,"Inky waters frothed and billowed unholy thick plumes of smoke, from which the silhouette of a horse was barely visible. When its glowing crimson eyes pierced this sinister cloud before the beast emerged it appeared more like a malevolent daedra than any creature of Nirn. This aggressively loyal and seemingly immortal being has entered your service. Her attacks are powerful and she never shies from entering combat alongside her master. Though it is undead Shadowmere shows no outward evidence of this nature beyond the overtly menacing stature. One tell might be the frankly unnatural rate of recovery from injury. Should this unparalleled steed somehow be slain, fear not! In a period of no greater than ten days she will be restored to unholy life near the site of death once again emerging in her frightening display from darkest depths."
200 CP,An Uncaged Mind,Elder Scrolls: Oblivion,"Little boys shouldn't summon up the forces of eternal darkness unless they have an adult supervision. Now normally, you need a witches coven, or a mages guild, or at least matching pillow case and sheets to invoke a daedric prince. They’re beyond the mortal scope, breadth, ken, blah, blah, blah. But these things are not beyond your scope, no siree! You have escaped limited scopes, breadths, and kens too! Your mind is free of such trappings. You have nothing to fear from the mind-shattering madness that comes from forbidden knowledge or embracing avatars of madness. Do you know what it’s called when you do the same thing over and over again and expect different results? Practice! And you, my good sir or ma’am or other preferred term of polite address are so extremely well-practiced at being sane it’s frankly insane. Nothing could break your mind any further than has already been done, congratulations!"
200 CP,Three Masks,TES: Dovah,"The masks gifted to three of the Dragon Priests of Solstheim, each of these are connected to a specific element. Ahzidal allows the wearer to resist half of all hostile fire effects, while boosting their fire spells. Dukaan allows the wearer to resist half of all hostile frost effects, while boosting their frost spells. Zahkriisos allows the wearer to resist half of all hostile shock effects, while boosting their shock spells."
200 CP,Dragonhorn,TES: Dovah,"Crafted from the horn of a slain dragon, this is one of many artifacts crafted by the Dragonguard, used as weapons against the Dragons. This magical warhorn is inscribed with various arcane runes, and capable of producing a tonal sound that temporarily incapacitates any dragons that hear it."
200 CP,Armored Robes,TES: Dovah,"Not all members of the Dragon Priests were content with the ceremonial robes, instead desiring something with more protection. This set of armored robes is as protective as steel armor, and offers a decent amount of magic resistance, reducing its effects by a quarter. Additionally, wearing it allows you to levitate a foot off the ground."
200 CP,Necromantic Grimoire,TES: Undead," [200]: An ancient tome written by an unnamed necromancer,
meant to help his students grow. This book is filled with a number of necromantic spells
for you to learn, such as raising the nearby dead or summoning a spirit animal, but the
amazing thing is that it will add new spells and rituals as you grow in both power and
skill with necromancy."
300 CP,Black Winter ,Dark Brotherhood Jumpchain,"A powerful contact spell that freezes and paralyzes anyone you touch for several seconds, fairly expensive but deadly"
400 CP,Dragon Priest Masks ,TES: Undead,"Granted to the Dragon Priests of Skyrim by the very Dragons themselves, each Dragon Priest Mask was a masterpiece, and imbued with unique enchantments. Hevnoraak, Krosis, Morokei, Nahkriin, Otar, Rahgot, Vokun, Volsung, Ahzidal, Dukaan, Zahkriisos. You are now the owner of all of these masks, with all the powers they grant."
400 CP,Silence of the Grave ,TES: Undead,"Possibly the worst thing about death that you remember was the silence. The unending quiet, only your thoughts with you as you lay trapped within the void. This experience has changed you, granting you a power feared by most.You can unleash a curse upon a target that silences them, not only taking away their voice but also their ability to use magic. This may only be temporary, at most a minute or two, but it's enough to render many powerful entities into harmless bags of flesh."
400 CP,Soul Magic ,TES: Magic,"Seen as a heretical and forbidden art, many forget that Mysticism does involve spells that facilitate the interaction and manipulation of souls. Soul trapping is the least of what you could do, with the potential to mend and cure the souls of any damage or impurities they may have. Of course, should you try your hand at it, you would have a great talent for the necromantic arts."
400 CP,Ghostblade,TES: Undead,"Just like your armor, when you died you died with your weapon in your hand. Now that you have arisen with it, it has gained new ghostly properties. In addition to dealing a large amount of frost damage to your target, it can also bypass armor and even skin completely, damaging the insides of your target directly."
400 CP,Ghostly Pack,TES: Undead,"No man is an island, and a lone wolf is a dead wolf. Sometimes personal power isn't enough, and where you are against forces that vastly outnumber you. Now though, you never have to fear being alone. With a haunting howl, you can summon up to ten spectral werebeasts to fight by your side. Though they may never be as strong as you are, nor have the versatility you might possess, you will find that quantity is a quality unto itself."
400 CP,Nightwielder ,TES: Rogue,"You have learned the signature magic of Azra Nightwielder, Shadow Magic, which grants powerful abilities outside the classical schools of magic. You are an undisputed master of this rare and difficult magic, able to can create objects and familiars of pure shadow, teleport short distances by slipping through the cracks of reality, hide yourself in the tatters of space-time to evade the notice of everything around you, manipulate probability and potential, and much more. At its strongest, it even has the capability to reach into and affect the multiverse."
400 CP,Will Of Sithis ,Dark Brotherhood Jumpchain,"You have learned a spell that allows you to give commands to any sentient humanoid and have them obey any orders you give them for a short time, powerful but high magic cost to use"
400 CP,"A Kiss, Sweet Mother: ",Elder Scrolls: Oblivion,"They became as black queens, screaming live with a hundred murderous sons, a thousand murderous arms, and a hundred thousand murderous hands, one vast moving event of thrusting-kill-laughter in alleys, palaces, workshops, cities and secret halls.” The immortal spirit of the Night Mother is revered and worshipped by the Dark Brotherhood. Whenever a person prays for the death of another, it is heard. A ritual known as the Black Sacrament is often used to best communicate these desires and intent to reach her – where an effigy made from deceased remains is used in a macabre display of reenacting the Night Mother’s own death. The Night Mother hears these requests and passes on the details to her Listener. You are that Listener. From this point you can reach out to the desperate party to come to an arrangement on how to grant their prayers. Through this system you can be contacted by prospective clients that want you to end lives. This alone is easily enough to begin a vast information network and untraceable assassination business."
400 CP,The Dark Practice,Elder Scrolls: Oblivion,"To view necromancy as part of the school of conjuration is misinformed. This is a multidisciplinary magic requires an understanding on mysticism, restoration, and enchantment practices as well. You have a foundation in each of these fields. Most soul trapping busies itself with the binding and use of white souls of lesser beings, only taking the animating energy of the spirit instead of the identity. You have branched into the arcane arts which harvest and use the black souls of sentient beings. This entraps not just the energy of life, but their identity with it. You understand the secret rituals of crafting black soul gems from white ones. The necromantic rituals for creating your own permanent undead minions are likewise known to you. With time and access to resources, you could build a formidable army of skeletons, spirits, zombies, or whatever other undead you require. Your skill in reanimating the dead makes you peer to figures like Mannimarco and Potema. When you wrest a soul from its owner and use that power to create another undead minion, you will them easy control, keeping any original personality subjugated as you refashion it into the servant you need. Achieving a state of lichdom would be possible for you, should you wish it. Binding your servants to your own life force as a means to control them, like some vampire clans or dragon cults is also within your skillset."
400 CP,Peerless Eyes,TES: Dovah,"The eyes of mortals do more than see, and you have got some unique eyes of your own, capable of seeing past illusions in order to see reality for what it truly is. This is more than a metaphor, as illusions no longer affect you, be they visual, audial, or even scent or taste based. You are also immune to lesser forms of illusions, such as hypnosis."
400 CP,Eternal Corpse,TES: Alessian Rebellion,"Even though Mannimarco would be thought of as the first recorded lich, one who utilized necromancy to achieve eternal unlife, he was not the first to walk the path. Like many powerful sorcerers and Ayleid kings, you have managed to imbue yourself with death magicks to achieve a similar result, becoming as ageless as the stars themselves. You no longer possess any need to eat, drink, sleep, or even breathe, as well as requiring only your skeleton to be mostly intact to continue surviving. Additionally, you will find that all magicks related to the soul and its manipulation have been empowered, nearly three times as potent as before."
400 CP,Flesh Shaping,TES: Alessian Rebellion,"Many cruel Ayleid sorcerers, especially those who embraced the worship of the daedra, have created horrors beyond what most modern people could even conceive. Some of the worst involved the manipulation of their subject’s own flesh and blood. Their skills with biomancy could be used to heal grievous wounds, or keep their victims alive for nearly as long as they desire, much to the victim’s despair. They could even create horrific, chimeric monsters from the flesh of the dead as well as living. You are an expert with this type of magic, as well as possessing an in depth knowledge of human and elven biology."
400 CP,Blade of Harkon ,TES: Undead,"An akaviri katana once wielded by the head of the Volkihar Clan, Lord Harkon. The crossguard has been designed to resemble the face of Molag Bal. When used by a vampire, it will drink deeply of it's target's life force, draining away their vitality, stamina, and magicka in order to replenish your own. It also acts as an excellent catalyst for blood magicks, should you be proficient with them."
600 CP,King of Worms,TES: Undead,"Mannimarco is often credited as the first modern lich as we know them today, and is one of the most powerful mages to have existed. Much like him, you have reached the peak of necromancy. All undead you raise are much more powerful, durable, faster, and more intelligent than they otherwise would be. Additionally, there is no limit to how long your undead may be animated, nor how many you can control at any given time. With such power at your fingertips, it would be wise to fear you."
600 CP,Overtaken,TES: Undead,"It was your will that brought you back from the realm of the dead, your resolve that allows you to retain your free will. Not many possess the same amount of willpower, which is quite unfortunate for them. Why? Because you can now possess people and objects, controlling them and their actions as if it was yourself should their willpower be found lacking. You will retain full access to your abilities, and can access your vessel's memories. Why, you could even possess dragons, should you be powerful enough."
600 CP,Staff of Worms,TES: Undead,"The ebony staff once owned by the King of Worms, Mannimarco. Not only does it greatly empower any spells channeled through it, but it makes any of the undead you have risen far more physically capable than they otherwise would have been, easily the equivalent of ten others. Additionally, it allows you to perfectly see and hear through your undead’s eyes and ears, somehow."
600 CP,Portal ,TES: Undead,"With your newfound existence, a question must be asked. Now that you came back from the afterlife to the mortal realm, can you do the reverse? With this purchase, that answer is yes. You now own a portal into your chosen afterlife, be it the eternal feasts of Sovngarde, or even a Daedric Realm should you so desire. No inhabitants can cross over to your side without your express and willing permission, so that should ease some of your worries."
600 CP,Vampiric Castle,TES: Undead,"After many decades or even centuries of unlife, it is not uncommon for a vampire to gain their very own castle. You are one of those, owning your own dark castle perfectly fit for your vampiric self. In addition to all the amenities you’d expect from a castle, the windows block out the harmful effects of the sun, there are many replenishing barrels of blood in the basement, and there are dozens of gargoyles to protect the area from any invaders. There’s also an alter to Molag Bal, where he can communicate with you and vice versa, but that’s entirely optional."
600 CP,Vampire Lord,TES: Undead,"You are not some freshly turned fledgeling, but a proper Vampire Lord, one who has been around for centuries. No matter what bloodline you hail from, all of your vampiric abilities are at the very peak. No matter what, all will be able to shapeshift into two or three mundane animals, turn into mist, hypnotize others with a glance, possess flawless control over bats, and even a limited ability to alter the weather. In addition, all of your vampiric weaknesses have been heavily reduced, if not removed completely, and you are no longer weakened by the sun."
600 CP,Mysterium Xarxes:,Elder Scrolls: Oblivion,"Greetings, novitiate, and know first a reassurance: Mankar Camoran was once like you, asleep, unwise, protonymic. This book is your doorway to liberate yourselves from the trappings of Mundus. It is an artifact of great power. It is revolution, cutting, and change. Merely handling the book can be dangerous. One example of the power of this tome would be creating a personal plane of Oblivion to bring the souls of those that follow your teachings upon their deaths. It is also possible to remake one’s body through transformative powers of the tome, altering your race and even carrying the blood of kings. In less direct power, the teachings within allow one great understanding in how to sever magical covenants and overthrow empires, but it would be up to you to put that knowledge into practice."
600 CP,Large Island,TES: Dovah,"The island of Solstheim is a remote place, it has a long history of habitation by other races, but it has traditionally been primarily Nordic in influence. The southern half is relatively temperate, and houses the town of Raven Rock, as well as Fort Frostmoth. The northern half is more arctic in nature, with constant snow and large glaciers. In the center is a mighty temple, built around one of the six All-Maker Stones that dot the island. You are this island’s new master, with all who inhabit it bowing to your rule. Should you desire it, the southern half of the island may better resemble Morrowind, like it was after the eruption of Red Mountain."
600 CP,Unfeathered,TES: Alessian Rebellion,"Much like the demigod hero of the Ayleids, Umaril the Unfeathered, you possess a connection to the waters of Oblivion, similar in nature to that of a daedra. Due to this connection, death will come to hold little meaning to you. Once per year, you are capable of resurrecting yourself no matter how horrifically brutal your death was. You’ll simply reappear the next day in a flash of golden light. The only way to bypass this resurrective power of yours would be to strike directly at your soul, though few can boast such capabilities."
600 CP,Soul Cairn,TES: Undead,"Perhaps you made a deal with one of the Ideal Masters, or you conquered their territory for yourself. Regardless, you now claim ownership of a portion of the Soul Cairn, with all that entails. Not only will you receive a steady supply of souls for whatever purpose you desire, but it is also filled with powerful undead that will obey your every command, including three dragonbone-clad Keepers and a powerful entity known only as the Soul Reaper."
