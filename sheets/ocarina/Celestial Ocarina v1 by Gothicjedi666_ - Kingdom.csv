0 CP,Bound Blade,The Legend of Zelda Series ,"It seems as though a spirit has bound itself to one of your weapons. It is only a young one, barely having a personality, though depending on how you treat them and the type of weapon they are combined with. Should you use this on the [Master Sword], then the spirit will be Fi. Should you use this on the [Zubora Gabora], then the spirit will be Ghirahim."
0 CP,Cuddly Remlit ,The Legend of Zelda Series ,"A species of feline native to the floating land of Skyloft, few are as lovable as the remlits.

Do be sure not to wake them up at night, though, as they can get a bit grumpy."
0 CP,Intelligent Wolf,The Legend of Zelda Series ,"A strangely intelligent wolf, one bearing odd markings and a mantacle around his front leg. Still, he's big, fluffy, listens well to orders, and is absolutely viscous in a fight. Some nights, he can be heard howling a pleasant melody into the night sky."
0 CP,Graceful Loftwing,The Legend of Zelda Series ,"A relic from the Age of the Sky, the loftwings have long since gone extinct. Strange, then, how you have come into possession of one. Being of a color of your choosing, this massive bird is your trusted mount, carrying you into the heavens above at ludicrous speeds, faster than even you, regardless of how swift you may become in the future."
0 CP,Twilight Princess ,The Legend of Zelda Series ,"An imp claiming to be a cursed princess, few are quite as sassy as she is. She seems to think you're the key to something she won't speak about for now, but is willing to help you out for now, so long as you can help her out. She's usually hiding as part of your shadow, the light of this world not quite agreeing with her, though can deal with it if the need arises."
100 CP,Fairy Follower,The Legend of Zelda - Ocarina of Time,"A small fairy, the kind that usually follows the Kokiri, has become your new friend! This small creature isn’t much physically, but she’s a great source of counsel, and what’s more, when she “targets” someone by circling them, you’ll find it much easier to hone in and focus on them as a foe."
100 CP,Cozy Home ,The Legend of Zelda Series ,"Everyone needs a place to call home, where they can rest their laurels and relax after a hard day’s work. You now find yourself the owner of a decently sized home, with four bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a fully stocked kitchen. It is already furnished, and all yours to do with as you see fit."
100 CP,Comfy Campsite,Breathless Wild Jumpchain Version 1.0,"Camping out is all fun and games until you get ambushed by a pack of stalfos in the middle of the night. You’re not going to get much sleep unless you can find a safe place to make camp, but this item can help with that. It’s a simple campfire which you can make out of any random bits of firewood, and while it only lasts a single night per use it’s guaranteed to ward off unfriendly monsters, people, or obnoxious animals and insects from finding and bothering your campsite, allowing you and any travelling companions who might be accompanying you to have stress-free and pleasurable evenings no matter where you are."
100 CP,Faithful Steed,Breathless Wild Jumpchain Version 1.0,"Hyrule is far too vast to travel across it on foot. Real travellers know to acquire the company of a horse to get them from place to place, and you will find no finer steed than this one.

Your equine ally is brave, loyal, and highly intelligent as horses go, as well as well-trained and accustomed to the chaos of battle should you require their services as a warhorse. Simply whistling for your companion will call them, to your side immediately, as if they had been waiting for you somewhere just out of sight even if you last left them many miles away."
100 CP,Monster Lair,Breathless Wild Jumpchain Version 1.0,"Even monsters need a place to live, though most are willing to camp out in caves and under giant skulls. You’ve managed to secure a much more heavily fortified location, more akin to the Yiga clan’s hidden lair than some random campsite. This hidden base is large and well-defended by the surrounding terrain, making it difficult enough for your enemies to find it and even harder to bring a large force to attack it. It’s very cozy inside, perfect not only for escaping the elements but also for imprisoning captives, as it has a small built-in dungeon with enough restraints to keep a fair number of captives securely imprisoned.
"
200 CP,Apple Orchard,The Legend of Zelda - A Link To The Past Jumpchain,"When all was said and done, two versions of Link chose to leave the land of Hyrule in an attempt to protect the Triforce from any more would-be thieves. The other two stayed with Princess Zelda, and of those two, only one remained a knight. The other one went back to the life he had before hearing her voice in his head, that of an apple farmer. You now have a small plot of land containing a small home fit for two, and of course a decently sized orchard of apples. Said trees will grow into delicious fruits with the bare minimum of care, and if you take great pains to give them the best you can give, they will
occasionally pop out an enchanted apple, capable of healing any injury short of death."
200 CP,Sanctuary,The Legend of Zelda - A Link To The Past Jumpchain,"And this is where the passageway that Zelda told Link about led. A small church to the north of the Royal Castle, tended to by one of the Sages. More importantly, it had enough magical barriers that not even Agahnim’s new army could break through. He had to sneak in through an undefended entrance in order to get in. You might want to be careful to close that behind you by the way. But I digress - when your castle is taken, your home in flames, and as your other safe haven's fall, the barriers on this place will grow ever stronger. When you have nowhere else to go, when all else fails, you can always come here to take sanctuary."
200 CP,Biggoron Forge ,The Legend of Zelda Series ,"The goron are famous smiths, due in part to their resistance to the heat needed for the process.

They will protect you from any weather, and the inside is extremely comfortable to be in regardless of the environment outside."
300 CP,Master Cycle Zero,The Legend of Zelda - The Breathe Of The Wild,"The true mount of a hero, Master Cycle Zero is a motorcycle, constructed out of Sheikah technology. It can be summoned via the Sheikah Slate, or, if you didn’t purchase that, you’ll get a small flat “rune-slate” that can be used to summon it instead. Unlike the Master Cycle Zero earned in the game, this version does not require Fuel, or rather, Fuel merely helps increase its speed. Without fuel, it moves at the speed of a fast trot, as more fuel is added, it can achieve higher and higher speeds. Care must be taken when fighting on the Master Cycle Zero, otherwise, you may fall off."
400 CP,Dungeon,The Legend of Zelda Series ,"You can find innumerable structures dotting the landscape, temples and ruins just waiting to be plundered and explored.

Should you manage to clear it out, then it will replenish itself within a month, even changing the layout within should you wish for something new."
400 CP,Kokiri Woods,The Legend of Zelda Series ," [400]: The emerald green trees, rivers of clear blue, black dirt filled with
nutrients, and the sounds of childish laughter drifting in the wind. Attached to your
Warehouse is an absolutely massive forest, filled with all kinds of life that can be found
in these lands, both flora and fauna, deku scrubs and fairies. And to protect it, the outer
reaches of the forest have been enchanted to confuse and distract anyone you don’t
want within, making them incomprehensibly lost before finding their way directly outside
of your forest."

The royal bedchambers are the absolute peak of luxury, fit for a king. It will come with its own staff and guards, the demographics of such up to you to decide."
400 CP,Floating Island ,The Legend of Zelda Series ,"Look to the skies, and tell me what you see. If you see a floating mass of rock, then congratulations. You are now the proud owner of a floating island, around the same size as Manhattan. It has lush plant life, and a never ending pool of clear water. It’s actually quite difficult to see from the ground, almost invisible, though those flying through the air will see it clearly. What use for this, only you can say, but it is a wondrous thing, a home in the sky, is it not?"
400 CP,Trial Shrine ,The Legend of Zelda Series ,"The ancient sheikah created numerous trial shrines all across Hyrule, meant to test the future incarnations of the Hero. You now possess one of your own, a hidden complex made just for you.

Over time, you may even find new layouts added to your collection, ensuring that your training won’t go dull."
400 CP,Mirror of Twilight,The Legend of Zelda Series ,"A massive mirror, easily as wide as a zora is tall.

You will even find a number of fairies have made themselves at home here, willing to obey the master of the fountain."
400 CP,Ancient Factory,The Legend of Zelda Series ,"How strange, it is, to think that the past was so much more advanced than the present, perhaps even the future as well. Now, though, you have yourself a sliver of that glorious past, one where the Thunder Dragon Lanayru spurned on innovation and creation. A massive factory complex that is connected to your Warehouse, it can be used to manufacture just about any technology you desire, though the higher quality the longer the process will take. Will you craft weapons not seen in millenia, or perhaps revive an ancient race of robots, or some other purpose that comes to your mind? Either way, you won’t ever have to worry about the materials, seeing as the factory will supply those on its own."
400 CP,Serene Arena,The Legend of Zelda Series ,"A replica of where the Demon King Demise was sealed away, a seemingly endless realm where there is only the water below, and the cloudy sky above. Should you so desire, you can set up challenges with others to take place within, be they any current enemies or summoned copies of those you've fought in the past.

600 CP,Sanctuary,The Legend of Zelda - Ocarina of Time,"There are things that need to be protected - and places where you must retreat in the event your enemies are surrounding you. This can take the form of a themed sanctum similar to that of the Fire, Water or Forest temple or a steadfast keep such as Hyrule Castle if you so wish. Either way, it will be difficult for all but the most intelligent and capable of people to infiltrate these places without dying - as you can determine they are patrolled by loyal minions in approximate effectiveness as Hyrule’s castle guards with traps and security measures appropriate to how they manifest!"
600 CP,Gate of Time,The Legend of Zelda Series ,"A magical gate that is potentially older than even the Goddess Hylia herself, shaped like a massive gear with arcane sigils adorning it. This will allow you to travel through the currents of time, from present to past, up to a thousand years, in all worlds you visit. The future, for some reason, seems to be blocked from you. Actions taken in the past will not overtly affect the present, not where it truly matters."
800 CP,Hyrule,The Legend of Zelda Series ,"There is so much beauty to witness and many mysteries to uncover within this land, so much that it's unclear if you'll be able to see all of it within just ten years. But what if you didn't have to leave, instead bringing the whole of Hyrule with you? From the Kokiri Forest to Death Mountain, from the Gerudo Desert to Zora's Domain, you can take all of it with you, the civilised inhabitants of the land seeing you as their newest ruler, pledging their eternal loyalty to you. This land will be bigger than what you may have previously thought, but that just means that there's so much more to explore."

This moon is now yours to do with as you see fit, able to be summoned into the atmosphere whenever you wish, greatly enhancing any lunar related abilities you may have, and sent hurtling towards the planet below. Within the moon, however, is a pocket dimension, an endless field of grass and trees, a peaceful place. Simply being here will alleviate any stresses, worries, or mental issues a person may have in an afternoon. The demonic face is optional."
