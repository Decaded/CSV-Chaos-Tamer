0 CP,Basic Magic ,The Legend of Zelda Series ,"Magic is a wonderful force, but everyone needs to start somewhere. You know how to channel magic at a very basic level. Perhaps you could cover the edge of your weapon, making its range longer and dealing more damage. You could also improve any racial attributes with this, such as a goron creating temporary spikes while in a ball and rolling. This is only the basic stuff, but it's more than enough to work with, if you're clever."
100 CP,Profit Making ,The Legend of Zelda Series ,"There's nothing more satisfying than the sound of clinking rupees at the end of a hard day's work, so how fortunate you are that you've got the skills to make a lot? For a skilled merchant such as yourself, you could probably sell sand to a person in the desert, all for a fairly decent price. Honestly, it would be shorter to make a list of the ways you couldn't make money."
100 CP,Evil Eyes,The Legend of Zelda Series ,"When others look into your eyes, what do they see? Apparently, something they really don't want to mess with.

100 CP,Great Might ,The Legend of Zelda Series ,"Power can come in many forms, though the most popular would be through pure brute strength, something you have in spades. You are an exceedingly strong person, capable of lifting three times more than you could before, and striking with that much force would leave most dead or severely wounded."
100 CP,Stone Body,The Legend of Zelda Series ,"Few are as sturdy as a goron, and for good reason. For a race that needs to eat stones to survive, they need to be just as tough. Not only are you just as durable as stone, from your skin to bones to organs, you are also highly resistant to heat and fire. It wouldn't be too outlandish for you to take a nice relaxing bath in a pool of lava."
100 CP,Malice ,The Legend of Zelda Series ,"All monsters are imbued with a fraction of a sliver of the malice of the original Demon King, Demise. Such hatred is built into them on a fundamental level. Due to this malicious connection, you are capable of sensing nearby negative emotions, and even determining which emotions they are exactly. This can, of course, be toggled on and off at will."
100 CP,Master Ore,The Legend of Zelda Series ,"Perhaps the rarest material in the land, it is from this metal that gave birth to the Master Sword.

You will receive twenty of these stones each week."
100 CP,Treasury,The Legend of Zelda Series ,"Rupees are quite a strange currency, being small gems rather than coins or bills. But hey, you certainly aren't going to be complaining, what with how much you've got now. You now have over a thousand rupees, more than enough to live luxuriously for a few weeks. And don't worry about running out in the long run, as they will replenish monthly. Just don't spend it all in one place, yeah?"

200 CP,Curse Your Name,The Legend of Zelda Series ,"It all started with a curse, with a demon condemning the spirit of the Hero and the blood of the Goddess.

200 CP,Silver Tongue,The Legend of Zelda Series ,"Power is not just found in might, but in connections as well, regardless of if they’re legitimate or faked.

200 CP,Unfettered Might ,Out of Context Triforce Supplement,"You are incredibly powerful in terms of your raw physique, more than able to match a skilled hero in a direct, one on one fight.

You even gain some power when you defeat foes!"

A dragon imbued with lightning would electrocute any who dared get close, while possessing the ability to generate thunderstorms.

400 CP,Might and Magic,The Legend of Zelda Series ,"Magic is a powerful force, and the body is willing, so why not combine the two into one?

You are wickedly, frighteningly creative with it, as well, able to use magic to seize all sorts of opportunities."
500 CP,Monstrous Durability,The Legend of Zelda Series ,"What use is strength when the body is not fit to handle it? Your durability is, quite frankly, utterly ridiculous. You can easily withstand an entire castle falling on top of you, and could even survive being stabbed in the face. The only way you’re going to be put down is through means specifically designed for you, or with an ungodly amount of punishment."
600 CP,Blessing of Din,The Legend of Zelda Series ,"You have been blessed by the Goddess of Power, Din, her red mark now on the back of your hand.

600 CP,Zubora Gabora ,The Legend of Zelda Series ,"A demonic greatsword, once owned by the Demon King Demise, a dark mirror to the Master Sword in every way. Its ebony metal can cut through steel with ease, fire off beams of dark energy that are just as sharp as the blade itself, leaves devastating wounds that are nigh-impossible to heal, interact with spiritual entities like poes, and is practically indestructible. Perhaps, with time, you could awaken the slumbering spirit within."
600 CP,Majora's Mask,The Legend of Zelda Series ,"A cursed mask, one that comes from a doomed world and once inhabited by an evil spirit. Although, it seems as though the spirit within is long gone, yet retains all of its abilities. Curious, but also useful. While wearing this mask, you will find the power of all your magics greatly enhanced at a significantly reduced cost, especially those of curses and magic considered dark or evil. Additionally, it gives the wearer the power of telekinesis, enough to throw a goron around with contemptuous ease."
