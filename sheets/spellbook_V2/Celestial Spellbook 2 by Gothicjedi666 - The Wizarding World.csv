He’s not exactly the most pleasant sort and depending on when you arrive, he’ll probably be quite indisposed. But regardless, despite how unpleasant he might be, there are quite a few things you could stand to learn from him. In this case, you’ve learned how to cultivate a reputation for yourself. Your endeavors seem to take on a life of their own, spreading throughout entire communities like Fiendfyre. Even more than that, tales of your deeds become almost exaggerated, such that, depending on what exactly you’ve done, they will praise your name or shun it to an almost unnatural degree for the sheer terror and awe it reminds them of. Just make sure you can live up to it, alright?"
100 CP,"Muggles Don’t See Nothing, Do They?",The Wizarding World Jump,"Hiding your magic from Muggles can sometimes be a difficult task, especially when they can be more perceptive than you might think. But for you, and with this, keeping your magic secret won’t be that big of a problem. In your presence, Muggles always seem to rationalize or even ignore minor uses of magic. For example, floating small objects or creating a bit of fire and light will be thought of as a clever use of strings and Muggle technology such as lighters and the like. Of course, this isn’t going to be quite as effective if you try and perform greater feats of magic such as setting an entire forest ablaze with nothing more than a stick in your hands. In that case, you better have one handy-dandy explanation ready for them."

"
100 CP,Magical Cleanliness ,The Other Harry Potter Fanfic Jump,"The wizarding world’s culture and technology resembles a hodgepodge of time periods ranging from the medieval to the victorian with a few smatterings of modernity here and there.

100 CP,The Family Watch,Wizarding World Jump,"It is a tradition amongst witches and wizards that they be given a watch when they come of age at seventeen years old. And while you may not be of this world, that does not mean that you cannot partake in its traditions and culture. Perhaps that is why you have this ornate and fanciful golden pocket watch, something you might consider as a gift from your benefactor, whoever they may be. And as always, this watch of yours is far from ordinary. You see, unlike a regular watch, this watch is not meant to tell the time and its hands represent neither the minute nor the hour. Rather, each hand is meant a representation of you and your trusted Companions. Like a certain redheaded family’s clock, the numbers on it have been changed to locations such as “home”, “school”, “work”, “prison”, “lost”, “mortal peril”, and many more. So long as this watch is by your side, you will always be aware of where your Companions might be and if they would be in need of your help.

Regardless of the language, you can pick it up very well, enough that you could learn the basics of a language by the end of a day and speak it fluently by the week’s end. If you do this right, you could even gain a bit of respect from the notoriously stingy Goblins of Gringotts."
100 CP,Curse of Defense,Wizarding World Jump,"The post of Defense Against the Dark Arts within Hogwarts is said to be cursed and judging by the long, long line of teachers and professors being ousted from the position year after year, there is probably some merit to such a thing. But fortunately for you, that shouldn’t be too much of a problem. You see, unlike those poor folks, you’re quite good at keeping your job. Now, so long as you actually do your job properly, you will never get ousted from your position due to circumstances beyond your control. Hey, maybe you should apply for Hogwarts. They’re always looking for DADA teachers."
100 CP,House Elf,World of Lewd Witchcraft,"This submissive little thing is a beautiful house elf (with an appearance far more in line with traditional fantasy media’s depictions of elves than the way that house elves look in Harry Potter) with a masochistic streak. She is your house elf, acquired either by your family before the jump begins and given to you as a personal servant or acquired sometime early on in your jump.

As mentioned before, it is rather rare but fortunately for you, you are a Metamorphmagus now. The extent of your new abilities allows you to mimic the size and shape of just about anyone, be they someone as beautiful as the lovely Veela or someone as grizzled and battle-damaged as one Mad-Eye Moody. In fact, you already have enough skill that you can even form parts of your body to things that are not entirely human, things such as a duck’s bill for a mouth, just as an example. With a bit more creativity, who knows what you could do in the future?"
200 CP,Emancipated Minor ,The Other Harry Potter Fanfic Jump,"A number of Fanfics have Harry, either through his own actions or as a side effect of some other thing that happened in the fic, becoming legally recognized as an adult with all attendant rights and responsibilities.

200 CP,Made to Last ,The Other Harry Potter Fanfic Jump,"Something about the ambient magic around Hogwarts, and only Hogwarts in canon for some reason, futzes with electronics but you’ll never notice as ‘anti-technology’ effects never seem to apply to your possessions. Likewise, magic items in your
possession seem to shrug off anti-magic."

But more importantly, what you have now are the instructions to create your very own Floo Network. With this, you have the choice of adding the new locations to your already existing network or creating a new one separate from those before it. You won’t even need a fireplace.

200 CP ,The Tower ,Generic Harry Potter Fanfiction,"​Research and advanced work, be it on science or magic, is best done in a dedicated space. And there are few such spaces better than this one. This is a Wizard’s Tower, hidden far away from prying eyes, and holds just about anything you might need to play the ‘Hermit Scholar’ and play it well. To begin with, it has every single book in any kind of public circulation in the world. Nothing that is limited to private libraries or that only exists as one of a kind or part of a small collection, but anything that was ever available to be bought on the open market and/or was somehow brought into the public domain. More than that, it has a huge supply of potion ingredients, wand woods and cores, ritual ingredients, metals and stones for enchantments, blood and parts from exotic creatures, and everything else you need to properly work on advancing whatever fields of magic you choose to work in. The quantity of the things you have here, the knowledge and the materials, all depend on how rare or common they are in the world, but they restock every six months. However, you don’t get anything that is truly only one or few of a kind here. Needless to say, you get the same in all future worlds."
400 CP,Inner Eye,The Wizarding World Jump,"Magic blesses witches and wizards in different ways. Some are blessed with great skill in varying subjects, from Transfiguration to Charms and more. Others receive more unique talents such as the Metamorphagi or the ability to speak the language the snakes. And with this, it seems that magic has blessed you with the ability to see into the future. Magic has made you a Seer. For now, as a Seer, your only visions of the future come during trances, periods of time wherein you slip into a fugue state and speak out your prophecies in a different voice than normal. Unlike a certain other Seer however, you have the ability to go into these trances on purpose but even still, you will have only a foggy recollection of your visions and prophecies. Over time however, with the more practice and experience you have with this newfound magic of yours, you will come to possess greater control. In time, your predictions shall be made far clearer, more precise. In time, they will no longer be prophecies but visions.

400 CP,Ancient Magic ,The Wizarding World Jump,"Magic is much like knowledge. Over the years, it is only natural for magic to become lost to the sands of time, to never again be learnt by the likes of ordinary witches and wizards. But you, you are certainly the farthest possible from ordinary. Like few others before you, the potential to manipulate ancient magic is now within your grasp. With it, you will soon be capable of magic beyond the pale. Bringing forth rain and life to an entire valley suffering from the harshest drought shall be the least of what you can do. But the keyword here is potential. In this budding state of yours, all you can do for now is simply the detection of traces of ancient magic and then use said magic to perform devastating attacks against your foes. And though your newfound abilities have bolstered even the growth of what others may call regular magic, that is not even close to where your limits lie. To truly reach your new limits, you must find ways to learn, people to teach you, and records to study. Do not think that this shall be an easy task. Depending on when you begin your journey, it could be centuries since ancient magic was last wielded."
400 CP,Wandless Magic,Hogwarts Legacy,"You have the ability to cast any spell you know without a wand. Spells cast this way will be generally weaker and less controlled than they would be with a proper focus, but this ability ensures that you are at far less risk if you are disarmed. However, this can function as a training aid, as, if you practice casting spells wandlessly and improve their performance, you’ll find those spells have a distinct boost when performed with an actual wand. "
400 CP,Ancient Ruins ,Hogwarts Legacy,"A large and sprawling ruin that is hidden from view from anyone other than you and those you bring with you. The ruin is filled with a variety of examples of forgotten magics and enchantments, as well as various rare and ancient texts scattered throughout it. In each new world you visit, the ruins will update with new examples and new ancient texts, as well as updating its structure to match ancient ruins from the new world."
400 CP,Unbound Potential,The Other Harry Potter Fanfic Jump,"Relating to the above bit of fanon is the idea of someone, usually  the “Manipulative Headbastard,” placing ‘blocks’ or ‘limiters’ on Harry’s magical core for some inexplicable reason because biggatons are the only way some fic authors can think of to make Harry ‘better’ than canon. Regardless, that’s not something you’ll ever have to deal with, as you are categorically immune to any and all attempts to bind, restrict, suppress, drain, steal, or damage any aspects of your power or energy."
400 CP,Jumper Manor,The Other Harry Potter Fanfic Jump,"What we have here is a luxurious sprawling estate with many acres of land and housing and accommodations that would make a jaded out-of-touch billionaire immediately pauperize themselves to try and fail to buy a home better than yours. All the utilities are handled by magic and the kitchens are always perfectly stocked, magical constructs serve the roles of servants, and you effectively have arbitrary room for guests. The manor home proper has whatever luxuries you could possibly want, and it will magically update itself so that no matter what it will always at least make Malfoy Manor or homes owned/inhabited by similar characters look like a run-down one-room hovel next to the city dump, though obviously it’ll never downgrade."
400 CP,Coffee Shop,The Other Harry Potter Fanfic Jump,"Or a tea house, that general idea. A cozy little place, themed however you want, where people can purchase hot drinks and baked goods and just hang out for a while. It’s always conveniently located even if it makes no sense and no one will question it. Business is always good, thanks to the competent NPC staff, and as the owner you have access to a modest income from it as well as a comfortable set of seats around a permanently reserved table for you and your friends to always have a private chat.

This ship is self propelled and can travel underwater protecting its inhabitants with a protective bubble, and though magical means it can teleport from one large enough body of water to another almost instantly. Thanks to a few modifications this ship can also fly and its bubble can protect the ship from the void of space but would require further alterations to travel faster than light. The expanded space inside of the ship is large enough to have about a thousand people aboard it and keep them in luxurious comfort indefinitely, it is set up like a cruise ship but doesn't need any staff, it is self-cleaning, self-repairing and self-steering.

600 CP,World Walker ,Generic Harry Potter Fanfiction,"You have an affinity for spellwork that has to do with long distance magic, such as transporting people or things, even things like words or messages. Not only are you one of the finest experts in apparition in the world, being an absolute genius at every variation and technique that exists, you’re also capable of extremely fast flight without a broom, which has the curious effect of enveloping you in thick clouds of any colour you like. Apart from this, you’re extraordinary at creating things like Portkeys, Vanishing cabinets or Portals, being able to create Portkeys that can move people as gently as a mother’s touch, and portals that move people around without them even noticing it until it’s too late. Summoning and Banishing spells are trifling to you, even the most powerful or complex ones. You have a considerable aptitude for penetrating wards and defenses when building these things, so much so that with even rudimentary information about the protections on a place, you can figure out how to circumvent them, and with a bit more work you could bring them down outright.

600 CP ,Personal Island,Generic Harry Potter Fanfiction,"​Ah, yes. This has grown somewhat popular lately, I’ll admit. This is a private island of your very own, raised from the sea-floor, or created through a volcanic eruption, or whatever other means you want, that’s not important. What’s important is that this island is linked directly to your magical core. Simply put, its size is directly proportional to how much magic you pour into it. As you put in more magic, you can literally see new land forming at the edges, ready to be moulded to your will. While it won’t shrink once enlarged unless you want it to, you have the ability to control virtually everything about this place, including its shape, flora and even the weather. This island is roughly half the size of Ireland to begin with, and can expand quite a lot, dependant solely on your power. At about Australia, though, the efficiency takes a sharp dive, to the extent it takes over five times the power to increase it any further, and this only rises from here. The effects of this island on the climate of the world are negated with the same magic that constitutes it, so no need to worry about that. Comes with rudimentary Notice-me-not charms all over it, but they won’t stand up to any concerted efforts unless you boost them. Speaking of which, this island is very receptive of any protection or secrecy magic, to the extent that all such efforts yield twice the expected results."
