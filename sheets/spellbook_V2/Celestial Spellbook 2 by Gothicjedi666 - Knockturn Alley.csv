In addition, you are able to switch off your morality, for when you have no choice but to go through with those aforementioned acts that you wouldn’t be able to stomach otherwise.

Though the Salazar within this painting is only a representation of the wizard himself, personality-wise he’s identical to the original. Whilst he doesn’t have any of the original Salazar’s magical knowledge or skills and is thus unable to tutor you in magic, this painting is very old indeed and has thus seen many ages pass by. Surely, having lived such a long life, even if merely as a painting, there is wisdom to be found in his counsel?"

Naturally this also extends on how to care for them in general, it would not do to finally breed your own basilisk only to then have it die in a fiery inferno because you mistakenly believed a basilisk to be fireproof, for example.
