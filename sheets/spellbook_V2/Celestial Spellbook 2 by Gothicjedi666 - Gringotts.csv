It will only open itself for you and those you explicitly tell it to allow access."
200 CP,Philosopher’s Stone ,The Other Harry Potter Fanfic Jump,"You could have made this on your own, but maybe you don’t have the patience, or you’d like a sample to reverse engineer, or you’d just prefer the security of a fiat-backed item that’ll make its way back to your warehouse if lost or stolen. Anyway, the philosopher's stone is an artifact that allows one to translate base metals into pure gold and that produces the elixir of life, a potion that restores the drinkers to their full strength and can make them immortal if consumed regularly and continuously. Supplemental materials likewise imply that it will increase your power and skill in regard to alchemy and its component disciplines. Now the prequel films seem to imply that the elixir merely slows aging rather than stopping it or restoring youth but plenty of fanfics predate that reveal and do depict it deaging you to the prime of your youth so this version does."
200 CP,Crown of Mneme ,Wizarding World Jumpchain,"You may have heard of the Deathly Hallows, objects of such power that wizards and witches have killed to obtain them for centuries. If so, you probably aren’t surprised to learn that there are more artifacts of great power to be found in this world, even if they aren’t as mighty as the Deathly Hallows. Created by Dai Ryusaki, a professor of Mahoutokoro, many centuries ago, the Crown of Mneme can be considered a Legilimen’s best friend. Even a novice in the mental arts will find themselves possessing considerable skill in Legilimency once this crown rests on their head. Originally intended as a medical device of sorts, the Crown of Mneme will do more than bolster your skill in Legilimency. With this crown, masters of Legilimency will even be able to recreate one of the Unforgivable Curses, being fully capable of controlling the weak-minded so long as they focus."
200 CP,Ryusaki’s Amulet ,Wizarding World Jumpchain,"Apparently, Dai Ryusaki was not content with simply creating one magnificent artifact that could stand the test of time. In truth, this amulet was not purposefully made. Rather, in the throes of his final moments, Ryusaki cursed it, infusing with all the rage and hate burning in his soul, forever turning the once bright and beautiful amulet into a thing of darkness. While wearing the amulet, you will find it slightly easier to use abilities of a darker nature but you will quickly find that is not where its true power lies. For you see, this amulet shows its true colors when worn by another, one that might not be so inclined to the Dark Arts. When worn by another, the curse upon the amulet shall make itself known. Within moments, it shall begin to influence the wearer’s mind. Day by day, the wearer’s will shall be tested and they will find themselves more and more willing to use the Dark Arts. And when their path towards the Dark is complete, the amulet shall leave their clutches and find its way back to you. And the best part? Unless they know about the amulet’s curse, they’ll never even notice that they’ve found themselves on a darker path. Like moths to a flame, or clay to be molded, by you."
200 CP,Skull-Hookah ,Wizarding World Jumpchain,"While Dark relics don’t necessarily need to look the part, like the one above for example, this one certainly does. Bearing a heavy resemblance to the skull-hookah Gellert Grindelwald once possessed, this aged and yellowed skull has been emblazoned with engravings and markings of symbols of the Dark Arts and of your own. And much like Grindelwald’s own, you can use this skull to project the visions within your mind over a vast area, large enough to encompass a colosseum. Useful if you need to impress the masses or perhaps convince them of the righteousness of your cause. However, the skull has one more fascinating ability to it. If it is broken, either by your hands or that of another, the magic within the skull shall rush into the next spell you cast. In doing so, the might of this spell shall be massively improved. A fire that burns down a house, for example, will become one that shall burn down a town. Once broken, you will receive a new one at the start of the next week."

Unlike the repositories that the Keepers guard, this repository is not tainted with negative emotions, but is instead a source of pure magic. It is possible for you to draw out this magic to empower yourself or link it into enchantments and wards to greatly empower them, even if you don't have the ability to see Ancient Magic natively. With such a power, you could use this power even more precisely. The energy within the repository will regenerate over time if used."

400 CP,Deluminator,Wizarding World Jumpchain,"Now just how did you get your hands on this? This little thing, resembling a rather fancy cigarette lighter, is the Deluminator and it is the proud creation of one Albus Dumbledore, quite possibly the greatest wizard of the modern age. Fittingly enough, this device is quite powerful indeed. At the most basic level, the Deluminator can take away and put back light from any source, whether it be technological or magical. Second, whenever your name is mentioned in a conversation, the Deluminator will play back a snippet of the conversation to you. Activate the Deluminator at this point and you will safely be apparated into location, enough to ensure that you may never be separated from your friends again. Finally, there is the Deluminator’s most powerful ability. With this, you may transport yourself and others into a mirror dimension of sorts. Within this world, you may battle to your heart’s content, with no risk to the people and the world beyond. Albus Dumbledore truly was a genius if he could make something like this. Why not follow in his footsteps, at least in this regard?"

Clad yourself in this armor and witness for yourself just how mighty a goblin can be. Forged from goblin silver, this magnificent set of armor has been enhanced with magic beyond what goblins are ordinarily capable of. You see, by channeling your own magic through the armor like you would with a wand, the silver shall glow a malevolent red as the corrupted ancient magic within come to life. Not only will you have a hefty resistance against most spells, almost equal to what a proper Shield Charm can provide, but so long as you continue to channel your magic through the armor, you will have a vast array of newfound abilities to use against your foes."
400 CP,Property-Mover,Partially Kissed Hero,"A simple, staff-like device, this has a hemispherical cavity at one end, and is covered with runes and powerful spells. By touching the cavity to the ground in any place you own, be it through jump-fiat or acquired in-jump, you can shrink the property into a snow-globe sized, portable form, which you can then move freely. To place it back on the ground in its full size, you need to just put the globe back in the cavity and touch it to the ground in any area of sufficient size. Examples of property moved are greenhouses, manors, castles, farms and chunks of forest, up to and including mines and lakes."

It is said that it contains all kinds of magical powers, but that it will only allow itself to be used by those who speak the serpent’s tongue. Should you be capable of such, then the locket will reveal its true power to you. It will allow you to imbue it with a small part of your soul. This ensures that should you somehow shuffle off this mortal coil someone will pick up the locket and be compelled to bring you back to life through a profane ritual within the next few weeks.

Even if nobility isn’t recognized in that nation. Not only that, you get multiple votes. How many? Enough to be a considerable power block by yourself but not enough to be a decisive majority.

600 CP,Hufflepuff's Cup ,Harry Potter Movie Series,"This small golden badger engraved cup was enchanted by Helga Hufflepuff to be an internally isolated space and perform a permanent transmutation. This method of transmutation allows you to convert any liquid into any other type of liquid, even those that don't exist in-universe and thereby surpass Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfiguration. Through this you could convert water into blood, vinegar, wine and even liquid gold with none of it sticking to the inside when poured out. Once a liquid has left the cup the magic keeping it in liquid state will end and may cause an exothermic or endothermic reaction. In Jump this can become an independent copy or it can replace Voldemort's Horcrux, destroying it and either appearing in its place or in your possession."
600 CP,Rowena Ravenclaw's Diadem,Harry Potter Movie Series,"This diadem is often said to enhance the wisdom of its wearer, however in truth it does far more than that. While being worn the diadem clears the user’s mind of all distractions, allowing them clarity of thought, and increases their perception of events, allowing them longer to think in the same span of time. The diadem also grants the user a form of photographic memory which allows them to call up anything they have ever known and retain any knowledge they gain whilst wearing the diadem perfectly once it has been removed. In Jump this can become an independent copy or it can replace Voldemort's Horcrux, destroying it and either appearing in its place or in your possession."

You have truly earned the loyalty of this wand, and so it will take no other master. In Jump this can become an independent copy or it can replace the Elder Wand, absorbing it and either appearing in its place or in your possession."
