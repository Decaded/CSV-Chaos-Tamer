Filled with what seems to be molten silver, the flask and the liquid within are nevertheless cool to the touch. More importantly, the liquid is enchanted in a rather special way. By pouring the liquid over a lost limb, be it an arm or a leg, the silver shall take on the shape of said appendage, replacing it with something greater. And don’t be afraid of running out. The flask itself always fills back up at the end of the day.

"
200 CP,Perils of Polyjuice,Wizarding World Jump,"Ah, the folly of youth. It is the time when people are most foolhardy, believing themselves to be far more prepared to face the world than they truly are. And more often than not, such youths are proven wrong, sometimes with very disastrous results. Few folks exemplify the foolishness of youth more than Maddalyn Magier, a young and beautiful lass with a penchant for potions. As a precocious child, Maddalyn had always been fascinated with the subtle science and exact art that is potion-making. And so, like many a reckless youth, before she even went to school, she sought to experiment. With Polyjuice. You know where this is going. Already time-consuming and complex, Maddalyn created a modified version of Polyjuice, one that was meant to allow the drinker to transform into an animal. It did not work. Instead of transforming her into an animal temporarily, like an Animagus, the potion changed her body entirely. But how has it changed her? Well, for one thing, given that rather than using mundane animal bits for her potion, she instead used the crushed remains of a Horned Serpent’s jewel. And so, she’s grown four horns on the sides and top of her head along with a few patches of scales all across her body. Not that it detracts from her beauty in any way. It actually makes her look quite exotic. But more than that, her potions experiment has bestowed upon her a few unique abilities, ones that others would be more than happy to kill for. Like the stories told about Horned Serpents, she possesses the ability to turn herself invisible in a manner most reminiscent of the basic Disillusionment Charm, but most uniquely, she possesses the power of flight. Like the Pegasus of myth, Maddalyn can soar through the skies with her own power, unassisted by things such as brooms, charms, or even wings. And despite all the changes to her body and all the discrimination now rallied against her, she does not seem to mind. She remains the same aloof yet confident girl she’s ever been. After all, she simply sees this transformation of hers as proof that magic has taken a liking to her. To further prove this hypothesis of hers, she has taken to focusing on improving her skills as a potioneer, devising more potions to further modify her body. So far, she hasn’t really had much success in her endeavors, aside from finding a few shortcuts on more common potions like the Edurus potion and the Thunderbrew. But she’s confident that she’ll be able to make her mark in history as the greatest Potions Master in history. Perhaps you canhelp her with that, either as her partner or just as someone to keep her from delving too deep into her experiments. She is rather reckless after all."

Or perhaps in your case, merely someone who has a foot in both worlds. Whether it be magical or mundane, you have a natural talent for discovering or implementing new shortcuts or innovations into them. You could discover shortcuts for making potions, better ways to cast spells, or, in terms of craftsmanship, realize the potential of materials gone unnoticed by many.

Don’t be stingy like the original Half-Blood Prince."

And now, the titular hopping pot has come to follow you around, hopping behind you on every step of your journey. But what can the pot do for you? For starters, unlike the pot in the story, this one can, all by itself, create a wonderful variety of potions for you, each one brewed as if a master of potions made it themselves. You won’t even need to provide the ingredients. The pot can make it all! Well, almost all of it. Potions such as the Potion of All Potential and its like are beyond even its extraordinary capabilities and it can’t really speed up the process of potion-making as much as you’d want it to. On a final note, it seems that the pot has a rather mischievous bent to it. It has a rather peculiar habit of trying to get you to help out others, much like it once did to a young boy. Unlike that young boy however, the pot won’t punish you for refusing to help. On the other hand, if you do help others, the potions the pot brews shall become better, the extent of which is determined on how often you choose to help those less fortunate than you."

A pity you can’t add to them, eh? Well, now you can. With this perk, you’re among the absolute greatest enchanters, potioneers, artificers and alchemists this world has ever seen. You have a profound, ridiculous talent for making items and potions of incredible power and use, being able to enchant items or make potions for just about anything you can do yourself. On top of that, you learn such fields with mind-numbing speed, and are soon pioneering new innovations and levels of mastery in each of these fields, possibly simultaneously. Making the greatest masterwork items Wizardkind can make these days is child’s play for you, and while you can’t quite mass-produce Cauldrons of Plenty or Deathly Hallows just yet, your talent is no lesser than their makers and you could get there in a fraction of the time it took the original luminaries, making items of equal or even greater power. Finally, this also gives you the same degree of talent when it comes to magical construction, making you, once you spend a bit of time developing your skills, capable of putting up buildings on the scale of size and complexity as Hogwarts in minutes, if not less. In future worlds too, you find you have the same talent in all the fields analogous to the ones mentioned above."

200 CP,Alchemical Stockpile ,World Of Lewd Witchcraft Jump ,"Alchemy is a Noble Art. You will not get far in alchemy with just instincts and half-baked plans. To master alchemy, you need a nobleman’s education and the patience of a scientist willing to experiment and diligently take notes. You may or may not have those traits, but you have something equally important in a potion’s brewing context: a lot of stuff. And importantly, you have high-quality stuff. You have an expansive stockpile of alchemical ingredients, and a lovely textbook that tells you their properties and what they do when mixed together. This book is an enchanted object, and as you acquire more ingredients, you can give small samples of them to the book, which will then log them and tell you what they do. If you hold it over a freshly brewed potion it will tell you what the potion does and a number of ways to make the potion differently than how you or the potion maker did (if not you) including how to make it faster, how to make it in a way that is cheaper, or how to make it more potent. The individual ingredients in this stockpile magically replenish themselves over time, with more common ingredients reappearing at faster rates than rarer objects. This also comes with the individual tools needed to brew potions, but they are of normal quality, though they do repair themselves and clean themselves when not in use, which is quite nice and can be incredibly handy in a pinch."

These potions can be made instantly and with even a few drops of their required ingredients."
