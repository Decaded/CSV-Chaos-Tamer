100 CP,Well-Read,Hogwarts Legacy,"You have read a high number of books on a variety of magical topics, and you have an extremely keen memory to hold them all.

100 CP,Course Books,Hogwarts Legacy,"A set of books covering the basics for every class from first year through seventh. Individual teachers may assign additional texts, but even if you only had these books to study from, it would be enough for you to pass your OWLs and NEWTs."

100 CP,No Snooping,Hogwarts Legacy,"While not an outright immunity to legilimency or mind reading, this perk will ensure that no nosey old men or antique hats or what have you will find any of your meta-knowledge, proof of your extradimensional nature, knowledge of your outside context abilities, information about your real age, or anything else that would inherently prove that you don’t belong here."

Right now, so long as you have a clear image of where you’re going, and nothing is blocking you, you can Apparate anywhere within a few hundred miles or so. And you’ve mastered Apparition to such an extent that you won’t need to worry about making a mistake either. That is a very good thing given how... severe the consequences of a failed Apparition can be."

So long as hope burns bright within you, the fight shall rage on."
200 CP,Rumor and Gossip ,Hogwarts Legacy,"Rumors move fast, and they are particularly quick to reach your ears. You are always keyed into the grapevine wherever you might happen to be, quickly hearing tales of people in need, strange phenomena, buried treasures, and roaming beasts. Even if you rarely, if ever, talk to people, you somehow still know what rumors are flying around."
200 CP,Lingering Clues ,Hogwarts Legacy,"Time wears down all things, which can make research difficult when information has been lost to accident or disaster.

Lost knowledge is far less lost when you are searching for it."
200 CP,Combat,Hogwarts Legacy,"You have a talent for combat spells, such as Expelliarmus, Bombarda, Diffindo, and Stupify. All such spells hit harder against your enemies, and, when you are focusing on a specific enemy, you will occasionally see glyphs flash briefly into existence over their head. These glyphs represent specific spells that would be particularly useful against your target (such as one for Expelliarmus when their grip on their wand slips a bit), and with practice, you can use these indicators to greatly improve your combat casting."
200 CP,Impediment ,Hogwarts Legacy,"You have a talent for magic that restricts movement, including Glacius, Arresto Momentum, and Petrificus Totalus.

200 CP,Seer ,The Other Harry Potter Fanfic Jump,"You’re a seer. Someone with the ability to foresee the future. While the ability can be trained to an extent, for the most part, it’s inborn. By itself, this Perk gives you a talent akin to Trelawny, where you will merely spout off a cryptic prophecy at important junctures that predict a possible future if properly deciphered, with the caveat that unlike her you’ll remember what you said, and maybe get an occasional coincidental or accidentally correct prediction,"
200 CP,Great Teacher,The Other Harry Potter Fanfic Jump,"Maybe you'd rather be a teacher than a student, or maybe you’d like to establish something akin to the DA a bit early.

You also have a basic grasp of Fiendfyre, though you still have to focus to keep it under control."
300 CP,Transfiguration,Hogwarts Legacy,"You have a general mastery of Transfiguration, allowing you to conjure, vanish, and transform materials, with far less material / effort needed for permanent effects. You also have a firm grasp on the tricks of Human Transfiguration, allowing you to turn people into objects and back again, and you have gained an Animagus Transformation of your own, allowing you to transform into a mundane animal of your choice."
400 CP,"
Top of the Class",Hogwarts Legacy,"Even if you started Hogwarts late, you’ll soon sail past your classmates, because your learning speed is simply unreal.

You are a wellspring of inspiration, capable of taking what you learn and building on it and synergizing to discover new applications of your own."
400 CP,Enchanting Education,Hogwarts Legacy,"It does little good to collect knowledge if you can’t share it. You are an exceptional teacher, capable of teaching your skills and knowledge at an accelerated rate without any loss in understanding. But you particularly shine as a teacher of magic.

You can use it as a school, as anyone you bring here to learn will gain the Magic perk and their own Wand and School Supplies Items, or you could repurpose it for some other use. Maybe a base? It comes with the full suite of Canon security at its greatest. This castle and its grounds can be imported into a suitable location in your current Jump or kept as a pocket dimension attached to your warehouse."
400 CP,I’m rather gifted with memory charms,Harry Potter Movie Series ,You have an excellent memory and have memorised all of the mind relating spells and charms to such a degree that even if you were a muggle you could use this knowledge to replicate the effects of the spells without magic.

Together, these two artefacts are responsible for recording the births, names, and displays of magic of magical children within the United Kingdom. This  urchase does not grant you those two artefacts, but it does grant you similar ones. You’ll receive a magical book that, when one writes their name and date of birth in the book with the magical quill, grants them magical power.
