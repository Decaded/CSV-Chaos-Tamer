200,Inspirational Voice,DC – Kingdom Come,"People need hope in these dark times. Even if you yourself don’t have that hope, you may need to bring it to other people regardless. Now, your words have a way of bring hope and happiness to even the most depressed person. Perhaps it could even move them to action or change their lives for the better. Even if you yourself feels everything is hopeless, you can muster up enough to bring people happiness. Be the light they need, with your words."
50,Sexy and I Know It,Generic First Jump,"Jumpers tend to be rather vain. Almost all of them eventually take some sort of appearance boosting perk, so let’s just deal with that  now. You are incredibly good-looking. On a scale of one to ten, you are a perfect ten. The exact details of your appearance, build, and “endowments” are up to you, but you look as good as it is possible for a human being to look and you stay that way no matter what your condition or the circumstances might be. Anything that happens to alter your appearance, such as scarring, amputation, cybernetic implants, or genetic mutation, will always leave you somehow still looking incredible. You may become a rotting zombie, but you will be the sexiest rotting zombie to ever crave brains.You will retain your fit and attractive appearance, even without exercise or proper diet, as long as you consume enough calories to avoid starvation. You will either heal perfectly, without any form of scarring, or your scars will enhance your appearance in some way. Even if your current appearance is inhuman in part or completely, you still remain this attractive. You never actually get dirty, always staying as pristine and perfect as you could be, unless you choose otherwise. In which case the sweat, dirt, blood, or whatever else will somehow compliment your looks perfectly. You also instinctively present yourself as well as you possibly can at all times. Your posture and movements never make you seem awkward or unattractive, always showing you in your best possible light and making anything you wear look amazing. Supermodels train for years to stand and move like you, and never quite make it. You never need to brush or floss, having perfect teeth and a great smile, your hair is always perfectly done up in whatever style you want it in, and if you don’t want to shave you simply won’t need to, facial or body hair simply not growing until and unless you want it to. Furthermore, you have perfect control over your fertility, and menstrual cycle in the case of females. Any sexual partners will believe you when you tell them you are protected, as long as you are telling the truth. Your voice is equally incredible in some way, whether it be sexy, commanding, soothing, or just pleasant. Your body scent is either extremely pleasant or you have no scent at all, and you can switch this at will."
50,Diplomacy,Justice League Unlimited,"Sometimes instead of fists, you need words to win a battle. Not only can you quickly think of the right thing to say to get people to stop fighting for a while you can also potentially talk someone out of performing whatever violent act they had in mind and formulate truces, peace treaties, or compromises between warring groups and individuals. Keep in mind though that this skill will only work on people who want some kind of peace."
100,Friendly Friends,Generic First Jump,"No matter what you have experienced or where you have been, you have no difficulty in connecting emotionally with other people. You are also a good listener and all around good friend, when you want to be."
100,Universal Translation,Generic First Jump,"You can understand, speak, read, write, and think any language you have ever encountered, as long as you have the necessary anatomy. This is retroactive to any languages you might have been exposed to in the past."
100,Non-Threatening,Generic Fist Jump,"Let’s be honest, you just don’t look that tough. No one is going to think you are a threat until you prove otherwise. This doesn’t mean they won’t decide to beat you down for fun, or that a paranoid enemy might not prepare to deal with you just in case, but in general, people will not want to bother with you, and they will tend to underestimate you at first."
100,Bedside Manner,Generic Medical Drama,"You know how to give people bad or unpleasant news in such a way that they have no ill will for you, and process the information in a healthy and prompt manner. Also useful for telling someone that they do, in fact, look fat in those pants."
100,Doctor’s Orders,Generic Medical Drama,"It could be a Medical Doctorate or a Doctorate of Computer Science; if you’re actually an expert in a subject, people soliciting advisement will actually follow your direction to the best of their ability. Patients will take their meds in a timely manner, etc."
100,Timeless Wanderer,DCEU,"The world of man is ever changing. As the years go by, mankind alters itself faster and faster, becoming more radically different than the young species you once knew. But you changed along with them, when you went to visit at least. Unlike many of your kind, you find it effortless to adjust to different cultures, times and places. Even in the strangest of societies compared to your own, no one ever finds you out of place. You naturally fall into the expected roles and seem to fit in, unless you consciously decide to act out and break the rules and expectations of society."
100,Silver Tongue,Generic Gamer,"Well aren’t you a charmer. You’re able to wheel and deal with the best of them, thanks to an acute understanding of psychology as well as a keen insight into people’s thoughts, desires, and motivations; you know how to make people laugh, cry, or feel just about any way you want them to feel, really. Unless what you say is blatantly and obviously false, it’s all but impossible to catch you in a lie. You know just what makes a person tick and how to get them to do what you want, to even make them want to do what you want. You’re able to be the life of the party one minute, put the fear of God into the whole room the next, then make everyone forget it ever happened. You have a startling grasp of local etiquette and customs, even those you’d have no way of knowing about beforehand. The only way someone is coming away with a negative first impression of you is if you want them to. It’s just hard to dislike you, and the alternative is oh so very easy. It certainly doesn’t hurt that you’re probably the best looking person in the world. You even smell amazing."
100,Magnetic Personality,Chronicle,"What a coincidence it is that the only people in the world with superpowers are all in the same city and quickly become friends. But if you were involved in that, it wouldn’t really be coincidence, would it? Somehow, you attract like-minded people to yourself, and are able to build relationships with them in mere moments, should you choose to do so. But this isn’t limited to such a nebulous quality as personality: should people with special powers exist in a world, you can be sure that you’ll quickly meet them."
100,Worldly Monster,The God of Highschool,"A demon you may be called but you are certainly nothing like the hellish things Humans dream up in their spare time. If anything, you are naturally far more in tune with the world around you and the many animals in it than any human. Whilst they will not seek you out to offer you aid with just this, you will never need fear being attacked by any wild animal without provoking it severely first. You may pass through their territory untroubled but threats or attacks will remove what goodwill your nature grants you."
100,Sworn Brothers,The God of Highschool,"Family is more than just those who share the same genetic heritage as yourself. The friends that would stick by your back even when all of Heaven is bearing down on you are just as much family as your mother or father. You may declare any friend of yours as being part of your family and for all effects that might care, they will count as being so. By taking them into your family in this way, you’ll have an instinctual sense for teamwork between the two of you and any other members of your family, along with being able to sense each other’s emotions very easily. It’s no magical spell but so long as you can see your brothers, you’ll always know how they’re really feeling."
100,A Good Seed,The God of Highschool,"A certain trait or quality of yours, immaterial to the naked eye, seems to attract those looking for a partner. No matter how handsome or ugly you really are, you seem to be have a charming air about you that draws in others, attracting them like a bear to honey. This trait is particularly effective upon those looking for a partner in order to create a proper heir, rather than those interested in romance or personal satisfaction."
100,Confession,KonoSuba,"I’m a Goddess! I really, really, truly am! It’s not fair that people only believe Jumper when he tells the truth and not me! At least as long as you stick to telling the truth, people will always believe you, no matter how outlandish or impossible it might sound. You’re no better than normal with ordinary deception and lying but something about the way you talk has people just accept that your truthful words are in fact truthful."
100,Lockhart's Legacy,Final Fantasy 7 Remake,"Beautiful, badass, sexy; you embody it all. You’re endowed with many incredible features, from a stunning face to stylish hair to impossible proportions. Such beauty comes effortlessly to you, whether it be on the beach or the battlefield. Of course, there is more to this perk than simple looks. Like the powerhouse of Avalanche, your stellar looks are matched only by your staggering strength. Both of these traits are now linked, letting you enhance your power or looks by improving on the other. Yet, for all your brawn, you’ll never lose your sweet appearance. You needn’t carry Barrett’s bodybuilder physique to powerfully pummel your foes. Whether by your strikes or by your style, you’ll always leave others stunned! See the Notes section for additional details."
100,Darling Knight,Medaka Box Abnormal,"Nothing can be nobler than the pursuit of love. Such a shame that most pursuits go unrewarded or even outright ignored! Your own efforts are much more likely to get rewarded however. Your romantic aims much more easily achieved. Those you are interested in find themselves at least a tiny bit open to the idea, even if they’d normally not even consider it, and any gifts or favours you do for them for the purpose of gaining their affections will be far better received than they normally would. Something that would have not even gained a reaction might be well appreciated, whilst a gift that already touched someone’s heart might make them fall for you outright."
100,Shoujo Prince,Medaka Box Abnormal,"They don’t call you a prince for nothing. You’ve got the sort of stunning good looks to make yourself stand out even on a world stage. No doubt half your schoolmates are crushing on you, from either side of the gender line too. Not only that but these effortless good looks really are as effortless as they seem. You don’t need to spend any time at all in the morning preparing, you’ll find yourself looking, smelling and feeling just as good waking up as if you’d spent a few hours at a luxury spa each morning. You’ll also find that most things you do have your beauty in them as well, ranging from having innately gorgeous handwriting to producing much prettier pieces of art."
100,YOU ARE GORGEOUS,Medaka Box Abnormal,"Those who succeed all the time will inevitably encounter that classic opponent- the one jealous of the successful people in the world. The sorts of people who look at those blessed with talent, good looks and good fortune and just feel envy. But when they look at you, they see something truly special. Rather than being disliked for being special, unique or blessed beyond the norm, you will find that most people like you more for it. When they might envy you normally, now they will be inspired by you. Even those who truly hate the sort of being that you are will consider you a small exception."
100,Provocations User,Medaka Box Abnormal,"It’ll definitely be a pain to fight you. With just a word, you can ruin anyone’s composure and force them to act out in anger. No matter how strong they are or how well controlled they are or even how many times you’ve used this, you’ll make someone get spitting mad for a few seconds whenever you specifically try to provoke them."
100,Royal User,Medaka Box Abnormal,"An Anti-Style Style for sure and maybe also reflecting of an arrogant tone as well. When you speak, you are able to prevent anyone else around you from being able to speak while you are vocalising. Even those that speak through means other than vocal chords, such as over electronic devices or through telepathy, will be silenced when within range of your voice."
100,Truth User,Medaka Box Abnormal,"Not all Styles must be directed towards violent ends. The Truth User Style brings to the forefront the aspect of Styles that focuses on communication and understanding between beings. When you speak with someone or a group of people, you allow all those participating in the talk with you to come to truly understand one another. The emotions behind the words you and they speak become clear as day to each of you, as do the reasons they have for speaking as they do and whether or not they tell the truth, lie or merely omit information from their words."
100,Majesty with Eyes of Blue,Duel Monsters - Shadow Realm,"Your eyes have become a beautiful shade of pale blue, marking you as kin to the Blue Eyes clan. Your sudden appearance may well have you be heralded by the clan as a messiah or a sign of a return to glory...and why wouldn’t they? Your appearance is absolutely stunning, whether beautiful or handsome. Those who look upon you will instinctively recognize you as some sort of nobility, whether a crownless monarch or someone with a grand destiny. What’s more, dragons will see you as kin to them, looking at you the way they would a cousin or a member of family. Be aware, this bond means less to some than others...but you will, if nothing else, be respected and heard out when you speak."
100,Red-Eyes Burn,Duel Monsters - Shadow Realm,"The feature which gives the Red Eyes their name. You are now able to manifest Red Eyes, bright red lights in your eyes that the Black Dragons used as a young clan to come off as powerful and intimidating. Not only do they serve this purpose, but you also gain a strange attunement to the element of “Fire” while the red eyes are active, making you a bit resistant to it and letting you manipulate it with a greater ease."
100,Monkey’s Compassion,One Piece: New World,"There is something about you that makes it easier for others to feel relaxed in your presence, making you all the more likable and them more likely to open up to you. You are able to bring out anyone’s childish side with enough time and care."
100,Certified Badass,RWBY,"You’re awesome and everyone knows it. As a Huntsman/Huntress, you have an aura of strength and inspire awe in those you meet. When you give advice and weigh in on situations, your words will be taken very seriously. People know that you know what you’re talking about, and they respect you enough to listen."
100,Honed to the Razor Edge,Petals of Reincarnation,"Something about the look in your eyes can freeze people in their tracks. There’s an intensity to your gaze and your manner, one that both unnerves people and allures them. When you become focused on obtaining something, from victory in battle to seducing a lovely lady partner, your attempts to intimidate or attract those around you become far more successful. There’s an instinctive fear or desire for the sheer intensity that you give off during those moments, something that may even become addictive to a small degree."
100,Made to last,To Love-Ru,"Your friendships - really, your relationships in general - are a lot more solid than normal. There’d have to be a lot more than some arguments or bad times for them to fall apart, because once you have made a bond with somebody, that bond stays. And nothing short of driven effort from one of you will ever break it."
100,Above the Influence,Rosario + Vampire,You are a master at resisting temptation. No matter how many times half naked beautiful members of the opposite sex throw themselves at you. You have the resolve to say no... if you want to. It's totally up to you. Your self control is incredible. Your willpower is similarly increased
100,Bluff,Rosario + Vampire,You are a master at concealing your emotions and giving others a false impression of what your feeling. You are quite capable of telling lies believably.
100,Burden of Power,Fate/Grand Order,"Wander into town, help out a few strangers, leave without another world. For those with power who haven’t fallen into depravity, it’s often the way. You feel disconnected from the world around you and even if you want to help them, they sometimes have nothing but fear left for you. Your power won’t get in the way of social interactions unless you’d like it to now. Not only will being great in magnitude than someone not make you fell distanced from them but they won’t feel envy or fear to you either. If you still happen to want to pass on untroubled, you’ll be able to peacefully fade from people’s memories after a while. Never be afraid that you’ll leave people pointlessly longing after you once you’ve disappeared from their lives forever."
100,Undiscovered,My Hero Academia,"That face, that body, those incredible good looks! Have you ever modeled before? You really should consider it, maybe in a cape and tights? Maybe branch into acting? You appear to be by many standards the perfect human specimen, described as traditionally handsome or beautiful. More importantly however is a kind of iconic charm. There’s something standout unique, about your appearance that attracts people more than beauty, an attraction breeds trust. This allows you to get away with more questionable thing by virtue of good looks alone, even “blend in” when you ordinarily wouldn’t belong."
100,Info-gathering,Sekirei,You pick up info as easily as you breathe. People tend to slip up or get loose-lips when you’re around or not being noticed by others
100,No Fighting Here,Sekirei,"With nothing but a few words you’re able to dissuade people from fighting, provided a brawl is about to go down at your home. This won’t help if you’re out wandering the city, but any attempts to threaten or attack you at home are stopped in their tracks."
100,Average Looking,Sekirei,"You won’t stand out unless you really want to. You’ll be seen as plain and average, nothing but a random passerby, unless you make an attempt to be  anything else."
100,Dark Theater,Arifureta Shokugyou de Sekai Saikyou,"It’s the flair! The Shading! The raw emotion hanging from each word! Well, call me maybe, you got the makings of a great actor... or orator, or something along those lines. As expected, you aren’t that inclined for those jobs, but the talent does show itself when you allow it. As long as you have some emotion behind it, the words for a revolutionary speech come easy to you, it comes easy to the audience as well, as they will wait for you to finish before responding. After the discourse finishes, those that listened to you will become more favorable towards your expressed ideas and yourself in general; the effect depends on their own attitude and personality, an enemy might value you higher, but someone that already admired you might carry out each of your words to the letter."
100,Keeper Of The Peace,Star Wars: Attack of the Clones,"You’re not a soldier. Or perhaps you are? Either way, you might prefer to act as a deterrent to violence rather than being forced to inflict it. If you sufficiently outnumber or are clearly more powerful than your opponents, you have a chance of them surrendering as soon as you brandish your weapon. This is less effective on the desperate or well trained. Unless you can demonstrably destroy an army by yourself, don’t expect them to give up the moment you show up if you’re alone."
100,Seductive Body,Akame ga Kill,"You have a body that anyone could love, and want to, your body is like a work of art that others may find it hard to harm. Though the effect might entice sadists, and won't do much on professional killers at least you look nice though?"
100,Honorary Xeno,Star Trek – TNG + DS9,Aliens will naturally like and trust you. They'll always see you as an equal no matter what animosity may exist between your species and theirs.
100,Noble Presence,Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation,"There are times that even though you are a noble, other people seem to fail to recognize it unless they see you wearing expensive clothes, being followed by guards and a noble bearing, but not with you. With this, your very presence screams you being a noble of higher lineage that no matter how you present yourself, wear a commoner's clothes others will always recognize you as a member of the nobility. You have gained an incredible grace that attracts people's attention and you always move subconsciously in a way that maximizes your appeal of your appearance towards other people. Though you can turn off the effects should you want to go incognito and you don’t want others to find out that you are a noble."
100,Why Is Everyone Blushing?,Infinite Stratos,"You’d think if someone was blushing, spending all their time with you, asking you out on dates or even outright confessing to you, you’d be able to tell they liked you, right? Sadly, not everyone’s mastered the...subtleties of all that. You have though, in fact, you don’t even need any indicators at all. You always know whether someone you’re looking at has romantic feelings towards you, as well as how strong. Don’t leave em hanging lover boy."
100,Building Bridges,Generic Harry Potter Fanfiction,"​As it usually works, people in high-tension situations almost always develop ‘us vs them’ attitudes. Anyone who’s friendly with the ‘other side’ is consorting with the enemy, probably a traitor, so on and so forth. Not you. You’re immune to such petty suspicions. As long as you’re not actually betraying any of them, you can spend the night partying in a Vampire club and the day attending the wedding of the most vicious hunter in town, and neither group will mind. The greatest use of this, however, is in mediation. You can assist disparate groups find points of agreement, and also come to terms with their differences. As long as your points are valid, no one will dismiss you as being a ‘lapdog of the other side!’."
100,Could You Not,Campione!,"Absolute madman would be how others see you when you tell off a Campione straight to their face or batter them about the head while deriding them for the latest travesty. Words escape them when you fail to turn into a pink mist, and you thought you saw something white at the corner of their mouths when it actually got through. Simply put you have a way with words and actions that reach even the quirkiest or alien of individuals, provided they will entertain communication at all. This doesn’t prevent them from harming you if you cross the line, only allowing for them to understand beyond their own twisted frame of reference without impediment. A useful trait if you insist on running with that sort."
100,Born Rich,Arrowverse,"You were taught the finer things in life at an early age, including the art of persuasion. You're a natural at it. When you smile, the room seems to light up and people are more willing to listen what you have to say. You can convince a board of CEOs to make you the President, with a heart filled speech and of course the winning smile. People tend to gloss over your minor negative qualities, like being a womanizing playboy. Even if you were declared dead for five years, your seat at head the company will be there waiting. Your name is on the VIP list for all the local clubs, you're incredibly good looking and a smash with the sex you're attracted to. What's more is that you give off a disarming personality. No one would ever suspect this is a cover identity."
100,Fear,DC – Blackest Night,"You were chosen for your ability to inspire great fear in others. You know how to terrify other sentient beings with horrifying ease, and you have faced your own fears and overcome them, making them your servant instead of the other way around."
100,Hope,DC – Blackest Night,"You were chosen for your ability to inspire great hope in others. You are able to remain steadfast in the face of a great crisis or hardship, staying optimistic when others would despair, and inspire them to feel hope as well."
200,Finding Help,Final Fantasy 7 Remake,"There might not be a whole lot you can do to change your circumstance, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t people who can help. This perk has two effects. First, it helps you meet important and influential people in your community. Second, you now have a greater chance of convincing them to assist you. Whether it’s a wandering mercenary or a sympathetic Shinra trooper, you have a knack for finding people that can help with your problems."
200,Burden of the Mighty,Duel Monsters - Shadow Realm,"It is the burden of the mighty to defend the weak, this is something you’ve learned throughout your years as a warrior. Understanding and accepting this solemn duty is your strength, now, and those who are weaker than you can see it in your eyes. Now, you are able to keep a sense of empathy towards those weaker than you, and in turn the weak see you as their champion and will be extremely favorable. The mighty become kings not through threats and fear, but by standing as the people’s blade. Let that lesson burn into your heart."
200,Unforgettable,Fate/Grand Order,"You’re not the sort of guy people just meet and forget about. You stick around in people’s heads for good once they meet you, every action you do being just as eternally memorable as you yourself. Given that you and everything you do is permanently engraved into the minds of those who meet you, it gives you a whole lot more influence with your words and actions. People remember and think about what you say to them, they remember what you’ve done to or for them and that memory gives you much greater influence over other people."
200,Holy Clay,DCEU,"Perhaps the Gods themselves truly did craft you from their most divine clay because you’ve got a body that can inspire men to become artists of legend. You have a divine beauty, as a man or as a woman, and exemplify every aspect of beauty you yourself could find attractive. Given the source of this beauty, it takes no effort from you to maintain and you will remain as gorgeous as ever even when in the midst of a brutal knockdown battle. You’re not just easy on the eyes either as people find you very easy to get along with, even if you have a gruff and naturally hostile personality. You can still drive people away if you try but now people will be naturally drawn towards you."
200,I’m Here To Help,DC – Blackest Night,"The Green Lantern Corps are a police intervention organization first, a military institution second. Thus, it’s good to be able to cooperate with the locals and get them to cooperate in turn. When you act in a crisis or a dangerous situation, others tend to trust and defer to your authority until the danger has passed, so long as they have no reason to distrust you."
200,Crossing Stars,DC – Blackest Night,"Love is an emotion that comes back to you the more you give it to others in turn. Thus, you know how to show your loved ones affection in a way that makes them happy. Among friends, you’re the life of the party. Around that special someone, your presence brings comfort and warmth, perhaps even making them fall in love with you all over again...or for the first time."
200,Jumper is Seriously Pissed!,DC – Larfleeze,"Pick a color and either an emotion or a concept such as chaos or freedom. You can imbue your voice with that color to emphasize what you’re saying and unmistakably mark your words with the emotion or concept the color is tied to. Yes, they can somehow see the color you’re speaking in. Works especially well if you’re shouting about yourself in the third person. Anyone who hears you will instantly recognize what you represent, and if it’s a particular emotion such as despair or desire then they’ll be mildly affected by your aura even if they’re outside your area of effect."
200,Do You Ever Do Something UN-Cool!?,My Hero Academia,"Heroes in this world stick out, standing in the spot light and inspiring those who watch them, those who surround them. They’re still people though, they were young once, you too can inspire people even if you’re not a hero yet. Something about you just makes you hard to forget. Even young you’re leaving impressions on people, though what kind tends to vary based on what you’re doing. What’s more, you’ve become more endearing, with your good points accentuated in people’s perception, especially to those who already like the way you carry yourself on some level. Even if you’re a complete asshole, ‘someone’ would probably still appreciate your manliness or honesty, wanting to be your friend or think you’re cool. Just don’t push it too much, ya know?"
200,Unity and Bonds,Sekirei,"From here on out, you share a telepathic and empathic link to those with whom you are close with, sharing thoughts and feelings with everyone you care strongly for. The closer and stronger the bond the stronger the link you will share with them."
200,Harem Protagonist,Sekirei,"It's in your DNA. Literally. Whether it be Sekirei or any other supernatural being of your preferred gender. They will find some reason, mundane or otherwise, to love you."
200,Unity and Bonds,Sekirei,"From here on out, you share a telepathic and empathic link to those with whom you are close with, sharing thoughts and feelings with everyone you care strongly for. The closer and stronger the bond the stronger the link you will share with them."
200,You Want To Go Home And Re-Think Your Life,Star Wars Attack of the Clones,"Wanting to help people is all well and good, but there are occasions where you might accidentally do more harm than good. Now, genuine attempts to help people will not backfire on them or you, and positive developments will stick thanks to your efforts. You also have a disproportionately beneficial effect when you help people. Someone you talk out of using and dealing drugs, whatever your exact methods are, will actually reform and clean themselves up without also expanding their portfolio to arms dealing, and they might go on to help others as you have helped them."
200,I’m Here To Help,All-Star Superman,"You’re probably used to strange or unusual powers being met with all sorts of emotions - terror, apprehension, disbelief. Calling upon extraordinary or otherworldly abilities can bring out the worst in those who lack such a thing, as they see you as a monster. But not here, not anymore. When you demonstrate new and amazing abilities unique or rare to the world, others judge you not on how you appear or what your powers are, but your deeds towards the rest of the world. Someone who sits in the middle is accepted for who they are and little more, but a true hero is seen as an amazing marvel and someone to admire for what they use such fantastic abilities for. However, particularly hateful or jealous foes can still hold you in contempt for such powers...just as Lex Luthor despises ‘The Alien’ to this day."
200,Charisma Isn’t Your Dump Stat,Invincible,"You my friend have charisma, a certain je ne sais quoi that surrounds you and your actions. Maybe it is the way you speak or the way you hold yourself. Regardless, something about you draws other people in, it makes them pay attention to what you say and at the end of the day helps cement their loyalty to you. You have charisma like very few others, a presence that is so powerful that you would be able to get elected as the president on charisma alone. This knowledge of how to interact with other people is not just in you alone but something that you can channel into your speech writing and delivery. Allowing this writing to impact people so powerful that centuries later people will present what you said as eloquent, respectable, and simply amazing."
200,"Small Step, Giant Leap",Rise of the Guardians,"You’re a planner, not a doer, but even if you can make the best plans in the world, you still need someone to carry them out for you. This Perk helps with that. Whenever you have a goal in mind, an objective as small as delivering a package or as grand as protecting all the world’s children, you become an expert at finding people to achieve it for you. You gain an almost intuitive understanding of whether or not people you know would be the right ones for the job and why, and you have almost supernatural luck at finding new good candidates. You’re able to find people who are inclined to accept, who would be devoted to the job to the death, who are incredibly skilled, and who will work well together; you may drop some of these qualifications if you like to increase the candidate pool, but the team won’t be quite as good. When you assemble a team for a mission, no matter how long or impossible it may be, you will find it composed of only the best, most devoted possible people."
200,Central Aura,Rise of the Guardians,"You know what’s really helpful for spreading your Center through the world, Jumper, more than just knowing the strategies people will best respond to? Being able to cloak yourself in an aura of it. That’s right — you have an aura of whatever your Center is, with the obvious results. Spirits of hope or fear have inspiring or dreadful auras, making people feel their Center, but also intensifying it if it’s already there. Already present hope becomes true confidence, and already present fear can become outright terror. This works on a sliding scale, allowing you to heighten or lower the aura’s intensity, or even just turn it off, at will."
200,Code Of Conduct,Star Wars: Attack of the Clones,"You might not already know how to be disciplined and how to follow orders, so now you will know when it is appropriate and what to do to avoid antagonising your superiors, as well as all the regulations and rules you need to follow in your position. Shiny and new as you might be to some of them, you can quickly prove yourself and earn their respect even if they initially distrust or dislike you for whatever reason."
200,Different Mask,Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation,"The nobles tend to wear masks that make them different when surrounded by people to hide their intentions and to prevent others from exploiting their weaknesses. This grants you a great talent at acting and the ability to construct a persona with an assigned role that you want to play and while in this persona, you will never give away or hint at anything that the role you are playing at couldn’t reasonably know or do. Turning back to who you were is as easy as removing a mask and no matter how many persona’s that you created you would never lose sight of your original self. When you are playing a role it's really hard for others to really see what’s underneath it thus preventing others from really guessing your intentions or how your mind really works."
200,Your Reputation Precedes You,Young Justice,"Sometimes, having others know exactly what you’re capable of is just what you need. For you, displaying a small amount of your power is the equivalent of displaying the full extent of your abilities. This is also useful for convincing others of your capabilities, as well as for ending a fight before it can begin through intimidation. This doesn’t actually reveal your power set. In addition, at the beginning of a Jump you may choose to have your exploits in other Jumps trickle in as rumors that are attributed to you, increasing how quickly you gain fame in your current Jump."
200,Well Rounded,Wo)Man (Fate/Stay Night,"Is it genes? Or maybe it's the inordinate amounts of magic in your veins. Whatever the case, you are fine. Better then fine even, you're gorgeous. The sort of beauty that forms fan clubs and makes people stop and stare on the street. You might want to be careful, this sort of beauty can get one into trouble. Which is why it's good you're no slouch in the combat department either. You won't be the master fighter some of the other things on offer make you but you'll make quick work of anyone  without actual training. And to top it all off, you're ELEGANT. You know all the manners to get by in high society, you're good at hiding any contempt for the lower classes and if you, you know, happened to have a temper, you'd get a fair bit better at keeping it under control. Not that I'm calling you a Tsundere or anything."
200,Touch of Dere,Fate/Stay Night,"Words just aren't enough all the time. You can't convey everything you feel through speaking, maybe because the other person is being a pig and not listening or maybe you just don't have the time to give them some speech. But you can convey every ounce of feeling and emotion you have through physical actions. A slap will tell someone exactly how frustrated, angry and hurt they've made you, a hug to finally get across the regrets you would never otherwise have been able to express to your best friend and a kiss to show that special someone just how truly unending your love for them is."
200,Messenger of God,Fate/Stay Night,"It might not quite be the Voice of God Himself but you've closed a lot of distance between the two of you. Your voice, now a lovely and gorgeous sound to behold, has an unnatural ability to cause pain to other people. Any insult you give seems to get under people's skin far too easily, personal attacks easily disturb a person's confidence and directly attacking someone's ideals, with the right words, can shake them to the core. You've also picked up a notable talent for the art of insulting other beings, just to make sure you can mess with them properly."
200,Kyuubi-chan,Generic Naruto Fanfiction,"It can be a daunting prospect to be set face-to-face with beings of terrifying power and might, such as demons or gods. You, however, are special. You find that you have something about you, like an aura, which immortal and powerful beings find rather soothing and pleasing. In addition, your mental faculties are such that you remain entirely unaffected by the status and power of the people you’re interacting with, able to treat them like you would anyone else. Indeed, it’s almost as if something out there wants you to form relationships with such entities, because they tend to be open-minded towards you even if they normally wouldn’t be at all, and you have inordinate luck and skill at charming and convincing them. You could talk to a demon and get them to become anything from your friend or lover, convince proud clans or species to become your summons and/or friends, get princesses and priestesses interested in bearing your children, and in general, the more powerful and distant a figure is, the easier you find it to get close to them."
200,Great Redeemer,Generic Harry Potter Fanfiction,"​There is never a person who cannot turn away from evil. You believe so, and you know so. You have an aura around you, a sort of force you exude that inspires people to regain hope in their innate goodness, which makes it so that no matter how foul someone’s past actions, how sadistic or obscene their previous temperament, they can always still turn to goodness and be as upstanding and kind a person as any other. You may choose the way you do this. It might be through a conversation in which you work through all their issues, it might be through defeating them in a duel, or it may be a long process of simple interactions that steadily make them see the light. Or, for the more ‘fun minded’, you could literally fuck the evil out of a person of your preferred gender over the course of several enthusiastic ‘sessions’. Whatever means you end up employing, if there is even the slightest chance of a person ever conceivably turning from their course, you know how to make it so."
200,Pleasantry User,Medaka Box Abnormal,"The power of please and thank you is not to be underestimated. You find that your life and the lives of those around you truly do become easier so long as you remain verbally courteous. Not only do you find yourself much luckier by never breaking a courteous mode of speech towards others, as well as speaking up when it would be required for politeness sake, but you also find more specific effects benefiting you as well. Saying please when you ask someone for something will make them genuinely consider your request, even if they despised you. Saying a short thanks before a meal will greatly improve the taste and nutritional value of the meal. Offering the first move in a match towards your opponent will allow your own first attack to come out faster and stronger than usual. These effects will not make a huge difference on their own but the sheer number of them should make up for it."
300,Notable Presence,Young Justice,"Inspiring your friends and intimidating your enemies, your very presence makes others pay attention and give consideration to what you say and do. You’re able to quickly build a reputation, for good or ill."
300,Objection Style,Medaka Box Abnormal,"Being contrarian and confrontational is in your very words by now. By yelling out “OBJECTION!” you are able to instantly put a stop to any one action that your opponent in any single fight has taken. You could prevent them from launching an attack or negate an attack that has already been fired, prevent them from blocking or dodging one move of your own or some other single event that can be undone. Only one such command may be used in each separate battle but used wisely, it can bring the fight to a victory for you instantly."
400,Getting Together a Team,Petals of Reincarnation,"With how big the world is, finding the very few capable of Reincarnating is a challenge. Finding those who possess the talents to one day have their own Reincarnators? Damn near impossible. But you make it work. For you, finding and even recruiting to your cause those who share the same traits or powers as you is an easy task. Even when they’re a one in a million or rarer occurrence, you can find people with similar or the same type of powers as you in just days and, so long as they’re not already affiliated with a rival group, easily convince them to give joining your side a go. Any trait you yourself have can be searched for in this way, from personality traits to types of powers to skillsets to even partner preferences, though it won’t be able to find anything that doesn’t exist in the world."
400,Nasty or Nice,Fate/Grand Order,"Good guy, bad guy, you’re a big influence on them both. Your presence and companionship can draw out the good and bad that waits inside everyone. If you don’t take action, it won’t change anything, but once you start to encourage people to let out what’s inside them, you can really get some changes going. Comrades can become more brutal and violent or more merciful and forgiving. The closer you are to a person, the stronger you’ll be able to make this effect. A stranger you’ve known for a few days might just talk and act a little differently. A close friend who you’ve saved the life of and vice versa? You could turn them from maniacal villainy into reluctant heroism or from being a shining example of a hero into a vicious extremist for their own ideology. Get even closer and you might be able to make some even more extreme changes. Bringing out someone’s inner good or bad side will take time but...a few days should be all you need."
400,Maestro,Medaka Box Abnormal,"Now you might not be all that special on your own, really, but you’ve got a tendency to make all those around you that much more amazing. You’re able to draw out the true potential of those around you that you care for and spend lots of time with, both in regards to their powers and even them as people. So long as you are constantly around someone that you have a good relationship with, you’re able to slowly bring out their true powers, increasing their maximum power by up to three times their normal level if you’ve spent a few months with them. You’ll also find that they begin to get over mental and emotional issues with ease so long as you keep talking to them, though this is mostly based on what they see as a problem. This increased power and sense of self will slowly drain if you cease to constantly spend time with a person, draining to nothing by the end of a full month."
400,Stand and Fight,Fate/Grand Order,"Lead from the front, that’s the motto of a true warrior king. If you couldn’t stand and fight alongside your men, you hardly deserve to lead them. They all agree quite wholeheartedly too. As long as they see you standing up in the front, battling away, they’ll know they can’t give up either. Your will becomes their will in battle, allowing you to support every ally that fights with you at once. As long as your willpower holds out, so will theirs. If you feel no fear, neither will they. If you are inspired to go to the very limits of what you can do, your army will rise up alongside you. So long as you hold out, your army will have to be killed to the last man before they admit defeat. But if you break, so does this protection and they’ll need to rely on their own wills, not that of their King."
400,Show Those Pearly Whites!,My Hero Academia,"“Smile! That’s one of the most important things that a hero can do. When the fearful and hopeless look to you for support, you need to be confident and give it.” Your smile has the capacity to comfort others even when the situation looks bleak, bringing a sense of peace to those in trouble or inspiring courage previously none could be found. That smile of yours promises supreme confidence, even if you might not actually hold it. It can help not only with comfort, but bluffing, fooling others into thinking you’re in an advantageous position or know what you’re doing when you’re utterly clueless."
400,Mask of Horror and Fear,Sekirei,You have developed a unique ability to conjure an aura of fear with a simple smile. It brings fear and terror to any and all that gaze upon your smiling face. A certain something might be conjured behind you. With practice and effort you can increase the number of those things that appear.
400,I Am the True Leader of this Country,Invincible,"You are an amazing leader. You engender true loyalty from your followers and respect from your enemies. You could lead enormous global organizations and ensure that they operate as close to perfect as is possible. Beyond that however you find that when you lead an organization of any sort, those within the organization work better together. They put their best foot forward and always try their best to better themselves and the organization. Start leading a company of slackers and before long you’ll find yourself one of the best in your field due to your employees’ desire to do better when you lead."
400,You know something about everybody,Rune Factory,"Delivering mail is tough, you can’t always keep everything straight with the mail if you have no interest in empty names and random mailboxes, so now I give you this. Whenever you’re doing something for somebody else, whether as your job or just from the goodness of your heart, you’ll learn things about people and get to know what type of people they are. At first you might only learn little things, but the more you do favors for someone the more things you’ll know. Do bigger favors and you tend to learn more important information, deeper secrets, their history, you name it. Maybe that guy you got to a doctor used to be a war criminal or a sailor that was shipwrecked, you’ll eventually just learn something about somebody, even if they have amnesia and don’t know anything about themselves."
400,Soothing Presence,The Fountain,"You have achieved inner calm and can project it as long as you are not currently experiencing any strong emotion yourself. Merely being in someone’s presence is enough, but physical contact, oratory or song, or just allowing them to see you can all boost the effect."
400,True Protagonist,Arifureta Shokugyou de Sekai Saikyou,"Well, it looks like someone got the charm on his side. For some reason you now attract the romantic attention of a lot of single females, even when you don’t try to do so, circumstances just align themselves to make them fall for you with no effort on your part. Going even more than that, for some reason those interested romantically in you just ignore the bad or obnoxious parts of your personality, in favor of what they deem as your good qualities. In short: Can’t turn off the swag. Always wake up covered in women."
400,Crazy AND Powerful,Arifureta Shokugyou de Sekai Saikyou,"Not only the empire, but this world at large seems to respect and bow to only one thing: Power. It reflects in the world at large and especially in you. No matter how crazy or odd you seem, as long as you are stronger than those around or opposing you, others will flock towards your side, work towards your goals and adopt your morality. In short, the more powerful you are, the more people will naturally seek to follow you. Even if you aren’t a good leader or particularly charismatic."
400,Experience Outranks Everything,Star Wars: Attack of the Clones,"While someone might technically or officially outrank you due to their position, that’s no guarantee that they actually know what they’re doing. Now, these superiors will be willing to listen to and apply your advice in any field that your experience outranks theirs, without getting offended that you clearly know more than them about it or disregarding your input for foolish reasons. You need to somehow show that your approach is better than theirs, either through discussion or demonstration, and they won’t necessarily give you credit for the success if they’re that type of person, but at least they won’t get you and others killed trying to enforce a decision that anyone with experience would tell them is stupid."
400,Sharing is Caring,Sekirei,"You now share a subconscious empathic bond with those you share a strong relationship with, platonic or otherwise. Within the group, negative feelings are mitigated, positive feelings are enhanced, and a mutual sense of sharing envelops you all; troubles, triumphs, possessions, space, etc are all communal. You may designate private things though."
400,The Mighty,Re: Monsters,"For monsters, might makes right. Power gives authority, regardless if that strength is in magic, speed, or strength, and the more of it you possess, the greater your authority. Your physical and magical power naturally feed into an aura of authority that expresses just how powerful you really are, a trait that imposes awe or terror in those around you, reassuring your allies of your strength and protection, or intimidating your enemies with just how much power you possess. This aura is also tinted with your ideals; those aligned with them will naturally be drawn in as allies while those opposed will be harshly reminded of what will come if they draw your ire. This takes into account all of your inherent abilities; it will not showcase additional power provided by your equipment, nor your allies, only your personal strength. It also doesn’t take into account your intelligence and mental capabilities, only your physical and magical ones. This even puts a degree of pressure on those around you, weighing them down with your sheer presence and can even affect those stronger than you, though not if they are vastly so."
400,Charismatic Personality,Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation,"Whether it's natural or out of necessity there are some nobles who are quite charismatic that charms others with just their presence and words and you're the same as well. With this, you gain an increase in your charisma and charm to the point that so long you show some competence, people will always think of you first should their goals and interest align with yours. Your charisma is incredible to a degree that giving a speech in a city would cause the people to rally to your cause and your mere presence can attract the attention of the most arrogant, haughtiest nobles. This also affects the common people to a slightly lesser level. Even your charm is incredible such that you can charm your way into a tight-knit group of nobles and then have them openly welcome you with just a few days of well placed and calculated words from you, though this would be a lot harder if they're hostile towards you. This also helps that in any territory that you have, your people are unlikely to rebel and more likely to be obedient so long as you're not actively abusing your power over them and exploiting them."
400,Hyper Signing,Medaka Box Abnormal,"A Style is based on communicating. Words are integral to the art and those unable to comprehend language, permanently or temporarily, are unaffected by the Style. But is it really so important? Language is hardly limited to just the verbal medium. You’re able to use your Styles, and any other sort of verbal power, without the need for words. So long as your target is within audible range of you, you can use Styles or other verbal effects on them without doing anything but thinking the words in your mind. Even if they could not ordinarily comprehend language, it will still work on them. A side benefit of this all is that you are able to perfectly communicate with people in the same manner, getting across exactly what you mean even to those normally unable to understand language, just so long as they can see you and you can think. Real advanced body language there."
400,Mythical Visage,Fate/Stay Night,"Like the legendary Helen of Troy or the divine Aphrodite, your beauty is far beyond any mortal constraints. Whilst almost all Heroic Spirits are gorgeous to behold, your visage is so shockingly beautiful that it would make those in the midst of combat stop to stare at you. Even veteran warriors such as other Servants would be unable to stop themselves from pausing just at the sight of you. This awe-inspiring appearance is enough to make many mortals that lack strong wills fall in love with you from sight alone. There is little need for charisma when personal attention from you can reduce almost any man or woman to stuttering messes eager to do what they can to please you."
400,The Devil Wears Prada,Campione!,"While politicians try to sway away many people at once and entrepreneurs focus on the target audience for their products, you decided to go a step further in convincing others of doing your will. Indeed, one-on-one interaction how it works best for you at persuading people. Be that you want a new contact, a spy in the enemy lines, or just getting someone to agree with your social views. Your social-fu is at the level in which you can have almost anyone warped around your finger after some interactions. It still works to some extent in multiple people at once, but not as good as when working in a single person at the time."
400,"Nok, Nok",DC – Blackest Night,"The language of the Indigo Tribe lacks the ability to be translated by most other Power Rings, and can only be understood when they actively choose to communicate with outsiders. You’ve learned how to mask your own words in a similar way, making your speech sound like complete nonsense to all except those you wish to understand you, who will instead hear their native tongue as you speak. No matter what ability or translation device they use, your speech will be little more than gibberish unless you see fit to be understood."
400,Jolly Cooperation,With This Ring,"​Butcher, Ophidian, Parallax, Ion, Adara, Proselyte, Predator, Swamp Thing, the Source​, and countless other beings hold incredible power and a distinctly inhuman mindset. You find it easier to anticipate and understand these beings, granting an advantage in dealing with them through diplomacy or combat. Furthermore, with the proper catalyst you could even fuse with one of them, with all the potential benefits and costs that would bear. This also applies to other non-human, non-biological entities as well, such as Planet-minds, Machine Spirits, Bijuu, Demons, and Old Gods."
400,It’s Never As Bad As It Seems,All-Star Superman,"You have a presence about you, Jumper. An inner light that soothes those who gaze upon you, and realize - everything is going to be alright. This is a natural charisma that doesn’t simply make others like you more, but inspires them to do better and to strive improve themselves. You can bring the suicidal the resolve they need to carry on with life, you can bring comfort to those laid low by awful tragedy, and convince a lone pariah of a race of idiots to believe in his kin and use his own abilities for good. So long as it moves others towards bettering themselves and those around them, you can inspire goodness and hard work in almost anyone...except those utterly consumed by hatred or an inability to understand you."
600,Smooth,Generic Fist Jump,"You are an extremely likeable and charismatic person. People enjoy being around you, and are often eager to befriend you. People will tolerate behavior from you that would be completely unacceptable from anyone else, just because they can’t help but like you. You’re especially good at bullshitting and fast-talking people, to the extent that you could probably convince a guard to let you into Fort Knox by yourself “Just for a second, I just want to look around.” In addition, you excel at pulling tricks and unexpected tactics in a fight, often because no one would expect such a nice guy to hit below the belt."
600,Big Dick Walking,My Hero Academia,"You may not be some hotshot hero, or a cop, or even a private dick, but no one can dispute your qualifications for a role in leading the powerless. You’ve got what it takes to police Heroes and Villains alike. You’re charismatic with those lacking in natural abilities or from the lower classes, such as those who lost the power lottery or the Quirkless. You’re excellent with battlefield strategy and coordinating the “helpless” masses to fight those with considerable abilities, or even just carrying out with rescue or disaster relief efforts. You’ve got the sheer force of character to have those above you in social class to accept your judgements as long as you at least put up a token effort to be fair. If that wasn’t enough, designing and helping construct maximum security prisons explicitly for containing threats to society with bizarre abilities are included in your portfolio. You may not have the papers, but you do have the substance."
600,Absolution,The Fountain,"If you can convince someone to willingly pour out their deepest fears, regrets, or sins to you, you can grant them true absolution, allowing them to forgive themselves and move on. This does absolutely nothing for you as it does not work if you make it conditional. Their repentance must be genuine for this to work and they cannot desire gaining absolution for any immoral or unethical purpose."
600,All Will Be Well,DC – Blackest Night,"Hope is also contagious, being one of the most warm and welcoming of the lights. You can turn common individuals into saints, and even turn a wicked villain’s heart into that of a selfless hero should you be able to open their minds and ears to your words. Continuing to do selfless and good deeds in a given society or sector will see an uplifting of their spirits, fostering a sense of optimism and similar kindness in others. Don’t forget: All will be well."
600,The Smile,Akame ga Kill,You have a pure and innocent smiling face that makes people fall in love with you. With it you might melt the frozen heart of a sadistic general or woo the heart of an experienced assassin the day after you meet them. Expect a harem to soon develop wherever you go.
600,Avalanche,Final Fantasy 7 Remake,"You’ve got the logistical skills, tactical knowledge, and charisma to run a full-blown rebellion! You can coordinate a resistance, recruit new members to your cause, and know how to use guerilla tactics to upend a numerically superior foe. Whether it’s stealing supplies or marketing your movement, you could be the start of real change.


--- Maelstrom (Requires Limit Break): Your plucky resistance group has turned into a worldwide movement. Where once you canvased streets and oversaw back-alley fights, now you lead small armies across a nation. Your ability to coordinate logistics and plan large-scale strategy has improved greatly, letting you turn a scattered collection of cells into a focused fighting force capable of toppling entrenched regimes. They can’t stop the storm, Jumper. ---"
600,Combat Empathy​,History’s Strongest Disciple Kenichi,"­ In battle, you can “read” the flow of your opponent's movements, understanding where they intend to hit and their thoughts and emotions behind their attacks. While this may not be useful unless you are fast or strong enough to counter them, you will still likely know where it is the enemy intends to hit in advance of the actual strike, though the accuracy of these predictions decreases with the speed and number of your opponents. Alternatively, you could use this ability to have a civil conversation with someone, expressing complex feelings and emotions through a series of blows and spirited shouts."
600,Truth And Justice,All-Star Superman,"Truth be told, superpowers are rampant in this world, as are those willing to use them for evil. Simply being one of the strongest or smartest beings on the planet alone means nothing - what matters is what you represent. When you fight or protect others in the name of an ideal, you will find others inspired by your actions. It starts small - citizens begin to cheer you on, crime rates begin decline, the streets become cleaner. In addition, you inspire others to follow your virtues and your example without misdirection or their own egos getting in the way, creating a new generation of heroes in both ordinary and extraordinary people. After a few more years of work, the entire planet will hail you as a hero, and all but your enemies will hold some respect for you and what you do...so long as you never turn your hand against those you’ve inspired, anyways. One person may not be able to save the world alone, but with you acting as a guiding light, you could turn a self-serving, selfish world into one of heroes and hope. When they look to the sky and see you, they see a brand new day on the horizon."
600,Magnetic,Generic Naruto Fanfiction,"You have something about you, a way, a certain je ne sais quoi that gets people to follow you. Maybe it’s your charm, your goodness or purity, maybe it’s destiny nudging things along, but wherever you go you tend to find people of great power or ability who are all too willing to assist you. Experienced generals, old shinobi who could kill whole armies by themselves, princesses who are just perfect to sort out any political troubles you might have... all are drawn to you like moths to a flame, only with a better outcome, hopefully. Not only do they follow you, but all of you bond to each other to ridiculous degrees, letting you work together with legendary synergy, almost reading each other’s thoughts, moving as one on the field of battle. This also lets you work together when it comes to training, letting each of you advance orders of magnitude faster in any field when teaching each other, and in general letting you improve ridiculously quickly via spars or joint training. Apart from specific training, even in general the people you associate with, who work with or for you find themselves improving at mind-bogglings speeds in all aspects, becoming smarter, more capable, more competent. Even those who start at the very bottom could outmatch the finest in the trade in short order. You automatically encounter many people who this works on, but you can also deliberately target these effect on anyone who doesn’t resist it, and all companions or followers are included by default.


--- Jinchūriki Boosted (Requires Jinchūriki): The being within you has seen the bonds you share, and it approves. And so it has whispered certain secrets into your mind. Firstly, the speed at which each of you learn has been increased further, becoming almost ridiculous, particularly when at least one of you already knows any given skill and is teaching it to others. But that’s just one thing you can do. More than teaching, the demon has whispered to you the true power of friendship. That is, having your friends around you, and sharing each other’s power. No matter how far apart the members of your group are and what stands between you, you remain in perfect communication, able to silently transmit words and even feelings between each other. Furthermore, you can also share your chakra/mana/ki/etc. with them freely, or vice-versa over any distance, without fear of any negative effects, even where they might normally happen. While even the vast power of the bijuu might stretch thin if you tried to supply an entire army, your friends and companions will have stamina and energy as effectively inexhaustible as your own for as long as you permit it. ---"
600,Divine Favour,Generic Isekai,"The gods are pretty nice, giving all these boring Japaense people free reincarnations and cheat skills. However, they like you even more. The gods of this world and others are far friendlier to you than normal, giving you blessings and helping you out. Even malicious gods will leave you alone unless you directly act against them. Once per jump, the gods will also resurrect you if you die. You can choose to appear within a day before or after your death, or to restart the jump entirely. Post-chain the once-per-jump restriction is removed, but the gods only have so much power to spare."
600,The Strongest In The Universe!,Dragon Ball Z,"It’s a perfectly natural thing, fear. Fear of your betters, fear of an invincible foe, fear of impending doom as you turn a miserable planet of apes into a screaming ball of fire. And as you grow in power and might, it’s only natural that others should find themselves cowed by your name alone. Others can subconsciously sense your maximum power in combat and destruction, and react appropriately - with fear. Your equals become cautious, your inferiors beg for their lives. You can easily cow hundreds or even thousands into your service purely out of fear and force of personality, and as you grow in power, that number can extend to the millions...and as you grow stronger, perhaps even further beyond that. Certainly, some ‘strong-willed’ weaklings or stronger beings can resist you...but that just makes it more satisfying when you crush them. In addition to substituting fear for charm in all things, your reputation can also spread like wildfire, adding a mythical air to your dreaded name, causing others to pause or avoid your affairs if at all possible just to be spared your personal attention. Of course, should you prefer discretion...or worse, mercy (pah!), both of these effects can be deactivated or activated at will."
