Cost,Perk Name,Source,Description
100,"Oh, The Possibilities",Generic First Jump,"You have a gift for making the most of your resources. You can find clever or inventive ways of using your abilities or possessions, and figure out how to compensate for weaknesses or downsides. You are very creative when it comes to using your assets."
100,Secondary Superpowers,Generic First Jump,"Any power or ability that you acquire, no matter where or how you acquired it, you also receive the necessary secondary superpowers to make it function properly. You also have the ability to shut off any of your abilities, or to weaken them to any level between off and full power, at will."
100,Screw the Devil,Generic First Jump,"You are completely immune to any form of possession. Outside control might still work on you, but you are the only actual occupant of your body, mind and soul, and you are going to stay that way. If you allow something else to possess you, you can resume control and kick them out at will. Nothing can stop you from doing so, if that is what you want to do."
100,We Can Do More,Invincible,"You can do more than simply use your powers to fight others, much more. Now you have innate skill in using your powers in ways that are not focused around fighting but around healing, helping and rebuilding the world around you. Someone with matter manipulation would know the best ways to go about revitalizing old farmland and creating needed supplies for starving villages. A person with super strength could be of immense help with disaster relief or prevention. Regardless of what you can do, you have mastered the use of your power outside of a fight."
100,Passing Limits,One Piece: New World,"Limits are something meant to help protect yourself, but other times they simply hold you down. When the cards are down and you are running on dregs, should you have enough willpower, you can break these limits, no matter how small."
100,Toggle,Young Justice,"Toggle allows its user to forgo learning to control their powers by simply allowing them to turn their powers off when they aren't needed. This can be done per power, so there isn't a need to go without the ability to teleport because you don't want to use your super strength. Also works on out of Jump powers. You can think of this like a dial. It can be on, or full power, as well as off, or no power, and anywhere in between those two states."
100,Knows His Own Strength,Young Justice,"Even if you have the strength to bench-press mountains, you’ll never be too strong to safely beat up the bad guys without killing them."
100,Unravelling,Medaka Box Abnormal,"Sprinting is great and all, really, but it's not much use in life. How often is raw speed in that sense going to help, in anything from typing to fighting? But it looks like it's actually quite fitting for you. The faster you become in raw movement speed, the faster you are able to do any task at all. Becoming able to move faster than the speed of sound would let you accomplish hours of work in just minutes, with no loss in quality,    consideration or effective time spent on the project. You'll be moving and acting faster but be just as effective as if you took as much time as you normally would on the task you're working on."
100,Survival 101,Arifureta Shokugyou de Sekai Saikyou,"You don’t last long as an adventurer if you aren’t willing to learn, adapt and overcome. You have a good head on your shoulders and have learned the basics of surviving in the wild and the urban by knowing how to set up or find shelter, gathering food, and being wary of predators of all environments. You also have a good memory for learning from your seniors and elders, soaking up little bits of important information like a sponge absorbs water. Likewise, you got a knack to pick up odd jobs that either make use of your unusual talents or let you learn and practice something new that you were interested in"
100,That is Normal,Toaruverse,Dressing in skimpy outfit during a battle doesn’t bring any benefits and protection other than distraction for your opponents though it doesn’t work in most cases. The outfits that you now wear no matter how skimpy and doesn’t protect the vital parts of your body would do now. It doesn’t matter if you’re wearing a shorts or even a panty that is as durable as steel it would provide a protection throughout your body by making a thin layer of protective barrier that as durable as steel. This applies to anything that can be classified as clothe or armor.
100,Evolution,Pokemon Mystery Dungeon,"You know how I said you can be any unevolved Pokemon for free? Yeah, now you may start as an evolved form. You can purchase this as many times as you have evolutions available."
100,The Inevitable Quality,Tate no Yuusha no Nariagari,"When crafting it’s expected that even with good materials the result can be bad in the hands of inexperienced crafters. Unlike those inexperienced crafters the quality of your work doesn’t drop/lowered beyond the lowest quality of the materials you used. This means the better the materials used for crafting would still result in a better potion, equipment, clothes, accessories, food etc... even if you failed or made a mistake crafting it. While the quality is great it doesn’t mean it looks beautiful or awesome, in the case of the medicines it would taste bitter, for foods it would look gross but taste good and nutritious. With skills and experience the appearance can be improved."
100,Adaptable,Generic Worm Fanfiction,"You rapidly adapt to new circumstances and pick up on things quickly. In addition you can learn, train, and otherwise improve yourself in one-fifth the time you normally would."
100,Controlled Ascension,Battle Through the Heavens,"The time when one advances in strength is usually a cause for joy, however it does not always occur when one would want. It is possible for one to start having a breakthrough in the middle of the fight. As opposed to what may happen in other worlds, here this is not a good thing, as distractions during a breakthrough can easily lead to complications and backlash. It is even possible for you to end up regressing in strength. You can hold back your advancement for many days if you wish, giving you ample chance to find a quiet spot to advance."
100,Selectively Religious,KonoSuba,"As lovely as being so holy is, to the point that it’s even in your very blood, there are times when you’ll want to turn off that power. To do the right thing, you might need to debase yourself and work with undead abominations. For the greater good of course but it doesn’t stop the sense of innate disgust to the whole thing. At least with this, the ability to selectively deactivate any power that you have, you’ll not kill your temporary allies on touch. You’ll be able to turn off any ability that you have with a thought and turn it back on again just as easily, excepting this power of course, and even set conditions to deactivate or activate your powers."
200,What’s Mine Is Mine,Generic First Jump,"You never give up what is yours. Your abilities of any kind never fade or deteriorate with time or disuse. A skill not used for decades will be as effective as if you relied on it for daily survival. This also means you are likely to age gracefully and healthily, though it does not extend your lifespan beyond what having the immune system and healing of a person in their prime would do."
200,Shattered Shaft,Bleach,"Nothing can keep a hero down for long, not even losing what makes him a hero in the first place. As long as you hold your convictions strongly in your heart, you’ll find it possible to regain power that has been lost. Partially and in full, for both supernatural powers and more mundane sources of influencing the world. Even having had your spiritual powers cut out of you, a path will unveil itself to you in order to regain them. But these paths are dangerous and risky, offering a quick regain of what you lost at the price of putting your life on the line, or perhaps something nearly as valuable. Lost spiritual powers could be forcibly reawakened, or new equivalents gained, by subjecting yourself to near-hollowfication and emerging victorious against your partially corrupted self. Another comparison might be the training the Quincies undergo to recover their powers once they use Letz Stil, training to exhaustion and then requiring an arrow fired to an exact spot on their hearts."
200,Quirk Proficiency,My Hero Academia,"I see you’ve tussled with the boys and girls in spandex before! Was it beside them. . or against them? Can’t quite remember! Regardless, over those years of flexing and accumulating experience, something spectacular has happened! You got good! Ordinarily you would have no experience with making use of your Quirk. Sure you might be well aware of what it does, but in this world that regulates their usage you never really got to train it, experiment. By purchasing this, you obtain two important things, with the first being training. Ever since you were young, you’ve been able to experiment with your Quirk in an environment that allowed you to figure out the nuances, strengths and weaknesses. You could have attended a prestigious hero school and learned from some recognizable names in the industry. You could have picked things up through trial and error in the criminal underworld. It could just be an overbearing pair of parents that beat it into you. You definitely know how your Quirk though. The second advantage is experience, several years worth of experience in applying your Quirk. Perhaps you’ve figure out a neat trick or two that no one could have predicted. Perhaps you’ve mixed in complementary skills into your Quirk usage. Something else? Whatever the case, you’re great!"
200,"Man of Steel, Woman of Kleenex",Invincible,"*CRACK*, you broke something again, this super strength is definitely taking some getting used to. At least it was. For some reason when you woke up this morning it seems like something is working perfectly in your brain and now your powers are modulated to whatever you desire. If you had super-strength enough to destroy planets, now you can juggle Faberge Eggs without fear of breaking. You might be able to manipulate fire on par with stars but now you find you can use it so finely that you could light the head of a match on fire. Use your star shattering telekinesis to manipulate an atom, why not? It doesn’t matter what you do but now you have perfect conscious control and modulation of any and all powers or abilities that you possess: even in things that may be considered unconscious actions, you may consciously control how fast your heart beats, your core temperature or the strength of rapid muscular contractions. That said this doesn’t let you do things with your powers that you couldn’t normally. If your “star shattering telekinesis”, for example, couldn’t normally control or affect things on an atomic scale this perk wouldn’t change that. This is just control and refinement when using your powers in ways they can already be used, it doesn’t actually expand what your powers are capable of."
200,Limit Break,Final Fantasy 7 Remake,"Normally a person gets more tired as they fight, losing effectiveness as time goes on. But not the champions of Gaia! The fighters of this world have Limit Breaks; special techniques they can execute after enough successful hits. Now you have one of these devastating techniques. Landing more sequential hits and combos will prepare these techniques faster. Each Limit Break has a special effect, whether it be inflicting extra damage, debuffing an enemy, or buffing your allies. Though you only start with a single basic Limit Break, you can unlock more through combat experience and training."
200,Applications,To Love-Ru,"Who needs a carjack when they have superstrength? You sure don’t. In fact, you are really good at applying superpowers to mundane applications, no matter if it’s cooking, cleaning or mechanics, and these small uses of your abilities somehow always go unnoticed."
200,My Powers Work,Toaruverse,"Fighting an opponent that is intangible or a being of pure would only tire you out or get yourself killed especially if your abilities and powers doesn’t interact with them at all. Your abilities or powers now work on abilities powers and beings that normally cannot be touched, interact with your abilities and powers or have condition to defeat or harm. It doesn’t matter if your enemy is intangible or made of pure energy your abilities and powers will hit and kill them even if they have multiple bodies as killing one body would kill them all and if they have resurrection ability when you kill them they die permanently."
200,Monster Hunter,RWBY,"You hunt monsters for a living. It’s what you do and you’re damn good at it. Anytime you’re fighting creatures that could be considered monstrous, you’ll have an easier time dealing with them and will quickly find their weak points. In addition, in future Jumps, you’ll always be able to find jobs hunting down and killing creatures for cash. This will vary in effect based on the Jump."
200,What’s This Doohickey?,Campione,"Ah, supernatural powers. They don’t come with an instruction manual, be it the magic of mortals, the Authorities of Gods or something else entirely, one needs to get their exact limits and improve themselves by trial and error. Well not anymore, this little blessing works to take care of that. Now, you gain an innate knowledge of how to use any new powers you acquire, as well as their limitations and advantages. Doesn’t sound like much until you get a power-up in the middle of a battle and you realize you don’t know how to use it. Embarrassing."
200,Unified Specialty,Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation,"When someone tries to train and master Martial Arts and Magic they have to train them individually which consumes a lot of time, but this would solve that problem. This unifies and links all of your physical and magical attributes so that when one grows, the other grows to match it. This is not a recursive loop; it simply balances things out such that whichever is lower is raised up to the level of the higher. In this case your Battle Aura and Mana Reserves are always in balance thus a God-Rank Magician would have a Battle Aura and Physical Feats of a God-Rank Warrior and vice versa. In future jumps, your physical attributes will scale to match your magic and vice-versa."
200,Defiance Of A Madman,Arifureta Shokugyou de Sekai Saikyou,"Skills, the bread and butter of everyone worth their salt. Magic may be available to everyone, talent notwithstanding. But skills? Those are rare, those are unique to the Job, unique to the race. So unjust. Why? Something stirred within yourself and a power was born. The ability to copy any Skill, as long as you see it fully at work, you will gain a decent understanding of its inner machinations and how to obtain a derivative skill that has the same effects. A good look to the ‘Limit Break’ Skill would tell you how to obtain something that boosts your power as much as the skill does. Even if that means courting death a few times."
200,The Way of Life,Toaruverse,Killing someone is easy but there are times that killing is only the last resort to save someone. With this all of your abilities and powers now have a special function. Where you can change all of your abilities and powers to non-lethal allowing you to use even the most destructive abilities without killing and knocking your opponents no matter how lethal that said abilities and powers suppose to be originally. The damage in this mode only applies to the surroundings and non-organic things and organic things and people would only feel one hell of a pain but still alive.
200,Naturally Skilled,Akame ga Kill,"You are naturally skilled at various things, and tend to pick up skills quickly. From bouncing a ball on your feet on the first try to picking up smithing it's all easy for you."
200,Revengeance,Generic Isekai,"You’ve been wronged, and you’ll never forget it so long as you wish for it to consume you. Your anger becomes a fuel that greatly increases your effectiveness when working towards your revenge, scaling to the gravity of the crime and the potency of your suffering. If you wish, you’ll also have a much easier time finding other revenge-seekers to help you on your quest. You can even inspire these feelings of rebellion in others who aren’t as far gone as you."
200,Powerpedia,Medaka Box Abnormal,"The more you stack up, the more confusing it gets to keep them all sorted. You’re probably already in the habit of collecting a wide array of abilities and it’ll only get worse from here. So it’s good that you’re now able to not only have a complete awareness of every ability and power that you have at all times but also all of their potential uses and combinations with each other. Even creative, obscure combinations between two seemingly irrelevant powers are immediately revealed to you upon possessing both of them."
200,New Testament,Medaka Box Abnormal,"You can make as many plans as you want for things but you won’t always be able to put them into motion. Being cut in half does that to you. Now you can put in a little insurance. You’re able to set conditions for any power or ability that you possess, including things like spells, to activate based on conditions. You can set a fireball to activate on a time delay, have a shield spell go off when you’re hurt beyond a certain level or even have a self-destruct ability automatically occur when you die even if you wouldn’t have time to activate it. Each ability can only have a single condition at a time and each condition takes a minute of concentration to set, needing to be replaced once the condition is fulfilled once. Conditions must also relate to single use cases."
200,Ad Hoc Attack,Medaka Box Abnormal,"What goes around, always comes back around. What goes up must come down. When you hit something, they'll always find themselves coming back for a second blow. Any attack that you make against someone is repeated against them a second later, whether it be a punch or a spell or a use of your powers. This secondary attack costs nothing from you but will only target the same place as the initial attack and be the same in every way as that attack."
200,Hyper Dash Wit,Medaka Box Abnormal,"Technically, there's not meant to be a benefit to acting cool in a fight. Being realistic, it's always more effective to just keep efficient and not show off. But we're in a manga, not real life. The more cool and over dramatic you act? The stronger you get. When you're in a fight and purposefully show off, act cool or get over dramatic, you'll find yourself steadily powering up more and more. The power up will leave you once the fight ends though, even if you manage a super cool climactic finisher move with an awesome one liner to send off your opponent."
200,Cruelty User,Medaka Box Abnormal,"A nasty guy like you probably shouldn’t get rewarded for being so mean but the world has never been a fair place. When you taunt and insult and act rudely towards an opponent, you’ll be able to empower yourself and become more and more monstrous the worse your opponent views your words. The ruder your speech seems to them, the stronger you’ll become. Throwing out your best swear words against a tough sailor probably won’t see more than a slight thickening of your skin but against a real prude who’s been raised in a sheltered home to always respect others...well, don’t be surprised if you can start knocking buildings down by brushing past them with your enormous body."
200,Intelligent Design,With This Ring,"​There are two ways that complex systems and objects come into being: evolution and design. Both processes create general trends in their products. Your innate supernatural powers gain the benefits of being designed: efficiency and rigidity. Using your powers takes less stamina and should you rely on an internal pool of energy, your use of that energy will be more efficient. Furthermore, the effects of power suppression will be very hit or miss on individual powers: No schizo-tech collar suppressing a metagene will affect muscles that you have already grown, but a psi baffle will still work effectively on most forms of telepathy."
300,The Realm of Heroes​,Overlord,"You have stepped into a realm that only the greatest that have ever lived can truthfully claim to be a part of. If you are a Warrior you could potentially cut down an army of a thousand regular men all by yourself, and would be capable of feats of skill and martial prowess that would leave regular folk in stunned awe of your capabilities, and have them whispering that maybe you aren’t a mortal at all. If you are a Magic Caster you are capable of spells up to the sixth tier, believed to be the highest tier of magic that a mortal could possibly ever achieve. Spells of the sixth tier can perform things that would be miraculous to the common folk, such as resurrecting the dead, teleporting over unbelievable distances without error, summoning forth powerful creatures as servitors, or potentially casting spells that would let you defeat upwards of a hundred men with no more than a few words and gestures. If you are a Generalist your luck, wit, cunning, and skill are so profound that you have an answer for virtually every situation, and while your combat prowess won’t be as great as a warrior of the same level, and your magic won’t be as good as a magic caster of the same level, you’ll far outstrip anyone that isn’t in the realm of heroes in those abilities."
300,Blessed by the Gods,Marvel Cinematic Universe Vol. 1,"Asgard is a wondrous place, you know. Existing for thousands of years, with advanced magic and technology that would see them rise to become a city of gods... it is little wonder that they are both feared and praised throughout the Nine Realms. The royalty however, has a penchant for adopting strays if Loki is any indication. You have been likewise adopted by Odin and raised as a member of the royal family to be great like them. Not only have you been augmented by Asgardian magics to a truly attractive state that you would feel qualifies as an appearance booster, but you display a great willpower and determination to see your goals and plans through with a very strong learning aptitude to absorb information like a sponge beyond even Tony Stark as befitting of Odin's adoptive child."
300,Do One Thing At A Time,Dinotopia,"When you focus yourself on doing a single task, your skill and efficiency doubles. Material requirements are unaffected, but time taken is halved and quality is doubled"
300,Our Darkest Hour,Star Trek – TNG + DS9,"With this perk you'll find yourself getting stronger as your situation becomes more desperate. Whenever you're in a dangerous or life-treating situation, you'll be able to think faster and more clearly, and your physical abilities will be doubled."
300,Empowered Quirk,My Hero Academia,"Some people get a bad hand, landing a Quirk that feels just a bit weak or limited compared to the ones other people got. While you’ll be able to choose your own Quirk, you may still wish it was a bit beefier than how it starts out. That’s where this comes in, allowing you to take your Quirk to another level. With each purchase, you may take your current Quirk and increase its Tier by one level, though Tier-3 Quirks or those boosted to Tier-3 are no longer applicable. This allows you to increase the quality of your Quirk in a variety of ways. This includes having the main function become more potent, having flaws lessened in one way or another, making it more versatile or just an all-around boost in general ability. As long as it’s thematic, you may choose what direction it’s taken. Through this perk, a Quirk taken from Tier-0 to Tier-3 after multiple purchases would gain equivalent power and/or utility to others found on that tier. Flaws may not be entirely erased even if all emphasis is put in."
300,Level Up,Is It Wrong To Try To Pick Up Girls In A Dungeon?,"You’re now no longer a low-level, level one adventurer. Through a heroic deed or deeds you have increased your Level by one. You can purchase this repeatedly - the highest ranked adventurer in Orario at this time is Ottar, a Level Seven member of the Freya Familia. Promotion marks you as one of the elite - an adventurer who can enter the middle or even deeper dungeon levels. Oh, and each promotion marks a significant boost to your abilities and a nifty title from the Gods. Each time you level your abilities ratings are reset to I for the new level (You don’t actually lose your prior ability, it’s just the rating - see the notes). You may also gain one Advanced Ability, a powerful and significant skill in one area you focus on."
400,Harmony,Generic First Jump,"Sometimes, the things you are collecting will clash with each other or are difficult to use together. That is no longer the case. You could safely use both the Dark and Light sides of the Force, channel both divine and demonic energies, wield conflicting forms of magic or energy, mix radically different technologies or biologies, even keep your entire harem in one place, and they will all get along with each other. They will get along with you as well. None of your abilities, possessions, Companions or anything else that belongs to you in some way will be able to harm, corrupt, or alter you against your will."
400,Hard Work Pays Dividends,Generic First Jump,"Being the best takes work. You have to spend the time and put in the effort to maximize your potential. Thankfully, the time and effort you require is a bit less than for most people. Any form of training or advancement works five times faster for you than it otherwise would."
400,You Have Been Reborn,Invincible,"You have somehow been caught in a time machine accident, and have been reconstituted with molecules from millions of years in the future. Thanks to this you have you have become better than you once were, far better. You have gained slightly beyond peak human physical and mental attributes, and neither your body or skills ever degrade in any way due to the passing of time or lack of exertion. Given time and effort you could easily win the entire Olympics if you’d like, break world records daily, become the greatest Chess Master in the world, these are all now possible for you. Beyond this however you have gained a minor ability to use Telekinesis. Able to use Telekinesis to lift a maximum of 10 lbs currently, though should you train enough this ability will quickly grow seemingly without limit. Given a year or two, you might be able to lift houses with no effort. More than this however these future atoms seem to have had an interesting effect on your existing abilities and will operate as a Capstone Booster on all capstones."
400,Watch Out!,My Hero Academia,"“With great power, comes great responsibility! You must always take care of your surroundings when you flex your might in the pursuit of justice!” Upon purchase you and your abilities will become more apt for heroic usage, dramatically reducing collateral damage and allowing you to better think of way to benefit from your environment instead of feeling inhibited by it. You’ll be able to stay aware of your current options and positions even on the fly so you don’t hurt bystanders or damage buildings. Abilities in general seem more likely to bend, sway or flow away/around structures or individuals you aren’t targeting. You won’t be able to make everything work, all the time. Detonating a massive blast in a confined space with allies or non-targets will still probably hurt them. But even the most mild of caution will allow you to undertake clean hero work."
400,The Name Means To Protect,Bleach,"Only for the sake of others, do you find your truest power unleashed. Being exerted through the soul, Reiryoku naturally increases as emotions burn hot but more than most, you find your power running wild when you fight for the safety and happiness of another person. Spiritually, mentally and physically, you find your power growing temporarily while directly in need to protect another, with this benefit increasing depending on how closely bonded you are and how desperate the need for help is. A stranger being beaten up by bullies might only inspire increased confidence in your own abilities than any true growth in power. The same strange about to be slain by a hungry Hollow, desperately calling for help? You could fight on even when exhausted as energy temporarily fills you to a little more than your normal limit. But something like a dear friend begging for you to stand up and fight again, their one saviour to whom they entrust their heart, could even bring you back from the dead and force you to an entirely new level of strength. The power gained will leave once the danger ends and too much power gained at once can leave you tired, drained or even unconscious for a while."
400,Demolition Man,Campione!,"You’ll have to forgive others for the title, given you could very well be mistaken for an avatar of destruction with how much ruin lies in your wake. The bright smile you have on your face the more damage you dish out doesn’t help either. Seemingly predestined to destroy all you touch; your actions and powers have a talent for causing more damage than reasonably possible with every step. While this doesn’t help in direct combat, the surroundings come apart with frightening ease such that even a simple exchange between equals could leave a noticeable scar on a city or an all-out brawl demoting it to village status. Of course, you can reign over the amount of collateral damage in any fight you partake on, from none to destroying the roman colosseum in a friendly spar."
400,Instinct,X-Men Evolution,"It’s a bother to train superpowers to make them stronger and figure out what makes them tick. This isn’t the case for you anymore as you can instantly master any power no matter the complexity without need for training and can draw out the full potential of any ability immediately. The instinct isn’t just limited to general powers but for anything else you may have such as special skills, innate abilities/energies, biological powers, etc. This instinct comes with having a perfect understanding of all your powers from every little quirk, nuance, strength, and weakness that your powers possess. Due to this you have perfect control over every single aspect of your powers and abilities that will not be affected by internal or external forces. Powers will never go out of control or anything that you find even slightly inconvenient. This control allows you do crazy things such as throwing an insanely hot fireball that melts through your enemies but bounces off surfaces and doesn’t harm even a single blade of grass. Collateral damage is now forever a thing of the past as you’ll always know how to best utilize any power for whatever situation and will know just how much power needed to put into things like knocking someone out or going for more drastic measures. Whether you’re combining powers, coming up with new uses, or even something else entirely you may be able to use a power in a situation in just the right way that can mean the difference between life or death."
400,Jamming Immunity,Toaruverse,"There are many things like magic or technology that exists to disrupt or weaken everyone’s abilities especially for Espers but unlike them you are far too dif erent. You are now immune to any supernatural ability and technology that would try disrupts, weaken, nullify, erase and manipulate your abilities or powers making you always able to use your abilities even in a no power zones or in the presence and contact with the Imagine Breaker. This also applies to technologies that you wield that things that would normally disrupt or make them malfunction would not take effect."
400,I Want To Be A Hero,RWBY,"You’ve always dreamed of being a hero, and now it’s time to become one. Your training yields extreme results, allowing you to learn new things at a rapid pace. A fighting style that takes years to master? You’ll be competent in a week and a master by the end of the month. This also speeds up your physical training to match, giving you the ability to quickly reach your true potential so long as you dedicate time to training. This applies to anything that you put effort towards making stronger."
400,With Great Power Comes Great Leisure,Chronicle,"The power you have at your disposal is enough to make you untouchable to most anything you might encounter, true. But even you have weaknesses. If you don’t concentrate to keep up your defences, or aren’t quick enough to raise them, you are just another human, with all the vulnerabilities that entails. But no more. Pondering over this problem, and possible solutions to it, has caused you to gain quite an interesting skill. You no longer need to focus your concentration on abilities you wish to use. Wanna spend your whole life being surrounded by a forcefield without ever thinking about it? Why the hell not, as long as you can take the strain. You don’t even need to be conscious for your power to keep on working: if you wanted to, you could set your cruise speed to a comfortable tempo, fall asleep, and wake up having flown to the Bahamas for a quick vacation. You can also set up your powers to do some more complicated stuff, such as making a camera fly around and film you or automatically repelling everything within a set distance of yourself. Do keep in mind that all this is simply you unconsciously directing your abilities, so they will still cost whatever they usually do: take care not to die because you forgot to turn off an exhausting ability. But if you play it smart, you’ll find that it’ll at least decrease the chance of getting shot in the back."
400,Skill Sharing,Generic Isekai,"Whenever you kill something, or, if you are merciful, merely beat them within an inch of their life, you may gain one of their skills for yourself. This may be anything from their Sword Mastery or their Singing. If you did not kill your victim, you may choose whether you steal their skill or merely copy it. This effect can only be used once per individual. You may also temporarily copy every skill and ability you have to a single other person, by touching them. They will have all your powers, and know everything you know about how to use them. This wears off after one day, unless you refresh it."
400,Experience Booster,Generic Gamer,"It’s not uncommon for a story to have its main character progress in power rapidly, far faster than anyone ever has. In the Gamer and the stories it’s inspired, this trope is actually built into the main character’s power. You’ll have access to that even without this, but if you’re looking to make even that look like chump change, then this is the Perk for you, as whatever development or training you undergo becomes a hundred times more effective than it otherwise would be."
400,Growth Cheat,Generic Isekai,"Whether it’s a product of reduced experience cost, increased experience gains, or a combination of both, this perk alone makes you grow at 400 times your normal rate."
400,Slipping Chains,Campione,"The greatest power in this world have conditions to their use. Anything from standing in sunlight to being at death’s door to fight back depending on which Authority you hold. Oftentimes just setting things up to begin fighting could leave you dead on the ground if everything doesn’t line up just right. In your case the chains that bind have been coated in grease. Sunlight could be replaced by electronic lights in great enough quantity, or perhaps a ludicrously sized fireball. Defending a fair maiden could become defending anyone, and one the verge of death could become grievously wounded. The core idea remains the same, but achieving them becomes far easier. You’ll find this slippery nature applying to any conditional otherworldly abilities you come to possess, should you have them at all."
400,Hard Work Overcomes All,All-Star Superman,"​: You may not have superpowers. Indeed, you may be dwarfed in comparison to the Kryptonian or just the many heroes of planet Earth. That’s fine. Humans got where they did with hard work and dedication, not innate power. You will fin efforts you make to improve your body through training, your skills and abilities through pushing them to their limits or experimentation, and more will yield results more quickly. Should you be a studious or a creating type, you will find science and studies will open the way to breakthroughs a bit more quickly than they normally would for you, as well."
400,Do You Stop Believing in the Sun When the Moon Comes Up?,Rise of the Guardians,"A Spirit’s, and particularly a Guardian’s, power is tied not only to how many people believe in them, but also to how much what they represent is present in the world. Pitch takes advantage of this, kidnapping fairies and stealing teeth to weaken the Tooth Fairy, but also destroying all of the eggs to weaken the Easter Bunny, not only erasing the children’s hope and their belief in them, but also removing their ability to recall happier times. And, in doing so, he makes the Guardians no better than mortals. Luckily, you don’t have to worry about that. If you have power tied to how much people believe in you, or even how much of some particular concept is present in the world, then your power may stall, but it shall never wane. Even if you had no believers, you’d still be able to access maybe a tenth of your powers. But even if you went from millions of believers to none, you would be unaffected, because once you have a certain amount, no matter how high, your power will always treat that as the new minimum. Though, if you want to increase your power further, you’ll need to get back up above that new minimum.


--- Capstone-Boosted (Requires Guardian): Ordinarily, this Perk would only take into account believers and the prevalence of your Center in your current world, but boosted in this way, your power shall count even those from previous Jumps. There is truly no limit to how strong you may grow. ---"
400,Link Box,Pokemon Mystery Dungeon,"The Humble Link Box, an item of… arguable usefulness. Normally only useful to link two or more moves on the move, allowing them to be used rapidly during battle, this one is special. Not only does it not break apart when used but it can “Link” your various perks, creating more powerful ones from the hybridization with linear improvement. Meaning for example that speed increasing perks will add their kilometers per hour onto one another. Another function of this item is that you may link two attributes, such as intelligence and strength, to one another, which results in them gaining a bonus equal to their opposite’s base stat. Note that Perks can only be combined with similar or related perks and a perk that has been made from linking two or more together may not be used to link with another for one year."
400,Resistance from Effects,Tate no Yuusha no Nariagari,"You’re not a shikigami but you have abilities similar to one that can help your companions. Any type of curse from abilities, magic or items fails to take hold on you as like a shikigami’s you become immune to curse. That’s not the end of it, you even become resistant to all negative status effects like debuffs, poison and etc... even the ones come from the cursed series and mitigate those that manage to bypass the resistance. The best part is you can resist and mitigate the effects of the cursed series of other heroes from affecting you. Even raph-chan needs physical contact to grant this protection to another person but since you’re a Jumper you can extend this immunity to curse and resistance to negative status effects to your friends, companions or pet by just them being your party members."
400,Unlimiter,Generic Naruto Fanfiction,"Your potential knows no bounds. Even with everything that chakra can do, other ninjas eventually reach a limit on how strong or fast or agile they can be, how much chakra they can store or channel, etc. But not you. Never you. You have the capacity for limitless growth inside of you breaking all of the natural limits on the human body, mind, or soul. With enough training you could eventually grow to equal the gods and then to surpass them. Furthermore, your potential stands unlimited in another way as well. Normally, gaining a skill or ability changes people. Muscles develop along a certain way, the nature of their chakra changes, and a thousand and one other things. The point is that this tends to reduce the extent to which they can learn other things. With you... that just doesn’t happen. No matter what you learn and what you train in, your ability to master other skills remains completely unaffected. It doesn’t even matter if it’s somehow a requirement for you to toss aside other arts to progress in one, you can ignore that and go right ahead all the same. This applies to any skills you have already acquired as well. Time, atrophy, curses, nothing short of jump-fiat can make you lose an iota of your ability, come hell or high water. Even deliberate attempts to cripple your capacity will always fail short of actual destruction of the relevant body parts. In case the last does happen, you can be assured that while this does nothing to speed it up, you will heal from such damage. Finally, you yourself are also protected from the effects of your arts, such that even the most dangerous techniques or abilities you ever use can only do temporary damage at worst, even if said damage is an intrinsic part of their function."
400,MASTER OF THE MIND AND BODY,Medaka Box Abnormal,"An Abnormality is in a sense, just another part of your body, controlled by you as if it were another limb. For some it grows to be a little more than that, though still most definitely a part of you. You’re able to set your powers to operate automatically and independently of your own mind, giving them a limited awareness of your body and the area around you. These powers still draw from you for any costs but will otherwise act automatically to protect and serve you. You may set as many powers to this state as you wish and reverse it at any time. A power to control the elements could form into shields or attacks against those hostile to you for example. These powers can only sense for a few feet around you on their own but otherwise act as if you were controlling them in regards to speed of reactions and skill of use."
400,Concept Ball,Medaka Box Abnormal,"When two combatants reach a certain level of power, fighting becomes a bit pointless. When both of you are Immovable Objects and Unstoppable Forces, you’re just going to be pointlessly nudging against each other. Well, if you were equal you would be. But you’re Not Equal. Whenever your own abilities that are meant to be without peer come into conflict with another such ability, yours trumps theirs. A blow that can pierce anything will tear through a defence that can block anything when you are using it. Your absolutes are more so, simply for the fact that you are the one using them."
400,Humor Contrast,Medaka Box Abnormal,"Never accept that someone can outmatch you forever, not when you are what you are. While being unequal to someone else might sound fitting to them because of what you are, you're just not the sort to accept that. When you find yourself facing someone that is stronger than you in a fight, you'll also find that your level of power begins to steadily rise to match theirs. This increase is permanent and the rate is quite fast, though it does not scale up as your opponents get stronger. The stronger your opponent is in comparison to you, the faster you will grow but this increase gets less and less the stronger your foe is."
400,Killer Queen,Campione!,"Once Pandora’s binding fades from the minds of the Divine Ancestors, there can be only one thought that crosses their mind. To reclaim their missing power. Thus far, there have been only mild successes, with most failing altogether or worse, coming down with a severe case of inbound Campione. Should you find something lost to you, sealed away, stolen, or something else altogether, you will find it far easier than it ought to be to either reclaim that missing power, or to steal something equal in value from another. It should also be noted that you also possess the skills at politics and backstabbing to gain assistance from other Divine Ancestors, and that your attempts are always more successful - and rewarding - than theirs. In fact, why don’t you go ahead and calculate the interest on this forced loan? Because that too will be yours in time. In short? The farther you fall, the farther you rise."
400,S Or M,KonoSuba,"A woman that can’t hit the broadside of a barn if her nose was pressed against it or a man that gets taken out of the fight from an idle slap. Neither sounds terribly useful in the long run and yet each have their own unique uses. You’re able to take on either of these traits at will, changing from your normal level to one of these extremes and back again with just a few seconds of concentration. You can give up all of your offensive ability to multiply your defensive abilities several times over or vice versa. It’s a whole lot more attack or defence but it will come at the cost of the other, so only use it when you’re sure it can pay off."
400,"Most Powerful, Most Beautiful",Akame ga Kill,"You have become both incredibly powerful(physically/spiritually), and incredibly beautiful, what's more the two things have become linked. Meaning that, while this is a small effect, the more beautiful you are, the more powerful this will make you, or the more powerful you are, the more beautiful this will make you. You may also see a small benefit as you grow in power, or beauty, such that the other grows, though you may have to double(or triple) one or the other to see a noticeable effect."
600,Full Power,Generic Fist Jump,"Despite the need for control in the ring, your training and perfected technique can also allow you to unleash your full strength, even with what most spectators would think are weak blows. This allows tricks like the famous one-inch punch. Also, this is your true full strength, which can considerably exceed your normal limits. You can easily learn to do this with any other form of attack you possess."
600,Hyperspecialization,Generic Gamer,"There’s focusing in a few specific areas, and then there’s this. Select a single skill, ability, power, Perk, whatever. At base, two things happen. A: the chosen ability progresses as if you’re training with it all the time, even when you’re doing nothing; if you were to actively train with it, the rate of growth would be effectively doubled. B: the rate of growth and development for the chosen ability is multiplied by a hundred. Now, keep in mind that that’s just at base — both of these boosts increase gradually but exponentially the longer you focus on a single ability. Give it a few days, and the rate of growth will be multiplied by two hundred; a month, and by a thousand. You can change what ability you’re focusing on at any time, at the cost of resetting the boosts."
600,Master of All,Generic Gamer,"Specialists focus on depth at the expense of breadth; generalists focus on breadth at the expense of depth. But what if you could focus on a single ability and have it benefit all of them? When you train one skill, ability, or power, that training and development applies not just to it, but to all of the skills, abilities, and powers you possess."
600,ABNORMAL GROWTHS,Medaka Box Abnormal,"Abnormalities disappear, usually anyway, once the user reaches adulthood. They grow out of ending such silly delusions and become properly grown adults. But until that point, the Abnormalities grow stronger and stronger as the children grow nearer to maturity. Your powers do the same as well now, slowly growing in power and utility as you age. They’ll improve in power and effectiveness, possibly even gaining new side abilities or uses as time goes on. However, any innate drawbacks to the power, if it has any, will grow alongside it. Thus, you may choose which powers will grow with age and when to stop this growth effect, though it will not stop any of them disappearing with age."
600,[Jumper System],Medaka Box Abnormal,"Mighty as an Minus can be, it is only once they move beyond just swimming in their own despair that they become truly strong. Whether it be growing as a person to be more than just a negative or to expanding their powers to more than just a single instance, growth remains the most vital. You’re able to simulate the latter at least, through the creation of Systems. Groups of two or three powers working in step with each other. This allows you to partially combine those abilities, sharing traits between them. Combining an ability that allows you to automatically react to and block attacks with one that allows you to control an element such as fire or earth would then let you have your elemental power automatically act to defend you."
600,Lifting Yourself Up,Chronicle,"The powers you have gained here work just like an invisible muscle. Ignore them, and they will stagnate. But actively use and train them, and you will see just how far dedication can take you. And now, all other abilities in your repertoire gain the same potential. Exercising your powers will increase their strength, no matter of what nature they might be or how mighty they already are. Unlike normal exercise, where after a certain point further progress becomes simply impossible, you will always see the same gains if you keep on putting in the time and effort. Don't neglect you real muscles, though. Playing superman is only fun if you also look the part."
600,Highway to Hell,Campione!,"For all the power of the Heretic Gods, they are limited in harsh ways. Whatever power they gained in their worship, whatever names they took and causes they championed, are now their chains. Rumor, myth, and legend give them power, but a power without one of those is one they cannot possess. Even the queen of the divine ancestors, Guinevere, accidentally created a new god during an attempt to empower her king. You might know him as Arthur. Rebelling against their own story, or perhaps more importantly, the fact that it is over, caused the gods to transition from truly divine to ‘heretic’. You, however, have actually succeeded. You are capable of growth even when growth ought to be impossible, of changing your nature as a God without becoming [Heretical] in the process. This power bleeds out to the rest of you, letting you overcome any set limit, like striking twice with a weapon only usable every ten years, or maybe something as simple as learning a skill that you do not meet the requirements to learn. Your continual growth might as well be a fact of existence."
600,Hero,That Time I Was Reincarnated as a Slime,"Heroes are the Human or humanity/good aligned equivalent of the Demon Lord, meaning they are equal existences through the eyes of the Voice of the World. They are the opposites of the same coin. Unlike Demon Lords, however, their existence is extremely rare, even more, rare than a True Dragons that number only three or four. They are said to be an existence that appears only once in a thousand years. Perhaps due to this reason, newly born Heroes are also possibly stronger than newly born Demon Lords. Also unlike Demon Lords, Heroes are always Human, meaning they are a human-specific existence. But I’ll allow you to buy it as a Humanlike race. To become Heroes, a Human generally needs to have a selfless and caring person even if they have a particular goal in mind that they are chasing after. If so, as long as the person is strong enough and has done many acts of good, out of the good of their heart for the sake of humanity, the Voice of the World will grant them the Hero's Egg. The Hero's Egg is a skill which is also not a skill. It has no other purpose but to awaken its bearer into a Hero once the conditions have been met. It gives no additional abilities nor skills but it does protect its wielder from attack prediction abilities. Afterward, the only step remaining would be to 'hatch' the egg. Although it sounds simple, it is actually more difficult a task than the Demon Lord's 'collection of 10,000 souls', since the Hero's Egg seems to only hatch by the strong willpower and conviction of the bearer. The person needs to truly know right from wrong and believe that what they are doing is a righteous act, and also be willing to face death for that conviction. Your egg has already hatched and your body has been reconstructed and your lifespan was increased, you are immensely stronger than before and a skill of your choosing has evolved to its next level. You receive a discount on a purchase of Ultimate Skill.You may eventually evolve into  a Demi God, an existence on par with True Dragons."
600,Realis Phase,Is It Wrong To Try To Pick Up Girls In A Dungeon?,"You’ve developed the same unheard of skill as Bell Cranel, driving your rate of advancement through the roof. Every purchase of Excelia is discounted and you can take ranks of SS and SSS in your Basic Abilities. There is a requirement to this skill however. You must set yourself a goal, and you must chase after that goal without fail. It could be as simple as ‘make the best sword I could possibly make’ or as difficult as ‘reach the bottom of the Dungeon... the hard way’’. So long as you are striving to complete the goal you will advance at an astronomical rate. Naturally this skill is a result of you having the drive to actually pursue such a goal, so it also comes with some pretty decent willpower and determination to ensure you’re willing to go out there and get it done. If you complete a given goal you may select a new one, and indeed you must select a new one or the perk won’t work."
600,The Hero Curve,Invincible,"You, my friend, are a hero, and it wouldn’t do to lose time that could be spent saving people on studying for a math test. It may be the rays that have empowered you, the radioactive liquid that you drank, your inhuman genetic code, or something else entirely but your brain and body have been supercharged. You learn, grow, and master things incredibly quickly. This boost has resulted in you growing, learning, and mastering things at a hundred times the speed that it took you before. Physical techniques, knowledge, philosophy you learn anything at this speed. Don’t worry about that math test, a thirty second skim through the textbook, and you’ll get marks like you studied for about an hour. Learn something for a day and it is like you spent two months mastering it.


--- Capstone Boosted (Requires You Have Been Reborn): These atoms seem to have really boosted how quickly you learn and comprehend things. Now you learn facts, skills, and knowledge at ten times the prior rate, or one thousand times what you could do before. But, you have an added boost: you have an instinctive mastery of every tool that you pick up from the moment that you pick it up. Pick up a gun and shoot like a pro, grab a plow and till the fields like a master. While this alone would not make you a master surgeon, as you still lack the knowledge required to know where and what to cut. Picking up a scalpel would allow you to use it as accurately as a neurosurgeon, a needle and suture material would allow you to stitch like a master plastic surgeon. ---"
600,Put Your Back Into It!,My Hero Academia,"“Chips are down, you’re in serious trouble, against the hardest fight in your life. What do you do? Are you going to let the people down!? I didn’t think so! Even if you only have one last move left in you, you’re going to give it everything you have!” This perk allows you to dump every ounce of stamina you have into one, big, final coup de grace attack. Even if you’re exhausted and on death’s door, this attack would be as strong as if you were in top condition during your prime. When you’re not exhausted though, actually in perfect condition and well rested? This attack would be greater than even the best of what you can normally put out, many times over actually. After this coup de grace attack, that’s it though, you’re going to be running on empty and likely out of the fight completely. Whatever you’re throwing out, you better make it count. Important to note, this perk can be used with other things you can spend a personal resource on and overcharge, such as magic and a spell, but will exhaust you completely no matter what it is you’re using it on due to its all or nothing nature."
600,Power Surge,X-Men Evolution,"When your powers just aren’t strong enough for a situation a little more oomph is a lifesaver. You can now forcibly ‘evolve’ your powers to make them better than before for a few hours at the start. This surged mode makes you astronomically stronger many times over and better in every conceivable aspect from powers, skills, intelligence to even things like luck and everything else about you. Whether your hair is flowing like you’re in a hurricane, have golden hair and lighting, glowing tattoos, or something else you’ll have some sort of visual cue that you’re now getting serious and the fight is only getting started. This significant and exponential increase in power doesn’t come without a minor fault. When you come out of this mode it’ll require a small period of time before you can enter it again at least in the beginning. With enough time you’ll increase the time you can remain in the mode and eventually will get to the point where you can remain indefinitely in it. Lastly, like any good transformation the stronger you get while not in this surged state the more effective, better, and all around greater boost to your abilities you will achieve when you enter it."
600,Amplifier Node,Toaruverse,"Normal humans only has one brain but unlike others you have an extra one in a form of a node that grows beside your original brain and quite different from a certain project that needed a lot of time and maintenance. This node has a special function that amplifies all of your powers strength, ef ectiveness, utility and range by ten times at bare minimum, and you’re Esper ability can exert strength, ef ectiveness, utility, range and powers one level above you’re current Esper level but has no effect on a level five other than amplification. You can also connect this power with others allowing you to amplify their powers and Esper ability like yours with no limit on how many you can connect or how far they are from you as the connection once set is unbreakable and you can also forcefully connect with someone through prolong physical contact without their permission to control or calm their berserked abilities or powers and this also applies to you which passively increase you control to all of your abilities and powers. This also allows you to know the location and conditions of those connected with you."
600,Strongest Esper,Toaruverse,"Being the strongest doesn’t mean anything even you have the most powerful ability if ever existed if you don’t know the extent, limits and applications of the said ability. But no more you now know the exact limits and applications of all abilities that you have and gain a preternatural ability to use them in a creative and innovative ways that others think that its impossible to do that along with the ability to create variations of every application that you manage to invent for your abilities. Like the strongest Espers your abilities that you gained here are now upgraded to have the strength, utility, ef ectiveness and range befitting a level five along with giving you perfect control at generating and manipulating your abilities. This also applies to your other powers both old and new ones in the future that are not on the level of a level five Esper will receive a upgrade making it equal to a level five ability in strength, utility, ef ectiveness and range but those stronger than a level five would not receive any instant upgrades. The abilities that are on level five or stronger would receive an accelerated growth in strength, utility, ef ectiveness and range with combat and at very least one percent growth at every battle or per hour on prolong battles but it needs to be at very least somewhat threatening to you."
600,Ability Wings,Toaruverse,"Wings made of Esper ability are a common usage for level five’s along with helping them using their abilities a lot better and faster. You gain the ability to allow you to form wings based and related on your Esper ability where it automatically calculates the needed process and steps to use the ability for you and makes it instinctive and easy for you to use. Its ef ect on other abilities are removing their limitations no matter how hardcoded it is li making you capable of using spells and magic that normally needed incantations and imaging instantly as it does all the incantation and imaging for you along making any magic system that you use from rigid and inflexible to smooth, flexible and easy to use. Another is the wings automatically block attacks no matter how fast it is and is as durable as steel which can be increased with no upper-limit as you gain more control and experience using your ability. The wings can also be used for flight with the flying speed of one hundred meters per second and you gain a scaling reaction time and thought of process to fully utilize your flying speed and with experience and training the flying speed can be increased with no upper-limit. Even as a level one you can form these wings and maintain it for a long time without problem."
600,Number One,Bleach,"Potential, what a terrifying concept. In every human soul, there is the potential to change the world. It may only be through little actions for some but for others, like you, your potential marks you as someone with the destiny to make great changes. In regards to war and spiritual power and the innate abilities of a race, as well as all things connected to these concepts, your potential is almost infinite. Matched only by Ichigo Kurosaki, you are able to make what might take most Shinigami decades or even centuries in just months of work. In regards to unlocking your own hidden potential, discovering abilities not yet available rather than furthering your mastery of existing powers, your potential grows to even greater extents. The result is that you will extremely quickly, perhaps in just half a year, gain access and capable skill with most of the racial abilities and techniques available to you. Progress beyond that will still be astonishingly fast, unbelievable to all but a prodigy and threatening even then, but not quite so swift as before."
600,Fires of War,Bleach,"The crucible of war is where mankind has often made it’s greatest advancements. In power and strategy, science and technology, even in growing as a moral species. Perhaps you’re something similar, on an individual scale. Far more than most, conflict brings out your full potential. Not only in combat but any competition or battle in which the stakes are high, you are able to grow and learn at a far greater rate than is normal for you. Ordinary battles to the death will quickly sharpen your abilities but fatal fights that are also for the sake of others you care for will greatly increase the benefits as the stakes rise higher. From huge bounds in growth to potentially discovering entirely new powers, you can even use this conflict- derived growth to push past normal limits or caps on your potential and continue to increased your abilities. The benefits are potent but will begin to drop off as the stakes keep rising. For the sake of a world, you could bring forth unheard of potential, but beyond such global stakes you’ll find little more increases to be had."
600,Combat Ready,RWBY,"You’re one of the best in the business. Very few can match your prowess and experience. You can move faster than the eye can track, are strong enough to casually smash through stone walls, and are skilled enough to fight nearly any opponent on any battlefield. You have over a thousand battles under your belt to draw from, and you have a lifetime of experience with all of your skills and abilities, a testament to your impressive career. This affects all powers and perks you have and will grant you the same level of experience with abilities bought in future Jumps when you enter the Jump you purchased them in."
600,Bullshit the GM,With This Ring,"​There are two ways that complex systems and objects come into being: evolution and design. Both processes create general trends in their products. Your innate supernatural powers gain the benefits of being evolved: robustness and flexibility. You are incredibly capable at adapting your powers to different uses than what are considered normal. Using enhanced hearing to learn echolocation is easy for you, as is using infrared vision to learn to read emotions from someone’s body heat. With moderate difficulty, you could leverage control over lightning into control over magnetism. With great difficulty you could leverage control over electromagnetism into Unified Field Theory and gain control over all four fundamental forces of nature. If your powers rely on a specific context, you’ll find the requirements of that context are a little more fuzzy than expected."
600,Resistance Ignorance,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim,"In many ways mages are on top of the world power-wise. After all, someone can only get so good at swinging a sword or hammer before things sort of just stop getting better. Magic isn’t limited like that, someone can go from throwing a fireball that engulfs a tree or two, to casting grand spells that can change the world or lay the groundwork for apotheosis. However, there is one primary issue with magic as a whole, and it can be summed up in two words: magic resistance. The power to rip someone’s soul out is only good if it works, and it’d be quite unfortunate for you to attempt something of that nature, only to have some meathead barbarian bash your skull in with an axe because of some amulet or innate resistance. Now that’s no longer a problem. An absolute resistance to magic is now nothing before you. Your spells and magical items do damage like they weren’t even there to begin with, and that’s if they had a full immunity. For those unfortunate enough to have less than full immunities, or none at all, they’ll see your offensive magic becoming that much more effective against them."
600,Segunda Etapa,Bleach,"Resurreccion is the true form of an Arrancar. The powers and traits that were sealed away when they gained human form return, enhanced significantly by their increased power. In this stage, their mask expands, coming closer to the original form it had before they became an Arrancar. The mask once removed is redonned for more power, the same reason it was taken away. But there are rumours that a Hollow has more potential than this. How could this state, a return to the past and the mask once cast aside, be a fitting finale to the supposedly endless evolution of a Hollow? For those that search it out, there is a step beyond. Segunda Etapa is a state beyond Resurreccion, wherein the mask of a hollow is fully removed. Not even a fragment remains. And this is when that hollows true power is shown. Both the unique abilities they had as a Hollow and their power overall is vastly increased. As an Arrancar, you possess this form, or can easily unlock it once you become one. Unlike a normal Resurreccion, which can easily be maintained for long periods of time if not forever due to being a natural state, the Segunda Etapa is very much a costly form. Less so for you, where it performs efficiently as part of your mastery of the form. Having unlocked and understood the state, you are also able to slowly guide other Hollows to the same realisations that unlock it, freeing them from their masks entirely for a time. The same potential and knowledge that led to the Segunda Etapa state can also be applied elsewhere. Other transformations, releases and forms of power can reveal a final additional step beyond what is normally considered possible, provided you have access t the forms and spend the time to unlock it. Each will have their unique requirements to reach but all will focus on finding the true form fitting to themselves."
600,The Final Getsuga,Bleach,"The true power of a Zanpakuto comes not from immense Reiryoku or total mastery of technique. It comes from the heart. The understanding you develop with this piece of yourself, the bonds you forge and the loyalty between two comrades. There is where true power can be found. Forming such bonds with spirits or intelligent sources of power within your being allows you to increasingly improve the power of your bond. The closer you grow with your Zanpakuto, the more powerful their abilities will grow, the easier they are to use and the less costly their release is to maintain. Truly deep bonds can even reveal entirely new powers. The two of you coming together as one to discover new sides of yourselves and in doing so, uncovering similarly new abilities. Obtaining a deep level of intimacy, an intense bond and acceptance of each other, would make you far superior to an otherwise equal opponent that lacked this camaraderie with their blade. Once a true and full bond is created, you will have the opportunity to truly become one. Known as a Final Technique, undergoing this process will destroy the gap between the two of you and create a new being. Your dear ally does not die from this even if you can no longer perceive them as separate, instead rejoining you to become an integral part of who you are. The final release gained from this, for a Zanpakuto’s Final Technique, would be similar to a greatly enhanced version of their Bankai state. Unlike the few Zanpakuto who can perform similar techniques as a desperation measure, the complete affinity you and your sword forged will allow you to retain this state and your spiritual powers. The state itself is not permanent, acting similar to your previous releases, but it can be entered with a moments notice. It may even leave some changes on your body outside of it, a sign of the part of you that has rejoined the whole. This above process is not limited to pieces of your own soul. Any being that has a connection with you and exists within your being is open to it. It requires a genuine and sincere bond from each side, failing if either side knowingly falsifies it in some way. But even a Hollow or a Demon could become one with their host. The changes you experience from this combination are likely to be much more significant if used with a being that was not originally part of your own soul, as a fair warning."
600,Halfway There,Petals of Reincarnation,"You really are new to this, you’ve not even fully completed your Reincarnation yet. That’s not to say that’s a bad thing. In fact, you seem to have a shocking amount of power already and more room to grow all over. As you use your Reincarnator power, you’ll slowly go through evolutions that severely increase the power it offers you and likely grant you some visual alteration when using it as well. Depending on the power, it may be two or even three different stages before it reaches its maximum level of progress through this ability, with each stage granting a hefty power boost. Unlike normal, this will apply to any Reincarnator power you buy in the later Powers section, despite them normally being unable to grow further, and also to any other power that you may possess, including ones that cannot normally grow in this fashion. They are subject to the same limitations as Reincarnator powers are through this perk however."
600,Simply Perfect,Petals of Reincarnation,"An old hand at the whole reincarnation thing, are you? You’re a genuinely Perfect Reincarnator, having become able to maintain the transformation for as long as you want. Unlike other Perfect Reincarnators though, you don’t need to have any visual changes in this state and can retain the powers despite having a normal appearance. You’ll still feel the urges of a Reincarnator however. Achieving this Perfect state has also shown you how to slowly grow other transformations towards a permanent state as well, making them last longer and longer as you use them more and more until you never need to shut them off again. Once they reach this stage, you can cancel any visual changes like you can with the Reincarnator form, though any other side effects will remain."
600,I Will Become The Most Powerful Jedi Ever,Star Wars: Attack of the Clones,"Think you should be more powerful? Well, if you have the motivation to accomplish that, you will find you also possess the talent and potential. You learn far faster than others and grow in power with equal speed. You don’t seem to have an upper limit to this, though the more power and knowledge you gain the more effort it will take to continue to grow at the same pace."
600,Kami no Shinobi,Naruto,"Maybe one day. All those who hold this title are or were monsters of all things ninja related. They mastered in days what would take others months. What would take others lifetimes would take them less than a decade. They made progress after progress in mind, body, and chakra far quicker than ever thought possible, and you are now one of them. Your sheer overwhelming talent and natural skill in the ninja arts all but guarantees you a place in history alongside those known as the Gods of Shinobi."
600,Peerless Prodigy,Arifureta Shokugyou de Sekai Saikyou,"For people here, every level is harder to obtain than the last, fitting for this kind of system. Each increase in power is more difficult to gain, requiring more training, more time and higher walls to overcome. Each point in those stats is more difficult to gain than the previous one. Not for you. This will make grinding a thing of the past, as you don’t have that escalation of difficulties when obtaining greater power. Making you able to reach hundreds of gains with the time and effort that would take others to reach a dozen or so. For you, the escalating walls to obtain power are all flat and equal. The same is applied to your skills and other powers, a pace fast enough to make the gains of a decade of hard work in some days with little effort on your part."
600,Tangent Skill Development,Akame ga Kill,"You have become incredibly talented at, improving your talents, you can train yourself to the limits of your abilities far faster than is reasonable. While this might allow you to find applications that you had no knowledge of, you won't be able to break past the limits of your abilities, though you will likely reach whatever limits your abilities have at a startling rate. Your abilities may also become much easier to use as you develop them, more so than they would have otherwise."
600,I Am The Power!,Justice League Unlimited,"Absorbing deadly amounts of energy and combining yourself with incredibly dangerous forms of technology or magic actually doesn't kill you but instead grants you a massive power boost. You could merge your body with mysterious alien nanotech, absorb the central power battery of Oa, or become irradiated by a meteorite and gain incredible new powers or have your existing abilities greatly improved. Depending on what it is you merge with you could get anything from a boost to your strength and durability, to several new powers that would let you take on the entire justice league at once."
600,World Of Cardboard,Justice League Unlimited,"A hero has to be careful. As they often have great power and potential. Enough to shatter the world to pieces like fine china. And because of this you have taken great pains to limit yourself when around those who lack your power. You can carefully navigate life despite the great power you possess having incredible self control. Your subconscious locks, keeping everything in check. However once you unleash those safety the explosion of power is far greater than expected, almost like it became pressurized in its limited state."
600,Protagonist,Rune Factory,"This is really more of a capstone booster than anything else, so allow me to explain to you what this does. Automatically this gives you a greater history. If you were a soldier, then you have the fame of doing things like taking out a tank with a watering can, or if you are a blacksmith, you are renown for creating some of the greatest weapons in the world, you may even gain a great reputation or legends associated with your name if you are a drop in. Aside from the fame this provides you, which you have the ability to refuse, this grants you some other things as well. You immediately have access to all of the skills from the rune factory games at level 1. While this may not sound impressive at first, this basically allows you, as an amateur, to successfully cook dishes or craft armor and weapons while only knowing the basic components, and you automatically know how to use weapons, farming tools or elemental staves with the proper techniques employed. While this may take a lot of energy to do, you will never need to practice swinging a sword or cooking food in order to know how to do it, but every time you perform an action, you increase your experience over time until your skill level reaches level 99. If martial arts were a skill in the system, level 1 would be slightly above the skill of a white belt, while level 99 would be equivalent to mopping the floor with a dozen 10th degree black belts without breaking a sweat. The higher level you are, the less energy you use when performing an activity. In addition, your body can level up, giving you increased health, energy reserves, and your base stats: strength, vitality, intelligence, agility, and elemental affinities and resistances. In future jumps, all abilities you have or skills you could learn will be counted in this system. The level cap will be removed post jump."
600,Supernatural Savant,Chronicle,"People have all sorts of talents. Some are good at sports, some have amazing voices, some are great at computer games, and some are ridiculously good at using their superpowers. Wait, scratch that, the last one is just you. You have an inborn talent for using any extraordinary abilities you might have in your arsenal, and coming up with new uses for them. In just a few weeks, you could go from only being able to use rudimentary telekinesis for the movement of small objects to creating barriers with it, easily shaping and moving gases and liquids, affecting things you cannot perceive with your senses, diverting and controlling energies such as lightning, and feeling your surroundings through telekinetic feelers. One might even wonder if the original power was capable of such feats, or if you invented them yourself. But there’s no need for wonderment: if you diligently train and experiment with your abilities, you will see yourself able to use them in ways impossible to grasp for any others, pushing both the power and yourself beyond their limits. So long as you are creative, the various tricks and specializations you invent this way will allow you to advance your power in ways beyond just raw strength, and perhaps topple even giants with the metaphorical sling"
600,Ordinary Man,Fate/Grand Order,"You weren’t born with magical powers. You didn’t discover a mighty artefact. You didn’t have some magic old man to make you a king. You had yourself, your own human body and whatever weapons you could find. In a world of legendary heroes and terrible monsters, the odds say you should have died. Yet here you are, having earned your spot in the ranks of mankind’s legends. How? You got so damn good that you made the mundane become magical. Your ordinary fists went so far beyond the limits of human possibility that they became weapons of legend. Your skill with a gun, so awe inspiring that the World itself can’t comprehend it as not being magical. Your swordsmanship literally warps space and time to try and keep up with your skills. You’ve got no limits on how far you can take any skill and the further you take any skill, the more magical it becomes. Become a great enough master and you might even see those ordinary skills forming into Noble Phantasms in their own right."
600,Infinite Jumper Works,Fate/Grand Order,"While the Origin may be the core of being for those in these worlds, you’re just a little different from them, eh Jumper? A little more adaptable. So when you found a secret art, a way to imbue your Origin into your attacks, you were able to make it fittingly adaptable to you. You can imbue any of your powers into your attacks to use them at range or combine their special effects with another method of delivery. A classic example would be combining the ability to create swords with a bullet to create swords from within the bodies of those shot by the bullet. Physical blows could be combined with elemental magic to grant them similar auras and even positive effects, such as healing magic, could be transferred through a quick smack or long ranged attack. A massive increase in adaptability for your methods of combat and abilities, it’s fitting for you Jumper."
600,"Praise Me, Revere Me",Flow,"The gods of this realm can grow weaker or stronger depending on how many people worship them and now you too receive this benefit. Your powers, physical and mental capabilities, and everything else about you will be boosted. The more people worship you the greater every aspect of you will be boosted. Worship in this sense has a very loose meaning as someone merely has to feel an emotion towards you. This can be respect, fear, hatred, anger, or any other emotion you can imagine. Humans are not the only ones who can come to worship you as anyone can do it so long as they feel any emotion. They can be aliens, fictional, in separate dimensions, or anything really so long as they can show emotion towards you. An entire city coming to worship you will result in a large boost in your capabilities. An entire world coming to worship you will grant an unfathomable boost to all your capabilities surpassing even the gods of this world. Who knows you might turn into if you manage to gather multiple worlds of followers."
600,Fit for Survival,Re: Monsters,"Where humans rely on equipment and training to defeat their foes, monsters rely on their inherent strength and power, but, for some monsters, this simply isn’t enough and they must either grow or die. You chose to grow. Your innate abilities grow with you, as your level increases, as your strength grows, so do your abilities and skills grow to match them. Your magic affinities will expand, your poison will become more potent, and your hide will grow tougher, along with many other effects. Of course, this is entirely based on abilities and skills inherent to you, not learned skills.


--- (Requires Protagonist): If you possess the Protagonist perk, this goes even further as improving in one area, such as physical strength, will naturally improve other areas as well, such as durability and speed. When your physical capabilities improve, all of them do, though this is not necessarily a one to one growth, but focusing purely on physical strength will not leave you clumsy or easily winded. You may choose to have your physical capabilities not manifest changes in your appearance if you so choose (so you can get stronger but not put on more muscle than you already possess). ---"
600,The Strongest Wielder of X!,High School DxD,"You are a prodigy when it comes to using magical items, Jumper. You can draw out the maximum potential of any object which you use over time. Have a magical sword that can shroud itself in flames? Now it can launch super-hot fires towards your opponents, as long as you are the one holding it. Spend a long enough time with it, and the sword would be able to do that even without your presence. If you have a sacred gear, then it would already have a sub-species unlocked, and the spirit inside it and you are extremely compatible. Furthermore, if there are any prerequisites for using a magical item, then you count as having fulfilled it. Wield a magical blade which can only be used by humans as a devil! The longer you spend time with the item, the stronger it grows.Ever heard of the phrase, “sword as an extension of the arm”? That is now true for you, in more ways than one. If you hold a magical item in your hand, then you would be able to use its effects throughout your body, as if the item was a part of your body. If a sword can wreath itself in flames, then you can too, as long as you hold it that is. If you have a sci-fi weapon then you can use it without fiddling with its settings, with no chance of it blowing. Whichever item you use becomes a part of you as long as you have it on your person. Holding a supercomputer would allow you to do calculations as fast as it can, while a shield would make your body as durable as the shield itself."
600,Hollow Vessel,Fate/Stay Night,"You were born for a purpose. To be a weapon, one that would kill any target for the right price. And a weapon has no need for petty things such as likes or dislikes or quirks. All that you needed was the ability to adapt to any situation and to understand your targets. Learning new concepts, such as skills or languages or entire cultures, is as easy as breathing to you. You did in a day what took others five, no matter the subject. And when they became jealous of your speed, it was not something you could not understand. Your incredible understanding of emotions and people letting you know what a man felt just by what his face looked like, with only the most tightly controlled being able to mask their emotions from your eyes. This attention to detail assists you in other endeavours too, from near instantly sweeping a room for anything that could be used as a weapon to picking out individuals from crowds of thousands, your skills of perception lie unmatched."
600,The Original Curse,Tate no Yuusha no Nariagari,"The curse series is a series of weapons unlocked in the legendary/vassal weapons based on the seven deadly sins. Which are gluttony,  lust, greed, wrath, sloth, envy, and pride. At the point when a blast of feelings equal to the obliteration of one's heart is conjured, a power coming from the curse series is unlocked. While these weapons hold great power, they also degenerate the personality of their user. On the rare chance that the cursed is overwhelmed by positive virtues within the user, the blessed series is unlocked. Since you’re paying cp here upon purchasing this you unlock all of the seven cursed series from the start. Giving you abilities based on the seven deadly sins that suit your personality and greater stat/attribute boost when using its weapon form. The mental corruption/influence is completely negated but using the abilities of the cursed series more than 7 times in a short time would subject you to a curse. The curse is based on the 8th cursed series form that you used and it would take months for it to be dispelled completely. While you can still be subject to the curse of the cursed series when used more than 7 times, but you're immune to all types of curse that doesn’t come from your own cursed series. With a proper perk or item you can weaken or remove the curse even prevent it from affecting you from the start as it’s not fiat-backed. There are two ways to turn the cursed series into blessed series, one is to overwhelm the cursed series by positive virtues, two is to unlock and master the 4th tier/rank of the cursed series. Upon unlocking the blessed series, you nullify the curse of its counterpart and gain abilities based on the seven heavenly virtues and dramatically increase its previous abilities. Your blessed weapon forms have both the abilities based on the deadly sins and heavenly virtues without the drawback and usage limit. Naturally your party members gain these benefits but you can grant other heroes, companions the benefits of this perk without them joining your party."
600,Going Nova,All-Star Superman,"Thanks to the incident on the sun, Superman is now stronger and smarter than he’s ever been - and it is killing him as a result. Such ‘overcharging’, even if beneficial, can be incredibly dangerous. So naturally, you can do it, too. You’ve found out how to supercharge your mind, body, and superpowers to a level unheard of, threefold their normal potency and potential. Some more ‘fluid’ powers could even spontaneously generate new abilities and techniques that help with the situation you’re currently in, though only within reason. The downside? What comes up must come down. This state lasts for up to a day, and depending on the powers used, you may find yourself exhausted and depowered. A human but brilliant scientist who used this for an all-nighter may find themselves bedridden with a cold and a migraine the next day. A Kryptonian running around using all of their powers at once will find themselves depowered and likely comatose the entire next day. Unlike poor Clark, this won’t kill you, but you’ll likely be out of action and helpless once the heights of your power have burnt out, unconscious for a day or even two with your own abilities exhausted if you pushed yourself to your limits constantly. You will regain your lost or ‘burnt out’ powers gradually over the course of up to a full day, or no less than an hour if you used this very briefly. The backlash is measured by the amount used, not possessed."
600,Demon Slayer Crest,Demon Slayer,"At the Zenith of a Demon Slayer’s power, in one of the most intense battles of their life, they may awaken a power not seen since the creator of the Breath of the Sun, the original Slayer fighting style: the Demon Slayer Crest, a scar-like marking on your face or neck which stylistically matches your fighting style. Simply possessing the mark puts your strength, agility and endurance in line with the strongest of the Upper Moons, making you one of the most formidable Slayers in the Corps bar none. Additionally, you can see beneath the skin to the blood flow, joints, and muscles of those around you, granting you the keenest of insight into their movements, and the world seems to slow down around you, allowing you to react to attacks the instant your opponent’s body begins to follow through. Lastly, you can ignite your weapon with a blazing crimson aura. While not literal fire, this glow is an amazingly powerful tool against creatures with regenerative properties because it substantially slows their regeneration down; enemies which would regrow limbs in seconds take five times as long to repair damage done by such attacks. All aspects of this perk - the appearance of the mark, the increased physical abilities, the “see-through world”, and the crimson blade - can be toggled individually. Also, some people might think that bearing the Demon Slayer Crest shortens your lifespan; this is false. Taking this Perk will not negatively affect your lifespan."
600,Phases of Divinity,The God of Highschool,"All High Gods, the third highest rank of God and the one directly above you, possess additional forms that they may take on when they require more divine power. Whilst not yet a High God in rank, you have gained this innate ability and mastery over both of these new forms. You are able to take on the Second Phase and the Third Phase form. Each grants a progressively more massive boost to both your physical abilities as well as your life energy powers. The Second Phase grants you a more divine form, fitting to your own personal theme, whilst the Third Phase twists this into a monstrous visage, more akin to a wrathful God then an ordinary divinity. Whilst each of these forms drain your energy faster than normal, you excel at managing this cost and can stay in the Second Phase for hours at a time and the Third Phase for close to a single hour, much more than any of your elder brethren."
600,When the Chips Are Down,The God of Highschool,"Things have come down to the razor wire. The doomsday clock has hit 11:59. The world is about to explode. You’ve never felt better. The bigger those odds, the more confident in yourself you get. This isn’t arrogance or overconfidence. This is an absolute, ever growing self-surety of what you can do and what your friends can do. More than that though, when those odds really start climbing, you find that your strength starts climbing too. It’s never going to scale to match, it’s not a heroic tale if you beat these odds with ease, but the greater the opponent and the disaster you face, in comparison to you, the stronger you’ll become. Find yourself facing a few dozen priests at once? Your body seems to miraculously restore its stamina at the start of the fight and you can push yourself just a little harder. A Bishop standing in your way? Your body will feel stronger than it should possibly be and you’ll find wells of energy you didn’t think you had. And if Zeus himself, or another High God, descended to stomp you into the ground? You’d be able to pull out every single bit of power and effort you had at least twice over to try and give yourself a chance. There is a limit to this however. You can only withstand so much of this boost, even against the great odds you might face, and if you try to draw too much power from you, you might irrevocably damage your body or spirit. What’s the point of beating the bad guy if you die in the process and never get to see your happy end?"
600,One Hundred Times My Own Power,The God of Highschool,"The enemies of Nox are cowardly and sneaky. Rarely will they fight you straight forward as a man should, instead they’ll will scuttle along in the shadows, trying to strike where you are weak. Some of them will even try to turn you against yourself, stealing your blessed powers and using them against you. No more will they be able to commit these disgusting affronts to your being. If it originates from you, it cannot harm you. Your own powers will not scratch your skin if reflected back at you, abilities stolen from you will not work against you and energy drained from you will fail to empower foes when they use it to strike against you, leaving them with nothing but their own power. Those thieves will be unable to even use the weapons you wield if they take them from you. So long as it is yours, it will serve them not. If they want to fight you, they’ll do so honourably and with their own power."
600,More Than a Myth,Rise of the Guardians,"Spirits are creatures of belief, and even though they may be able to do some cool stuff even without believers, it’s nothing compared to what they can do with them. So, you gain power for each child (and non-child, post-Jump) that believes a being matching your general description exists, and an extra boost on top for how much of your Center you inspire in them or that they associate with you.

--- Capstone-Boosted (Requires Guardian): You also gain a much smaller amount of power proportional to how much of your Center there is in the world in general, related to you or your believers or not. After all, Guardians are protectors of all children, even the ones who don’t believe in them. That’s not all, though. No, your Center has become too complex to define as any one concept. It expands to cover adjacent and related concepts as well. Fun expands to Joy and Excitement. Wonder expands to Awe and Admiration. Dreams expand to Creativity and Imagination. Hope expands to Bravery and Aspiration. Fear expands to Paranoia and Anxiety. And so on. And all the Perks here that rely on your Center? They take that expansion into account. ---"
600,A True Hero,Dragon Ball Z,"You might get called a lot of things, because for a lot of people out there Hope and Love are weak and without merit. They’re things that can’t give strength, strength to defeat your enemies and protect these fragile emotions. But you know that they make you strong in the REAL way, strong in ways they can’t even imagine. When you’re fighting to protect or for the sake of someone(or multiple someones!) you truly love, you could go from a normal man to someone who could shape and shake the earth with your strikes. Not only strength, but your clarity of thought allows you to bring out an inner focus and competence you may not have even known was there. If the people important to you needed you to move mountains...by god, one way or another you’d get them moving. In addition, the more ‘stage presence’ you have...the louder, more flamboyant, or hot-blooded...your combat abilities rise with your gallant performance, letting you truly become a larger-than-life fighter even if you seem little more than a hooligan or a dandy at a glance. This won’t always suffice against foes far stronger than you, but it may give them a harder battle than they anticipated. And if you do both of these together? You will truly earn the name ‘hero’."
700,Shazam’s Chosen,DC – Kingdom Come,"The Wizard Shazam was forbidden from interfering in the current troubles by cosmic entities, but it’s not exactly interfering in these affairs if he makes a new hero and offhandedly asks them to check up on Billy Batson and perhaps help him out if he’s in trouble, yes? If you do this favor for him or not is up to you. He can’t exactly take away your powers now if you just disobey him. You have a powerful form you may call upon by shouting “SHAZAM”, manifesting in a great and powerful display of nature. Such as whirling sands or a great burst of fire, or the classic lightning bolt. You may still use this manifestation of nature to heal or harm as you wish, and it is magical in nature. You may also share this power with others who are worthy, however expect yours to decrease in strength when you share it until you get your powers back. Your power is derived from the very gods themselves. With great strength and speed that threatens Superman, you are a power to be feared. Possessing the Wisdom of Solomon, you have eidetic memory and a vast intellect. Excelling at war tactics and mathematics among other subjects. You may also comprehend and speak in any language you encounter, including magical ones as Solomon was a powerful wizard himself. The Wisdom of Solomon also enables you to gaze upon all possible angles of a situation and figure out how to turn disadvantages into advantages. You can fly at fast speeds. You also have a vast well of willpower inside you. You also lack the need for food, water, or sleep. You possess infinite endurance and stamina. You also resist powerful magic, such as Zeus’s lightning bolts, but you also possess great magical talent. (You start out with no skill in it, however. You’ll need to refine your powers.) Only the most potent of magic found here could harm you. Finally, you have been given access to the Rock of Eternity, an interdimensional prison where you may lock up any magical being you desire. Created from two rock formations from Heaven and Hell, it may hold up to great magical beings such as the Three Faces Of Evil. You can also teleport to this place at any time. This will be dragged with you from place to place, and you must be able to defeat them before you can lock them up with you."
800,The 42nd Supreme Being​,Overlord,"There were 41 players that came together to form the guild known as Ainz Ooal Gown (the name Momonga, the guild leader, eventually took as his own) and then later took over and remodeled the Great Tomb of Nazarick. Well, there were 41 of them. Now, however, there are 42. You are the final member of Ainz Ooal Gown and alongside Momonga you are the only one of the ‘Supreme Beings’ that remained behind. You are considered to be a god by the NPC’s of Nazarick and they all swear their undying loyalty to you, and to Momonga. You will have full access to the resources, facilities, and services of Nazarick and may freely command any of the NPC’s within it to do basically anything you tell them to do, the only one who can challenge your authority is Momonga himself. You additionally have your own luxurious quarters on the 9th floor of Nazarick itself.
Since Ainz Ooal Gown was originally founded upon the idea of group decisions you will always have a say in the general direction that Nazarick takes in regards to politics and the distribution of resources, but your own vote is no greater or lesser than that of Momonga himself so you will likely need to compromise on particularly divisive issues. Taking this option automatically overrides your location roll. You automatically start in the throne room of Nazarick alongside Momonga, with events prior to your appearance having played out as they normally would have (such as Momonga editing Albedo, and taking into his possession the Staff of Ainz Ooal Gown).
Additionally you will gain memories appropriate to being a member of Ainz Ooal Gown (you can not be a Drop-in with this option), and you will find yourself having an extremely strong attachment to the NPC’s, such that you’ll find yourself forgiving of just about anything they do that isn’t blatantly and obviously a screw up on their part, as well as possessing a strong desire to protect them (and Nazarick by extension) and a towering anger at anyone that would dare to lay a hand on them.

Capstone-Boosted (Requires Level One Hundred): You’ve hit the pinnacle. There is no higher level, not within YGGDRASIL at least. As a Player you have hit level 100, not exactly a surprise since most Players had done that, and represent the absolute peak of personal power and ability. If you’re a Local then you’re quite frankly a freak of nature and are probably seen as a god by any other locals that actually know what you’re really capable of. Literally, by the way, the Slane Theocracy actually worships as gods a group of six level one hundred Players that appeared to them in the past, though virtually no one still alive outside the highest echelons of the Theocracy itself actually knows that. All level one hundred individuals possess high-tier nullification defensive abilities. This means that individuals won’t be able to even hurt you that aren’t, at the very least, within the fabled ‘Realm of Heroes’ and even then they’d have to be a hero among heroes to manage it, and they’d still have to get past your normal defenses even if they manage that much. The only hope they’d normally have is if they possessed access to some magical artifact of sufficient power to get past your defenses. That said the high-tier nullification is an all or nothing ability, either it works or it doesn’t. Your physical and magical statistics are absolutely mind boggling as far as the locals are concerned. Even magic casters, if they’re level one hundred, will possess physical strength and defenses on par with a warrior that is ‘only’ in the ‘Realm of Heroes’, and warriors can expect to be far far beyond even that. Magic casters actual magic power is enough that it could literally bring even the greatest human archmage to his knees in awe and shame at his own weakness, were he to actually witness your true strength. Even warriors that only dabbled in magic would still be on par with magic casters in the ‘Realm of Heroes’ at the very least. The abilities of a Generalist, both physical and magical, will outstrip everyone other than their level 100 peers by a tremendous degree. As a warrior you are capable of annihilating armies of tens of thousands of regular men on your own, and likely wouldn’t even notice them. It would take legendary heroes or beasts to actually make you break your stride. You’ll possess skills that will let you nullify certain damage types outright, perform swings of your weapon that can hit dozens of individuals at once with air pressure alone, and provide you with a myriad of defenses against magic casters that would seek to stymie you and prevent you from closing the distance. You are literally a one-man army killing machine. As a Warrior you additionally possess ‘super moves’ that can do things like grant temporary invulnerability to virtually anything, allow you to strike everything in your line of sight with a single powerful blow at the same time, or hit one opponent dozens of times with a single strike. As a magic caster you are capable of casting spells of every tier up to the 10th Tier. This is a tier of magic that only a bare handful of people in the entire world even know exists, with most believing that 7th tier is as high as it goes. 10th Tier magic is the stuff of legends, capable of healing armies or slaying them, resurrecting the dead en mass, permanent teleportation circles, ‘buffing’ or ‘debuffing’ entire armies, summoning forth creatures of legend as servitors, and so forth. As a Magic Caster you’ll also be capable of ‘Over-rank Magic’, also known as Super-tier magic, that exceeds even that. Singular spells that could slay 70,000 men in one go and then also summon massively powerful eldritch nightmares under your command at the same time, destroying entire cities with rain that infects those it falls upon with an undead plague, conjuring forth miles upon miles of enchanted forest that responds to your will and will empower you while you are within, or spells of similar such scale and effect. Unlike normal spells ‘over-rank’ spells don’t actually cost mana and are more akin to skills, they always have a long casting time, usually a minute or so, and you must stand still and can not do anything else while casting them. Additionally you can only use them a few times per day. If you are a Generalist there really isn’t a question of ‘can you do something’ so much as ‘how do you do it today, and will you do it differently tomorrow’. You’re not quite on the same tier of skill as the warrior at combat, or the magic caster at magic, but you’re just below both of them. Magic of the 9th tier is yours to command, and while you’re not the combat beast a warrior could be you find that your command of both the physical and magical aspects give you a range of utility and versatility no one else could boast. As a Generalist you don’t benefit from super moves or over-rank magic but in compensation your statistics are significantly better overall in the areas where the other origins would be weak. You do have one area however where you particularly shine. You are blisteringly fast. You could run circles around the warrior even if you couldn’t beat him at swordplay, and you can certainly close the distance (or run away) from a magic caster in the blink of an eye. You’ve also picked up a penchant for sneak attacks, and opponents that don’t see you coming rarely get the opportunity to learn from that mistake."
1200,The Legendary Hero,Medaka Box Abnormal,"You were born as a being with the power and destiny to both save the world and to destroy it. Your physical form is far beyond any humans. You have the power to destroy the moon in a single blow, to travel faster than light with just your own two feet and several more unique powers on top. The first, imbuing your power into other objects. With this you can use your full power through anything you pick up. A flicked rubber band would hit with the greatest amount of power you could put out with a punch. You could poke someone with a pencil and blow a hole clean through them. Even the air around you can be used, a puff of air turning into a wave of destruction when it originates from you. The second, a great defence against all powers. No supernatural or superhuman ability, no matter how strong or strange, can affect you unless you allow it too. From simple super strength or attacking with the elements to the esoteric, such as warping reality or attempting to delete the concept of your existence, you are utterly unaffected. The sole exception are powers based in the power of language, spoken or written or signed abilities that work solely by being spoken or written or signed. The Styles of this world are one such example. In addition to this, once you have seen an attack against your person once, excepting one that is based in language as a Style is, it becomes useless and ineffectual against you, as you cease to recognise it as an attack. Obviously, if it failed to kill you the first time, it is nothing more than a bug sting. The final, the irreversible action. Any action you take or change you make or damage you deal can be made permanent and irreversible by your will. Wounds you make will never be repaired or healed or changed at all, no matter what is attempted to change them, though language based powers will bypass this too. If you were to break someone’s will, it would remain broken for all eternity. You may reverse this at any time as you will, though it will automatically do so upon your death. This also has a secondary use, in that any attack that hits you will be broken permanently. Swords will be shattered, arms left twisted, techniques rendered powerless and so on. The greater the attack, the worse it will be broken. An ordinary sword might only be left bent and rusted but an indestructible sword of arcane might would be reduced to a pile of dust."
