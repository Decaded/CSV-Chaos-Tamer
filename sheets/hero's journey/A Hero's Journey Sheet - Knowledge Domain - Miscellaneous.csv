Cost,Perk Name,Source,Description
50,Life Skills,Generic First Jump,"You have the basic life skills that everyone really should possess. You can cook, clean, do laundry, drive, perform basic maintenance, balance finances and perform other such tasks that are needed by the average person."
50,Acrobatics,Justice League Unlimited,"Quickly sprint over rooftops, dash through hazardous environments, and avoid being hit by your foes with graceful and impressive displays of agility. You’re skilled enough to easily avoid melee blows from mundane opponents, doge ranged attacks from most thrown weapons, and traverse complex environments like cities, secret labs, and alien hives well enough to keep up with your flying allies or outpace deadly pursuers."
50,Escape Artistry,Justice League Unlimited,"You're a pro at getting out of traps and bindings. You could easily escape from any normal kidnapper or prison, and I'm sure plenty of magicians would love to have you as a partner. While you're not yet capable to escaping from anything designed by a super genius or advanced civilization, you can easily learn how to with a bit of study or experience."
50,Stealth,Justice League Unlimited,"Just like Batman, Huntress, and various other sneaky individuals, you've learned how to sneak past armed goons, avoid security cameras, disappear into shadows to avoid detection, and quickly move without making a sound. This is skills work best against modern technology and mundane foes, but you may be able to sneak around alien and supernatural threats as well if you’re especially careful."
100,Eagle Scout,Generic First Jump,"You are an expert when it comes to survival, both wilderness and urban. You are both talented and lucky at finding the materials and resources you need, in any environment they could exist in."
100,Homemaking Skills,Ranma ½,"You can cook and clean with supreme skill and efficiency, in any environment. While others would need all day to get the house clean, do the laundry, and make dinner, you can have it all done perfectly in minutes with lots of time to spare for some light reading or other hobbies."
100,Steady Hands,Generic Medical Drama,"You gain microscopic precision in your movement. You can hold yourself or objects perfectly still, and draw perfectly straight lines or flawless circles freehand. Your fine control makes you more graceful as well. Does not grant the senses to make this kind of precision truly useful."
100,Bartender,Final Fantasy 7 Remake,"You’re a great bartender, both in terms of mixing drinks and connecting with people. Your delicious drinks and worldwise demeanor will quickly make your name known amongst your patrons. Whether you use this ability to recruit for your resistance group or make your local pub the talk of the town, you’ll fit right in behind the counter."
100,Night Life,Final Fantasy 7 Remake,"It’s rough living in the slums, so Midgar’s poorer residents live like every night is their last. You’ve got the dance skills to work at the Honeybee Inn, suffer no ill effects from alcohol, and can easily ensure you and your compatriots have a relaxing and enjoyable night. You also have a knack for intimate entertainment, letting you charm strangers and soothe their bodies. Massages from you would give even Madam M pause."
100,Vehicular Manslaughter,Marvel Cinematic Universe Vol. 1,"You're a really good pilot, and a really good driver! It doesn't take you long to familiarize yourself with a new vehicle, though alien vehicles may take a fair amount of trial and error. Once you're moving however, you know how to get the most out of your new toy... as well as how to utilize it against your enemies. Whether using the weapons or just running them over, a vehicle is a tool of death in your hands."
100,Rules Lawyer,Marvel Cinematic Universe Vol. 2,"Political maneuvering can be a boon when you're the one doing it, and a complete bane when it's being used against you. It's kind of like the difference between being a smart-ass, and someone being a smart-ass to you. Everyone knows, however, that only the best smart-asses survive in this business. You're able to pick up laws and legal customs very quickly, and recall them the second you may need them. No legal document is too obscure for you to forget, and your ability to spin these legal rules will no doubt serve you well in getting out of trouble and infuriating your enemies."
100,What? Who?,My Hero Academia,"Sometimes it’s good to be noticed, trusted, recognized for your actions or image. But as someone who skirts the law, that isn’t always true, now is it? You’re way better at organizing quick disguises to cover up or distract from your more eye-catching physical features, and coming up with excuses to wave people off and come off as NOT suspicious. It’s of serious aid when you’re trying to make sure people don’t recognize you for your alias out of costume or vice versa. Also useful for just getting ignored."
100,Master Forgery,RWBY,You possess the lucrative skill of forging documents. Any documents you forge are of the highest quality and will pass nearly any inspection. Lots of people would pay lots of money to get their hands on the things you can provide.
100,Ingredient Hunter,Battle Through the Heavens,"Knowing how to identify special medicinal plants is not a skill only relevant to Receptariers. Physicians, a profession similar but inferior to alchemy, need to know it. Similarly, picking and selling ingredients is a good way to make some money, or even just collecting them to get an alchemist to refine them for you. You have studied for a while, and have a working knowledge of many of the medicinal plants that dot this land, and their general effects. This kind of knowledge will put you in good stead for strengthening yourself."
100,Knowledgeable,King Arthur,"With this you gain a library of knowledge about myths & the legends surrounding them, along with an encyclopedia of information equal to a degree in Biology , Botany, Ecology, Geology, and Ethology, not only in this world but all your previous ones and gaining more as you continue. You also gain a working knowledge in medicine and first aid."
100,A Lover that’s Out of This World,Invincible,"You are capital S, seductive my friend. Regardless of how you look, you have the instinct needed to seduce anyone of any persuasion into bed with you given a chance to talk with them. More than that however, you have the skill and stamina to keep them there for hours, and then bring them back, and back, and back again as you wrack their bodies with pleasure. Let's hope your bed doesn’t knock on the wall or the banging will keep your neighbors and guests up for the entire night."
100,Culinary thumb,Sonic the Hedgehog,It’s like having a green thumb for cooked dishes! Get it? Expect to have a fun time in the kitchen as you become a prodigy of the culinary arts. Even a simple sandwich becomes the most luxurious things ever. But like all things a cook can only do so much with shitty ingredients.
100,Concentration,Justice League Dark,You’ve got excellent concentration. Half the Justice League could be fighting the latest world-ending Big Bad right in front of you and you could easily do doctorate level research while holding a casual conversation with the heroes. It’s not much but comes in handy given how unruly this place can be.
100,A Simple Magic,Justice League Dark,"You’re a liar. Just an absolute, filthy liar. You’ve got a knack for lying in thought, word, and deed. Tall tales, feints, betrayals, espionage, bluffs, omissions, secrets, disguises, you’ve studied it all. You can keep track of all the stories you conjure up comfortably. And if you’ve got the spark for magic, you’ll be able to weave your lies into your spells, crafting powerful illusions and concealing terrible curses like it’s just another Tuesday. This won’t give you the tactical acumen to make sure you aren’t caught and I’m sure someone could find some way to force the truth out of you. Still, given how everything you do could be a lie in one form or another, it would take something divine to make you show your hand."
100,Ranger,Overlord,"You’ve got the skills of a ranger. This means you’re an excellent shot with a bow, decent in melee with a sword or mace, and have a particular affinity for moving through the wilds and taming animals. You’ve also got talent in druidic magic but not to the same extent as an actual Druid. You’ve also got the ability to ‘lure’ monsters to you over a wide area. The more powerful you are the larger the area that you can lure monsters in, and the more powerful monsters will respond. This does not actually create monsters out of thin air, it is entirely possible to ‘over hunt’ as it were. Great for wiping out pesky monster populations. Just starting out you’re well suited for surviving in the wilderness and off the land, easily capable of matching any regular warrior in battle, and know a handful of druidic magics to help ease your way.


--- (Requires Realm of Heroes): In the Realm of Heroes you could track a man weeks after he’d moved through an area, assuming he used no supernatural methods to hide his tracks, and your skill with a bow and blade (or other weapon of choice) are sufficient that the mere rumor of your presence in an area is enough for tribes of (intelligent) monsters to steer well clear. Your druidic magics at this level are substantially stronger, able to conjure forth magical animals to serve you, control clouds (though not the climate), heal yourself and others of grievous wounds, and more. ---


--- (Requires Level One Hundred): At Level One Hundred you can track so well that unless strong supernatural protections are taken to prevent it you could track anyone, no matter where they are in relation to you, regardless of whether or not you’ve actually ever seen any of their tracks. Effectively just by thinking about the person you can find them given a bit of time and effort. Your skills with weapons are enough that you could clear out entire provinces of powerful monsters and beasts entirely on your own, leaving small hills of such dead creatures in your wake, or alternatively you could tame such beasts and have them serve you. Your druidic magics are at their peak, you can easily control the weather, conjure forth legendary magical beasts as servitors, and influence and control nature to a considerable degree around you, though not to the same degree as an actual druid. At this level your ability to ‘lure’ monsters is so profound that you can now specify specific types of monsters, or even specific individual monsters if you know of them, to call forth into your prepared traps. ---"
100,Rogue,Overlord,"A less polite person would call you a thief, but they wouldn’t be calling you that for long, especially not if they knew you had heard them. You’ve got the ability to pilfer things you really probably shouldn’t be able to, and your skill with knives and daggers need to be seen to be believed. You’re also adept at stabbing foes right in the weak points for ‘massive damage’, a form of ‘sneak attack’ you might say. You’re also particularly skilled with illusionary magics to divert the attention of your foes as well as to seek out information for yourself, or protect your information from others. Just starting out you’re well suited to theft, burglary, infiltration, and the casting of magics to help facilitate such endeavors. Namely invisibility, silence, altering your appearance, and speed of movement. Such skill and abilities make it unlikely in the extreme for regular individuals to detect your actions.


--- (Requires Realm of Heroes): In the Realm of Heroes however your skill has increased to prodigious levels, you could tightrope walk across a thin wire dozens of feet in the air during a windy night, slip through even the tightest security, and place yourself easily in just the right way in order to take advantage of the openings of any enemies or foes you may encounter. Additionally at this level your magic has branched out to the point that you can effortlessly weave complex illusions, cast flight and teleportation (though not perfectly accurate), superior forms of invisibility and silence, as well as scrying and anti-scrying efforts to better collect, and protect, information. Your services as a ‘security consultant’ for the discretionary noble or businessman would be in considerable demand. ---


--- (Requires Level One Hundred): At Level One Hundred your skills are at their peak, you could backstab an undead for massive damage even though they don’t have weak points, slip through even supernaturally empowered security efforts, hide in a man’s shadow in broad daylight at high-noon, and your magical abilities allow you to pilfer information as easily as they allow you to pilfer more physical things. You’ll never be found unless you want to be, baring considerable efforts from similarly skilled individuals. ---"
100,Welcome to Beacon,RWBY,"It’s always good to put your best foot forward. When you enter a new Jump, you find that you have an instinctive grasp of that world’s culture and customs. This only covers general knowledge like basic social customs and current rates, but it’ll save you time not needing to learn the minor things."
100,Didn’t Skip Basic,DC – Blackest Night,"Just because you have one of the greatest, if not the most versatile, tools in the universe at your disposal doesn’t mean you’re prepared for absolutely anything. You have learned how to survive and thrive in various environments, from volcanic planets, underwater depths, and even the vast stretches of space between planets. You adapt quickly to working or fighting in hostile or difficult new environments, so long as you can somehow survive within them."
100,Massage,Akame ga Kill,"You have experience giving massages, and are skilled such to pull all the stress out of someone's body. Even someone who's been fighting a great deal will be returned to top condition after a brief massage, though they might need proper rest if they overexert themselves and you can't do anything about injuries."
100,Tracking,Akame ga Kill,"Whether animal or man you are skilled at tracking, skilled assassins may be skilled enough to cover their tracks, but you may still find some evidence of their passing."
100,Man of The Something,Akame ga Kill,"You have extensive experience with, something, such as the sea and water in general, in which case you are also a natural with a sail, a fishing rod, a net and just being in the water. You could pick something else however, like a desert or a mountain, whatever it is you have the skills and natural abilities suited to that environment."
100,Living Off The Land,Akame ga Kill,"You're experienced at finding food around you in the wild and are certain to be able to survive off the land so long as there is enough food there in the first place.  This includes dealing with and hunting wild creatures, as well as general survival skills."
100,Hand of Poker,Red Dead Redemption 2,"When the saloon goers aren’t fighting, drinking, or fucking, they’re gambling. And who better to “steal” their earnings than you, oh master of the card table? You see, you’re a right jackass, a man luckier than a rabbit with a leprechaun’s foot and just as skilled when it comes to just about any table top game. A good bluff, a quick knife hand, and the sense to call it quits while you’re ahead, you’d excel at games like poker, blackjack, five finger fillet, and just about any other table based game you play. Just look out for cheats, and angry men looking for their money back."
100,Business Skills,With This Ring,"​Too many supervillains are created when a bright and hopeful young scientist creates something capable of changing the world only to utterly fail at introducing it to the market, stymied by the whims of the consumer or any of thousands of tricks established industries use to quash new technologies. No more shall this stop you. You are an expert in the legal and financial intricacies required to get a product to market, and you are skilled at adapting your product to ensure it sells well while maintaining its intended functionality. The execs in charge of the Fujitsu Q-series laptop wish they had your skills."
100,Queen Be Proud,Arrowverse,"You possesses considerable skills at lying and deception, having ability to bested a lie detector test. You're also able to sneak in and out of almost any unguarded building without being detected. You're able to seamlessly disappear in a second's notice, even in broad daylight, leaving no signs of how you left or in which directions. For long periods of time, you're able to follow your targets without being noticed."
100,Cat Burglar,Ultimate Marvel,"You are a master thief. One of the best in the world, capable of infiltrating heavily trapped buildings and escaping with your prize, or easily stealing objects from others without them realizing."
100,Meditation,Dragon Ball Z,"A clear mind is the first step to enlightenment, and you have a knack for making that first step. You may easily enter a meditative state that eases your mind and soul, as well as focuses your ki and increases your sensory range with it so long as you remain in that state. Your mental abilities also receive a considerable boost while you’re in this trance. Danger or pain can snap you out of it, but constant practice will let you hone the increases you receive, perhaps even keep them in the long-run. Even the mind needs training, after all."
100,Searchlight,To Love-Ru,"You are really good at finding somebody’s general whereabouts. Even completely without clues, as long as you know who you are searching for so will soon find yourself in their general area. However, the accuracy is limited depending on how mobile your target is. Somebody planetbound might find you in the same city, while for a space traveller you would only arrive at the planet the are at. You have to decide who this locks on at the start of each jump."
100,Quick On Your Feet,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim,"And even faster with your hands. You have very good reflexes, speed and reaction time, able to dodge and weave around enemies or even avoid triggered traps. Useful, since the tombs and caves around here are filled with deathtraps. Not to mention the whole 'civil war' issue that seems to be going on. While you lack a warrior's skill with weapons, you are capable of getting in some hits while avoiding retaliation. The best defense is not getting hit at all, afterall."
100,Master Artisan,Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation,"From a humble hobby you manage to turn something mundane into something exceptional. This grants you the proficiency and mastery of all Arts and Craft allowing you to create and do things at master-level so long it's related to Arts and Craft. Anything that you make is always beautiful and artistic without compromising its quality and the quality of your failed or inferior products are still at the level where kings and nobles would use much of their fortune to compete and buy it. Your greatest products may even incite wars. When you are working on a project the minor projects tend to be ten times faster when you're working on it and the major ones tend to be half as fast as your small projects, no matter how complex the project is, granted you have all of the materials needed to create the said projects."
100,Otherworlder,Re: Monster,"Having already lived one life, you have a great deal of skill and perspective to draw upon in this new world. You think differently from the people of this new world and are difficult to predict as a result. Additionally, your experience allows you to apply knowledge from other worlds to better understand things in a new world, putting them into a perspective you can more easily comprehend."
100,Modern Myth,Campione,"This is a world where all myths and legends hold some truth to them, as such, you have been studying them from as far as you remember. Researching Gods, heroes, and esoteric matters in detail left you with a wide array of knowledge about them, their cults and related trivia. From the origins of certain heroes, association between gods and festivities, evolution of cults and which ones still remain in some form. This knowledge will update each world you visit, provided they had a similar cultural progression. Also, that historical and myth trivia may be a nice way to make small talk with others."
100,Layman Linguistics,Fate/Stay Night,"You've got the oft underestimated or even mocked ability to state complex ideas or philosophies in simple, short ways. If you have the perfect answer to utterly destroy the rantings of the madman before you, it won't take you an hour to explain it all. It'll take you a single sentence to demonstrate exactly how flawed his arguments are while also showing how resolutely determined you are at the same time. You do need to have an answer or explanation however and lacking one is likely for you to just state some obvious, slightly stupid fact in lieu of the verbal masterstroke you intended."
100,Catching Up,Fate/Stay Night,"One of the most basic functions of the Grail System is to ensure that all Servants have the basic knowledge necessary to function in the modern world. This include things like basic knowledge of technology levels, culture, laws and modern society, as well as the most spoken language in the region in which the Grail War will take place. While any Servant automatically gains these effects during this jump for the Fuyuki City, Japan area, purchasing it will cause it to apply wherever you go. This ensures that you always possess the knowledge listed above for any area you are in, though without external influence this knowledge will be temporary and leave you as you leave the area in which it affects."
100,The New Chess,Medaka Box Abnormal,"Never worry about finding yourself and your friends on a bored afternoon again. You’re a genius at creating games to amuse or challenge yourself or others, through almost any medium imaginable. Physical sport games, card games, games linked to the supernatural powers that you or others have. They’ll be well made, with fair rules without loopholes or easy cheats unless you desire them to be and most of all, they’ll actually be pretty fun to play even on your own. Good Style practice too if you go for the word games."
100,Kindly Couple,Superman: the Animated Series,"Raising a child isn’t for everyone. Children require constant attention, need rigorous structure, and some rambunctious kids manage to give even the best parents headaches. But you’ll get there. When it comes to children you have the patience of a saint, the discipline of a headmistress, and eyes in the back of your head (figuratively [well, maybe literally. I don’t know you]). You might not be the best parent in the world, but you’re definitely in the top one hundred."
100,Bard,Overlord,"You are a bard. Or perhaps a Skald, if you prefer more fighting than singing. Regardless of that you tend to know a little bit about just about everything, and can usually be called upon to provide some interesting tidbit of knowledge or insight on just about any subject of note. Just starting out you’re not as good a fighter as the ranger or sorcerous swordsman, or as good at exploiting the openings of enemies as a rogue, but you’re not terribly bad either. Pick two weapons or types of weapons, you now have the skill of an experienced veteran in both of them. Your real bread and butter however is in your ability to sing (or play on instruments) magic tunes that can be used to empower yourself and allies, or debuff and debilitate your foes. Possibly both at the same time, if you’re really good. You possess a truly excellent singing voice and a masterful level of skill in just about any instrument you care to name, save for the most rare and complex, and can tell all manner of stories in engaging manner (whether they’re true or not). You also possess some skill in arcane magic, though not to the same extent as a sorcerous swordsman and certainly not to the same extent as an actual magic caster. Your real talent is that the songs you sing and play don’t really take anything out of you, so long as you can continue to play you can continue to empower yourself and friends and depower your foes. The effects of them however tend to fade after about half a minute of you not singing/playing anymore.

--- (Requires Realm of Heroes): In the Realm of Heroes your weapon skills are truly masterful, your singing, instrument playing, and arcane magics greatly magnified, and your songs can affect many more targets at once. Additionally the effects of such songs now linger for several minutes after you stop singing, and are substantially more powerful. You’ll also have a much broader base of knowledge to draw on. ---


--- (Requires Level One Hundred): At Level One Hundred your fighting and singing/playing skills are at their peak, a true epic in both song and form, capable of drawing applause (or perhaps tears) from even the most stone-hearted audience. Your arcane abilities are both subtle and profound, and tend best to work to strengthen and empower yours or others efforts. You now know a lot about just about everything, potentially including even lost or hidden knowledge, and your songs can now potentially affect whole armies, and their effects might linger for hours after you’ve finished playing. ---"
100,General Knowledge,Generic First Jump,"When you enter a new Jump, you gain knowledge of the location and culture you start in that is equivalent to what the average citizen would know. You also gain fluency in the local language or languages. For an additional 50cp, all of your knowledge will have the local equivalent added, such as a student of history knowing as much as an equivalently educated student of history in the new setting. This added information never goes away, but is never confusing and does not impair you in any way."
200,Wrong Side of the Tracks,Justice League Dark,"All these wizards and their cushy ivory towers, these witches with their cozy shacks in the woods. You’re a real hedge and you didn’t learn the Art on Easy Street. As a result, your abilities are much rougher than they’d be otherwise. You’ve got a knack for playing dirty, turning anything you know into another way to hurt others. Not only that, you know how to scrap by, finding tidbits of knowledge in the unlikeliest of places, chumming up to the most despicable characters, and feeling at home amongst the gritty, the despised, the outcast, and the literally damned. As a bonus, this upbringing comes with preternatural skill in various street urchin tricks like pick-pocketing and car jacking."
200,Sage-Like Master,Generic Fist Jump,"You are a truly excellent teacher in any subject, though you specialize in teaching martial arts and common sense. You can make even the most mundane activity, such as painting a fence or washing a deck, into a highly effective training method. You can use these methods for yourself, as well as using them to train your students."
200,Off the Grid,Marvel Cinematic Vol. 2,"In today's age with cameras and facial recognition and satellite surveillance in almost every corner of the world, you've gained an edge that most secret agents would kill for. You've gained a knack at staying off the grid more or less, knowing how to avoid electronic detection and how to get by so that you could go years without anyone realizing where you've been. Even better, when others are accessing your records or try to analyze your assets, they'll likely end up missing a thing or two. Like the company you bought, or the fact that equipment in the base you visited just happened to go missing…"
200,Always Be Prepared!,My Hero Academia,"“Remember not all heroes must fight villains with names and lives. Some of the greatest heroes I know fight the dastardly workings of nature and carelessness!” Upon purchase you’ll become innately aware of standard disaster relief protocols and training for both heroes and civilians. Additionally, you become quite apt at adapting yourself and your current skills and abilities for just such a pursuit. Suck up wreckage and rubble with black hole powers to free those trapped underneath, navigate flooded streets with frog powers, blow away smoke and fire with your mighty lungs as you work to save civilians stuck in a fire."
200,That’s Exactly What We Do,Star Wars: Attack of the Clones,"You know everything about the form, function and general operation of every form of government, which is very useful if you are part of such a structure. If someone doesn’t know much about politics, you can explain the system in a simplified but informative manner they can understand. If someone thinks they have an idea for a better system, you can compare it to the current system and identify any similarities and differences, as well as objectively compare any benefits and flaws in how said systems work. You can also come up with good arguments to defend or point these out."
200,Skilled and Resourceful,Overlord,"You’ve got a knack for certain skills. And by ‘certain skills’ what's really meant is ‘skills in general’. If you’ve got a mundane chore, assignment, or task that you need to do, then nine times out of ten you already have the skill needed to perform it at the level of an average expert. If you don’t possess that skill then you’ll probably know at least two or three related skills that can do a passable job of it anyway. This doesn’t give you any supernatural skills or anything hidden, restricted, or that requires a truly extensive education but if it's not any of those things then you can bet good money you know it or know something similar. In addition to this you’ve got a particular knack for knowing how best to use your resources to address the matter at hand, and will always possess a mental list of what resources you actually have that you can call upon. This includes human resources and things you don’t actually currently have possession of but could reasonably go get or claim authority over. If you can’t do it personally, or can’t find someone or something that can do it for you, then it probably isn’t something that can be done"
200,Run like mad,Rune Factory,"Right, so... Listen, I don’t know your life, or your skills, but you’ll need this if you can’t fight or don’t want to fight. You are a master at never facing your problems, you can dodge fireballs, explosive chicken eggs, not get hit by the horde of wolves, maybe even the bosses... for a while. On its own this skill isn’t good for much, except for running, jumping, dodging, free running, and every kind of parkour, especially when you could get dead, as we like to call it, and you move fast."
200,Saboteur,Sekirei,You’re deceptively capable of throwing a wrench into whatever plan that revolves around you or others
200,Proper Protocol,Star Wars Revenge of the Sith,"Were you made for this sort of thing? You now know all of the languages present within whatever setting you are in. You have no specific restrictions on being able to use them even if there usually would be. You are also aware of how to pilot vehicles in the setting, not to the point you can do tricks with just this alone, but you can use any vehicle properly and be at least an average driver or pilot. You are also aware of how to properly address others, which is good for formal occasions and when you want to get on somebody’s good side. Or at the very least stay off their bad side. Calling someone ‘my lord’ might be received well, while calling someone else ‘master’ might end poorly. You won’t run into that particular problem anymore"
200,Conditioning,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim,"Armor, such a useful and yet obstructive tool for many. Normally your biggest weakness would likely be your defense; armor and other heavy defenses weigh you down and would hinder both your style and ability to sneak and thus be more of a hindrance than a boon to you. Yet you’ve cheated in one way or another, you’ll find that heavy equipment that should weigh you down and weaken you just doesn’t anymore. Ebony armor can be used silently and without issue in fighting quickly just as easily as the armor of the Nightingales. You’ll also find yourself incredibly light footed, to the point that pressure plates won’t be set off and no footprints would be left behind in snow or mud."
200,Tutor of Moves,Pokemon Mystery Dungeon,"Moves are the building blocks of Pokemon Society around here. Indeed, you couldn’t make it far without at least rudimentary understanding of fighting, so even young children will know how to at least tackle somebody. However, for anything more, most need a teacher, and you are an expert at that. You may impart any skill or ability you have onto others, as long as you take the time to teach them. If you buy “Link Box” you can teach one perk instantly once per jump. Yes, Pokemon Moves work for this, even with those who aren’t Pokemon."
200,I'm Just a Janitor,Fate/Stay Night,"All too often, it seems that heroes are just guys good at hitting things real hard and looking impressive. You took a more humble approach to life. Cooking, shopping, gardening, cleaning, household maintenance and even basic mechanic work, you're world class in all of these. Not only are your skills around the best any normal human could get at these disciplines but you'll find people are much more affectionate with you when you do this sort of housework for them. A homemade meal for a lady friend might speed up your relationship by a few weeks or else cleaning up a few times after some newfound mates might really cement your burgeoning friendships."
200,In The Name,Fate/Stay Night,"The work of the Faith called to you one day and you answered eagerly. Or perhaps you just took any direction when offered, regardless of what it was. Even if your reasons were empty, the training you received was not. You are a fully ordained member of the clergy of the Catholic Church in this and all future worlds. You also have a perfect memory of all scripture, extensive skills with the exorcisms of all manner of foul spirits, the knowledge and ability to bless objects with holy power and a sense of trustworthiness about you, not much but enough to tip the scales every now and then."
200,Serving from the Shadows,Tate no Yuusha no Nariagari,Being a shadow it’s expected that you serve your liege while remaining in the shadows. You’re an expert at this that if you masquerade as a maid or other roles you don’t make mistakes while playing this role making others can only see you that way. Even your movements are silent so that you can move from one location to another without others knowing. Tracking your targets even if theyhave several days of head start and without them knowing about your presence are a piece of cake. Even kidnapping and assassinating someone heavily guarded before the guards knows is easy for you.
200,Lightspeed Navigation,DC – Blackest Night,"The various Lantern Corps make regular journeys between both planets and galaxies with naught but their Rings. As such, it’s good to be able to accurately navigate the vast stretches of space, especially if you’re visiting uncharted systems. You have the ability to make sense of your location just by the position of stars around you, turning near-indistinguishable celestial bodies into useful landmarks, and can easily navigate through space just by ‘eyeballing’ it."
200,The Savior Has Come!,Dragon Ball Z,"The most important skill for a fighter? Why, being able to rock the mic! After all, half of the battle is in the mind...so hyping yourself up and talking your opponents down is pretty effective. It helps you’re used to fighting in front of a big roaring crowd, too. Hyping and getting the attention of packed stadiums and whole countries is no big deal to you, getting their applause and adoration with aplomb."
200,Setting Priorities,Chronicle,"Now, while being able to charm your way into people’s pants puts you ahead of a good part of the competition, it would be awfully embarrassing to fail at what comes after, right? While your skills cannot be said to be supernatural, you are no beginner at the game, and no matter whoever you choose to spend the night with, they’ll be sure to leave satisfied and looking for more. Any self-proclaimed casanova might be able to do the same, though. What sets you apart from the rest is that, curiously, your skills in the bedroom are enhanced by any powers you might have. While lifting a bed with your mind might only make you the stallion of your local high school, becoming one of a thousand superman references would have you recreating scenes of your favourite two dimensional adult entertainment. Of course, you also know perfectly just how to use those powers in R-rated ways. Did you know that telekinesis is defined as, among other things, being able to make objects vibrate? Just take care not to become too /d/eviant with that gift."
200,That One Guy In Freshman Philosophy,Chronicle,"Definitely isn’t you. But you’re still quite the philosopher. Whether it is Schopenhauer, Kant, or Descartes, you’ve got a fitting quote for every possible situation, and the ability to convey it without looking pretentious. You also have the necessary mindset to truly excel in philosophy, able to look at situations from all possible angles, both inside and outside the box, a surprising insight into human nature, and the ability to write down your thoughts concisely in an easily readable format. Who knows, if you put your back into it, people might even quote you in the future."
200,Public Relations,My Hero Academia,"The hero industry has many players. Many of them are out of the limelight, making sure the ones people are watching keep looking good. You gain a remarkable amount of skill with improving someone’s image in public perception, selling it like you were advertising something a bit more traditional and selling it hard. You’ve got a silver tongue to go along with it, dancing around leading questions of interrogative reporters (among others) and taking the reins to lead the conversation yourself. You’d make an excellent manager for one of the real capes."
200,Unnatural Skill,Percy Jackson,"Whether from your heritage or just being that good you've got one particular mundane skill that your feats with border on supernatural. Whether you're a smith on the level of the Cyclopses, a near prescient tactician or a swordsman who is ny unstoppable with a blade your feats will be legendary. You are on a level within your skill such that only other beings of legend can hope to match you. This may be taken multiple times. You may not choose magic but you may choose a particular application of magic if you have it already (so curses, enchanting might work, more specific gets a bigger boost)."
200,Martial Arts Medicine,History’s Strongest Disciple Kenichi,"You may now apply your martial arts techniques to heal people instead of harm. Whether it be massage, chiropractic, or acupuncture, you can now fix nearly any non-life threatening injury through a few sessions of your specialized treatment. You may even be able to regrow lost or severed nerves, restoring function to paralyzed limbs and reinvigorating aged bodies to near the prime of youth. There are limits to this and while you cannot do the impossible (regrow lost limbs or restore the dead back to life) nearly all of the accomplishments of modern medicine and then some are within your grasps using these techniques."
300,Occult Knowledge,Arrowverse,"As if you've been studying the occult for at least a decade, your knowledge of the occult is second only to one other. You're able to identify a large number of demons, angels, magical artifacts of old, as well the language skills to decipher ancient texts in long dead or carefully hidden languages. When your time here is finished you'll similarly be filled with the occult knowledge of any at roughly the same level of your new location."
300,Parahuman - Enhanced Mastery,Worm,"Your ability allows you to master any skill or field of endeavor you care to name at an incredible pace, and to keep growing your skill from there. Within a few days of studying or practicing something you’ll be on the level of the professionals in the field, and within a week you’d be among the experts. Your growth slows down from there but your ability to learn means that you always see noticeable increases in your skills whenever you put effort into them, with continual refinement always possible. Aside from that however your ability to learn and improve your skills is superhuman. You also possess perfect technical retention and execution, meaning that your skills and knowledge never degrade, and you always perform at the top of your game. As a rough guideline treat hours as months for learning and training time. This power only affects your skills, developed attributes like strength or energy pools aren’t affected."
400,Mental Defense,Fate/Extra,"You cannot attack that which was never there can you? Those that try to attack or influence your mind will themselves limp and ineffectual as it slips out of their grasp again and again. Given a lot of time to prepare, they might be able to affect you, but you'll mentally slide by anything less than a prolonged session with a mind reader. There are some beings that simply cannot be avoided, but these beings are incredibly rare."
400,Master Investigator,Akame ga Kill,"You have all the skills needed to investigate criminal or other activates, you can trick people into thinking you are on their side as you investigate them, seduce relevant targets to improve your situation, track down any bit of information related to your investigation, and even uncover secret connections using the smallest hint. This makes you a great spy in addition to being an investigator, and does not actually require you to be investigating to use these skills."
400,A Helpful Hand,Chronicle,"Not everyone is well, even though they might not look the part. And oftentimes, their inability or refusal to ask for help leads them spiraling further and further downwards, until they are stuck there. But you are the preventive care they need. Almost instinctively, you can recognize if a person you spend some time with has got any problems, ranging from depression to financial trouble or simply social anxiety. And if they are experiencing tough times, you are able to talk to them as a friend without being turned away. They will find it surprisingly easy to open up to you, and simply talking and spending time with you is enough to immediately alleviate their problems, continuing until they fade completely as they interact more with you. The content of these conversations doesn’t matter much, and even such platitudes as “Just bee yourself, bro” will lead to gratitude instead of ridicule. This even affects things outside their control, such as money problems or abusive relatives. And even if you should leave them sometime afterwards, these problems will never pop up in their lives, as if they had been permanently purged from their very being."
400,"Shadow, Hide Me",The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim,"The direct route through the front doors is the way of the warrior and many times the mage as well, yet there are far more dimensions for travel that you’re more than capable of taking advantage of. Agility and dexterity are something that have and always will come to you easily in such a way that advanced parkour, climbing, and other various feats of acrobatics like swinging yourself over a ledge with one arm while completely geared are easy for you. To complete the skill set hunting, tracking, and gathering information on your targets is your bread and butter and finding out all sorts of things will be well within your capacity."
400,Get Up And Rise Again,Dragon Ball Z,"Fighting against titanic foes or just taking injuries in general is a problem, and it’s a problem you can’t really afford to waste time on when you or your friends are bleeding out. You now know how to use ki to heal someone’s wounds, able to bring someone back from near-death in prime condition, though healing in rapid succession can be costly if you’re not careful. This isn’t as effective when used on yourself - it takes twice as much effort to heal yourself to full condition. You may want to keep someone else handy as a medic. Nobody messes with the healer, right?"
400,Slick Commanding Style,Star Wars Attack of the Clones,"You can do more than just charge directly at your opponents and hope those following you don’t get gunned down. Unlike some here, you are actually highly competent when it comes to war, particularly when it comes to leading forces. You know a variety of strategies and tactics for the situations you and your forces will find yourself in, as well as skilled at maintaining morale and understanding logistics that are required to be successful in war over the long term. You’re the sort of leader that would quickly earn genuine respect by those you lead or otherwise outrank for doing your best to achieve victory and their survival."
400,Escape Master,Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation,"Traps and prisons are common things that can kill the powerful, especially if they are not careful. Thus, spotting traps both magical and not is a breeze for you and additionally you know how to best get around or evade them, whether by disarming or dodging at the last minute. You’re also a master at escaping making it clear that no prison, bindings, seal or dimension can prevent you from escaping. This also gives you great attainments at making traps and would be especially effective if it's designed to target a specific person or race, and the traps that you make can be both physical and magical."
400,A Message of Hope,All-Star Superman,"Your time in each world is short, limited by a decade or the whims and challenges of fate. Even then, there is the persistent fear that what you learn and what you teach may one day fade away, buried under the sands of time and the embers of dying stars. The fear that all of your achievements will end once your presence fades. No longer. You know how to pass down any skills you can teach in an understandable format, and the actions you take in the world and the reputation you wore will be carried on through myth and history. The seeds you sow, whether new technologies or the path to a bright new future - even after you’re gone, they will bloom, and they will have worthy successors who will carry on your ideals in your place, in a way you would be proud of."
400,Amusement,KonoSuba,"Who needs a muse when they’ve got you there to do all the work for them, better than they could have imagined? Art is an integral part of your very being and it shows in what you produce. In every form of artistic endeavour, from paining to performance arts, is quite literally divine in excellence. Even idle dirt drawings you spend a few minutes on could be held up as world famous pieces of art. Humming a few random notes together makes songs that could bring people to tears. Spending an afternoon writing a book, with no real plan or care? It’d become a bestseller on a global scale. And that’s just when you’re not trying that you match the peak of humanity’s creations. Actually putting in effort and you’ll see superhuman results. Paintings with magical effects, stories that can literally charm the reader into doing things, weaved clothing with the defence of enchanted plate steel armour. You are even able to inspire other artists and creators, though to a much lesser level then yourself."
400,Trainer,Re: Monster,"You have an uncanny knack for training others or, more accurately, imparting the work ethic necessary to push through the intense level of training you put them through to build them up. This accelerates their learning speed when you train them considerably but also gives them a small boost in their normal learning speed (about 1.2x their normal learning speed) even after you stop training them. Additionally, you may temporarily impart part of your own learning speed, roughly a fifth of your learning speed, to anyone you train. This increase only lasts as long as you are training them regularly (for at least a week) and for a few days after the fact at which point they stop benefiting from this increase. This has the side effect of imparting an improved work ethic on anyone you help train for an extended period of time and can even impart ideals you try to instill in them if you work with them long enough, to the point you can turn a normally savage species into a more civilized one."
600,Best of the Best,Marvel Cinematic Vol. 2,"An authoritative figure, a commander... is supposed to lead by example. If you can't even keep yourself safe, how is anyone else going to think it's worth saving your bacon? It's a lesson you and everyone must learn, and this has come to pass by how well you can teach others. Combat skills, espionage, diplomacy... these skills and more, you are able to teach your followers with near unnatural efficiency. They will learn in a fraction of the normal time, allowing you to turn weaklings with an ideal into disciplined subordinates that could take on elite forces with a speed that others might think is witchcraft. The only magical thing they'll find is your competence, and theirs."
600,"Sweet Mother, Sweet Mother",The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim,"Send your child unto me, for the sins of the unworthy must be baptised in blood and fear. A child of Sithis, or at least someone who must’ve been touched by the entity is here. That would be you Jumper, for your world is that of the shadows and your trade is in blood and murder. When it comes to the art of assassination there are very few in the Dark Brotherhood’s history who were quite as good as you were. Sneaking into a heavily guarded fortress, silently slaughtering your way through so you can plant your dagger in a King’s chest is just as easy as it would be for you to cut your way through a camp of drunken bandits. More than that, skills such as impersonating officials and guards is child’s play and dancing around alerted foes and slipping a dagger through their armor is much the same, all without even being close to touched. An Archmage or a Warrior King may be titans on the field of battle, but what can they do about the knife they can’t even see?"
600,Knowledge of Infinity,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim,"Knowledge is power, or at least that’s how the saying goes, and the Daedric Prince Hermaeus Mora would happen to agree. Within your hands is a very strange and almost disgusting book known as the Oghma Infinium, bound with the skin of each of the Mer races, both extinct and not, this book stands as one of the greatest depositories of knowledge in the Elder Scrolls universe. Filled with everything from swordplay to ancient and forgotten spells not seen since ages past, this book represents an immense amount of power should you utilize the knowledge within. Of course, while that would be quite the bounty on its own it seems your version has retained the inquisitive nature of its master, each setting you go to represents a font of knowledge never before seen in the halls of Apocrypha or the pages of the book. Like Mora himself the book will gather information from each setting you go to as if Mora himself was gathering it, this isn’t instantaneous and don’t expect it to pull information that’s under incredible concealment or protected by entities of immense power with ease. At most the book will take a full decade to gather an equivalent amount of information on each world as it does the Elder Scrolls."
600,The Day We Stop Believing Democracy Will Work Is The Day We’ll Lose It,Star Wars Attack of the Clones,"So it’s a good thing that you are really, really good at politics and using democratic systems to aid as many people as you can. Even if you’re young, you have enough experience to advise others on complex geopolitical matters and a knack for predicting what is needed to get any party or group to agree. If you and others aim to bring back those that want to separate from the current system, you would know they cannot be approached if they still feel threatened. You can even determine how political alliances are most likely to form, what might cause them, and who would be involved. This applies more to general groups, rather than specific people."
600,A Million Ways,Campione,"Slavatore Doni, a heretic genius capable of matching any Great Knight with swordsmanship alone. Luo Cuilian, an absolute master of martial arts and Daoist Arts. They are grand warriors who faced gods with nothing but their honed skills, perfected to an inhuman degree, and came out winning the battle. Now, you join their ranks as the great master in one skill of your choice. Take blacksmithing and start forging weapons that can hold their ground against Authorities or Divination and start spoiling the hell of all those shows that are yet to finish. Sure, you could also choose swordsmanship and become the only decent practice buddy for Salvatore. In any case, you also gain a small boost in learning other skills directly tied to the one you choose."
600,World’s Greatest,Generic Isekai,"Choose a mundane skill. You are now literally the greatest in the world at that skill, able to perform feats that are borderline supernatural. When you travel to another world where that skill works differently, there is someone greater than you, or there is otherwise more to learn, you quickly rise up to retake your position at the top, retaining the progress wherever you go."
600,I See Your Potential,Dragon Ball Z,"Your allies and companions may lament that they simply cannot match you. They can’t hope to catch up, to be the behemoth of power and skill you may potentially become...or already are. That fear is now unnecessary. When you train someone in a skill or ability that is possible for your new student to learn, and one you know yourself, you will find that the gap is quickly closed with enough training and effort. As long as you’re personally teaching your student one-on-one, they will quickly race to the heights of skill you yourself currently rest at, able to make a student into a master with enough time. This only works for one particular set of skills (combat, a particular technology or science, knitting, etc.) at a time, but you’ll find the top won’t be so lonely anymore. Be warned, some people who know of this teaching prowess may take advantage of you and work to ulterior motives after learning what you know...use caution when choosing your students."
800,Living Saint,Generic Xianxia,"You have walked down many roads and experienced many things, and while some would pass this off as unimportant or behind you, you are capable of recognizing how these experiences shape and ultimately improve you. It seems that by simply experiencing more and living your life, you continue to grow in power, both physically and spiritually. This is not to say you grow stronger by simply aging, or that by sequestering yourself in a cave and “experiencing” the flow of time that you grow. Rather by living your life, by making mistakes, false starts, having joys and sorrows and triumphs and simply living like a (relatively) normal person, your power will grow along with you. If you are particularly long lived and are able to remain grounded in the lives of humans or other like minded peers, your power could become… quite substantial. Living like this for a few hundred millennia might even let you reach the power level of beings who could forge stars or birth planets"
