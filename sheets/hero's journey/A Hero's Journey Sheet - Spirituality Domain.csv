Cost,Perk Name,Source,Description
0,Chakra (Jonin),Naruto,"The basic Chakra system perk, you start with reserves equal to average Jōnin. In future Jumps, by channeling chakra into others you can cause a chakra system to grow inside them."
0,Enhanced Ki,History’s Strongest Disciple Kenichi) ​(300,"­ Some have ki. You have KI​. You can feel it in you and channel it more easily, enhancing the normal effects of Sei and Dou ki to a much greater degree. Perhaps upon reaching the status of a master you may project your ki beyond your body, achieving techniques that can only be described as supernatural in nature. This perk stacks with any boost to ki, chi, aura or other general body­based energy field you may have."
50,Self-Motivation,Generic First Jump,"You have no difficulty motivating yourself, easily putting your full effort into any task, training, or activity."
100,A Deep Grudge,All-Star Superman,"You hate them. You hate them SO much. They say wrath blinds a mind, and that envy is a slow poison. Poison is certainly what you will feed to those stupid enough to earn your wrath. When you hate a particular person, object, or organization, your skills and trades come into lucid focus, and all actions you take to destroy or humiliate the object of your hatred enjoy increased competence and an increase in quality, so long as you sincerely hate it with all your heart. Oddly, this comes with the ability to let go of your grudges and hatred, and if you truly wish to, completely forgive them...but why would you do that?"
100,A Kind Heart,Justice League Dark,"Great and terrible sorcerers are a dime a dozen around here. People with the knowledge and means to unmake reality on damn near every street corner. But you have a rare gift not often found in this world: you are one of the few people who could be called truly kind. You have a knack for understanding what people are going through, offering a helping hand, and genuinely caring for anyone and everyone. You know what people need in order to feel safe and comforted. If you’ve got the ability for it, you’ll find that magic you cast is similarly kind. Benefic enchantments you cast and blessings you weave are far more powerful than they have any right to be. Additionally, people notice this kindness and they’ll often act with a bit more grace and love when you’re around, almost as if they’re trying to live up to your example. Of course, you’ll have to act the part in order to fully benefit from this perk. For a paragon of love like you, though? That’s not even remotely a problem."
100,At Your Center Lies,Rise of the Guardians,"Who are you, Jumper? What is your Center, your core? What have you, as a Spirit, sworn to protect? Choose wisely, because whatever it is, it’s a part of you now. Your Center will always be there for you. A spirit of wonder will never stop seeing the world for the beautiful place it is; a spirit of hope will always find it, even in the darkest of corners; a spirit of memories will remember everything that’s ever happened to them. It’s a part of you, and that fact cannot be changed by even supernatural influence. Perhaps more importantly than not losing it, you will never undervalue your Center, never forget how vitally important it truly is."
100,Avarice,DC – Blackest Night,"Jumper. You want it all. You feel great avarice and the desire to claim what you consider rightfully yours, and the will necessary to place your own desires over that of others. It is yours, not theirs."
100,Be Not Afraid,Generic First Jump,"You are immune to the mind-bending or destroying effects of eldritch abominations, are never impaired or disabled by fear, and are also immune to any form of spiritual corruption."
100,Boredom Immunity,Generic First Jump,"You are completely immune to boredom. When engaged in a simple repetitive task, you can choose to fast-forward through it, remembering performing the task without having to experience it fully. This fast-forward ends instantly if something changes that requires your attention."
100,Chakra (Kage),Naruto,"Requires Chakra (Jonin)

By paying 100 CP, you will start with reserves equal to an average Kage."
100,Compassion,DC – Blackest Night,"Whether it was forced upon you or you were already a warm-hearted individual, you feel great compassion and empathy for others. You can understand the emotions of others and feel great care and kindness towards them, giving your heart a sort of gentleness that can set weary souls at ease."
100,Dedication Through Light and Darkness,Duel Monsters - Shadow Realm,"Let it be known. The path of Chaos requires strict training to follow. Any lesser magician or warrior who tries to channel light and darkness recklessly would be destroyed, their body unable to hold both without annihilating itself from the paradox. Now, you have learnt the art of balancing and controlling warring powers; You can now channel and control conflicting energies within yourself, and keep them separate enough so that they do not cause you harm. If two powers would destroy on another and you with them, or null each other, then you can have both within your form or soul with no fear of accidentally allowing them to mix."
100,Expanded Metaphysique,With This Ring,"Magic requires power. Some mages sacrifice a chicken or other people for a boost; some people bargain power from arcane lifeforms like Demons, Angels, or gods. Some people, like John Constantine, get by on cleverness to sidestep a lack of power. However, simply practicing magic slowly expands the strength of your soul, much like weightlifting will expand the strength of your muscles. This grants a three-fold increase in the strength of your soul and magic, enough to take a completely untrained novice to the level of an adult Atlantean mage of average talent. This may be purchased five times, each purchase linearly increasing your power (3x, 6x, 9x, 12x, "
100,Force Sensitive,Star Wars: Attack of the Clones,"You have the lowest possible connection to the Force. You might be able to sense or intuit things, but you have no ability to use it to act on the world. You may seem to have quicker reflexes than most, or feel things about places or situations, but you cannot do much more than that."
100,Hard Won Wisdom,Generic Fist Jump,"You have studied and contemplated and have found not enlightenment, but the road to enlightenment. You can always remain calm, with perfect control over your own emotions. What is more, you are always aware of your own biases and preconceptions, even subconscious ones."
100,Herbivore Gods,Flow,"These gods are the pigeon, sparrow, cat, and other weak gods which aren’t really all that powerful although they’re the most common ones that people have. You can just pick any random herbivore and you’ll nail a weak god. Due to their common and weak nature, the wishes they grant aren't all that powerful when compared to the other gods. Some examples of the wishes you could make would be small such as making someone silent forever, cosmetic changes such as adding an animal’s traits to your body, and general small things."
100,Inspiration,Generic First Jump,"You will never run out of inspiration, being immune to writer’s block or any similar form of affliction. You are very creative and imaginative, with high potential in all creative fields."
100,Life Well Lived,Fate/Grand Order,"Even if you regret every choice you’ve ever made, it’s better to remember than to throw the memories of your life away. You existed and your choices effected everyone around you. Forgetting is an insult to yourself and to all those who took part in your life. Knowing that, you won’t forget yourself anymore. You’ll always be aware of yourself, knowing exactly you are were, who you are and who you are turning into as time passes on. Even if you do somehow lose your memories, this specific knowledge will stay with you at all times."
100,Living Life,DC – Blackest Night,"The world is full of death, that is true. But it is full of life as well. You’ve taken this lesson to heart, and regardless of the horrors you may face or the constant fighting you will endure, the simple pleasures of life never lose their light and your enjoyment of such will never be found lacking. No matter the trauma or the ennui, life will remain bright, and you will still live."
100,Love,DC – Blackest Night,"You have the ability to feel great love. Your heart has felt the warmth and ache of the Violet Light, and it burns brightly within you. At will, you can recall and experience this love, its intensity growing along with the affection of the one (or ones) you care about the most."
100,My Nindō,Naruto,"The Ninja Way, a personal rule that each shinobi lives and dies by. It is their motto, their belief and the way they live their lives, and it can be anything no matter how immoral or cruel. You too have a motto that you will follow and abide by to the ends of the Earth and no matter how many hardships you face or what situations arise, you remain steadfast to your Nindō. Unlike others, you will always find ways to achieve what you need to without compromising your beliefs whatsoever. After all, this is your Nindō."
100,"No Matter Where You Go, There You Are",Generic First Jump,"Your priorities, sense of morality and beliefs only change how you desire them to. You will instantly process and deal with any trauma in the best possible way for you, making you immune to PTSD and similar issues."
100,Nothing to Fear,Rise of the Guardians,"When the chips are down, it won’t be you who runs from a fight. It’s not that you’re fearless — though you’ll never be afraid of anything you don’t have good cause to fear — but rather that the fear will never be overwhelming, will never be able to control you. Not only that, but no one will ever be able to use your fears against you. Phobovores will gain no power from your fear, not even if they utterly terrify you. If a person were able to somehow sense the fear of others, be it through magic or smell, they won’t be able to sense your fear. And, finally, no one will ever become aware of your specific fears or phobias unless you tell them."
100,Psychic Intuition,Generic First Jump,"You have a bit of psychic potential. You often get flashes of intuition or gut instinct that prove accurate. You are also an excellent judge of character, can get hints of other people’s emotions, and can sense the presence of the supernatural."
100,Push Through,My Hero Academia,"Many Quirks lack common precautions you would think would be built in. Training and even active use of powers can sometimes hurt, a lot, and you don’t have time for that. You can push through the pain of any self-inflicted injuries and push the stimuli to the back of your mind as you focus on the situation at hand, whether that’s combat, training or something else. Break your arms in a dozen places each? Fracture your legs? If it’s an emergency you’ll still be able to keep running and fighting and moving. Just be careful you don’t cripple yourself in the process."
100,Rage,DC – Blackest Night,"It was not merely anger you felt the day you were chosen by the Red Light. It was tail-gnashing, nail-biting white-hot fury that burned within you. You feel great rage within your heart that you can tap into at will, ensuring the Light of Rage will burn brightly in your hands."
100,Saint Gatherer,Fate/Grand Order,"A unique substance to be found in this world, Saint Quartz are powerful multi-coloured crystals that can be attained by accomplishing certain sorts of actions. Completing quests or journeys, making daily significant progress towards your main goals to gain every second day, taking part in important events in the story of the world or forming very close and strong bonds with other people all have a chance or certainty of granting a Saint Quartz. Once obtained, there are three uses for these crystals. One can be used to fully restore your energy and fatigue, one can be used to revive you and a small number of allies from the brink of death to full health again or one can be used to chance the summoning system within the Grand Order system, so long as one has the support of Chaldea. This perk is free for Human Type Jumpers for the duration of the jump but may be kept for future jumps, or bought by Servant Types, for 100CP."
100,Shamefully Shameless,Infinite Stratos,"Shame. You have none. Zip, nada, nil. You could walk out onto a worldwide stage, stark naked, with a grin on your face and be every bit as confident on the inside as you look on the outside. You’re not immune to fear, save the fear of embarrassment, nerves, butterflies in the belly and shyness. You’ll never find yourself unable to confess to that girl you like, chickening out of a dare from embarrassment or unwilling to be every bit of the over the top nutbag you really want to be deep inside."
100,Spiritual Pressure - Vice Captain,Bleach,"A capable and well-proven member of your kind. You’re not the elite but you are far above the common pack. You’re a dangerous fighter, with likely years to decades of experience depending on your species life expectancy. You’re generally capable with most of your race’s special techniques, a Shinigami would have decent skill in each of the four primary arts of Zanjutsu, Hoho, Hakuda and Kido. A Shinigami would be a weaker Vice Captain, perhaps new to the role. A Hollow would be at least Adjuchas class, possibly one of the older and weaker kinds of Arrancar that pulled off their own masks, such as the Privaron. A Quincy could be a lower ranked officer in the Quincy King’s army or match the traditionalist Ishida Uryu around the time he went to Hueco Mundo. A Fullbringer would have reached full affinity with his object of power, such as most members of Xcution and an Artificial Spirit could match any of the above."
100,Strong Soul,That Time I Was Reincarnated as a Slime,You have a very strong and powerful soul unlike most monsters whose souls contain much less energy naturally. You may be seen as a valuable snack to demons who can utilize such energies. A stronger soul helps in getting stronger skills.
100,Swift Release,Naruto,"A combination of lighting and wind, with this bloodline, a user can increase their speed to extreme levels allowing for the user to strike at enemies far faster than the eye can see. With time and practice, the user can even move so fast that not even the Sharingan itself can see the user."
100,The Road Goes Ever On And On,Generic First Jump,"Your mind is well-prepared for dealing with eternity. You can find joy and satisfaction in everyday life no matter how long you have been alive, you can adapt to new cultures with ease, and you will never find your emotions blunted by the passage of time and ennui."
100,Veteran,Generic First Jump,"You never lose your cool, keeping your head no matter what the situation you are in. This does not mean you don’t feel emotions, just that you can control them."
100,Will,DC – Blackest Night,"You have the ability to overcome great fear. Your willpower was strong enough to draw the attention of the Power Ring. Thus, you have a great will, able to face your own fears and hardships with grit teeth and steadfast determination."
200,Aegis Shield,The God of Highschool,The spirit of the legendary Aegis carried by Athena and Zeus. This Charyeok manifests as a full body energy armour made of transparent energy shards. These shads can split up and move as the user wills. They can be used to attack as a swarm of flying energy knives or form into singular weapons for the user to wield or to enhance the user’s existing weapons. They can also be formed into larger weapons on their own and fight independently of the user or form shields or platforms to defend or stand on.
200,Baedal Choi or Bruce Lee,The God of Highschool,"A dual choice option. One may take either the legendary Karate Master Baedal Choi or the famed Jeet Kune Do master Bruce Lee. Either of these options greatly enhances the user’s physical strength, speed and reactions and the Charyeok, particularly friendly ones, will do their best to teach you what they know of their martial arts and the secret techniques that they never revealed to the rest of the world."
200,Beginner,Star Wars: Attack of the Clones,"You are actually able to use the Force to some extent, akin to the level of a beginner Padawan. You can move small things with some concentration or somehow intuitively react to things you cannot see, as an example."
200,Chakra (Tailed Beast),Naruto,"Requires Chakra (Kage)

Paying 200 CP will result in having chakra on the same level as Kisame Hoshigaki, a shinobi hailed as ‘Tailless Tailed Beast’. In future Jumps, abilities that function using the target’s chakra, such as by disrupting, amplifying, or sensing it, will continue to function as normal, either using the setting’s equivalent energy types, or using life force as appropriate."
200,Divine Protection,Re: Monster,"You have been blessed by a god or goddess, granting you their protection and a boon unique to them, which can vary from person to person as well as god to god. For 200cp, this is the blessing of a demigod, offering a minor benefit to you. Demigods are in the range of Color, Compassion, Dance, Healing, Staves, War Beasts, and similarly focused gods. As an example, the Demigod of Fire grants resistance to flames and the ability to breath fire."
200,Experience of Ages,Fate/Stay Night,"Getting caught up in one's own legend is disturbingly easy, especially with how justified it can feel sometimes. Why should you fear this fresh faced young boy when you have fought the greatest monsters the world could throw at you and emerge victorious? No matter how justified, these feelings eventually lead to overconfidence in oneself and underestimation of one's enemies. You have learnt how to always have a stable and fair image of your own power and that of any opponents you face. Never again will you overestimate your own abilities, even if you haven't rigorously tested those limits you will know what is too much for you. The opposite is also true as you will never underestimate any enemy for any reason other than simple lack of knowledge. Your pride, ego and past experience will never cause you to take an opponent any less seriously then they deserve."
200,God Point Granter,The God of Highschool,"Whilst as a God, you possess the ability to form contracts, this would normally apply only to those abilities and energies that you have gained from this land, being otherwise incompatible for what powers may hail from other worlds. By taking this ability, you become able to form contracts that grant measures of your power that originates from other lands. You are able to imbue amounts of power or energy into those willing to take it in return for them giving you some of their energy or performing favours in exchange. However, by granting them this power, you will be unable to access whatever you chose to grant them whilst they make use of it. See notes for more details."
200,Golden Rule,Justice League Unlimited,"Being a hero isn't always sunshine and daisies. Sometimes you've got to have...something else other than power and desire to do good. Sometimes you have to hold yourself to standards. Standards that would normally be impossible even for most heroes. The greatest of heroes have a golden rule they never cross. Set a rule, any rule and you won't unconsciously cross it you'll always be aware of this rule and follow it to the letter. This however won't prevent you from never being able to cross it consciously you can always choose to break it when needed. You cannot be mind controlled or manipulated without your consent to cross such a line. And god help whatever manages to make you break said rule. The mental backlash would be enough to shatter such control over you."
200,Grim Will,Petals of Reincarnation,"You may not normally think a person who cuts their own throat to have a strong will but when it is done on faith from an untrustworthy source and just for a chance at power? The situation looks a little different. You’ve got a will that is not just nearly unbreakable towards others, it allows you to decisively do any sort of disgusting or self-harming thing if necessary. You can slice open your own throat without hesitation if you believed it necessary or wade through all kinds of shit and filth in pursuit of your goals. You are even able to force yourself past any fears or phobias that you may still have, crushing your terror with sheer will."
200,Jutsu Mastery,Naruto,"Your control over jutsu and other techniques is akin to an experienced master. Any jutsu you already know no longer needs hand signs to use beyond the most basic of ones like one needed for Fireball Technique. Any technique you learn will very quickly be mastered up to this level. A great example of this is creating a Rasengan with just one hand, but this doesn’t end at that. You can even create Rasenshuriken with just one hand if you know it. This is what you could do to every technique you know."
200,Lava Release,Naruto,"A combination of fire and earth, this Kekkei Genkai is a tad different compared to others as this bloodline manifests in different forms. You can choose which form this takes. One is molten rock (compulsory for Son Goku Jinchúriki), the second is a form of acidic mud which basically looks like brown dirt, the third is corrosive quicklime, the fourth is vulcanized rubber, and the final form is volcanic ash. Different versions can be purchased for 50 PP per version."
200,Not Nearly Enough,Invincible,"I don’t know what it is my friend but pain doesn’t bother you: you’re able to deal with immense levels of pain as if it simply isn’t there. Not the normal aches, papercuts, white lies, and stubbed toes but true pain. You could be roasted in the fires of a star or suffer the pain of your loved one moving on, or even have your own intestines ripped out of your abdomen and still keep yourself together. With this you could headbutt someone to death after you had broken your arms on their face or even be able to push through the emotional pain of an abortion or miscarriage to support someone who really needs it. It’s not that you don’t feel it but that it is not nearly enough to stop you."
200,Ordinary Gods,Flow,"While calling gods ordinary might be a weird thing to say these are the gods that a lot of the people who are forced to go to high school have. These are your lions, tigers, and bears although there are even street dogs, snakes, and rats. As the gods are more worshipped the wishes they are able to grant is a good deal more powerful than those of the herbivores. Wishes such as restoring your lost limbs and eyes, making you impossibly lucky at gambling, or even eternal youth are the standard fare for these gods."
200,Royal Humility,To Love-Ru,"There’s a point where a single person holds simply too much power for them to stay completely sane - but that’s not a limit you will ever reach. No matter how powerful or influential you become, you will never become power hungry, snobbish or dismissive of actual threats. There will be no time where you become incapable of associating with “the Common Folk” or where you go crazy trying to prevent any chance of you being toppled."
200,Spiritual Pressure: Captain,Bleach,"Powerhouses of the spiritual worlds, this is the divide that separates the weak from the strong. Those at this level are the Captains, Espada and Stern Ritter of their kind, albeit the weaker and less experienced members of these august ranks. As one of the longer lived races, you may very well be a centuries old warrior, with a well rounded understanding of both combat and your races’ unique abilities. Highly capable in most areas, from combat to technique to racial magic. A Bankai, if not fully mastered, or Resurreccion is expected at this point. Your spiritual power has reached what most would consider the level of an ‘average’ Shinigami Captain and you’re likely to be a frontline fighter for any faction you join. Some examples are thus. A Shinigami might be equal to Captain Komamura or Captain Hitsugaya early in the story, powerful but hardly the cream of the crop as they are now. A Hollow would be one of the lower Espada, an Adjuchas made Arrancar through the Hogyoko, such as Grimmjow or Nnoitra. Of the Quincy, the lesser Stern Ritter such as Candice Catnipp or Bazz B are a good example. Of the Fullbringers, Ginjo before he takes Ichigo Kurosaki’s powers is a capable representative and Artificial Spirits could look to powerful Bount like Jin Kariya or enhanced souls like Nemu."
200,Take It Head On,Bleach,"What matters most in battle? It’s sure as shit not fancy footwork, puffed up sword waving or whiny magic. It’s being a hard enough fucker to take the hits and give them back just as good. Too many of your fellows fall short at the first stage, dropping like flies the moment someone has a good shot. Not you though. You’ve always been naturally tougher than everyone around you, gifted in all things defensive. The primary initial way this appears is in a greatly increased defensive property. For most races, this is in inordinately tough bodies. A normal human would have skin like tough bark while a Menos or seated Shinigami’s skin seems like steel, much more potent than peers of the same level. A Hollow might instead empower their regeneration to be much faster or a Quincy their Blut Vene. You’ve got a natural affinity for anything else that falls under the umbrella of just tanking and surviving everything that comes at you. These things will grow quicker and smoother in you, the rate of increasing these gains increasing with your power to help you stand out as a bulwark among your level."
200,Tempered Steel,Kickboxer,"Even with a gun to your temple and a blade pointed at your eye, you’d be able to smash your fist into the bad guy’s face with all the force you can muster and not waste a moment in hesitation. You still feel fear and caution but as distant things, stuff to be registered but ignored when it would be more effective. You will never again hesitate because of fear, worry or anxiety, in a fight or when making a life choice. This won’t drive you to make reckless choices, only remove the critical flaw of cowardice from your mind."
200,Those Who Would Be Kings,Campione!,"Before their successful acts of deicide, a Campione is an extraordinary person able to find a way through even the direst of circumstances. Sharing in that prerequisite, you find yourself blessed with the qualities that would guide you towards such a fate. Courage and will to face down a heretical god despite being an otherwise normal mortal, paired with cunning great enough to link together a means to make their downfall a reality should they be available. Luck to create miracles that snatch victory from the jaws of seemingly certain defeat, if it is indeed at all possible for you. In more ancient times you would find yourself leaving a name in history that altered its course globally, provided you did not simply content yourself with lesser pursuits."
200,Tireless,Overlord,"You simply, magically, don’t get tired. Ever. You can fight literally all day and all night non-stop for weeks at a time if you need to. You’d still need to eat and drink on the go, unless you don’t normally need to do those things, but you could do that while fighting with one hand easily enough. Your muscles do not cramp, you do not feel weariness creeping up on you no matter how strenuous the exercise, and in combat when others start flagging and slowing down you’re still going strong at the peak of your ability. This explicitly makes it so you don’t need to sleep anymore, assuming you still have to do that, and at any time that you aren’t in the middle of strenuous physical endeavours just taking it easy and relaxing will be just as beneficial for you as actual sleep. This also provides you with a modest healing factor, not quite strong enough to be useful in short battles but noticeable enough to be of significant use in longer conflicts. Even undead or things that wouldn’t otherwise be naturally capable of healing themselves can benefit from this regeneration. This tirelessness also slightly affects your mental processes as well, allowing you to easily dedicate your extra time from not sleeping towards any sort of training or other activity that you desire without suffering from mental fatigue."
300,Dragon Soul,King Arthur,"You have the soul of a dragon, or at least people seem to think that now. Aside from the cool factor this give you a greatly increased aptitude for magic of all kinds and, even if only slight, the respect of dragons. Allowing you to talk to even the most haughty of flying lizards without them immediately trying to kill you."
300,Dust Release,Naruto,"This Kekkei Tota derived from the combination of Wind, Earth and Fire affinities allows the user to disintegrate a target on the molecular level. This is done by creating a small 3D object which expands once released by the user. Anything that passes through it is destroyed. However, these techniques require time to prepare and can be chakra taxing."
300,Ki,The Rising of the Shield Hero,"You have a talent for yet another energy source that exist in this world, this time one more useful for strengthening the body. By circulating and expending your internal Ki you may substantially increase your physical abilities. Through training, you may learn how to sense Ki to substitute for sight, or even refine your control for more complex ways of attacking or defending like bypassing durability or parrying magical projectiles back to the caster."
300,Mythical Gods,Flow,"Now we are getting into the truly powerful gods that everyone wants to have. These are your unicorns, griffins, american eagles, dragons, black tigers, and other mythical gods. These wishes are extremely powerful such as granting you immense wealth nearly on par with the whole world, killing anyone that is weaker than you, the creation of special relics such as a safe that can be stored in personal dimensions, or even a book that can hold many powers."
400,Ancient Tongue,Generic Naruto Fanfiction,"Somehow, through an accident or fate, you encountered one of the ancient tongues of the world, maybe the Celestial or Infernal, or something similar. This has changed you, and made you… better, in certain ways. First, you have a ridiculous aptitude for all languages, mortal, immortal, divine or demonic. Simply by encountering them once you can learn how to read and speak the language flawlessly and fluently, no matter if it’s just a dialect of a language you already speak or the language The World Was Written In. In addition, you become an absolute master of fuuinjutsu, capable of doing things with it even the greatest master would gawk in awe at. You can set up things like Konoha’s shields, seal terrible and powerful entities into objects and things to harness and manipulate their powers however you please, make storage seals, explosive tags, seals to support jutsus or ones that hold whole Jutsus in stasis, or even other, more exotic effects... basically everything you see seals doing in Naruto fanfics. This carries over to similar skills, anything to do with inscriptions or runes like warding and enchanting or cursing in the future too. Not only do you learn the skills reserved to mortals in such fields, but even the stuff of heavenly or hellish libraries is not beyond you now."
400,Black Turtle,Flow,"The Black Turtle does not have a specialized wish and only has a generic wish to offer you. It makes up for this by giving you powerful abilities. At a moments notice you can conjure up a storm so powerful it can flood an entire city given a few minutes. The Black Turtle also is able to give others a portion of its power strengthening all of their other abilities while allowing access to the Black Turtles main ability. These people who you bestowed power upon will be able to gift others with those same powers as well although unlike you this has a nasty side effect of turning them into monstrosities and killing said individuals. The most terrifying weapon of The Black Turtle and all those who have a piece of its power is the ability to take other animas. This can be done by either the person voluntarily giving up the anima or through force. By force, I mean that the person has to die in order for you to gain their power. In future jumps, you will gain the souls, powers, innate abilities/energies, etc of beings that voluntarily give them up or you kill. You are also able to take nay sealed beings that are inside a person or object. Due to its strange nature, it is possible for you to put anima’s into dead bodies although the process is not easy. In future jumps, this turns into a general soul stuffer and may be used on living bodies."
400,Blue Dragon,Flow,"The Blue Dragon is the other god that holds power over the future not the past. The special wish of the god is the power of foresight or seeing into the future. It shows inside your mind a vision of the future that can be months decades, or further beyond ahead of its time. The visions are always accurate as the god shows you all the major events, important minor events, and even possible future paths based on choices you could make in full detail. Should you have the power of the White Tiger as well you can instead opt to travel to the future instead. This doesn’t count as a special wish for the White Tiger. Just like the White Tiger you may stay in the future an continue on or stay upwards to a week before returning back to the present. The Blue Dragon, like any god, requires a sacrifice should you wish to use its ability after three times. This sacrifice is a whole lot less drastic than the White Tiger as it isn’t as dickish. The sacrifice is that one loses a part of their body such as eyes or the ability to walk. It is merciful though as regeneration and technology can work around these issues and the dragon god isn’t bothered so long as the sacrifice was made. As its power is future sight the skill of the Blue Dragon is precog. In the beginning, you’ll be able to see one second into the future. This can be done at a moments notice giving you a clear picture of what will happen in any situation. This future vision could be used in manys ways ranging from a danger sense to petty gambling. With the repeated usage of the precog, you’ll be able to extend the limit on how much time you can see into the future. With the blue dragon being a god, both of the precogs are capable of trumping others who have precog or similar abilities while limiting what they see of you."
400,Divine Protection,Re: Monster,"You have been blessed by a god or goddess, granting you their protection and a boon unique to them, which can vary from person to person as well as god to god. For 400cp, this is the blessing of a god, offering greater benefits than those offered by the demigods. Gods are in the range of Blood, Darkness, Death, Fate, Gems, Judgement, Magic, Sunlight and similarly focused gods. As an example, the God of Ice Fields grants protection from fire based weaknesses (such as sunlight to vampires) and grants an affinity to Ice Magic that can be channeled through weapons."
400,Don't You Ever Get Lonely?,Justice League Unlimited,"Leaving behind your old life can be difficult, especially if you couldn't bring anyone with you, and if you had to leave because all of your friends and loved ones or perhaps even your entire species were gone, well, that can cause some people some very serious mental issues. Fortunately you're very good at dealing with your emotions, making connections with new people, and finding purpose in your work and other things. Even if you discovered that you were the last surviving person on the planet or found yourself stranded on some distant alien world you could resist going insane and quickly adapt to your new environment. With enough time you can start a new life and be content regardless of where you are, and you're guaranteed to find a new family or lover if there are enough people around that you can connect to."
400,Get Up And Rise Again,Dragon Ball Z,"Fighting against titanic foes or just taking injuries in general is a problem, and it’s a problem you can’t really afford to waste time on when you or your friends are bleeding out. You now know how to use ki to heal someone’s wounds, able to bring someone back from near-death in prime condition, though healing in rapid succession can be costly if you’re not careful. This isn’t as effective when used on yourself - it takes twice as much effort to heal yourself to full condition. You may want to keep someone else handy as a medic. Nobody messes with the healer, right?"
400,Heracles,The God of Highschool,"The greatest hero of Greece, Heracles himself. In raw power it can be said to be one of the greatest Charyeok in the world and it grants this in the form of incredible physical might to its user. Even an ordinary boy would become able to lift hundreds of tonnes with a single hand or survive being kicked through multiple buildings with nary a scratch on their body, along with the endurance to fight for hours at a time. As your experience and bond grows, you will be able to pull out more and more of the legendary strength of Heracles."
400,I Am the Bone of My Sword,Fate/Stay Night,"One thing. The very core of your being. Something to base your whole life around. For Shirou Emiya, it was Swords. For you? Perhaps something else. You'll find yourself innately understanding the idea you choose, even letting you understand other concepts a bit easier if you can frame it in the context of what you chose. More importantly, you're an absolute genius when it comes to magic based around this one thing. Shirou Emiya, an otherwise poor quality Magus, was able to use magic that approached the level of True Magic when relating to swords. It took him being in a rather unique situation, where usually it would still take years to achieve, but he did what would have been impossible for most Magi. You are on the same level with your chosen idea. When related to that idea, your magic will be many times stronger, many times easier to use and many times easier to learn or create, though the broader the concept is from 'Sword' the lesser the effect will be. Careful to not lose yourself in your own ideal."
400,I Just Do My Best At Everything,Chronicle,"So many people are simply living life without doing anything with it, only talking and thinking, but not acting. And then they see you, and wonder about how you are so far beyond them. If only they knew how simple it is. Well, for you at least. You simply get up every day, motivated, refreshed, and full of energy, and do your best at everything. Without fail. This doesn’t mean that you don’t make mistakes, of course, but rather that you are able to give 100% at everything you do, at all times. And you are able to do this without accumulating any stress or fatigue, whether it be physical or mental, that would hinder you from doing so. While others might be surprised at how mundane your secret to success seems, having this outlook on life does work wonders on where you end up."
400,Jinchūriki,Naruto,"You are a Jinchūriki, a human sacrifice made to contain one of the nine Tailed Beasts, remnants of Kaguya Ōtsutsuki’s chakra and the World Tree. This burden comes with both advantages and disadvantages. Firstly, due to holding a being of pure chakra within them, a Jinchūriki boasts immense reserves of chakra far greater than an average Jōnin, potentially equaling that of a Kage. Secondly, each Jinchūriki possesses an ability unique to the Tailed Beast that inhabits them. For example, the Jinchūriki of Shukaku possess the ability to manipulate sand, while the Jinchūriki of Son Goku possess Lava Release. Through practice and time, a Jinchūriki can wrest away the chakra of their Tailed Beast, forcefully taking their power for themselves. This allows a Jinchūriki to take on the form of the Beast, increasing their physical abilities and granting them greater access to the Tailed Beast’s capabilities. However, there is an alternative method of drawing upon the Tailed Beast’s power: befriending it and forming a symbiosis with it. This partnership can allow your Beast to access your chakra reserves, enabling them to funnel their chakra through you and even absorb and balance nature chakra for you."
400,"Mind, Body, Spirit",Generic Fist Jump,"Your mind is focused, your body is strong, your spirit is pure. Through training and meditation, you have made yourself anew. Your willpower is unlimited, yet you remain mentally flexible and open to new ideas. You are resistant to poison and disease, and no matter how old you become, you remain as physically capable as in your prime. Finally, your spirit is unbreakable. You never give in to despair and are immune to any form of corruption. You will only be as evil as you choose to be."
400,Phoenix,The God of Highschool,"A great bird made from blue flames. The Phoenix is not only able to tear apart foes with its super sharp, giant claws and beak, but also generate and control fire in large amounts. It’s most fearsome ability however, is the ability to leech the life off of other beings in order to multiply itself. Whether through the contracted user or on an enemy, Phoenix is able to devour their life energy to grow bigger or to grow additional bodies, which are equally powerful to the original Charyeok."
400,Pride of the Weak,Duel Monsters - Shadow Realm,"It is the pride of the weak to stare down the tallest of giants, and through gumption fell them like trees. Under your command, those who face foes with greater strength than they will gain a great amount of courage...a courage which seems to translate into a greater power! These weak warriors will be able to deal damage even despite the disparity of ability, as the ‘stronger’ foes will be more susceptible to their strikes. The weak have their pride, let the world know!"
400,Red Dragon,The God of Highschool,"An enormous female Red Dragon originating from Britain’s legends, the Red Dragon is large enough to encircle a large apartment building multiple times over and still have some length left over. Able to create and manipulate fire at will, sharing this ability with her partner, she is also immensely physically powerful and speedy. Red Dragon is also capable of incredible feats of regeneration, healing from even severe wounds across the entire body in minutes, whilst coming back to life as a hatchling two months later whenever she is killed. She is very protective of her partner and has a great passion for gold of any kind, becoming ecstatic on being given gold bars or jewellery as a gift. Red Dragon is one of the rare Charyeok to be able to polymorph themselves, being able to turn into a pretty young redheaded girl with twin tails"
400,Red Phoenix,Flow,"The legendary bird that is most known for its control over life. There are two uses for the wish of the god with the first being that should you die by any means it shall use its power to resurrect you. You’ll come back in prime condition, stronger than you were before, and highly resistant to whatever it was that killed you provided it was some sort of exotic or hax effect. The second usage allows a person that is long dead or someone who died in a special manner such as being retconned out of existence, to be resurrected with the same benefits as yours. As you have three special wishes this lets you have three resurrections for yourself or someone else. The sacrifice is unique for The Phoenix as it doesn’t want you to sacrifice anything of your own. If you die or need to resurrect someone and have used up your special wishes the Phoenix will use the last remnants of power to fulfill your wish. The sacrifice is that you forfeit the power of the Phoenix itself. No more wishes until ten years pass or the next jump. However, there is a way to get more of the special wishes without forfeiting the Phoenix's power. The Phoenix absolutely loves to see bloodshed and wants the lives of others in return for the continued use of its resurrection. By killing any sentient being i.e humans, gods, orcs, aliens, fantasy monsters, intelligent animals, etc it will add one more wish for the continued use of its resurrection powers. The Phoenix is known for being supportive and its skill reflects this. With a mere touch, you can restore a person and heal them to their prime condition with the process taking only a single moment. The person can range from slightly sick to even the recently deceased. So long as there is a single body part or piece of skin remaining everyone can be brought back. This healing touch cures them of any and all ailments, diseases, mental illnesses, curses, and anything that negatively affects their mind, body, and soul. You can turn a person's age back into their prime years by reversing the aging process. Yes, you can instantly heal yourself back to full power with a touch"
400,Sacred Gear - Blade Blacksmith,Highschool DxD,"This Sacred Gear is something of an ‘older brother’ to Sword Birth, having an identical effect save for the fact the weapons summoned are Holy Swords, thus making it terrifyingly effective against Devils or other unholy creatures like the Fallen. It’s also notable in that it can potentially develop multiple Balance Breakers, such as summoning knights to wield said Holy Swords or make a gigantic dragon made entirely of said weapons. Who knows? Perhaps that potential can be unlocked in your hands, as well..."
400,Sacred Gear - Earthshatter,Highschool DxD,"These are a pair of arm guards clad in bronze. Their application is simple and direct - the user’s physical attacks, whether with a weapon or with their fists and feet, will enjoy a boost of kinetic force that can pulverize rock and fight things many time their size and strength. There is no muscle power involved - the Sacred Gear turns mana into pure kinetic force, making the user stronger, faster, and tougher as the physical force of their blows and movements are increased while those of the enemy are mitigated. This has limits, however...it can only provide and prevent as much power as your mana can feed, and things that don’t rely on blunt or kinetic force can’t be defended against by this Gear alone. Try punching them before it happens."
400,Sacred Gear - Forbidden Balor View,Highschool DxD,"STOP. Sit. Stay. Another eye-based Sacred Gear, this one allows you to momentarily freeze what you can make line-of-sight with in time. This starts at a relatively short amount of time, but with practice and increased mastery, the duration can be made longer - it’s unlikely you can freeze anything indefinitely, however. It’s said this Sacred Gear has a lot of potential, and an evil consciousness within it...but, of course, this version lacks the latter effect. Be grateful."
400,Sacred Gear - Gravity Jail,Highschool DxD,"Sometimes, people just weigh you down. Good thing you can return the favor. This Sacred Gear manifests within your eyes, and allows you to adjust the personal gravity of anything within your line of sight, of your choosing. This lets you crush someone with bone-smashing gravitational force, or make them float helplessly in the air - just mind the ‘need line of sight’ thing."
400,Sage Mode,Naruto,"Many view Sages as just another type of ninja, another kind of killer, but we both know that’s not true. A Sage is something more, a being who doesn’t just use the chakra of the world but becomes one with the world. Sages utilize a specialized form of jutsu called senjutsu that involves drawing natural energy from the world itself into their bodies and merging it with their own chakra to create senjutsu chakra. Now, this seems easy but in order to do so the nature chakra must be gathered and then balanced with the body's physical and spiritual energies. Upon doing so, the Sage’s strength, speed, stamina, reflexes, perception, and durability are enhanced. By utilizing senjutsu chakra, the Sage can cause their ninjutsu, genjutsu, and taijutsu to become even more powerful. The Sage can sense chakra around them and can sense attacks without the need to view them and if you can already do that before, then the talent is enhanced. While in Sage Mode, this increases the amount of chakra the user has available and by imbuing senjutsu chakra into ninjutsu, the user can augment the techniques and gain access to special senjutsu techniques. As you are paying CP, you can choose to gain the powers of either the Toad Sages or the Snake Sages. The Toad Sages possess the Frog Kata ability, allowing the user to harness natural energy to extend the reach of their attacks. The Snake Sages possess the Inorganic Reincarnation technique, allowing the user to animate and control the environment around them, as well as using the White Rage technique, a powerful explosion of light and sound. However, this comes with a downside. If too much natural energy is taken in, it can lead to the Sage being turned into stone. Another downside is that the natural energy can only be taken in and mixed only when standing completely and utterly still. If in a fight, you cannot stay utterly still, then your reserve of Senjutsu chakra will diminish as the battle goes on. By paying for it here, you'll find that the first drawback of turning to stone will never occur and you will never make any mistake in the blending of the chakra. Even in a life and death battle, the process will always go correctly. Normally you would require large chakra reserves, but you have found a way around that. Another thing to remember is if you continually practice the use of senjutsu, the time needed to refill your senjutsu reserves will decrease."
400,Senior,Star Wars: Attack of the Clones,"You are on the level of a fully trained Padawan, having enough training to be a competent wielder of the Force. Anakin would be somewhere between this category and the next, having power but lacking discipline that would raise him to that level."
400,Simultaneous Activation,Akame ga Kill,"It's widely considered impossible to use two Teigu at the same time, due both to the mental strain, and the physical toll being to great. However you can manage it(provided you are compatible with both), the strain on your body will still leave you feeling like you had a building fall on you, but it won't put you out of commission. In time you may be able to train yourself such that it's no more strenuous than using a single Teigu. What's more you will find that you can combine the abilities of the Teigu you use seamlessly, as though they are a single Teigu. This effect will also extend to other magical devices, allowing you to combine the usage of two usually incompatible devices in a seamless fashion."
400,Six Paths Senjutsu,Naruto,"Requires: Sage Mode

you can obtain Six Paths Senjutsu, a version of senjutsu vastly superior to regular senjutsu. For starters, every boost you get from regular senjutsu is massively enhanced to the point you that you can sense beings like Madara’s Limbo clones and dodge lightspeed attacks. Secondly, you are immune to all but senjutsu enhanced attacks. Thirdly, Six Paths Senjutsu enhances any dōjutsu you possess. An example of this is Obito using Kamui and what little Six Paths chakra he had left to somehow give his Sharingan to Kakashi temporarily while he was in Limbo. Another example is Kakashi being able to use the perfect Susanoo without any of the prior forms. Finally, you gain access to Yin and Yang natures as well as Yin-Yang release and Truth-Seeking Balls along with the ability of flight. Aar as abilities go, the versions the Jūbi Jinchūriki have and what Naruto gets are the same but with different appearances. Naruto’s eyes changed to be similar to when he uses Sage mode in Nine-Tails Chakra Mode but without the markings or the chakra cloak, The Jūbi Jinchūriki either has fleshy mutations like Obito or clothes made of senjutsu chakra like Madara. For the purposes of this perk, if you are not a Jūbi Jinchūriki, assume that your Six Paths Sage Mode is similar in appearance to Naruto’s, only tailored to what animal summon you chose to learn from."
400,Spiritual Pressure - Elite Captain,Bleach,"The elite of each faction, albeit not the absolute peak of power. With this option, you’ll no doubt be considered quite famous, as either a brilliant young prodigy or a true veteran of nearly a millennia of action. Most core skills, to combat and racial techniques, are at the level of an expert user. In terms of Reiryoku, you’d have about twice as much as the average Captain and you’d be considered to have some level of mastery of your racial release state or unique power. Examples of this level are sparing but eye-catching. Byakuya Kuchiki of the Shinigami is an excellent showcase of the sort of overall level of skill and superb power available. A mighty warrior, skillful magician, intelligent leader and fine man. But clearly lesser than the true Shinigami veterans, such as Shunsui Kyoraku or Unohana Retsu. Among Hollows, the higher level Espada such as Starrk or Harribel are a clear example, likely making you a Vasto Lord yourself. To the Quincy, powerful Stern Ritter like Bambietta Basterbine or Mask de Masculine are your best choices. Make no mistake, you’re not the strongest with this or even on par with the second and third strongest tiers. The Royal Guard, the Quincy Schutzstaffel, thousand year old Shinigami Captains and more are all beyond you in power and skill. To say little of their leaders. But it makes an excellent starting point."
400,Thor,The God of Highschool,"The Norse God of Storms. Thor grants his partner greatly increased physical ability, though not nearly to the level of one Heracles, and the ability to fly at great speeds, both for the user and for them to make other inanimate objects or people fly as well. He also allows the user to fire huge, pink laser beams from their eyes at will, each of which are incredibly destructive rays."
400,Tranquil Fury,DC – Blackest Night,"As it turns out, an entire organization of wild berserkers with little more than pack mentality isn’t a recipe for success. You’ve learned how to internalize your anger, gaining all the benefits of the ensuing adrenaline rush and berserk fury, but your cognitive and mental abilities do not deteriorate or lose clarity no matter how angry you become. So long as you speak to others with rage in your heart, they can sense the storm of white-hot anger within you, and it makes you more intimidating in social interactions and much more resilient against mental or telepathic attack."
400,White Tiger,Flow,"The White Tiger is one of two gods that hold power over time itself. The specialized wish of this god allows you to be sent back in time a day, weeks before you were born, decades into the past, or even much further into the past. You can opt to stay in the past permanently and continue on or spend up to a week in the past before returning to the present. The present will be changed according to whatever changes you made while in the past. After you travel three times you can time travel again although any subsequent times will require a sacrifice. The sacrifice is heavy as the White Tiger is a bit of a dick. This god wants your existence which translates to your death. If there ever could be a silver lining in this shitty situation it would be that your death is not immediate. You’ll be sent back with the time limit as usual, to do whatever and when your time is up you'll be erased from existence. This process takes a few moments so if you happen to be touching anyone during this act they’ll be erased from existence as well. If you have any resurrection items this will negate the death and you can return to the present or stay in the past but you probably only have so many of those. The White Tiger’s skill allows one to use its power to stop time. In the beginning, you’ll be able to stop time for one second. A second might seem short but in the midst of battle, it can mean the difference between life and death. With the continued usage of the skill, the duration of the time stop will be increased. Eventually, you’ll be able to spam time stop after time stop however sadly a road roller is not included in the deal. As a slight benefit, you can move normally in another person’s time stop or can even cast one alongside another to increase the duration."
500,True Name,Generic Naruto Fanfiction,"Whoa. Ookay, this is some deep stuff, man. Something happened. Maybe it was a great quest, some memories from another life, maybe you glimpsed something mankind was not supposed to see. However it happened, you have discovered your True Name. This is the truth of who you are, all of it, the summation of every “you” that ever was, could have been, will be, or might be. And knowing it grants you quite a bit of power over yourself. Firstly, this means that it’s no longer possible to drive you mad or corrupt you, even by things which would normally find doing so a trivial effort. You know yourself. No matter what actions you might perform, what you might witness or be exposed to, your True Name remains the core and truth of you and all else just slides off, leaving you unmarred. The same effect also shields your soul from any and all attacks whether it be mundane or magical, whether the perpetrator is some petty torturer or a celestial spirit. Your, soul, sense of self and willpower are absolute, boundless and inviolable, come what may. Neither can your True Name be used against you, or knowledge of it pass on to others save by your own will and desire. Beyond this, truly knowing yourself places your heart at ease and lets you draw out more of it from within you. Simply by meditating upon your True Name you find that your soul grows ever-so-stronger, growing richer for the experience, and immensely benefiting your comprehension of all things related to your mind, soul or spirit. Finally, your enlightenment will avoid the traps of stasis or hubris; from now on your soul will develop only for the better and never for the worse as you walk the road towards the better you, the you that you really wish to be. No more self-deception, no more blind alleys."
600,A True Hero,Highschool DxD,"Nothing is a greater show of heroism than blood, sweat, and hard work. It doesn’t matter if you hold a Longinus or belong to some ancient bloodline - what matters is that you fight for what you believe in and never give up. Your determination receives an astounding boost - despair and mind control find themselves trying to move a mountain against you, and your body refuses to stay down even if your bones have shattered like glass. Not only does this grit make you harder to put down, but you can apply your own hot-blooded willpower to your magical power, increasing its potency or destructive power with the roaring of your soul. An amateur making an elemental blast could overtake an entire squad of more experienced foes by surprise with such a thing, and with time and training, who knows what you’ll accomplish? One thing is certain - it’s not about what kind of weapon you wield, but the hand that wields it."
600,Ancient Wisdom,DC – Blackest Night,"The Guardians of the Universe are, to put it nicely, complete and utter failures at their own mission. One of the sole exceptions, Ganthet, took you under his wing and personally trained you in both leadership and wisdom. Your judgment is almost Solomonic, able to lead large organizations with great charisma and foresight, able to resolve disputes with little more than a well-timed speech and come up with excellent solutions for complex societal problems. Your presence and wisdom is strong enough that, if you were part of a universally despised group or species, you would be given sole exception as ‘the good one’ so long as you lived up to the part."
600,Apotheosis,Dragon Ball Z,"Whether through a ritual or by an appointment from the Guardians of this world, you have ascended to godhood, converting your ki into something more ‘divine’. This doesn’t put you on par with Gods of Destruction or other titanic foes you will meet...but the benefit to this ki is that it is much easier to control and shape, and cannot be sensed or detected by anything short of another ‘god’ (or what the world would consider beyond them). Your raw ki power is increased slightly, enough to start you off with a slight edge on early foes...though unless you improve yourself, you will quickly fall behind, as is the fate of many other Gods who stand idle or as simple mentors. You can, if you wish, use this new ki to halt your physical aging, resuming it at its normal pace at your will. An important thing to note: A Saiyan who obtains this power does not immediately become a Super Saiyan God, or obtain power equivalent to it."
600,Asura,The God of Highschool,"Another terrifically powerful Charyeok, taking the form of one of the six armed, three faced Asura. The user may fire incredibly powerful energy beams from their mouths or turn these same beams into all direction shockwaves to strike at everyone around them with nothing more than a word. They may also absorb and then reflect attacks that are fired at the user, so long as those attacks are energy based instead of physical. There is a limit on the power of this absorption as anything too much stronger then you and Asura’s life energy combined will blow right through this ability. The user even gains the power to alter their body in minor ways, such as extending their fingers at great speeds to pierce opponents or being able to turn their heads all the way around to look behind themselves. Finally, Asura also grants its new partner the ability to control the minds of others through the user’s voice. Those with great willpower can resist this but a great deal of humanity will have no option but to follow every command of the wielder."
600,Chaos Form,Duel Monsters - Shadow Realm,"The arts of Light and Darkness take great pains to teach you how to ensure that the two energies don’t mix in your form, to prevent the inevitable entropic maelstrom that would occur. However,those who reach the zenith of the Chaotic Arts will know the second reason they take so long to teach neophytes how to mix the energies in their body: The resultant boost in energy is magnificent and dangerous in the hands of the foolhardy. You now know the technique known as “Chaos Form”, which magnifies your power both physical and magical to a level above any other native of the Shadow Realm,even the vaunted Dark Magician and feared Blue Eyes White Dragon. However, it is not freely used. Every moment spent in this form is a moment it channels pure raw entropic power, eroding away your body and soul. If you were to fully lose yourself to being drunk on this power, without fail your very being would be eradicated as you were swallowed by Chaos. Until that point, however, finding a match for your power in this realm would be a very difficult task indeed."
600,Charismatic Philosophy,Justice League Unlimited,You're incredibly wise. Far beyond someone such as yourself. Perhaps it's from all those years of being in so many odd scenarios. Perhaps you're just highly analytical and personable. Either way you're far more practical and thoughtful than most would give you credit for. This also extends to being in social situations able to talk your way out of a good deal of problems. Don't worry though to help you'll be given a good deal of acting ability and a flexible yet appealing voice to complete the package. With enough time and experience perhaps you can talk a confused god into being your friend.
600,Divine Protection,Re: Monster,"You have been blessed by a god or goddess, granting you their protection and a boon unique to them, which can vary from person to person as well as god to god. For 600cp, this is the blessing of a Great God, of which there are only five and provide the greatest benefits to those they bless. The great gods are Origin and Demise, Space-Time and Star Sea, Birth and Wisdom, and Nature and Souls, with one still yet named in the series. Greater gods almost universally provide a form of magic as their boon."
600,Enlightenment,With This Ring,"​Through great personal sacrifice, you have reached true enlightenment. Pick an emotion, you are now perfectly aware of how you are defined by that emotion. For example, Avarice enlightenment would make you aware of exactly what you want, why, and to what degree. Not only does this prevent self-deception, it also allows you to easily identify any external influence on your thoughts, regardless of how subtle they may be. If you wield a Power Ring or similar weapon aligned with your enlightened emotion, you are now more attuned to its power source, allowing greater power and more efficient use of that power. Emotion based powers will never overwhelm you, and extreme emotions will never override your reason. You can also now perceive the emotions that define and guide another person’s actions both consciously and subconsciously.


--- Enhanced (Requires Jolly Cooperation): Lastly, if taken with Jolly Cooperation​ this will allow you to fuse with relevant entities and separate at will, giving you a trump card for when fights escalate to the level of Old Gods. In future jumps, if no equivalent distinct entity of an emotion (an analogue of the Butcher, Ophidian, Parallax, Ion, Adara, Proselyte, or Predator) exists for you to fuse with, you may fusswith all of an emotion that exists in the universe instead for a similar increase in power. ---"
600,Hero’s Will,Fate/Grand Order,"So long as your will stays strong, so too will your body. The determination to protect your friends will last you out even if your body should be too weak to protect them still. Now your willpower can be used to power or empower your body or abilities, replacing the normal energy used and possibly even empowering it above the normal level of use. However, the greater the cost it would have been on your energy stores and the more power you put in above the normal level, the more strain it will put on your mind and body. Take too much strain on and you may find your mind, body or even soul to start to rip, rupture and tear. Continue to push yourself so far beyond your limits and even having a truly unbreakable will won’t prevent you from dying, though having such a will would allow you to go far, far further with this ability than most."
600,King of the Earth,The God of Highschool,"A Charyeok thought exclusive to Nox, as it is a contract formed with the ruling Gods of this world, those who enforce the taboo on Humanity. King of the Earth allows for a multitude of powerful abilities. First is the summoning of angels and Nephilim in great numbers, who will come to loyally aid the user against any foes. The Charyeok’s second and most useful ability is the power to create matter from nothing but life energy. From a large number of swords, or simple a very large sword, to instantly restoring severed limbs or healing terrible wounds on the bodies of people around you, your potential is only really limited by your imagination, your understanding and your energy. King of the Earth is also able to teleport its user and those around them over long distances, as well as create powerful energy shields to defend its partner."
600,Longinus Hand,The God of Highschool,"Based on a part of Christian mythos, the Longinus Hand grants the user the ability to summon gigantic projects of hands and to manipulate gravity. The projections summoned by the user are giant, transparent hands of energy. Even at the start these are large enough to cover whole city blocks but they will only grow to even more immense sizes over time, and can be used to smash, grab or do anything else a hand could normally do. They do not require the user to see where they are being summoned either and the range of summoning is only dependent on the user’s power, starting at around a few hundred metres and increasing from there with no upper limit. The user can also control gravity, increasing or decreasing it as they will, even doing both on specific areas to change the topography of an area around. As usual, the power of this manipulation is dependent on the user’s life energy. Longinus Hand can also summon cross shaped energy shields in front of the user, so long as the user raises one hand in front of them. This Charyeok forms a cross shaped mark on each of the user’s palms by being contracted."
600,Master,Star Wars: Attack of the Clones,"You have gained more power and experience after your standard training, placing you on an equal level to Obi-wan and other experienced Jedi, and at the higher end capable of the same feats as Count Dooku."
600,Nature of the Soul,With This Ring,"You can now perceive the complex web of identity, emotions, and arcane connections that form a person’s soul. Additionally, you have greater understanding and control of your own soul, granting a slight boost of strength and control of your magic, and a much greater boost in control of any domains or divine magic/abilities you possess. With practice, you can learn to push your soul into mundane or magical artifacts either to siphon strength from them, imbue them with power, make them into a part of your expanded metaphysique for purposes of arcane sympathy or control, or directly struggle against their own power or owner’s power to steal control of the item (though losing such a conquest can have terrible consequences). Most importantly, you can induce a divine awakening in mortal souls (including your own, if you are not already a New God). While this does nothing on its own, an awakened mortal will, over time, grow into a New God, increasing the strength of their soul and connecting to a Domain relevant to their skills and personality. Awakening a skilled mage would lead to a New God of Magic. Awakening Green Arrow would lead to a New God of Archery. Awakening a veteran Green Lantern would result in a New God of Will. A New God of Archery could fire one arrow and hit seven targets around a corner. A New God of Will could match the Guardians of Oa. In addition to granting a domain and increased arcane power, an Awakening will heal most injuries or arcane maladies, and elevate the subject to the ideal status of their species. It will turn white Martians into red Martians and have similar effects on other species with inherent biological or arcane castes. The rate at which a new New God grows into his or her powers can be increased with exposure to raw arcane power. Additionally, while a Fatherbox or sufficiently skilled New God could perform or teach this skill in the Jump, it does so by forcing them to focus on one or a few specific aspects of their being, such as a skill, power, or personality trait, and hinders them in gaining completely new skills or powers unrelated to their domain. Purchasing this skill will allow those you empower to continue to gain new skills/powers/facets of personality without issue"
600,Nine Tails Guardian,The God of Highschool,"The great Nine Tailed Fox, who was originally a Demon who became the bodyguard of the Jade Emperor through sheer determination, but was cast out from fear of its power. It’s hatred of the Gods turned it into the First Key, a being that can unseal the Taboo. The fox itself grants its bearer immensely increased physical abilities, enough that even at the most basic level of contracting the user cannot be perceived by ordinary humans because of their sheer speed. Incredible powers of pyrokinesis are also at the hands of the contractor, along with the ability to summon fire foxes of all different sizes in great numbers. As a Key, the Nine Tails is able to unseal the Taboo on all of humanity at once, regardless of their distance or presence on different dimensions, and could reseal it if the user so chooses. Activating this Charyeok turns the wielder’s hair white, their eyes yellow with red outlines and grants them seven tails made of fire. Perhaps you could unlock the last two tails with a direct contract?"
600,Overflowing Aura,RWBY,"Your aura far exceeds the limits of what is typical. You have nearly five times as much as the average person and it grows at an equally rapid rate. In addition, your aura recovers ludicrously quickly. Assuming you’re not actively using it, your aura will fully replenish in a little over one minute. If you are using it actively, it still replenishes, but will do so a bit more slowly, taking around five minutes instead. This regeneration also affects any other energy pools that you may possess."
600,Sacred Gear - Down Fall Dragon Spear,Highschool DxD,"How did you get your hands on this? You’re most certainly going to confuse a certain Fallen Angel. This is a unique artificial Sacred Gear made through a pact with the dragon Fafnir, an incredibly powerful spear whose full powers have yet to be revealed. It does come with a pre-awakened Balance Breaker form, however, forming a draconic armor around the user that greatly protects them from both physical attacks and magical attacks. This duplicate of the spear also doesn’t need said pact to keep its powers, and Fafnir and Azazel are both unaware of you even having it...for now."
600,Sacred Gear - Goliath Quake,Highschool DxD,"They do not recognize you now that you’ve BECOME HUGE! The ability of this Sacred Gear is delightfully simple - it increases the size of things. What things? Anything. You can make yourself into a giant, you can make individual body parts a bit larger, or turn a tiny chip of metal into a chunk the size of a skyscraper. In short, you can make anything building-sized and then turn it back to normal on a whim with this ability. The tallest you can make something with this Sacred Gear is the size of a modern skyscraper, though with time, perhaps this limit can grow with you. It takes the form of a handheld gong and the necessary instrument to ring it."
600,Sacred Gear - Twice Critical,Highschool DxD,"A commonly occurring but extremely powerful Sacred Gear, this gauntlet manifests over the user’s hand with the fingers uncovered. Its power is short and simple: it doubles the power of the user, both physical and magical. This effect doesn’t stack with itself and it expires after some time, but you know what they say: double or nothing, right?"
600,The Great Epiphany,All-Star Superman,"​: Everything is connected. Everything. Whether from a rush of new power and senses, or just the realization of how infinite the Multiverse truly is...you comprehend the clockwork of the universe on a philosophical level. And it does not care. These tiny points of light, these blue planets called Earth all scattered across infinity...this is all they’ve got. Instead of despair, this has filled you with hope and knowledge of how to use all of your powers, skills, and even influence over others to create better worlds or just put them on the path to progress. In addition, nihilistic despair and mind-shattering revelations simply hold no power over you...because you see with the eyes of both a Human and a God, and it has filled you with love and understanding, or even just enlightenment, few can dream of. Your mind is unburdened, your path and place is clear. What will you do with it?"
600,Trinity,The God of Highschool,"Taking the form of three light orbs that encircle the user’s body and being based on certain Christian teachings, Trinity enables the user to manipulate the weather on an incredible scale. You gain control over both the air and electricity, becoming able to produce and direct both elements, as well as summon many great disasters from the natural world. Whilst they are costly effects, you may create hurricanes, earthquakes, eruptions and other natural disasters, even when they should be impossible to happen naturally."
600,Un-Equivalent Exchange,Full Metal Alchemist,"This world’s alchemy runs on the concept of equivalent exchange, except in one major case: The use of human transmutation. You see, that question above isn’t just some guideline used to scare away alchemists, or limit their abilities, it’s a legitimate rule of the universe. There is nothing that matches the metaphysical value of the human soul, so attempts to revive others, and transmutate human life will almost always cost something that the bearer truly cannot go without such as their eyesight, organs, limbs, or even their entire bodies. This limit, and the one that states that only something of similar material makeup may be transmuted is waved for you. Now, you can apply scientific reality to the mystical parts of Alchemy. As long as you have the mass necessary, you can transmute one thing to the other without issue. Sealing wounds and fixing bodies as long as you have the matter necessary to remake the parts? Sure. Bringing someone back to life using the materials necessary to form the human body, and their DNA as a blueprint? Truth won’t even flinch. In a way, you’re like a walking Philosopher’s Stone, though even you may not make something from nothing, only reconstitute what is already there. In addition, you still need to follow the rules of alchemy, so you must comprehend what you wish to reform or break down. You best get studying. In future worlds the same applies, allowing you to break the rules of your mystical systems and apply scientific logic to them regardless of their spiritual aspects restricting your ability to act. Your new magic system won’t let you turn things into gold despite you being perfectly capable of transmuting other things because of some mystical convenience? Not anymore."
600,Unlimited Name Works,That Time I Was Reincarnated as a Slime,"In this world names have power. It gives and takes massive amounts of power from individuals, connects people through their souls, grants blessings and can even give something life and sapience. Naming people could be as much a blessing as it could be a curse for the namer as it could permanently take away from their power and grant it to someone not even guaranteed to be loyal to them. Now you don’t need to have such worries as just for naming only, you have infinite mana. You could name as many as millions of people a day and not even be a little tired. Though this does nothing for your actual mana and can only work for naming. You are also able Name others in future jumps even without the System and on top of that, may even name Humans."
600,Will of Fire,Naruto,"Konoha is known for its Will of Fire, and now you embody that ideal with a Fire that burns especially bright. No amount of damage done to your body may squander your spirit. You could be too exhausted to move a limb, but you’d still try to charge your enemy by pushing yourself with your chin. Your will is so powerful you could still fight after being knocked out cold. Your cut off head would probably try and bite your opponents’ ankles for a while before you actually died. Yes, you could literally push yourself beyond death with this, if only for a little while, to give allies some extra time to heal you. Be careful about taking things that far though. Even for someone with an unbreakable will, being dead is still dead, and if you aren’t resuscitated soon after crossing that line, you won’t be coming back."
700,Battle Beast,Invincible,"You are now a monster of combat, inhabited by a slightly altered copy of The Spirit of The Beast. This power can be expressed in different ways. You can choose for the spirit to inhabit you giving you all of the powers with no physical changes, or you can allow the spirit to change your body into that of a huge humanoid tiger complete with retractable claws and sharp teeth. Either way choose now as the transformation is permanent or this jump, and act as an alt-form afterwards. Once this spirit of the beast inhabits you it augments your base abilities increasing them by the power of a Regent level Viltrumite, bringing a normal human to that level upon the spirit entering you. The strength, speed, and durability would allow you to fight on par with a Regent Viltrumite with the stamina to last through the pitched battle fo  weeks on end. You have regeneration, and senses on par with Viltrumites but are unable to fly like them. However, unlike Viltrumites, those inhabited by the Spirit of the Beast are unable to die of old age. Finally this spirit, unlike Battle Beast’s, does not change how much you already enjoy fighting, nor does it drive you to self-sabotage in the desire to have a fair and honourable fight."
800,Legend,Star Wars: Attack of the Clones,"You have notably greater might and knowledge of the Force and how to use it than most of its wielders in this time, placing you on the same level as the venerable Yoda."
800,Pandora,The God of Highschool,"The box from which a woman in the ancient past released all the evil in the world. Pandora was filled with such hate that that woman felt from being tricked by the Gods into opening that box and thus became the Second Key, the second weapon to strike down the Gods in the sky. The Charyeok is immensely powerful even without its Key nature. It grants the user enough physical enhancement that a Bishop class Nox agent was able to handily defeat one of the legendary 9 Demon Kings. Whilst your boost will not yet be on that level, you will certainly be able to match a Bishop from the first moment. Pandora can generate almost any kind of poison or disease, both in the air and directly within the bodies of those the user can see. It can even force others around the user to experience any sort of hallucination the user desires. Pandora grants the powers of telekinesis and telepathy, even across dimensions, as well as the power to create strong force fields for defence. The Charyeok is even able to summon an armour that increases the user’s physical abilities even more, with a second stage to go even further. The greatest abilities of Pandora however, are what it gains from its status as the Second Key. Unlike the First Key, Pandora cannot work on more than one target, only being able to unseal one being from the Taboo that the user can see at a time. However, it is also able to seal away powers, leaving the user with only their physical abilities, albeit they may be supernaturally great still, instead of any divine abilities or Charyeok. This sealing may also be used to reflect any attack away from the user and back at the attackers, though both this and the power sealing effect may fail if the foe is too far above the user’s power level. The Final ability of this Charyeok is The Hope- Sovereignty. Within a small area and for a very limited time, the user gains a great deal of control over the laws of physics and causality. With this, one could prevent attacks from being fired or nullify the abilities of others to manipulate physics in a similar way. This ability seems unable to be used to attack others, only change or nullify things. When active, it creates 3 angelic wings on the user’s right side and one on their left."
1000,Sacred Gear - The Longinus,Highschool DxD,"And then we have these Jokers. These Sacred Gears were freak accidents in the system established by the God of the Bible, 13 unique items that vastly surpass the others in terms of growth and raw power. In addition to Balance Breakers, the Longinus also possess Juggernaut Drives which unlock even greater powers in the right hands. These are extremely desirable by all factions, and possessing even a duplicate will make you a subject of interest to almost every supernatural being in this world. Purchasing this allows you to have one of the Sacred Gears listed below. Whether you possess a benefactor-sponsored duplicate or the original is up to you, but mind that this may have unforeseen consequences if you take someone’s place."
