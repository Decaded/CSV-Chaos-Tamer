Cost,Perk Name,Source,Description
0,Airburst,My Hero Academia,"The user is able to compress small quantities of air into marbles and project them. The marbles rupture on contact with something, popping with the force of a large balloon. The marbles even sound like popping balloons, leaving them a startling, attention grabbing distraction but ultimately harmless. The user must hold their breath while collecting and throwing these marbles of air, requiring strong lungs."
0,Confetti,My Hero Academia,"This Quirk bestows the ability to manipulate pieces of paper after the Quirk user has come into contact with them. Their control is such that they can manipulate many pieces over a wide area, making folds and cuts as desired to shape and split it up. Confetti is unable to manipulate any one piece weighing more than a standard piece of notebook paper however, such as a magazine or a poster. The Quirk user loses the ability to manipulate paper that’s been wet too much, the paper’s integrity failing and weight becoming too great."
0,Curveball,My Hero Academia,"This Quirk allows the user to apply a delayed rotation to small objects, designating the direction at that time. This rotation activates the moment the object begins to move at any significant speeds, and will scale in speed with the speed of the object. The Quirk may be activated and applied through one degree of separation, such as through striking something with a club or bat. The effects of this Quirk end once the object affected comes to a stop,"
0,Leaf Manipulation,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk has to power to project leaves from their surroundings as small, sharp blades at a target. Able to shoot many at once with relative ease. They have no real control over the leaves beyond shooting them, and their lack of real mass doesn’t make them very dangerous for the most part. No ability to generate leaves or very difficult to project heavily damaged leaves."
0,Little Pompeii,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user has the ability to produce and control ashes from their finger tips. Little Pompeii seems to provide an immunity, or strong resistance, to degenerative side effects of smoking. Fingertips glow orange while active. Ashes are hot to the touch, but lack so much mass and are hard enough to produce that not much can be done with them other than ignite already highly flammable materials."
0,Shadow Puppets,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user gains the ability to manipulate their own shadow. Stretching it, twisting it, shaping it, growing it, shrinking it and even adjusting the shade. This Quirk does not give any unique properties to the shadow by itself. The Quirk user has difficulty with growing their shadow more than twice its current size."
0,Weak Attraction,My Hero Academia,"With this perk you may pull small, lightweight objects closer to you. This is a Quirk of convenience, grabbing things from the other side of the room like keys or drinks. It is heavily limited by the weight of the individual objects it can grab, mostly focused on small, lightweight things under a few pounds."
0,Dou Qi Method,Battle Through the Heavens,"While Dou Qi Skills may have been the bread and butter or cultivation, Dou Qi methods are the foundation upon which everything rests. These are the things that allow cultivators to cultivate, to gather Dou Qi and grow stronger. As such, the strength of one's Dou Qi Method is extremely important. The better it is, the faster and higher one will rise. You may get a Huang, Xuan, Di, or Tian tier Qi technique. Each rank increases the speed of cultivation and rate of recovery of Dou Qi. Normal Huang Methods are open to the public. Xuan methods are things that smaller clans might have. Tian Methods are sufficient to drive Dou Zun crazy."
0,Dou Qi Skill,Battle Through the Heavens,"The bread and butter of the cultivation world. These are the techniques used by cultivators in order to fight against the many beings within this world. Many cultivators will have numerous different Dou Qi Skills with a range of strengths and weaknesses. These are to cultivators what spells are to mages. You receive a scroll upon which is written a Huang, Xuan, Di, or Tian tier Qi technique. Each rank greatly increases their strength and efficiency. Be warned that the higher level techniques will require much more Dou Qi to use."
100,Absorb & Release,My Hero Academia,"This Quirk allows the user to absorb enemy attacks, kinetic and energy based, hold them within their body and release them whenever and however they wish. It is heavily limited, however, by the fact that it doesn’t protect the user of the Quirk in the process of absorbing the attack, causing them to be burnt by fire, shocked by electricity and so on."
100,Bending Arts: Air,Avatar: The Last Airbender,"You were born with the ability to manipulate the element of your nation, and have been trained in its use. The Bending Arts differ from element to element, but always involve a combination of physical movements designed to evoke that element, focused with the will of the Bender. Bending an element provides substantial control over it, allowing you to move it, shape it, and direct it, though the exact nature of each depends on the individual element. It should be noted, however, that you cannot actually create an element - though Firebenders can transform their body heat into a raging inferno and Airbenders can make the breath from their lungs into a gale, Waterbenders and Earthbenders must have a source of their element to Bend."
100,Bending Arts: Earth,Avatar: The Last Airbender,"You were born with the ability to manipulate the element of your nation, and have been trained in its use. The Bending Arts differ from element to element, but always involve a combination of physical movements designed to evoke that element, focused with the will of the Bender. Bending an element provides substantial control over it, allowing you to move it, shape it, and direct it, though the exact nature of each depends on the individual element. It should be noted, however, that you cannot actually create an element - though Firebenders can transform their body heat into a raging inferno and Airbenders can make the breath from their lungs into a gale, Waterbenders and Earthbenders must have a source of their element to Bend."
100,Bending Arts: Fire,Avatar: The Last Airbender,"You were born with the ability to manipulate the element of your nation, and have been trained in its use. The Bending Arts differ from element to element, but always involve a combination of physical movements designed to evoke that element, focused with the will of the Bender. Bending an element provides substantial control over it, allowing you to move it, shape it, and direct it, though the exact nature of each depends on the individual element. It should be noted, however, that you cannot actually create an element - though Firebenders can transform their body heat into a raging inferno and Airbenders can make the breath from their lungs into a gale, Waterbenders and Earthbenders must have a source of their element to Bend."
100,Bending Arts: Water,Avatar: The Last Airbender,"You were born with the ability to manipulate the element of your nation, and have been trained in its use. The Bending Arts differ from element to element, but always involve a combination of physical movements designed to evoke that element, focused with the will of the Bender. Bending an element provides substantial control over it, allowing you to move it, shape it, and direct it, though the exact nature of each depends on the individual element. It should be noted, however, that you cannot actually create an element - though Firebenders can transform their body heat into a raging inferno and Airbenders can make the breath from their lungs into a gale, Waterbenders and Earthbenders must have a source of their element to Bend."
100,Blood Manipulation,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to manipulate their own blood. They can harden it, eject it from their body, pull it back in, manipulate it inside their body to move their own body and so on. The limitations of Blood Manipulation are obvious, as it’s important to keep most of it inside of you to avoid dying and such, and pulling it back in after ejecting it may prove dangerous if it brings back any contaminants."
100,Homing,My Hero Academia,"This Quirk allows the user to alter the trajectory of bullets or other projectiles they personally fire or release, allowing them to almost always hit their mark. The user is able to cause projectiles to accelerate somewhat and make several sharp turns in the air before impact, but is ultimately limited by how well they can perceive their own projectiles, the initial speed of the projectile after being fired and actually having ammo."
100,Inner Strength,Battle Through the Heavens,"Bones break and flesh tears. Those can be healed with relative ease by cultivators or using pills. The inner qi pathways are a slightly harder matter to resolve. Your particular Qi pathways have been tempered and are more resilient. They are capable of withstanding far more abuse. This has several advantages. First and foremost, it would let you take more damage with minimal lasting effects. However it also has the benefit of meaning that your pathways are sturdy enough to withstand strong pills that would ordinarily be too much for your body to handle."
100,Kido Training,Bleach,"The arts of the Shinigami are many, fitting given their long existence. Few Shinigami pursue training in all the disciplines available and Kido is by far the most neglected. Many Shinigami possess only rudimentary skill in the Demon Magic Art, the spellcasting system of Soul Society. Some have no knowledge at all. But you’ve eagerly pursued such things, reaching the level of a capable caster in both Hado and Bakudo spells. Hado spells largely deal with offense and destruction, while Bakudo is for both defense and a variety of support uses. At least ninety nine spells exist for each form, numbered in order of power. You know over a dozen spells for each discipline with your maximum abilities being a pair of spells in the 30 range. 31 Shakkaho, a powerful blast of fire in the Hado arts or 30 Shitotsu Sansen, a Bakudo spell that creates restrictive triangles of light around an opponent. In Shinigami terms, you’re the equivalent of a graduate of the academy who received top marks in Kido, which may explain the natural talent you have for learning more Kido down the line."
100,Larceny,My Hero Academia,"This Quirk allows the user to steal any objects they can see on a target’s body, including manifestations of their Quirk that aren’t permanent fixtures like a temporary tentacle. ‘Stolen’ objects transport straight to the Quirk user’s hands, making it difficult, if not impossible to stop them from taking whatever they have their eyes on. Larceny cannot be used to steal anything too large, leaving them unable to take large pieces of equipment and such. As the Quirk user needs to confirm a target with their eyes, being blinded or blindfolded will lock off the use of Larceny."
100,Lock Down,My Hero Academia,"This Quirk allows the user to lock objects in space, essentially immobilizing it. This is done by pushing the user’s finger, which gains key teeth protrusions, into the desired object and turning that finger like a key. This allows the user to prevent pieces of furniture from moving, stopping objects in the middle of the air as a form of obstacle, stopping projectiles from continuing towards them among other applications. There are limits on size and force, making the task of stopping out of control trucks or giant pieces of falling rubble daunting threats, especially if they lay on the edge of what’s possible. This Quirk may not effect living things."
100,Signal Pirate,My Hero Academia,"This Quirk allows the user to hijack electronic signals and manipulate the audio and video of nearby electronics. This would allow them to broadcast their face and voice over TVs, make themselves invisible to security cameras or blow out speakers with top volume cacophonies. This quirk has an effective range of just over 50 meters and obviously has few uses when out of range of any suitable electronics to apply their Quirk on."
100,Water Balloon,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to alter the surface tension of liquids within their surroundings and keep them that way. They’re able to leave the surface of a liquid hard, rubbery, soft, velvety, even abrasive, or just return them to normal. Inventive applications include literally walking on water, trapping someone in a liquid jail by making it impossible to breach, even handle useful liquids like adhesives or poisons by turning them into water balloon style projectiles and altering their properties at the last second. Being so reliant on outside resources can prove troublesome. The Quirk user’s influence extends to the surface, not below, reducing their total options somewhat."
100,Size,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user is able to increase the size of objects they’ve interacted with up to two dozen times over. The activation condition for this effect is the user touching their five fingertips on each hand together, similar in nature to a prayer. They may increase the size of objects from quite far away, even outside their line of sight, providing they focus on their target(s). They may manually deactivate the changes with the same gesture as before. The Quirk user is unable to affect living things such as plants or people."
100,Alchemy/Alkahestry,Full Metal Alchemist,"The art of Alchemy involves many different components, and is part science and part mystical. It involves the law of equivalent exchange, and with that limit in mind, one can comprehend, deconstruct, and reconstruct physical matter into different forms. Amestrian Alchemy involves using the power generated by the Earth’s tectonic shifts to power this transformation, and an alchemical circle to make the change. Alkahestry on the other hand is a more medical, and spiritual form of Alchemy that involves the “Dragon’s Pulse” which is a concept that details the constant pulse of Chi or life energy within the Earth. Unlike Alchemy, it is far better for healing wounds, and can project transmutation across distances. With this perk, you gain a decent understanding of either Alchemy or Alkahestry, enough to be a State Alchemist for the former, with a minor focus on one form of Alchemy, and similar skill for the latter with a minor focus towards either healing or combat. "
100,Alchemy/Alkahestry (Other),Full Metal Alchemist,"Requires Alchemy/Alkahestry.

If you pay an extra 100CP discounted to Alchemists, you have instead a similar understanding of both principles due to your Origin studying both, or if you’re a Drop In, due to Jump Shenanigans. Before you think yourself a God capable of deciding life and death with this"
100,Dou Qi Method (Rank Increase),Battle Through the Heavens,"Requires Dou Qi Method.

While Dou Qi Skills may have been the bread and butter or cultivation, Dou Qi methods are the foundation upon which everything rests. These are the things that allow cultivators to cultivate, to gather Dou Qi and grow stronger. As such, the strength of one's Dou Qi Method is extremely important. The better it is, the faster and higher one will rise. You may get a Huang, Xuan, Di, or Tian tier Qi technique. Each rank increases the speed of cultivation and rate of recovery of Dou Qi. Normal Huang Methods are open to the public. Xuan methods are things that smaller clans might have. Tian Methods are sufficient to drive Dou Zun crazy."
100,Dou Qi Skill (Rank Increase),Battle Through the Heavens,"Requires Dou Qi Skill.

The bread and butter of the cultivation world. These are the techniques used by cultivators in order to fight against the many beings within this world. Many cultivators will have numerous different Dou Qi Skills with a range of strengths and weaknesses. These are to cultivators what spells are to mages. You receive a scroll upon which is written a Huang, Xuan, Di, or Tian tier Qi technique. Each rank greatly increases their strength and efficiency. Be warned that the higher level techniques will require much more Dou Qi to use."
200,Self-Molecular Rearranging,DC – Kingdom Come,"You have super strength, and the ability to rearrange your own molecular structure. Making yourself lighter or heavier or changing your height is possible with your abilities, and your strength grows and shrinks with your height. Right now this is the only way to increase your strength, but maybe if you’re smart you could think of other ways to increase your strength without needing to become bigger. You have no theoretical limit to what you can grow or shrink, but 60 feet is the maximum height you can maintain for a significant amount of time as of your current mastery of this ability. Further training is needed to expand it. You can also manipulate your molecular structure to let you phase through walls as well, in case you need to sneak somewhere instead of punching holes in walls. You could also extend this ability to shift between the different states of matter, but to enter the state of plasma will require an external energy source other than what this power provides. Furthermore, changing your state of matter is past your current mastery of this ability, and becoming plasma is a state of matter that has to be achieved separately past the other states of matter."
200,Shadow Manipulation,DC – Kingdom Come,"You can manipulate shadows, merging with your own to slide across the ground or fly in the air and possessing the shadows of others. You can also grow to a huge size as a shadow and create physical items and shapes in a way similar to that of the Green Lantern ring. Your body also resists antimatter to a degree as well, thanks to your exposure to the Shadowlands. You also have telepathic abilities to a minor degree, able to speak in the minds of others and have them reply back. No mind control, for one exception. You can make someone see the depths of their evil side. All their horrifying thoughts, desires, and dreams. This could drive them to the brink out of remorse and regret for their actions, or horrifically traumatize them. Or both."
200,Aerokinesis,Young Justice,"Aerokinesis allows the user to create and manipulate the air, allowing them to push and pull objects and enemies with air currents and create certain weather phenomena, such as twisters or tornadoes. Skilled users can use this ability to fly."
200,Cement,My Hero Academia,"This Quirk gives power over cement and cement-like materials simply by being in contact with them, able to exert a great deal of control over a large quantity of material at once. The user of this Quirk is able to even expand, grow or repair the materials they’re using as well. While powerful and convenient in urban settings, this Quirk falls off hard in places lacking in concrete."
200,Combat Bender,Avatar: The Last Airbender,"Since time immemorial, Bending has served as mankind's sword and shield - and now it's yours. You are unusually skilled in using your Bending in combat - shaping your element into lethal or non-lethal strikes, deflecting or countering others, even controlling a battlefield's terrain all come naturally to you. You are even able to adapt your forms into martial techniques, allowing you to use them in close combat even without your element. This runs both ways - should you know any other forms of martial arts, you can adapt your bending forms to them, letting you strike with your element."
200,Cooperative Bender,Avatar: The Last Airbender,"Though your own Bending may or may not be anything special, what you excel in is harmonizing it with the bending of others. By directing other Benders while bending along with them, your team can perform feats rivaled only by a fully- empowered Avatar. This isn't limited to your own element, either; if you have Benders from other Nations working with you, you can work with them just as easily, letting you combine elements to fantastic effect. This has also given you practice with wide-scale bending, and even without a team, the amount of your element you can bend has greatly increased."
200,Creation Methods,Battle Through the Heavens,"Every pill has a story behind it. Every skill has an expert who made it. Even the mysterious Flame Mantra, whose origin is a mystery to the previous Dou Di, ultimately came from someone’s brilliant mind. You have similarly stepped onto this path of creation. Over the years, your sharp mind has shown a natural aptitude for the creation of Dou Qi skills and methods. It wouldn’t be too surprising if when advancing between realms you comprehended a new skill. If you happen to be an alchemist, this skill will naturally extend to the creation of pill formulas. No need to wallow in mediocrity when you can forge your own future."
200,Crippled Past,Battle Through the Heavens,"Haven’t you been at the same initial cultivation stage for a while? Your cultivation has been stagnated for years now, and has only recently started moving again. While that means you will have a later start than some, it has also gifted you an incredibly stable foundation of Dou Qi, the basis upon which your future cultivation will be built. Consequently you will find progressing in cultivation far easier than you would otherwise."
200,Dead Zone,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user is able to reduce the electrical conductivity of everything in the area around them down to zero. This effectively applies nigh immunity to lightning and other forms of electrical damage to the user and others in the area while in effect. Electronics and other electricity reliant objects in the area will also shut down while the Quirk is active, of course. The user can extend or contract the dead zone to the maximum range of around half a kilometer or down to just the user’s body. Dead Zone doesn’t penetrate living beings, unable to shut down nerve signals in humans and other animals. The user is unable to affect the shape of the dead zone, just the size, rendering them near incapable of shutting down specific electronics if that’s their desire."
200,Fiber Master,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to freely control and manipulate textiles. This gives them an advantage against anyone that wears clothes, which is to say most everyone. The user is able to textiles as completely intact clothing, or unravel clothes or cloth into fibers and strings for alternative uses such as setting traps or binding enemies. Notably, this power can also be used to aid allies by moving them out of the way of an enemy attack. This power is notably tricy to use and difficulty varies by the type of textile, working best on denim, while sweats remain tricky."
200,Flight,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user is able to manipulate a special aerodynamic barrier that passively covers their body. The barrier is very strong and temperature controlled, allowing the Quirk user to use it for high speed flight without concern of upper atmosphere cold. The Quirk user can feign physical enhancement by leveraging their barrier to lift or strike things in their surroundings. The Quirk user may share their barrier with whatever they’re in contact with, though this thins the barrier out and leaves it more vulnerable to overpowering forces or temperatures."
200,Handyman,My Hero Academia,"This Quirk allows the user to mentally grab and manipulate the pieces of a broken object before putting it back together, the object regenerating additional damage upon doing so. Handyman gives a period of around one minute where the Quirk user has full control over the broken pieces before they’ll fly together and attempt to reform the original object. Objects must be broken before they may be “repaired.” This quirk is unable to affect the pieces of an object that has been almost completely destroyed/pulverized/molten down/etc."
200,Kido Specialist,Bleach,"Kido is far from a single unified discipline. The most obvious divisions are that of Hado and Bakudo but several groups exist outside of this numbered system as well. Kaido, also referred to as the healing arts, or the wide variety of seals and large scale barrier techniques apparently outside of normal Bakudo. You’ve found quite the gift for one such field of Kido, one of the above classifications or even just a type of spell like those that manipulate lightning or which suppress spiritual energy. You’ll easily make great strides of progress in learning your specialty and find it possible to take those arts well beyond the normal limitations. Much of this has to do with how easy you find it to modify existing spells that fit your chosen field. Hado 4- Byakurai is normally a single beam of powerful lightning but in your hands, it could quickly be used as a homing laser that chased foes till caught or a rapid fire blast of smaller lightning bolts or even act as a lightning rod towards your fingers to protect others."
200,Maneuverable Bender,Avatar: The Last Airbender,"You have a natural aptitude for using Bending to enhance your movements. Though each element has its specialties, all of them provide a variety of ways to increase your speed, agility, and acrobatic prowess, as well as give you unique methods of movement. Whether you're leaping gorges with gusts of flame or wind, gliding across a lake on a slab of ice, or crawling across a ceiling with rock shoes and gloves, where you go few others could hope to follow. You are also able to better use your Bending art on the go, adapting your forms to take advantage of your natural stride."
200,Path to Power,Dragon Ball,"One of the simplest and earliest uses of spiritual power is to make the body healthier and stronger. While not quite full mastery or utilizing of ki, you’ve gotten the basics down - you can power yourself up, increasing your muscle mass and physical strength, speed, and durability just a bit higher than your normal maximum. This is tiring to sustain, however, and can leave you extremely winded if you’re not careful...so be sure to keep up your training!"
200,Perfect Control,Naruto,"To be a medic requires absolute control over one's chakra, both to regulate the chakra and to conserve it. You in particular are a master of the art, able to precisely utilize the exact amount of energy needed for a task without any additional energy being wasted whatsoever. As a by-product of such control, you can control the flow and molding of the energy needed for jutsu or other techniques with only a fraction of the seals required and with no loss in power or range."
200,Pharmacist,Generic Xianxia,"The plants and animals of the land can be turned into medicines and food that when eaten allows one to gain strength. With this perk, you can mix the parts of flora and fauna to create such. While they may have side effects, they are never permanently harmful, and they will always make the consumer stronger, though to what extent and for how long depends on the ingredients, process, and your skill. Furthermore your pills, elixirs, potions, and other similar such things made for the purpose of beneficial effects will be strengthened by almost half-again what they would normally be capable of, and if temporary in nature they will even last half-again as long.

Alchemist’s Refining Equipment ​(Free): A necessity for anyone looking to get in on the ground floor of esoteric and/or mystical reagents. This series of tools is perfect for the refinement and distillation of potions, pills, poisons and mystical elixirs of all kinds. Whatever your chemical or alchemical needs, this equipment will always be perfectly matched to your skill level. Anything that you could theoretically brew given enough time and the proper equipment, can be brewed with this equipment. It cannot do the impossible however and if you are not skilled enough in the esoteric sciences of pharmacology then naturally, so will this equipment."
200,Photokinesis,Arrowverse,"You have the power to shoot out high energized blasts of bright hot luminous light. These blasts of light are able to blind someone temporarily, and possibly permanently, as well as cut through metal. Your control over the ability is to the point you can bend light around your skin making you invisible while allowing you to still see. However, you can't turn any of your clothes invisible initially."
200,Radiokinesis,Arrowverse,"You’re able to absorb radioactivity and harness it, even if the source of the radiation is vast distances away. After absorbing the radiation, you double your size increasing your strength and durability. Absorbing too much radiation will leave you weakened."
200,Receptarier,Battle Through the Heavens,"It is not an exaggeration to say that being an alchemist is the most profitable profession in this world. Even the most basic alchemist would garner much respect from small clans, as their pills could have a myriad of beneficial effects. Numerous services are often free to alchemists. But it is not a simple profession, nor is it easy. Aside from the basic requirement of fire attribute with a sliver of wood for refining, you also need a strong spiritual perception. This is because you will need to tightly control the temperature around potentially thousands of different ingredients which all need different treatment. Those without a strong soul power are unable to divide this kind of attention and thus cannot progress beyond the most basic of pills. By taking this perk you will have more than met these requirements. Becoming a Tier 7 alchemist is simply a matter of time and finding the right teacher. Further than that? Well, that depends on whether you can reach the next stages of Spiritual Strength."
200,Repulsion,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to manipulate a repulsive, invisible force that bounces anything that comes in contact with it away, like magnets with the same polarization. The user is capable of either wrapping it entirely around them or shape it into various invisible shapes like bars, barriers and varying geometric shapes to protect themselves or others. The major limitation is that while the force cannot be broken, it can be overpowered and pushed through if enough force or weight is behind something it tries to repel, and the user will be subjected to intense vertigo should this happen."
200,Spatial Strength,Battle Through the Heavens,"Long ago you were supremely unlucky enough to be caught in the turbulent wake of a Spatial Storm, a terrifying silver vortex that could kill Dou Zhongs. By pure chance you were at the very edge and were only severely hurt. But from this exchange the remnant spatial strength actually somewhat merged with you Dou Qi. This affords you slightly increased sensitivity to space, and as you grow stronger you may be able to begin manipulating it earlier than usual. This is nothing on the level of the Ancient Void Dragon race, but it might perhaps be what set them on that path."
200,Specialist - Fuinjutsu,Naruto,"Every ninja no matter what, specialises in at least one area. Some specialise in ninjutsu, some specialise in genjutsu, and some in fuinjutsu. Specialists possess far greater power and skill than those not specialised in their chosen area. For each purchase of this perk, you can become exceptionally good at learning your chosen specialization. For example,  one who picks fuinjutsu would have the potential to equal the greatest of the Uzumaki Clan with the proper training, while those who pick genjutsu could eventually rival Itachi Uchiha himself even with his Sharingan. This purchase bestows all the relevant knowledge and information needed and allows for a beginner to learn everything related to your chosen specialty in a fraction of the time it would normally take. The narrower the  focus of your specialization, the faster you learn. This perk can be purchased multiple times, and you can mix specialities for free, such as making a Nin-Taijutsu specialization, but you have to purchase the specialities you want to mix and fuse in order to do so. Barring medical ninjutsu, you can purchase any specialty."
200,Specialist - Genjutsu,Naruto,"Every ninja no matter what, specialises in at least one area. Some specialise in ninjutsu, some specialise in genjutsu, and some in fuinjutsu. Specialists possess far greater power and skill than those not specialised in their chosen area. For each purchase of this perk, you can become exceptionally good at learning your chosen specialization.

Barring medical ninjutsu, you can purchase any specialty."
200,Specialist - Ninjutsu,Naruto,"Every ninja no matter what, specialises in at least one area. Some specialise in ninjutsu, some specialise in genjutsu, and some in fuinjutsu.

200,Summoning Pact,Naruto,"This scroll, upon signing it with your blood, will allow you to summon one type of animal. This can be whatever animal you want. They are all trained in basic ninja arts and some individuals among them are of irregular size. The scroll doesn’t need to be on your person for the jutsu to work and if you allow, others can sign it too to be able to summon your type of animal. Can be bought multiple times for multiple types of animals, discounted after the first purchase."
200,Utilitarian Bender,Avatar: The Last Airbender,"Bending can certainly be used as a weapon, but it can also be so much more, and you have a natural talent for using it for these more constructive pursuits. Constructing entire buildings piece by piece with Earthbending, healing using Waterbending, blacksmithing with Firebending, or even just grabbing a stubborn out-of-reach tool with Airbending - you're a master at using your abilities for day-to-day life. This also increases your ability to perform precision bending, ranging from freezing a single raindrop to creating a sculpture so life-like it captures each individual hair."
200,Ki Accumulation,Generic Wuxia,"You are skilled at meditating and gathering your ki. You can use ki (or chi, or qi, of spirit energy) to strengthen your body and mind, and to use many higher-level martial arts to their highest potential. All Youxia can use Ki, but only you have the purity of focus to gather your energies and restore them even during the fury of battle."
200,Training Journal,Naruto,"This little book has been in the possession of many shinobi throughout the ages, all of whom decided to write here about their jutsu training in detail. For 50 CP, the journal possesses a handful of techniques from previous owners. For 200 CP, every once in a while, you will find a new section in the journal potentially allowing you to, in time, learn all jutsu in the Naruto series, though this could probably take a few hundred years considering the rate at which new information will reveal itself and that you have to learn all of them yourself."
300,[Five Focus],Medaka Box Abnormal,"You’re able to turn your fingers into long red talons now, very pointy ones. You can manipulate the ailments and sicknesses of anyone you scratch with these claws, making them healthy as a horse or filling them with every disease known to man in an instant. You can even control the stage and speed of the diseases and sicknesses that you inflict onto people, as well as traits such as the infection rate or capability, toughness of the disease itself and more."
300,Chlorokinesis,Young Justice,Chlorokinesis allows the user to control and greatly accelerate the growth of plants on the molecular level with their mind. This can be used to create hybridized plants as well as plantlike minions and creatures.
300,Earthflow,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to exert a great control over large amounts of earth at once for a variety of effects such as causing landslides, digging and so on. In addition to more straightforward uses, the user is also able to make sentient creatures with animal level intelligence out of dirt and stone known as Earth Devils that can prove quite formidable. The only limitations are fatigue and needing a source of earth nearby, which it often is unless you’re adrift on a boat at sea."
300,Electrokinesis,Young Justice,"Electrokinesis allows the user to manipulate existing sources of electricity, such as power plants or storm clouds, as well as create a small amount of electricity themselves. This can be used to fry most electronics, as well as your enemies."
300,Impact Recoil,My Hero Academia,"This Quirk allows the user to reverse the impact caused by an opposing physical force, sending the force back into whatever, whoever or wherever it came from. This Quirk can be applied not only to one’s self, but to nearby allies as well, allowing the user to potentially protect them or use them as meat shields. There is a small windup before its activation necessitating a bit of prediction. It can, of course, only work against physical impacts and doesn’t help with things like fire or electricity"
300,Maximum Security,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user has a great deal of control over iron and iron alloys as well as the ability to command it over a wide area, over one hundred meters. Although they have full power to manipulate and shape such material, they have a natural inclination/talent towards forming it into bars and chains, being able to perform more complex actions when manipulating iron using these shapes. They don’t actually have the power to sense iron and must be able to find it themselves to assert control. Manipulating truly massive amounts of iron can quickly become tiring. It’s easier to hover iron over a surface, horizontal or otherwise, than suspending it in the middle of the air."
300,Meteorologist,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user is able to manipulate water vapor to spontaneously form clouds even if there weren’t any before. From there, the Quirk user is able to simulate various forms of weather, such as heavy winds, rain, hail, snow, thunder and lightning. The Quirk user’s powers and influence lowers the wider the range they’re attempting to cover. A few city blocks could be hit with spontaneous, albeit mundane seeming rain. At the personal level however, the Quirk user may leverage a small cloud to send heavy rain sideways like a firehose’s flow, launch baseball sized hail, throw people off their feet with tornado force winds, blanket foes in snow and send out minor but potent electrical blasts. Quirk user is limited by humidity, as particularly arid conditions make it much more difficult to create requisite clouds. Quirk user requires some level of protection against the elements, as they have no innate resistance to temperature extremes or weather forces."
300,Noise,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk can cause whatever they touch to generate one of two different unique types electromagnetic fields “disruptive” and “attractive.” A disruptive field scrambles electronic signals internally while scrambling photons externally across the surface of whatever touching, making it appear to be covered in television static. An attractive field siphons electrons from existing electronic fields to charge the object in question, causing it to seemingly produce electricity from nothing and glow. This Quirk is excellent for giving the user a steady supply of electricity, setting electrical traps, shutting down electronics and even immobilizing people by scrambling nerve signals. While this Quirk is active, the user is susceptible to being jolted through contact with metal. Disruptive fields hold no real effect on objects with no relation to electricity. Attractive fields weaken considerably when away from any notable electronic fields."
300,Overhaul,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to disassemble and reassemble anything they can touch with their hands, either restoring it to its previous state or an entirely different one at the user’s discretion. With this Quirk comes an endless variety of applications. Instantly obliterate people or obstacles, fix a broken object, cure chronic ailments, heal severe damage, warp terrain to the user’s advantage, fusing materials or objects together, even reviving the freshly deceased good as new. Overhaul may even be used to fuse people into new, composite entities or fuse people with objects to give them a hellish existence. Notable, is that any living being, including the Quirk user, will experience excruciating, terrible pain whenever affected by Overhaul either partially or completely. Overhaul’s extreme control over the reassembly process is only able to work with what it has on hand. As hand contact is required to apply the effects of Overhaul, enemies that are able to attack while avoiding the Quirk user’s hands can avoid being obliterated"
300,Parahuman - Air Control,Worm,"Don’t laugh at it, the power to sense and manipulate air within a large radius is incredibly potent. The range of your power is roughly several city blocks, and its strength is enough to shred stone within an instant and metal shortly after. Of special note is your ability to compress air to the point that it’ll act like a liquid or solid, granting it incredible strength from the raw pressure. Releasing this compressed gas makes for incredibly dangerous aerokinetic explosions. Your power’s strength and control is much greater in areas with large open spaces and strong winds. If an airborne opponent was stupid enough to fight you high up in the atmosphere in the global slipstreams you’d be a living force of nature."
300,Parahuman - Gravity Manipulation,Worm,"You can manipulate gravity, increasing it immensely or completely nullifying it. Your ability to change its direction also means you can do things like fly, make it so that along a particular street people can walk on the building’s sides like it was a sidewalk, and much more. The effects of this power on an area can either be temporary, or last until you reverse them or they are disrupted by another effect. The upper limit of how strong you can make gravity increases with time. You start with five times earth gravity being your upper limit. This power’s range is a radius equal to about two city blocks around you, which will increase slowly over time."
300,Parahuman - Sensorium,Worm,"You can paint very large areas in an invisible field that allows you to hijack and manipulate the senses of those within. You can make them perceive and experience anything you can imagine, covering all possible senses. Blatant use allows you to effectively create holodecks wherever you will it, while subtle use allows you to misdirect and deceive with unparalleled finesse. Exotic senses will require attention on your part to account for, although your power has no trouble spoofing these just as easily as normal ones. As a secondary ability your imagination and creativity is enhanced, along with effectively perfect internal visualization."
300,Perfect Control,Generic Naruto Fanfiction,"Okay, whoa. This is quite nifty! Your chakra control is now utterly, absolutely perfect, which means that no matter how much of it you use and how many different manipulations you do at a time, you never waste so much as an iota of it, retaining absolute pinpoint control at all times. And chakra isn’t the only thing you can control so finely, either. Welcome to the world of perfect muscle control and coordination. You have utterly inhuman mastery over each and everything in you, your energies and your body, so strong that it never frays, let alone breaks, no matter what. You can manipulate chakra with your mind alone, and thus perform any Jutsu you know without the need of hand seals at all. In future jumps your control over your bodies expands to cover any other bodies you may acquire, and you can control any and all powers and abilities you acquire just as finely as your chakra."
300,Pyrokinesis,Young Justice,"Pyrokinesis allows the user to create and manipulate fire and heat, allowing them to throw fireballs and greatly increase the ambient temperature. The user is also immune to fire and most forms of heat; not to the point of being able to fly through the sun, but they could fly much closer than most spacecraft."
300,Rock of Ages,Generic Xianzia,"You have managed to unlock the secret of agelessness and youth. But what is the benefit to immortality if you cannot share it with others? You may bestow this longevity with others though this is not without cost to yourself. You must expend enough magical or spiritual energy to essentially blow up a mountain each time you use this technique. As such, you will likely require time and meditation in between each use of this ability and may be unable to utilize it altogether if you lack sufficient spiritual or magical strength. When you do succeed however the targets body is returned or accelerated to their physical peak and will remain as such forever unless external forces seek to rob them of their youth and vigour. You do not have to use energy from your own stores; energy siphoned from items, or other beings will work just as well."
300,Soundgarden,My Hero Academia,"The user of this quirk is able to manipulate a large amount of sand and glass at once with the sound of their voice, giving commands in a way that sounds like song more than orders. This Quirk, aside from just manipulation, also allows the user to seamlessly shift sand into glass and back again, turning sand into glass with higher pitch vocalizations and glass into sand with lower pitch vocalizations. An exceptionally low tone bellowed and sustained can cause any sand under the user’s command to pack itself together, attempting to condense and squeeze anything in the way. An exceptionally high note vocalized and sustained causes glass to reverberate and eventually explode/shatter. Shaping glass into “blooming” constructs like flowers seems to be easiest. The major limitations are lack of protection to the abrasive and cutting abilities of their own power, as well as the condition of their throat. Prodigious overuse of the ability has predictable results in scratching up and damaging vocal chords, making continued use difficult."
300,Technopathy,Arrowverse,"You have the ability to control any form of technology within your immediate facility, overriding it with your own encryption which changes and mutates like a biological virus, and can make technology do whatever you desire. You can also sense technology in your surroundings. Lastly you’re able to create a digital copy of your brain and upload it to any technology around you, but the copy will die if the power is cut from the device you’ve uploaded the copy to unless transferred elsewhere."
300,Parahuman - Biosculptor,Worm,"On touch you are able to sense every detail about living matter you're in contact with, and can shape it with a thought. You are only limited by your own (admittedly great even just with this powers senses) knowledge of what you're doing, the amount of biomass you have to work with, and physical laws. As long as it is organic you can weave it like a master musician would a masterpiece from the violin, or like a sculptor would mold their masterpiece. Contact means you're at least touching part of the living being you're wanting to effect. Requires direct flesh to flesh contact on your part, doesn't work through clothes or coverings, and doesn’t work on yourself. This power isn’t instantaneous, although it’s still extremely quick."
400,Air Specialization - Pressurebending,Avatar: The Last Airbender,"Requires: Bending Arts: Air

You have learned a unique form of Airbending invented right before the Genocide, utilizing a combination of wind and movement of air to create areas of extremely highly pressure. By preventing these areas from equalizing by surrounding it in a shell of high-speed wind, the pressure within these shells causes the air within to act as if it was solid, effectively letting you create short-lived objects. This art can also be used to create extreme low-pressure zones, and if you master it, you may even be able to create true vacuums."
400,Earth Specialization - Metalbending,Avatar: The Last Airbender,"Requires: Bending Arts: Earth

Long thought to be impossible, you are able to sense and Bend the tiniest impurities of earth within metal, target them, and use them to bend the metal itself. Though much more difficult than Earthbending, mastery of this art will enable you to move and shape metal objects as you please, tearing through solid steel like it was tissue paper or tossing tanks like childrens' toys. However, as an Earthbending specialty, this will only work on metals with impurities; completely pure metal will forever be out of your ability to control."
400,Fire Specialization - Lightningbending,Avatar: The Last Airbender,"Requires: Bending Arts: Fire

You are one of a very few set of firebenders able to separate positive and negative energy within your body, using this imbalance to create lightning. A dangerous and difficult art, it requires an absence of emotion and peace of mind; any deviation can prove fatal. However, its power is unrivaled, making those able to utilize it extremely feared. You have also mastered the art of lightning redirection, guiding electricity through your body before expelling it harmlessly."
400,HAZARD,Medaka Box Abnormal,"All life has water in it. All life that you know of anyway. It's a vital part of biology and to someone who can control it, a lethal weapon. You are not able to control all water without limit, instead you are only able to manipulate the volume of water in anything. So long as the water source you are manipulating is within a stadium's worth of area to you, you are able to massively increase or decrease the amount of water in a water source. You can double or half the amount of water there for every second that you focus on a specific source, easily enough to instantly kill most humans from the sudden increase off pressure from inside their bodies or cause widespread destruction to a city."
400,Water Specialization - Lifebending,Avatar: The Last Airbender,"Requires: Bending Arts: Water

Water is the source of all life, and all life is a source of water. You are one of the rare Waterbenders able to access this source, bending water within living organisms. Aside from enhancing your healing, you may now control water within plants, leeching it from them or twisting them into any shape you desire. However, under the full moon, you gain the power to Bloodbend, controlling animals and even humans as your puppets, or leaving them as dessicated corpses. With time, you may truly master this art, Bloodbending even in the light of day."
400,[Ice Fire],Medaka Box Abnormal,"You’ve gained the power to manipulate temperatures in and around your body to quite crazy extremes, freely forming and controlling ice and fire in some amazing ways. You’re able to easily do basic things like freezing entire rooms solid or creating blades of fire in your hands but you can also do things like using your ice powers to keep your head cool and prevent yourself from getting angry or use fire powers to hype up all your allies and get them raring to fight. Your powers have a good range, reaching across dozens of metres with ease, and you’re also able to control wind to an extent by manipulating both heat and cold at once."
400,AERO BIKER,Medaka Box Abnormal,"Everyone needs to breathe and thus controlling what they breathe allows you to control everyone. It might not be as faultless logic as you hope but controlling oxygen still makes you quite the terrifying opponent. You’re able to control all oxygen within a few hundred metres of yourself, letting you suffocate or attack people as you will. You can even use it to oxidise metal and meat or manipulate people’s health by precisely altering their oxygen levels. Or just blow them up from the inside out by greatly expanding the oxygen in their bodies. Makes a mess though, even if its nice hearing them choke on their own blood."
400,Age Bringing Glory,Bleach,"Age is a strange thing to the Shinigami. While the general rule is that the more powerful one is, the slower one ages, it can often move at different rates for unique individuals. Two captains of similar age may look entirely different, one a beautiful woman in her middle years and the other a wrinkled old man, despite the old man being by far the more powerful. But unlike mortal beings, the minds and bodies of the Shinigami rarely become frail. However old you may become, you appear to retain the full capabilities of your youthful prime. An aging elder’s body still bulges with muscular power and a thousand year old doctor’s mind remains as sharp as ever. The Reiatsu flows out strongly and indeed, there are some ways in which this age only makes you more deadly. The passing of years will slowly, independent of your actual training or learning, reveal to you secrets and developments to your skillset. The idle consideration given to one’s powers or skills happens to uncover new ways to use old tricks, a method to slightly improve your control over a fire-based release or give a flash of inspiration to solve a long mulled over problem. These improvements come slowly but steadily, mainly to the things that you focus on in life. A legendary Kido Master would naturally find his spells and casting of spells to improve as he grew older."
400,Barrier Code,Fate/Extra,"This grants you the power to create barriers of force in order to protect chosen locations. With a minute or so's concentration, you may summon one of these barriers out of thin air. Each is strong enough to require a demolition team to break it down, though you can put more energy into it to boost the toughness, to the point that even a Servant might have difficult breaking through. While these barriers have no time limit, each one does take a small amount of energy to remain active."
400,Force Manipulation,Young Justice,"Force Manipulation allows the user to create translucent, non- complex constructs out of pure force, allowing them to create force fields or batter their opponents. This cannot be used on the internals of things, even if you can see them. The strength of your constructs will depend on your concentration and focus; in theory, a construct could be maintained indefinitely, if you concentrated on it. However, if your constructs are struck with enough force your concentration can be broken, with the construct going with it; at normal human levels, constructs can withstand most gunfire, but may be disrupted by strong enough explosions or superhumans. You can purchase this again at no additional discount to lift some of these restrictions; your constructs can now have moving parts, and those without moving parts can now be double their previous maximum size."
400,Geokinesis,Young Justice,"Geokinesis allows the user to control and manipulate the earth, and includes the abilities to change its composition and density, turning rock to dirt or sand as well as allowing the user to throw large boulders and even temporarily allowing small amounts of earth to become lighter than air, allowing it to be “levitated”. The amount of earth the user can control increases with experience."
400,Safe Zone,Generic Isekai,"You have access to some other dimension that’s technically outside the bounds of this world. One minute in the outside world is equivalent to one hundred minutes in this dimension, making it excellent for training. Basic necessities such as food and cooking, dinine, and bathing facilities are available here. You may leave this dimension whenever you wish, but you’ll return to the point where you left the other world.\"
400,Unique Skill,That Time I Was Reincarnated as a Slime,"Whether you’ve gotten it from being an Otherworlder or you got it naturally, you’ve been given a Unique skill of your own tailored to your desires by the [Voice of the World]. You may choose to either buy a Canon Unique Skill or create one for your own. If you buy multiple skills you may combine them into a single skill. Your created skill can only have up to 3 abilities, excepting those combined and they must stay consistent. Their power must be kept close to canon skill levels and they can never reach Ultimate Skill levels without evolving."
500,SPINNING ANGLER,Medaka Box Abnormal,"All that rotates now does so at your command. Well, as long as it’s not bigger than the Earth. You’re able to manipulate the rotation of the planet and anything smaller than that or yourself that you are currently in contact with, even when that rotation would not be physically possible normally. You can rotate someone’s waist to tear their body in half or speed up the rotation of the Earth until everyone on Earth is killed or flung into the air."
600,[Grab Empty],Medaka Box Abnormal,A mirage is a trick the world plays on the human eyes. All you do is make it a little bit more tangible. You have gained the ability to warp space itself on an incredible scale. You could stretch out space to turn a mile into a thousand miles or contract it to be able to hop from one side of a country to another. You could fold space over itself to hide an entire city within space itself or even create new space to form pocket dimensions for yourself to play in. Even tearing apart space to leave holes in reality and sucking your enemies out into an endless void can be achieved. Your actions upon space will remain until you choose to retract them or another being with similar powers undoes them.
600,Bending Genius,Avatar: The Last Airbender,"You are a born master of your Element, using it on a level that most Benders could spend a lifetime failing to achieve. Where others toss boulders, you throw hills; where others could freeze a raindrop, you can transform a rainstorm into ice. Even the most trivial effort will allow you to learn any bending form you observe, and with casual practice you can master, then improve, on them. This genius also enhances, rather than supplants, any other Bending perks you've purchased; your talents are now exponentially greater, and your mastery also applies to the Specialized Bending Art which you learned, letting you master that art with little more difficulty than you'd have with the pure form"
600,Cryokinesis,Young Justice,"Cryokinesis allows it’s user to greatly lower the temperature around them, causing ice to rapidly form. This can be used to fire “beams” of cold temperatures that freeze whatever they strike, or to cause the ambient temperature of the surrounding area to drop significantly. Experienced practitioners can drop the temperature further still, as well as affect much larger areas, to the point where one might be able to affect an entire city."
600,Death Wizard,Bleach,"There’s no messing around anymore. Why even bother with a Shikai when you can outperform many Captains with Kido alone? You stand up with the legends of the arts with this, the likes of Tessai Tsukabishi and other outstanding leaders of the Kido Corps, as you’ve fully completed your training  in the arts. You possess knowledge of all Hado and Bakudo spells, from #1 to #99, as well as dozens of spells from the Kaido, Sealing/Ward and other such categories. Each spell has been honed to a fine degree of skill, if not mastered outright, that allows you to routinely express much greater effects without the energy costs increasing to match. Even with a few dregs of spiritual energy and serious bodily wounds, you remain a dangerous combatant. A few whispered words from you could bring a torrent of elemental destruction or a set of sealing spells down on your opponent. As befits what is surely a leading light in the Kido Corps, you have a particular talent for creating new Kido. The differing formations, sequences, chants and methods of Reiryoku use are all well known to you, allowing you to create new effects within this magical system. Inventing a new Kido is still a lengthy process, meaning any boasts of making obsolete others’ Zanpakuto are best kept quiet. But where others might take years, if they have any hope of it at all, you can likely create even a high level spell in a few months of steady research."
600,Haki Training,One Piece: New World,"While much of this world is more scientific than it seems, that does not mean the spiritual is useless. Capable of turning your will into a weapon and shield, you have mastered the basic uses of Armament Haki and Observation Haki. With Armament, you can reinforce yourself or objects and can bypass the defences of those thought untouchable. With Observation, you can sense the presence, strength, and emotions of others. With time and training, you might be able to project your Haki without a medium to attack others from the inside, or become capable of seeing into the future."
600,Royal Slaying Sword,Battle Through the Heavens,"Truly this is the weapon of an Emperor. As a ruler, one must lead. And as a ruler, you must be able to pass judgement onto traitors. Strictly speaking this is not actually an item, but rather an ability. An ability possessed only by those with the purest of royal bloodlines; to form this powerful slaying sword. It is singularly good at killing a specific species: your species. Unless the target is significantly stronger than the wielder, they would be as helpless as cabbage in front of this blade. Wielding this blade takes a good deal of Dou Qi. At the early stages of cultivation a single swing may be all that you can manage before becoming drained. Not even a Dou Zun could swing this willy-nilly."
600,Technopathy,Sonic the Hedgehog,"You can control electricity! But it's much more than that. You also gain magnetic field manipulation. It's precise enough to let you control electronics remotely. Make technology your bitch so long as it's within your range. You're new to this ability so expect some trial and error with a limited range of 20 feet at best. But if you focus and train hard enough you gain a significant boost in potency. Going up to 5 miles, and control 100's of electronics at once. Be careful when trying to control bots with true Sapience however as they have a strong resistance to being fully controlled."
600,Ultimate Skill,That Time I Was Reincarnated as a Slime,"You have been blessed and lucky enough to obtain an Ultimate Skill through some means. Rejoice, for you’ve joined the ranks of this world’s strongest although you’re nowhere near the actual top. You may choose to either buy a Canon Ultimate Skill or create one for your own. If you buy multiple skills you may combine them into a single skill. Your created skill can only have up to 3 abilities, excepting those combined and they must stay consistent. Their power must be kept close to canon skill levels excepting Veldanavas abilities, which are entirely off-limits excepting his actual Ultimate Skills like Uriel, Michael and Ahura Mazda. You also may not choose the Ultimate Skills “Storm Dragon Veldora” and “Scorch Dragon Velgrynd”. If you choose a canon ultimate skill it will not stop the canon characters from getting it themselves, though you can stop them from obtaining it through other means. Normally if you have an Ultimate Skill named after Angels, Justice Lord Michael could force Absolute Command on you and force you to do anything it wants unless you had an Ultimate Skill named after Demons too or your Angel skill was evolved or discarded. Normally if you had an Ultimate Skill named after Demons and was too weak to control it, your personality would change with the traits close to what Sin the Demon represents being heavily emphasized. But since you’re buying these with CP, both of these things won’t happen to you."
600,Unleash Your Power,Dragon Ball,"Skipping right to the mid-point, are we? You have actually tapped into your ki in the past, and have trained yourself to use it with some regularity. You can ‘power up’ using ki to boost your physical strength, speed, and durability as well as fire powerful ki blasts. You start with the ability to blow up a small car using this and know a single technique to that effect. Even with this early start, however, it is incredibly draining to use and is best reserved for finishing moves. You must train hard to go past this point and overcome your limits. Luckily, this also boost your effectiveness from training and learning how to harness similar spiritual energies from within - whether it’s ki, chakra, or something else tied to the soul."
600,Hydrokinesis,Young Justice,"Hydrokinesis allows the user to control and manipulate water, including changing the water’s state from liquid to gas or solid and back again. Experienced users can do this with other liquids, though the more water the liquid contains the easier and more complexly it is manipulated, and liquids with extremely high or low evaporation/freezing points may be unable to be manipulated in those ways."
600,Truth,Full Metal Alchemist,"The Gate of Truth, the place where all knowledge of Alchemy is stored, or so some think. You see, when one undertakes human transmutation, they find themselves taken through this gate and given knowledge of alchemy greater than most experts, alongside the price of something taken from them. Somehow your In-Jump origin managed to figure this out, and instead of trying a human transmutation they worked solely for the sake of entering this Gate and obtaining this knowledge. Somehow, this worked. Whether there was an item of great strength involved (hint hint), a gift from The Benefactor, or just Truth deciding to be a magnanimous fellow for once, they got that knowledge. You see, like a certain Dwarf in the Flask, you too have great knowledge of Alchemy. Instead of just being an expert, you’re more like a master, having knowledge of almost every branch of Alchemy in one way or another. Included in this is also the method for creating Philosopher’s Stones, Father’s eclipse ritual, Homunculi (the original kind), Alkahestry, and all the lost arts of Xerxes. Somehow, like the other sacrificial candidates and those stupid enough to try Human Transmutation, you too are now able to use Alchemy without a Transmutation Circle. You could spend centuries truly making this knowledge yours, but for now you’ll have to settle for the good amount of expertise you have.

(Requires Alchemy): The art of Alchemy involves many different components, and is part science and part mystical. It involves the law of equivalent exchange, and with that limit in mind, one can comprehend, deconstruct, and reconstruct physical matter into different forms. Amestrian Alchemy involves using the power generated by the Earth’s tectonic shifts to power this transformation, and an alchemical circle to make the change. If this was already obtained, gain a capability boost allowing transmutation with fewer materials.

(Requires Alkahestry): Alkahestry is a more medical and spiritual form of Alchemy that involves the “Dragon’s Pulse” which is a concept that details the constant pulse of Chi or life energy within the Earth. Unlike Alchemy, it is far better for healing wounds, and can project transmutation across distances. With this perk, you gain a decent understanding of either Alchemy or Alkahestry, enough to be a State Alchemist for the former, with a minor focus on one form of Alchemy. And similar skill for the latter with a minor focus towards either healing or combat, as well as the ability to read the Dragonpulse, and people’s presences and status. If this was already obtained, gain a preternatural understanding of the Dragon Pulse."
600,An’Ankra Essence,DC – Larfleeze,"You’ve merged with the cosmic force that binds all of existence. While your unique multidimensional nature as a jumper precludes you from using the full potential of this bond, limited forms of its abilities are still available to you. With focus and concentration you can understand and control the material world around you, creating nearly anything from their most basic quantum components or deconstructing them to the same, and finding vague information of the location and status of people and objects no matter where they hide, and (of course) firing powerful blasts of cosmic energy. You can also transfer your consciousness into nearby life forms such as trees and clones, and once per jump (or every ten years if they’re longer) you can reconstitute yourself from nothing after being killed."
600,All Is One,Dragon Ball,"Your studies into Ki have granted you the greatest revelation...All things are connected, and all things have the ki utilized in the strongest techniques you may find here. By performing a certain technique, you are able to gather non-essential ki/life energy from your surroundings, harmonizing your soul with the world around you’s as your hearts all beat as one. With this, you can empower yourself for a time(as the excess chi burns off well enough n use) or a single attack with greater magnitude than any strike you could have performed while in the empowered state! Curiously enough, this seems to be tied to your origins as well...races who perform this technique on their home planet or a place that you consider home will get a monumental boost to the damage potential given by both the empowerment and the ki-infused strikes."
800,[Eternal Eternal Life],Medaka Box Abnormal,"Life just moves on, you know? You can’t expect things to stay the same forever, with people never leaving you and the world never changing. Not if you want to call yourself a healthy human being. The power to make things stay the same is in your hands now. You are able to make ever-lasting, static or permanent anything you touch or are involved with. You could make someone’s love for you never change no matter what you did or did not do, the trees you touch would never lose their leaves nor grow old, a water droplet that floated in the air would remain so for as long as you wished and those you turned your wrath on would remain injured forever by daring to rouse you. So long as you can make physical contact with the target or something physical the target is connected primarily to, you can make all or part of it permanent and never changing."
800,Heavenly Flame,Battle Through the Heavens,"Within Heaven and Earth, there are some abnormally strong flames formed by natural forces. Each their own force of nature, these domineering flames are the kings of all other flames. In their presence all other flames of similar or lesser power will submit. Each flame will have its own special ability, such as triggering eruptions or attacking the soul. These flames are widely sought after by receptariers as they can be used in ‘borrowing the flames’ to refine pills of much higher quality, as well as break down much stronger materials. There are 23 known types of Heavenly Flames, which have been ranked according to their strength. For 400 CP you receive a Flame of rank 13-23, 600 CP for rank 4-12 and 800 CP for rank 2-3. It is a little known fact that the rank 1 flame is actually a merger of every other Heavenly Flame. Of course, it has long been suspected that there are more Heavenly Flames out there, that have yet to be discovered or created. Even some of the known flames have unknown effects. As such you can choose to create an until-now unknown flame. Its strength will match the price you buy it at."
900,Atom Eve,Invincible,"Somehow the government experimented on you as a fetus. As a result of this you are now able to innately understand everything to do with chemistry, and the make-up of molecules, while also having the ability to transmute matter at will. This can come in many forms, everything from generating constructs of energy, that could even allow you to fly, all the way to manipulating the atoms of non-living matter. You could create a piping hot cheeseburger from a brick, but you could not generate a living being or alter one. Hell you could generate a mansion and plenty of fine dining level food just from detritus around you. You cannot control living things, however, as the government that created you also implanted mental blocks that prevent you from altering them. These blocks do not naturally degrade except temporarily during times of extreme emotional stress (like if you were dying after having a Viltrumite punch a fist sized hole through your abdomen and spine) where you will be able to use this power on anything for a few seconds at most. When activated they automatically heal you to the prime of your health as well as anyone else nearby whom you care deeply about. These powers do activate as you die of old age: congrats, you are now physically immortal. A secondary aspect of this power that is both positive and negative is that as you use it results in rapid caloric depletion and the shunting of unused atoms into your digestive tract. While this will never be damaging to you, so long as you use your powers regularly you will always stay thin and remain unable to put on weight past your desired body type no matter what you eat. The secondary and less pleasant aspect of this is that if you use your powers very heavily you will need to go to the bathroom several times a day. With practice and mastery you may be able to learn to prevent this from occurring. Normally you would be unable to use your powers while pregnant as their use would put a strain on and potentially kill any foetus that you carry, meaning that if you got pregnant you would have to go 9 months without using this power. However thanks to the power of jumpchain this issue is no longer there allowing you to use this ability anytime without fear of damaging a foetus. Energy constructs default to bright pink, but as you are buying your power here you can decide what colour they are when you buy this perk. A person with this perk would be capable of creating constructs or manipulating matter that could block a young Viltrumite, and given years to train might even be able to survive against a veteran Viltrumite in combat. While the mental blocks do not naturally degrade, you could break them given the appropriate powers or tech. If the powers are ever unblocked, then even a Regent level Viltrumite would need to fear them as you could easily turn them into literal swiss cheese. For an extra 400 CP you can get these powers without the mental blocks, allowing you to affect living beings."
1000,[Encounter],Medaka Box Abnormal,"Unless you desires it, no one will ever touch you again. You are able to push away everything from yourself that might harm you, whether it be physical or mental or emotional and direct that harm onto someone or something else that you can see at the time. You can direct it towards other people, towards objects or even just into the space around you to harmlessly dissipate. This defence cannot be bypassed by an attack, no matter how many attacks or how fast or how strong but it does have a certain weakness. Attacks that have no specific targets and simply work on everything without distinction within a certain area will entirely ignore your defence. Powers like Scar Dead below are just such examples. Until your chain is over, you will also not be able to push away your own death."
1000,Wisdom of the Sage,The God of Highschool,"You inherited a portion of the King’s Power, the innate Divine ability of the Jade Emperor Ohkwang. This power allows for the manipulation of the Four Fundamental Forces of the Universe. Strong Force, Weak Force, Electromagnetism and Gravity. The King himself was able to fling whole planets around the solar system like pinballs or disintegrate half the bodies of High Gods with a wave of his hand and his true successor, Han Dae-Wi, will be every bit as mighty. You however, have only received a portion of this power. You could fly or destroy whole houses with a thought or construct various weapons and items from thin air but the heady heights of power the Kings possessed are years away from you. As time passes and you practise your power, you will grow in both the control you have, the range of your ability and the magnitude of what you may effect. This ability turns one of your iris’ wholly black, with a golden Omega symbol in place of your pupil, at least when the ability is in use."
1200,Free Climbing,Medaka Box Abnormal,"You're already used to the numbers game, given the sorts of power you regularly use and interact with. This just made you take it to a literal level. You are capable of manipulating parameters and variables to become greater and stronger or lesser and weaker. You can increase someone's physical strength or decrease their intelligence, increase their age or decrease their hair follicle count. So long as you can put a hard number to it, you are able to raise or lower that number. You are limited in how much of either can be done, only able to raise up to one thousand the original number or decrease to one thousandth of the original number. You must come in physical contact with your target to use this ability on it."
1400,[All Fiction],Medaka Box Abnormal,"Before you, all of creation becomes mere fiction, wished away with a thought. You are able to erase anything you desire from existence, from a person to the stars in the sky to a colour to someone’s powers to the love between two lovers to someone’s death or even more abstract things. With just a thought, these things disappear entirely. It is not impossible for beings of sufficient power or with similar beings to resist or counter your effects however, nor is it impossible for people to bring back what you have erased, though one would need to be especially mighty in comparison to you to do so. You could even use this ability to erase your own death, by setting it up in advance or doing it from the afterlife, though do remember that those who shut down your power or have some way to stop you coming back will stop you from doing this. For an extra 200CP, you may also gain Non-Fiction that expands your power to be able to erase the erasure of things, allowing you to bring back things you or others have removed from existence, an ability you lacked with just the basic ability."
