Cost,Perk Name,Source,Description
100,Infinite Ammo,DC – Kingdom Come,"Any gun you hold has infinite ammo/energy. That’s just how it is. You also know how to rig up any ballistic weapon on your body to fire when you will it. If you want a shooting crotch gun and have it be an efficient design feature, that is possible. If you want jack in boxes that shoot guns when they pop out, that’s fine."
50,Good Fortune,Generic First Jump,"You are luckier than most people. Not to the extent that people will be shocked by it or that you could rely solely on this to keep you alive, but random odds do tend to tilt in your favor. Also, you will not experience any fate that could end your chain solely because of bad luck."
50,Normal Days,Sekirei,"People have an odd tendency to ignore the strange and unexpected when you’re around. If you start brawling in the street, passersby shall just blink and move to avoid the flying bodies, instead of scream or call law enforcement. Any peculiarities about your companions are likewise ignored, even if they’re walking about half naked and still smoking from that battle five minutes prior"
50,Auto Mapping,Pokemon Mystery Dungeon,"This special skill allows you to create working maps of your surroundings. If you explore an area you haven’t been to before or which can be considered a labyrinth, building or cave of any sort. If it has a clear layout this perk will activate, creating a map in your mind which slowly updates as you explore."
100,Simple Convenience,Generic First Jump,"Some worlds do not have the modern amenities that we are used to having, making everyday life a little less comfortable. You no longer have that problem. Your clothing, personal equipment, and body are always clean, and you never need to visit the little extra-dimensional adventurer’s room. This can be toggled on and off at will."
100,Secret Identity,Batman: the Animated Series,"Oddly enough, it seems that people have trouble putting two and two together when it comes to your “civilian” and your “costumed” identities. Even if you’re the only person who fits the physical profile in the entire city, you can conceal your identity by playing dumb, wearing glasses, or even just slouching a little. This won’t help if they have irrefutable proof of your double-life, but otherwise they’ll just think it’s a funny coincidence."
100,Let’s Have A Clean Fight,DCEU,"When two living gods go to war with each other, can the little people really expect that they will escape unscathed? At least when it’s you fighting, they apparently can. Any fight you take part in, the participants will never cause collateral damage unless they specifically intend to. Even if you are hitting with the force to shake entire countries, you won’t crack a single window or even knock a bystander over from the shuddering blows you deliver to your enemies. They too will be under this effect, preventing them from doing collateral damage unless they specifically aim to destroy the people and objects that are around your battle. Hopefully you finish fast enough before they decide they only want to make you miserable."
100,Heroically Unimpeded!,My Hero Academia,"“What’s that? How does my hair and cape always flow perfectly in the wind? Don’t you know!? Heroes don’t have to worry about such things!” On purchase you’ve become gifted with the ability to ignore all manner of common inconveniences that may get in your way or prove dangerous when fighting crime. You never seem to trip over rubble or loose stones, wind always accentuates your coolness instead of blowing your hair around or turning your cape into a hindrance, clothing doesn’t catch on anything even if it’s loose and so on. You just worry about doing your job right."
100,It Might Be Destiny,My Hero Academia,"You don’t have to be an adult or someone big and important to leave a lasting impression on someone, and you don’t need to be a hero to help people when they need it. You have a way of landing chance meeting with or running into people during formative or troubled moments in their lives. They might be complete strangers having a bad day, or an old acquaintance looking for a fresh start and no plans. Whatever the case may be, it’s in your hands what you do with these chances. Befriending someone when they’re looking for a friend, hurting them when they’re vulnerable or simply giving them a bit of direction. These meetings happen often and you’ll always know when it’s happening."
100,Painting the Battlefield,Demon Slayer,"Let’s be honest - the thing that makes KImetsu no Yaiba such a masterpiece, at least in its anime incarnation, is the fight scenes. More specifically, watching the Demon Slayers at work, with their awesome visuals attached to their stylized Breath Techniques. This perk, provided free for the duration of this jump, not only lets you see this amazing stylization, but also lets you distinguish between different fighting styles with a moment’s glance! So you know why the Fire and Insect Pillars are actually called those things and demonstrate the fundamental truth that you can look like you’re swinging a sword the same way as your friend with a different style, and those swings are completely different. Besides, if you know an enemy’s style, you can be better prepared to counter it, right? For 100 CP, you get to keep this perk for other jumps; it may not be as awesome when you’re fighting a bunch of gun-toting goons, but any character who has their own way of fighting will have amazing visuals ot go with, and just a few attacks will be enough to paint a picture of their general style. The effects of this perk can be toggled."
100,Isn’t It Past Your Bedtime?,RWBY,"Your enemies always seem to underestimate you for some reason. No matter how often you prove yourself capable, they will almost always look down on you. Though this could give you an opening to end a fight before they realize how strong you really are... This can be toggled on and off at will if you ever need to intimidate someone."
100,SUPERHUMAN DESIRE,Medaka Box Abnormal,"You always wanted to be special and that want was itself so strong that you really did become so. Whenever you are subjected to a procedure that will improve or beneficially alter you with a chance of injury to you, death or even just the procedure failing outright, it will instead have a guaranteed chance of success. Risky operations will always go off without a hitch, shoving an energy source into your own body will have it combine with you successfully if there was even the smallest chance of you not dying."
100,Miniskirts and Cigarettes,Full Metal Alchemist,"Ok, so maybe it is a bit strange that you make all your female subordinates wear miniskirts, or that you chainsmoke every day, even during important meetings. However, it’s never really been a problem for you has it? Your superiors have always seemed to be fine with your conduct as long as you met the minimum level of competency and success required to do your job. In fact, when you go above and beyond, they do more than just tolerate your behavior, they have the common habit of actively laughing along at your antics. As long as it isn’t blatantly treasonous, or active sabotage, you’re probably fine."
100,Darn Mages They Ruined Skyrim!,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim,"It’s a sentiment you’re going to experience quite a bit in these parts nowadays, especially if you're not Human. Regardless, ever since the fall of Winterhold and the destruction caused by Red Mountain’s eruption mages have been seen as less than desirable by many Nords, despite the invaluable services they provide to the province as a whole. Normally this would be a pain but for some reason you seem to be exempt to this prejudice. People will judge you based on your actions and unless you act in such a way that would make you a menace or undesirable you’ll face no discrimination from others despite factors that normally would bring it on you."
100,Dire Need,Pokemon Mystery Dungeon,"To be a Rescue Team means to be on the scene as fast as possible, to save the lives of those caught in an accident or catastrophe. Yet even Rescuers need help sometimes. Thanks to this perk, should you be seriously injured you will instead of dying be knocked out and put into a pocket dimension. A distress beacon will be set up and your companions have 10 hours to search for you, and if they succeed you will be healed completely. If they fail, well, chain end."
100,Gacha Bitch,Fate/Grand Order,"Another five star gold? Damn, you’re making me jealous here. You manage to get just obscene luck when it comes to gambling games. Be it casino gambling or rolling the gacha on a mobile game, you’ll get the result you want 9 times out of 10. If people start cheating against you, your luck might start to not be enough but long as things are fair, you can really rack up the goodies. As a minor side benefit, you also happen to have a quick understanding of how game rules work and a sense for when you are in a game yourself."
100,Brothers in Arms Across Worlds,Fate/Grand Order,"Myths are always getting changed and mixed up. A popular book series coming out in the modern day and becoming a worldwide sensation could radically alter how a Servant appears to be once summoned. You’re a little less alterable in this way. People remember you as you are, unaltered by popular stories and when it comes to specific people, they may even remember you if it’s not even them remembering you! If you’ve met and fought alongside King Arthur in your legend or in these coming battles here, you’ll find yourself remembered as a fighting partner by any version of King Arthur. This’ll never be enough to make them consider you an ally on the spot but these fond memories of you will make people you’ve met before quite a bit more amiable towards you."
100,Interesting Times,Highschool DxD,"Who is that weird redhead you keep bumping into? How about that loser who got caught breaking into the girls’ locker room? Or that box with the weird, ominous chanting in it? You’ll find that with no real effort on your part, you will quickly get roped into plots and major events in some fashion. You will usually be treated like a side character and left alone, but even this can be a little dangerous...at least you won’t have to look far to find main characters, or those with untold and unseen stories. It doesn’t automatically make anyone like you more or less, mind. This can be toggled on and off."
100,This is My Absolute Territory,Fate/Stay Night,"The sad reality of all those fabulous clothes you see some people wearing is that there are certain sacrifices to be made. Things like how utterly freezing your thighs get when your socks only go to your knees or how gross and sweaty your chest gets after you've been running around in a steel breastplate all day. I guess it's lucky you don't stick to reality in this case because you'll never have to experience either of the above two things. No matter what you're wearing, as long as it is not actually harmful to you, will feel like the most comfortable, well-fitting clothes you've ever gotten to wear, regardless of their actual shape, material or quality. Go ahead and wear all the leather, spandex and metal you want."
100,Good People Have Good Night’s Sleep,Fate/Stay Night,"First times usually aren't like what you read in romance books. Think less sensual and more awkward. Of course, there's always the exceptions. The lucky few like you. You'll never be awkward or nervous when you're laying with someone and you'll always perform exceptionally well with a partner when you're having a tumble in the hay. I'm sure you'll be popular. But hey, even if you're alone, this'll also make sure you'll always get a good night's sleep, even on rocky ground or a cold floor."
100,Divine Protection,Rising of the Shield Hero,"Rather than protection bestowed by a divine being, this perk gives you a kind of ‘immunity’ from divine influence. While it certainly does not protect you from a direct divine smiting, you will find most subtle influences will not gain traction on you. Great for avoiding divine meddling in your life, hint hint."
100,Please Return!,Generic Naruto Fanfiction,"People are incapable of denying to themselves or failing to realize when something you’ve done has helped them. This doesn’t necessarily mean they might not still express ingratitude or scheme to use you for their own benefit, depending on what kind of people they are, but it does mean that even your worst enemies will still acknowledge your true value. This perk can also act as a general leadership buff because your followers will always truly see how your decisions and deeds have acted for their benefit; no amount of enemy propaganda can spin away your accomplishments. Your people will always know in their hearts when their leader is truly worthy of their trust. This effect obviously does not help you unless you actually are a good leader, mind you. Fortunately, it also doesn’t broadcast when you’ve been a bad leader; people will have to find out about your errors or misdeeds on their own."
100,Protection,Generic Isekai,"Birth control? Condoms? It can be rough living in a fantasy setting. You can now reduce your fertility to zero whenever you want, and even prevent your own periods. You’re also immune to STDs or anything unwanted supernatural effects that transfer through sex."
100,Reward the Child,Campione!,"Favoritism is the name of the game and you’re a natural at it. Wherever is because good impressions, some fortuitous coincidence or pure dumb luck, you seem to receive more blessings than you should get. For example, winning some small lottery would give you also a secret prize, buying an old magic book could come with some extra teachings inside and if you ever become a Campione, you can bet that the [Authorities] you get will be a cut above others."
100,Teach Me,Flow,"People are willing to teach you anything you wish to learn about and merely asking someone is enough to get an entire lesson. It's a bit too easy really as almost everyone is willing to teach you not only subjects they’re good at but how to use powers, techniques, and everything they know. Even super secret abilities are ones they'll teach you even if they would never do it for anyone else. This extends to people you fight against as they are strangely giving you advice on how to improve the way you fight, better utilize your powers, and general life advice. Your most hated enemy will offer up sagely words of advice while trying to kill you."
200,Seek And Ye Shall Find,Generic First Jump,"When it comes to tracking down what you need for your collection, you are quite lucky. In fact, you are lucky anytime you try to find something. You are much more likely to find clues or leads that will tell you where to locate the object or person you are seeking. You are also good at putting these clues together, making you a talented investigator and tracker."
200,Extra Credit,My Hero Academia,"For every dreamer or hard worker that becomes a hero, there’s dozens, maybe hundreds more that fail to qualify. It might not even be their fault, simple luck of the draw with Quirks and a bad matchup with tests or hurdles. For those who don’t test well, there’s this. As long as you show potential and initiative, there will always be more ways to prove yourself and reach what you’ve been working so hard to achieve. Fail a test? There are ways to earn extra credit. Seeking to prove yourself someone and it relies on something you’re horrible at? There will be other ways to earn their approval. Your efforts will not go unrewarded."
200,"What Are Your Plans, You Rogue!?",My Hero Academia,"“-and then I said ‘What are you up too, deviant!?’ and he just started monologuing! Works every time! Hm? How do I do it? Just give them the chance and they’ll do the rest for you, my fine compatriot!” Like any good hero, you now have the ability prompt your enemies into dramatically monologuing about their plans or intentions, planting that compulsion in your head via an interrogative question. Those who naturally do things like that anyways are easy targets, while those strong of will and attached to keeping secrets may be able to shake off the effects of this perk."
200,Lucky,Rosario + Vampire,things just tend to go your way more often than they should. While you may not win the lottery bad things tend to happen to you less than other people.
200,A little help from your friends,Rosario + Vampire,Whenever you are badly hurt or in grave danger your nearby Friends and Companions combat effectiveness greatly increases as they try and protect you.
200,Violence Solves Everything,DC – Blackest Night,"There is no need for restraint, for all will know your anger soon enough. Your attacks and acts of violence inflict greater damage on your surroundings, dramatically increasing the collateral damage you inflict on the environment. Broken windows turn into broken buildings, and a small fire turns into a raging inferno. This effect can be toggled on and off."
200,Darcy Time,Marvel Cinematic Universe Vol. 1,"One of the most iconic and well-known species of this world, Asgardians have made their mark on Earth as Nordic gods while the Nine Realms see them as protectors and enforcers of peace. The average Asgardian is strong enough to lift around ten tons and could even train to lift up to twenty, while possessing significantly greater durability, reflexes, and coordination than humans would. Asgardians also possess an innate affinity for battle and war that sees them performing beyond almost all the other races in regards to combat. Along with healing faster than normal, it is little wonder that they are seen as among the strongest of the Nine Realms. Should you desire, you may instead be one of their genetic cousins, the Vanir."
200,Breaking Bindings,Sword Art Online,"Programs have limitations in what they’re capable of normally, just like humans, caps on their processing speed, resource allocation and access permissions for various parts of the file system. These tend to be absolute, much like how quickly humans can react or use their muscles, but you also share humanity’s ability to break these on occasion. When so desired or unwillingly restrained in some manner you can throw off any restrictions placed upon you, whether that’s being physically bound by chains or mentally bound by compulsions and spells. This can cause physical damage in exchange, depending on the strength of the restrictions, although never more than enough to badly injure you."
200,What’s Mine Is Mine,Naruto,"Poor Hashirama Senju. Decades after his death and people are still desecrating his body and implanting his cells within them. God forbid something like that happen to you. Imagine people like Orochimaru possessing your biological abilities by gaining access to some of your cells, or even cloning you! I’d say that would be hard but, in this world, it really isn’t. It’s a worry, or it would be, but there is something about you or, more precisely, about your DNA, something that actively works against all attempts to decipher it. The smartest beings in the universe could try for a million years to gain access to your DNA and they would come out with nothing. The greatest scientist could spend centuries trying to clone you and it wouldn’t work. Your cells could be implanted in thousands of test subjects and not one would acquire any of your abilities. Now, if anyone manages to gain access to your DNA it would give them no benefit whatsoever, including technology that would scan your biology and DNA, so no Omnitrix scanning you. You can toggle this on and off as you see fit."
200,The Force Of Will,Star Wars: Attack of the Clones,"Or do you want to forge your own path, break free of any shackles of predestined events? Your actions will change things regardless of precognitive abilities, destiny shaping effects, and other forces that try to ensure that things go along a specific path. For better or worse, canon can be derailed with your influence."
200,Chosen by the Relic,Pokemon Mystery Dungeon,"There is a McGuffin Jumper, an artefact that is key to the fate of this world. It will only respond to a certain kind of people, and that sort of people are you. No matter what the normal conditions would be, artefacts of technology or magic will never question your worthiness from today onward. Even if you are the most unlikely of people to be the chosen one, even if you’re a coward too scared to enter a guild because someone shouted from below at you, your heart is pure and that is all you need."
200,Beyond Faker,Fate/Grand Order,"You’re a legend among legends, everyone knows that. You’re undeniably you in your very own place. That’s why it’s so very easy to tell when you aren’t you. People who try to copy you, no matter their normal level of proficiency with that art, just fall flat. Disguises are shoddily made, voices are horribly off, attempts to pretend to be you see the imitator forget vital information you should know. Even trying to copy your techniques or abilities will at best result in these same pale imitations they get elsewhere, with weakened abilities or entirely missing ones. Anyone who had actually met you could spot these fakes in a moment and even those who have never met you can tell that something’s up."
200,Memorable Occasions,Fate/Grand Order,"There’s no way to be a protagonist if you’re stuck fighting the rank and file. It’s a lot more dangerous but the only way to really make a difference is going straight to the top. The guys who have names people actually know and remember. You’ll never find yourself stuck in a conflict against the unimportant guys. Whether it be a war or just a competition, you’ll clash against the important, the strong and the named guys. They’re usually a lot stronger but they also happen to be a lot more important in the long run. You’ll also find yourself meeting potential allies this way too, important people that might be on your side or able to be convinced to your side."
200,Musashi Malfunctions,Fate/Grand Order,"It’d be awfully anti-climactic if a hero in the making like yourself just got winked out of existence with no chance to defend yourself. Wouldn’t it be better to live to fight another day, even if that day was taking place in a different world? Attempts to kill you by erasing the world or time that you are in fail to work. If the universe is destroyed with you in it, you’ll find yourself rather roughly flung into a new universe or timeline that is similar but different from the first. People can still blow you up, they just can’t erase you by destroying the space-time construct that you exist in. If they want you dead, they’ll need to do it directly. Or just blow you up from afar even still. Maybe invest in some good shields?"
200,Big Damn Lolis,Fate/Stay Night,"The way you just happen to always arrive right on time to stop the villain getting away or foil the hero's dastardly plot to ruin your evil plans, some people think you're really just waiting in the wings for something to happen. You're not quite that good of a planner though. Really, you're just lucky beyond belief when it comes to arriving at the most dramatic time. As long as it's not straining belief more than a little for you have gotten to some place quick enough, you'll always arrive to any heroically or villainously appropriate situation at the most dramatic time possible. You'll get to your captured friends just in time to block the executioner's blade or arrive just as the hero thinks they've finished one foe off for good and has let his guard down. Just remember, stretch reasonable timeframes too far and you'll just get there late."
200,Bad End Night,Fate/Stay Night,"Some days it seems like death or worse awaits around every turn and behind every door. A man could go mad at the constant paranoia and fear such ever-present death might impose. You though, possess a sixth sense of sorts. As death approaches, you gain a vague sense of impending doom. The closer your death approaches, the greater this feeling grows, until it feels like your heartbeats are blocking out all other noise. This gives no indication of what the danger is or where it comes from."
200,I’m Here To Help,All-Star Superman,"You’re probably used to strange or unusual powers being met with all sorts of emotions - terror, apprehension, disbelief. Calling upon extraordinary or otherworldly abilities can bring out the worst in those who lack such a thing, as they see you as a monster. But not here, not anymore. When you demonstrate new and amazing abilities unique or rare to the world, others judge you not on how you appear or what your powers are, but your deeds towards the rest of the world. Someone who sits in the middle is accepted for who they are and little more, but a true hero is seen as an amazing marvel and someone to admire for what they use such fantastic abilities for. However, particularly hateful or jealous foes can still hold you in contempt for such powers...just as Lex Luthor despises ‘The Alien’ to this day."
200,Even Bad Guys Need Sleep,Chronicle,"Sleep is one of the best things in life. The ability to just turn off your mind for some time and escape the woes of life often goes awfully underappreciated, not in the least because it does have its drawbacks: one is left completely defenseless when asleep, and the mind is addled with more than a few problems if you lack it. That’s why your body decided it’ll just do away with those negative aspects. Whether you’re asleep, unconscious, or in a drug-fueled haze that renders you unable to act, it is guaranteed that no harm will fall unto you. You enemies may still bind you to prevent your escape, but you won’t get hurt, either due to you waking up in time before anything happens or nothing happening at all. And since you are able to rest without fear, you’ll also do so restfully, with all sleep being entirely enjoyable. You won’t even be groggy in the morning anymore!"
200,Now We Can Fight to the Fullest,The God of Highschool,"You have the ability to create small, overlaid pocket dimensions around yourself. Within this pocket dimension, which looks exactly like the environment around you before you activated it, any damage or destruction dealt to the surroundings will not carry over to the real world and living beings other than yourself and your opponents cannot be harmed from within the pocket dimension. The dimension will cover a few city blocks at first but as your power grows, so too does the size of this ability. Perhaps you will one day be able to carry out entire wars within one of these bubbles, preventing the precious land from being torn up by the fighting."
300,Workaholic,Sonic the Hedgehog,Sometimes you wonder how some geniuses are able to build entire armadas within days or weeks of their last defeat. You become a walking factory of production. Building in masse is something that comes without issue to you. That one bot that took a week to build? Now that one bot is now 5. Or roughly 3x the size it was before. How do you even have the resources to build so much you say? The hell if I know.
300,Changer of Fate,Sekirei,It’s stated that an Ashikabi brings about a ‘change of fate’ for Sekirei. Now you can bring about that change to anyone else that might feel trapped or in danger by forces outside their control.
300,Hammerspace,Demon King Daimao,With this you can effectively summon from your Warehouse anything that you’re strong enough to lift that can be affected by teleporting. You may also put it back. This just teleports things about while there.
300,[Amateur Amazing],Medaka Box Abnormal,"They thought you were too freaky to touch as a child, so they decided to pelt you with abuse and rocks from afar. At first you just thought they had shit aim, when they started missing. But then you realised that even when you stood right in front of someone, they couldn’t hit you from a distance. You’ve become immune to attacks from range, impossible to hit from a distance. No matter what the attack is, it always seems to miss you, be blocked by something else, suddenly aim for something else or even just whiff entirely. The only ranged attacks that can get around this are those that don’t target you directly, such as a bomb’s explosive wave going off nearby or an attack that was targeted at someone else but you were within range."
300,Anti-Discrimination Aura,Battle Through the Heavens,"Unfortunately this world’s society has some deep rooted prejudices. People will often discriminate against other people due to their parents, status, or gender. When people look at you though, they seem to miss or ignore all those little voices that tell them to look down on you for whatever reason. They will be completely neutral to you until you actually act."
400,Ride The Rails To See The Sights,Generic First Jump,"Maybe you want to help blow up the Death Star, or fight on the walls of Gondor, or fight off the Agent Smith virus. For those events to happen, events before them kind of have to go a certain way. This is your guarantee of that. Now, as long as you do not deliberately cause large scale changes, the canon plot of a Jump’s setting will proceed as expected, adjusting for minor alterations you might have caused. This can be toggled on or off, but once turned off, the butterfly effect may make a return to canon events impossible."
400,Lucky Son of a Gun,Generic Fist Jump,"They say it is better to be lucky than good. Hopefully they are right, because now luck will be on your side. This is never blatant or extreme, but fortune tends to favor you, and bad luck always seems to miss you. Your luck never runs out, but it might fail in the face of overwhelming power or skill."
400,Racial Taboo,The God of Highschool,"The Taboo laid upon humanity is nigh absolute. Even the strongest human to ever live, Taejin Jin, a man who erased part of a country during one battle and could split mountains in two with one kick, could only lightly harm a Nephilim rank God with his strongest attacks. Once the taboo was lifted, that same man could kill those same Nephilim with a lazy slap of his hand. As a God you benefit from the Taboo laid upon humanity but in the coming years it is likely to be broken, one way or another. You will retain it however, in this world and any future ones. The taboo is now an innate part of your divine being, applying the same reduction to any attack against you that originates from a human being. Some attacks will damage or even kill you, depending on their power or special qualities, but anyone below the level of the monstrous Special Human known as Taejin is unlikely to even scratch you."
400,Luck of the Devil,Battle Through the Heavens,"There is a saying in this world, that luck is a type of skill too. Those who are lucky are extremely skilled and you happen to be a master. Expect to have many lucky encounters with rare plants, or unique maps to hidden treasures. A dangerous poison you consumed by accident may end up helping you break through a bottleneck. This could alternatively be called ‘luck of a xianxia protagonist’."
400,This Will Work,Flow,"Whether you’re genetically engineering something, stuffing a god’s sou into a corpse, creating life itself, or similar mad science most don’t get it on the first or subsequent tries.This is no longer the case for you anymore. Any experimentation or modification you do on any being will always work with no negative side effects unless you want them included. It is impossible to fail on any sort of modification or experimentation, even if it something impossible such as sticking multiple gods souls into a corpse. Whether it’s genetic, spiritual, or something else entirely nothing is impossible when it comes to applying science."
400,Uncivil Servant,My Hero Academia,"You might be trying to do good in your own way, you might not be, but either way you’re working outside of the law. That means you’re a bit bereft of resources and contacts, at least without this you are. Through the power of this perk you’re able to summon a copy of all kinds of private records at your discretion. Police reports, financial history, medical records, psychologist observations and more. You can pull up police and autopsy reports to help you solve cases on your own. You can cross check medical records with details on a suspect or victim to follow up hunches. Everything an enterprising vigilante could want and more. Just make sure you keep it on the down low since this isn’t exactly legal. To use this, simply focus on the kind of record you’re wanting and the power will do the rest. The files will disappear when you’re done with them."
400,Outnumbered,RWBY,"Quality trumps quantity every time, and Huntsmen are the embodiment of this idea, often facing hundreds of Grimm at a time. It doesn’t matter if you’re fighting ten foes, or ten thousand. Whenever you face a group of foes, their superior numbers grant them no advantage beyond moral support. As long as you would've been able to defeat them all individually, you'll have no problem dispatching them in a group."
400,Gaia Power,Duel Monsters - Shadow Realm,"The Wild is your home, and it gives you strength. Your physical capabilities are at their peak in “Wild Places”, uncivilized and untouched by society. You can ‘make’ locations into “Wild” places, and as long as you are within a wild place you can move and attack unseen, a master of guerilla warfare. Become the nightmare within the forest…"
400,Administrative Access,Sword Art Online,"Normally electronic devices have a series of access levels upon them, things a particular user can and cannot perform due to what tools and programs they can use. The average user of a laptop can surf the web and watch videos, but only an Administrator can install new programs, for example. This grants you those self-same Admin permissions, allowing you access to the debug and editing tools used to create the software, even if those weren’t shipped with the user-end edition. Even if the world of a game is randomly generated, you are able to tweak the results in a local area as you desire, by temporarily modifying the algorithm’s parameters. Want to render yourself invincible to all damage? Disable enemy AI? Change your avatar’s appearance, spawn items and objects or give yourself a massive pile of money? With this, you can do all that and more, provided you’re interacting with computer software. This perk is restricted during the duration of the death game, limiting you to only altering the virtual world’s code if you find an Admin console somewhere within the environment, as well as failing to work on your NerveGear at all."
400,Lucky,Naruto,"You are obscenely lucky with a capital L, random events always go your way, you trip over treasures and fortunes others would sell their soul for and your enemies always seem to suffer from something or other every time they come across you. This isn’t a win button, however. If you piss off a being too powerful compared to you, you will be lucky enough to probably make it out alive if not in one piece, but that is better than most people get."
400,Better Part of Valor,Final Fantasy 7 Remake,"When you’re on a mission, you can’t afford to die in a heroic last stand. This perk amplifies your ability to avoid catastrophe and ultimate destruction. You know when and how to escape trouble should defeat seem certain, and almost always manage to save enough of your allies and resources to rebuild. Only the most complete and total defeats will leave you with nothing."
400,Like the Rising Moon,Rise of the Guardians,"The Guardians, both as a group and as individuals, did not come into being ex nihilo. The group was founded by the Man in the Moon, and its members became Spirits because of the Man in the Moon as well. When you share a goal with someone, you may gradually feed them energy to make them stronger and better able to accomplish the goal. The more they’re devoted to the goal, the faster their growth. Eventually, after enough time has passed, they will evolve into a Spirit, and their growth will have gained enough momentum that even without your influence it will only be a century until they gain the power of a Guardian. This can apply to even the souls of the recently departed, though they will not be able to interact with the world until they are Spirits in full. Usually it would take a few years of regular interaction with a person to get them to the point of evolving into a Spirit; who knows how short it might be if they could be fed energy even when far from you?"
400,Protagonist,Re:Monster,"You possess a weird sort of luck, one that makes sure you always have a fighting chance and will generally have the tools necessary to survive any encounter you get into. Rarely will you find yourself overwhelmed, and if you are, it will be when you won’t die from such a loss. You still need to recognize and capitalize on such advantages, and you will sometimes be pushed to the limit, but you will never be without the means to claim a victory. This will not save you from sheer stupidity, such as challenging an opponent so far beyond your ability you can tell you’d have absolutely no chance with what you have on hand and not taking the obvious hint to walk away. This will not make you instantly have a chance against such an opponent."
400,Outside of Time,Pokemon Mystery Dungeon,"Don’t you hate those time paradoxes? Yeah, me too. Travel into the past, change one thing, kill one mosquito, stop time from being broken by Darkrai, and boom! You’re fading away within a few minutes. Well, that may have been until now. From this day forward, with this perk, you are exempt from any and all changes to the past that would negatively affect you and even guarantees that you being stuck in a world if you time travel will no longer work so long as you did it for the betterment of others."
400,Never Too Late,Pokemon Mystery Dungeon,"Ever wonder how Rescue Teams manage to, time and time again, save Pokemon from perilous situations without being too late to save them? Me too, buddy. However, thanks to this you have now no longer to worry if you will make it in time, as long as you put in the genuine effort you will always arrive on time to save lives, stop atrocities and interrupt the evil plans of your nemesis. Mind you, you can’t rely on it delaying the horrible fates forever, so hurry."
400,Uncle Urahara,Bleach,"It’s hard to explain just why so many famous men and women seem to think you’re the apprentice they most desire. Maybe they just really like an excuse to mess with you, maybe your parents just knew everyone important in the world. But fact is, you have quite the habit of drawing unique but powerful mentors to help you out, especially when you know you have a challenge ahead you’re not yet ready for. They tend to rely on dangerous training methods, sometimes even life risking ones, but they’re incredible effective and you’ll recoup results far beyond what might normally be possible for you. As long as you can survive. While some of these teachers might wander on their own way, others could be willing to help you out if your goals coincide or you really end up bonding with them."
400,Power of Friendship,Bleach,"The hero doesn’t fight alone, not these days. There’s no reason that the friends he fights for can’t give it a go themselves to help him out, especially not when they’re in your presence. Your close friends and trusted allies grow stronger alongside you as you fight and continue to adventure, provided they’re joining you in your struggles. To a lesser extent, they can take advantage of the speed at which you grow if they also make efforts to improve, likely to greatly increase their efforts. What makes you special in particular is the ability to awaken entirely new abilities in those around you, sometimes as a direct result of energy you project and sometimes as a coincidence of being wrapped up in the same schemes you’re trapped in. The result is that normal friends or those too weak to really keep up in the struggles you face are able to develop powers that help bring them nearer your level. They might discover sudden Fullbring heritage to save themselves when you couldn’t reach them or suddenly unlock a supposedly impossible transformation to recover lost power as a Hollow. Once they have their new powers, they’ll be able to progress them as if they were truly inherent abilities."
400,Protagonist,Re: Monster,"You possess a weird sort of luck, one that makes sure you always have a fighting chance and will generally have the tools necessary to survive any encounter you get into. Rarely will you find yourself overwhelmed, and if you are, it will be when you won’t die from such a loss. You still need to recognize and capitalize on such advantages, and you will sometimes be pushed to the limit, but you will never be without the means to claim a victory. This will not save you from sheer stupidity, such as challenging an opponent so far beyond your ability you can tell you’d have absolutely no chance with what you have on hand and not taking the obvious hint to walk away. This will not make you instantly have a chance against such an opponent. This acts as a Capstone Booster."
400,Refined Form,Re: Monster,"Those native to this world are not as inherently versatile as those that reincarnate, unable to draw on the expanded range of knowledge and potentially unique abilities possessed by these individuals. Instead, they refine what they know, make it better, and dedicate themselves to it. When you focus on something, be it the use of a specific weapon, the skill necessary to mine ores, or even the study of magical theory, you can slowly internalize this focus and make it a part of you, allowing it to shape your development and skills in a way that aids you more than it otherwise would. This will naturally make you more suited towards the skills related to what you’ve internalized and ease any restrictions on you for learning such skills. Over time, you may be able to enhance an existing focus to be stronger and offer greater benefits to you, especially as you Rank Up or gain associated Jobs, even unlocking new ones based on your foci. Alternatively, you may gain the ability to instead internalize a new focus, on top of the existing one, which will shift your affinities to overlap with it. This is easier to accomplish if the foci internalized are related. An example of this is E, a goblin that grew fascinated with spirit stones and started to mine them regularly, developing into an affinity for earth that allowed her to eventually evolve into an Earth Lord, giving her great strength, durability, and the ability to control the earth itself."
400,Human Ingenuity,Re: Monster,"Tools, weapons and armor, an equalizer for races that do not possess the innate strength and defenses of monsters; even with the more human-like monsters picking up the use of such equipment, humans are the ones that benefit most from such equipment. Physical equipment you utilize, whether that’s a weapon, armor, or a tool of some sort, is more resilient and can handle greater forces put on it than normal, based on your own overall ability and skill with the piece of equipment. More than this, equipment you use is overall better in your hands than it is for others based on your skill with it. A sword will act as if it were sharper the better your skill as a swordsman, armor will provide greater defense the more used to it you are, and a hoe would be better at turning the soil the better you are as a farmer. Additionally, skills that rely on equipment, such as Slash or Bash, are more effective."
400,Is This A Bad Time?,Justice League Unlimited,"You have incredibly good luck when it comes to attacking your foes. Whenever you're about to have an important battle you'll find that your enemies will always be inconvenienced or hindered during the fight. Maybe one of your earlier schemes prevented some of their backup form arriving, or maybe you just so happened to escape and enact your revenge right when your archenemy was helping save people from an erupting volcano? Whatever the reason, this perk will ensure that you always have at least a slight advantage during any fight where you'd need one."
400,I Wish To Live As A Man,Fate/Grand Order,"God himself could come down from the Heavens and tell you your purpose...and you’d be able to tell him to jog right on. Your life is your own, not bound to anyone else’s’ desires or beliefs about how you should proceed. Your fate and destiny is unalterable by the unnatural influence of any other being, even He Himself, and you are free from any feelings of obligation that you do not willingly take on. Merely having abilities that grant power will never make you feel like you should need to use them nor will anyone ask for you to do so or expect it. Everyone around you understands that the actions you take will be those you decide to do and that the only way to change that would be to forcibly take control of your mind or body away from you."
400,Eternal Sunshine,Fate/Grand Order,"When you walk in the room, it lights up everyone’s faces. Unfortunately it’s not your winning personality at work but the shining sun that follows your presence. Or perhaps another feature entirely. See, when it comes to conditionally activated powers, you’ve got the blessing of not really needing to worry about conditions. As long as you need to satisfy a location or time based condition to use an ability or item, that time or location will overlay itself on you and your immediate surroundings. Need it to be noon to use your powers to their fullest? The sun will constantly shine down on you as if it were noon. Require being in a specific building to have your greatest abilities accessible? That building will overlay some of its features in the ground around you to ensure you can simulate being there just fine. There are some limits however. Time based conditions that do not occur at least once a year will not work for you through this and location based ones must be places you have been to and that are currently accessible in your current jump."
400,Larger Than Life,Young Justice,"You truly lead by example; whether you’re heroic or villainous, your actions have a profound effect on others, especially when witnessing them directly. Others will see your actions, and how you treat others, and seek to emulate them. This doesn’t mean that they’ll try to punch out someone with super strength or try to fly, but they will strive to be more like you in ways that are possible for them. What’s more, others will see those that emulate you, and will emulate them in turn."
400,The Duel with Honor,Tate no Yuusha no Nariagari,"To a hero sometimes honor is everything and to others it’s useless but to a duel it’s very important. So when you challenge someone to a duel with an equal bet should you win, your opponent would likely follow the rules and fulfill their end of the bargain. If by chance your opponent didn’t follow the rules and cheated you of your reward fate and coincidence itself would conspire to give you the reward one way or another. The other benefits of this is if your opponent is using this duel for evil or injustice to others or yourself and the more the scale of the bet leaning towards your opponents the more likely you would win and gain even more rewards."
400,Luck Above All,Tate no Yuusha no Nariagari,"Being a hero on top of being protagonist the shield hero is very lucky to help him in sticky situations. As the protagonist of this jump it would be bad if you die quickly as you begin so your fate, luck and coincidence combined their forces to keep you alive. No assassinations in your sleep, poisoning your food, destroying dimensional passage and etc... to kill you. Making it that no underhanded attacks and assassinations would kill you, hinder you probably but killing you is impossible. There’s a downside for great things the more heroic and epic the battle the weaker the effect of this protection. The impossible to be killed by underhanded attacks and assassinations becomes possible but still heavily leaning towards your favor in keeping you alive. As a bonus, events or games of chance lean towards you, making you likely to win more than usual or arrive in time for events to happen."
400,The Reformation of the Territory,Tate no Yuusha no Nariagari,"Building a territory needs manpower and time but with this say goodbye to those pesky things. This gives you the ability to move, place, remove, create and combine things in your territory. Normally you would need offering points but you only need to spend MP to perform this. This allows you to move, place and remove objects you’re touching, inside of your warehouse or with the cursor in your field of vision when this ability is activated. You can create items with the recipes that you know and materials that you have in your warehouse and place it in your territory. Even combining two objects into one and gain the effects and abilities of the two objects. You don’t need the supplementary skills of the legendary/vassal weapon in combining objects like the plant modification. It even allows you to modify the objects or buildings like a monster stable adapting to the specific type of monsters you want to rise in it. You cannot move, place, remove objects or buildings with occupation in it."
400,It’s Gonna Be Me,Flow,"It always seems that there are rare items, abilities, talents, energies, and many other things which can only ever be held or done by someone special, have a will of their own, or can be bonded to only one person. This is a silly limitation which is why you can ignore any requirements for anything. Nothing is too unique, cursed, or special in any world that you can’t safely wield or use without drawbacks. You can use any weird enchanted objects, magic, power, and any selective McGuffin that is picky about who uses it. Things bonded to a single person will immediately recognize you as their true owner and jump ship. You’ll trivially draw out the full potential and powers of any ability or object as they won’t fight you on anything."
400,Improbable Crafting Skills,Generic Isekai,"You’re an expert at recreating modern technologies with atypical resources. Even if you don’t know the full mechanics or manufacturing process for a particular item, you’ll be able to craft it with local materials or supernatural abilities through experimentation or sheer magical power. Post-jump, you’ll also have a much easier time interchanging materials and processes for technologies not native to your original world."
400,The One Moment,Campione!,"Timing. It’s all about timing. Asking out a girl, trying to score a new job, getting in a fight with the law. The results may completely depend on the timing of your actions. That final slash to your archenemy, that cool entrance just in the nick of time to save the princess, or when you try to have a heart-to-heart with your friend. Get it wrong and your archenemy survives, the princess dies and your friend are estranged. Failure is not an option. For you it never shall be again so long as you actively work towards making it on time."
400,Polymorphization,The God of Highschool,"A trick you picked up after watching one of your co-workers’ Charyeok turn into a cute girl, you’re able to enact Polymorphization on any Charyeok or other like entity, including summons or familiars. This lets you grant these things full, human-level intelligence no matter what they are, and those already gifted with sapience will find their minds sharpened even further, and a humanoid, human-like form. What this form will look like is not up to you but in general, it’ll be an attractive body that closely resembles their original form. Of course, just being human-like and aware of themselves won’t make them disloyal to you and you’ll find that beings that did not originally possess human intelligence and have been Polymorphed are much more affectionate with you then they normally would be."
500,Pentakai Bench,King Arthur,"Just as every king has his followers, all drawn to him by numerous reasons. You have your companions. Whenever one of your followers are near you, both of you get a small boost of power, around a tenth of your or their base power. This increases with the amount of followers you have around you each getting the boost as well."
600,Not Quite Dead,Rosario + Vampire,"You are one hard person to kill. Not necessarily due to toughness but fate also seems to be dead set on your survival When it comes to matters of your survival your luck is Exceptional. You will just be knocked unconscious by fatal attacks as they just miss your vital organs. If you are alone, gravely wounded and bleeding out someone will find you and save your life. You have exceptional luck for surviving things that you shouldn't. However if you rely on your luck too often it will run out. This perk will not save you if someone checks to make sure that your dead. Nor will it save you if there is no possibility of your survival."
600,Xianxia Protagonist,Generic Xianxia,"​This is it. You're the star of your very own Immortal Hero novel, and you have all the upsides that grants! As such, just about everything will be easier on you. You will benefit more from training, becoming much more potent and advanced than other students. You have a knack for finding long-lost items of great power and mentors of awe-inspiring might that can let you grow more powerful significantly more quickly. Techniques and training methods that are potent, you shall show great talent for. Fate smiles upon you, for your enemies tend to have a more difficult time dealing with you. You will never be permanently killed by anything so mundane and pathetic as a mere fall down the stairs or choking on your food. Your plot armour is ridiculous, letting you walk away with stuff that would maim or ruin normal people. Lastly, you gain some insight into the nature of your enemies; it will help you when confronting them.


--- Secret Technique Scroll (Requires Xianxia Protagonist): There are many hidden combat arts throughout the long and storied history of the realm, and this scroll is but one of them. With successful study of the scroll, training in line with its instructions, and meditation on its deeper meaning, you will obtain a unique skill, one that will likely aid you in future training and provide you with unique options in combat. What the effect is is ultimately up to you but below are certain examples; Increasing the weight of an object the more spiritual energy you put into it. Being able to separate your spirit from your body. Concentrating all of your spiritual energy into a single point. Granting you control of all parts of your body, even your sweat and hair. Or maybe even making your skin become as hard as metal when you flow your spiritual energy through it. Or maybe cutting your enemy with your blade the instant before it actually connects. Ultimately, what this technique is and how it manifests is up to the buyer, but two things will almost always be true of it. The first is that it will always be limited to what a highly advanced practitioner of martial arts could do (or at least what they claimed they would be able to do in the distant past). And secondly, that it will improve and become more effective the longer and harder that you train with it. ---"
600,Natural Genius,Petals of Reincarnation,"If you were going to be as lazy and half-hearted as to give up all hope and rely on your ancestors for a free ride in life...well, you’d probably just have killed yourself a while ago. You’re no Reincarnator. You’re a natural, modern day Great Person. Whatever ability you may have gained from the Ancestor section is instead an innate power unique to you, always active and free of any compulsions to act in any way you do not wish to. It’s your power, not borrowed from someone else. Amazingly enough, despite already being the sort of person to one day be used as an Ancestor, you’re able to develop even more powers. By accomplishing great things, you can have those accomplishments turn into incredible abilities. For you, the greater the accomplishment, the greater the power you’ll receive from it. Strangling a few hundred people and becoming well known for it may just result in supernaturally strong arms while changing the entire world with your discovery and popularisation of easy electricity use may leave you able to tear apart entire cities with lightning bolts sent from your fingers."
600,Master Craftsman,King Arthur,"Thanks to being taught by faeries anything you make by hand is a great deal better than anything regular human can make. Armor is nearly indestructible and lighter than it should be, blades are sharper, blunt weapons have more force behind them, bows and crossbows can shoot farther and are easier to pull back. Even mundane items like baskets work better, though you can't give items mystical powers without being a wizard or something."
600,A World with a Yellow Sun​,With This Ring,"​Something about your new home makes you stronger than you should be by a great deal. You are stronger, faster, more durable, and heal faster than you should. While on planets other than your home-world, all supernatural powers you have are an order of magnitude stronger than normal. In future jumps limited to a single planet, the same effect takes place in nations that your origin was not born in, with drop-ins having their starting location count as their “home” for purposes of this jump."
600,Lucario’s Legacy,Pokemon Mystery Dungeon,"Once upon a time there was a great Rescue Team leader known as Lucario. His deeds are so great and remembered with such reverence to this day that the highest rank of Rescue Teams can achieve was named after him. With this perk you won’t instantly be as legendary as him, or have the Lucario Rank, but instead any great deed you have performed in this, past and future jumps can, at your discretion, become a known legend based on fact and people will associate, if you so wish, that legend with you. Not only does this give you incredible bragging rights, but your foes will be extremely reluctant to cross you, even those who could have a chance against you, and your allies will fight harder, march longer and be filled with the bravery and knowledge that you are with them, allowing them to overcome all fear and perform feats of legend. What’s more, this perk also grants you another bonus: Any training, studying or other way of improving yourself, will now be 10 times more effective and never cease to bear fruit for you."
600,Rolling With The Punches,Young Justice,"You’ve got uncanny luck when in combat that causes most projectiles to simply miss you, and the ones that do hit are extremely unlikely to hit anything that would cause you permanent damage. When you get struck dead on by someone stronger than you, there’s a greater chance that their blow will glance off; still knocking the wind out of you and sending you flying, but not crushing your ribcage like a tin can. This effect is increased the more skilled you are in comparison to your enemy."
600,Power is Power,Generic Worm Fanfiction,"There are forms of power. Economic, political, personal... and so many more. They all have their own uses, and their own significance... unless you have this perk, in which case it all starts to blur together, a bit. Put simply, all forms of ‘power’ you have now grow together. The stronger you get in one way, the stronger you get in all the others. While the details of how doing more push-ups pads your bank balance are left to you, it does so all the same. Increasing your territory, getting more people in your faction and boosting your laser eyes are all tied together in ways no one quite understands, but everyone can see. In addition, it is a truism of life that the easiest way to get more power is to have power. For you, your powers are now a training booster not just for each other but also for themselves. The more powerful you become, the faster you can learn, train, and improve both yourself and things and people that are yours. This doesn’t let you violate existing softcaps by itself but from now on you are not only immune to diminishing returns in your gains but actually see increasing returns."
600,Fated Encounters,Fate/Stay Night,"You've got a habit of sorts, one of running into surprisingly powerful people that all seem rather happy to help you. A new friend made at school turns out to be a powerful young heir to an ancient magic family, for instance or a teacher who has a secret past of being a powerful enforcer for the supernatural dark side of the city. You'll frequently encounter these people, ones with special abilities or incredible skills, as you go through life and find that most of them are easily befriended or allied with by you. While often powerful or in possession of useful skills, these people would not change the course of the world on their own. Not without you there to push them into action."
600,Within My Own Territory,Tate no Yuusha no Nariagari,"It’s normal for a villain to have advantage when fighting within their territory. Even more so if staying in your base makes you powerful. By owning a territory even if you bought it, given to you, inherited from your family or stolen from others. When you’re within your territory you receive a stat multiplier that multiplies all of your stats/attributes. The multiplier depends on the size of the territory. A village at bare minimum doubles all of your stats/attributes. The larger the territory the higher stats/attributes multiplier you would receive. Owning a country will multiply your stats/attributes by several times but owning a world will multiply it by tens of times. If your territory isn’t functioning as intended, sheltering the people. The stats/attributes multiplier would only give you half of its effect. Like a village territory would only give you 50% stats/attributes boost. Yes there is no limit to the boost it gives but remember this is only effective if you’re within your territory and going outside the limits of your territory would remove this boost."
600,Gotta Have Power To Get Power,Medaka Box Abnormal,"Once you’ve had a taste, you can’t help but want another and another and another. Power is an addiction, one that the world seems all too happy to feed into you. The more power you gain, the easier and faster it will be to gain more power. Personal power, supernatural power, political power, financial power, any sort of power or influence on the world around you will become easier and easier to gain as you gain more of that sort of power. At the early stages, this can be as simple as growing faster or finding more sudden bursts of inspiration but later on you may find yourself gaining powerful mentors, finding great riches every day or even, eventually, just spontaneously developing new powers now and then."
600,Plot no Jutsu,Generic Naruto Fanfiction,"Are you even taking this seriously? It’s like you’re treating this world as your own personal playground or something. How many fortunate coincidences can one ninja benefit from, anyway? You’re obscenely, ridiculously lucky. Bad luck never touches you, random events almost always go your way, you practically trip over things that you go searching for or will need later, and your enemies keep suffering from convenient attacks of stupidity, such as helpfully explaining how their powers work so you understand how you’ll “never” be able to defeat them. This is not an “I Win” button. If your stupidity reaches the point where you are outright begging the universe to come smack you, it will. Still, the amount of crap you can now get away with before you reach the ‘too stupid to live’ threshold is downright mind blowing.


--- Jinchūriki Boosted (Requires Jinchūriki): It turns out that luck and probability are like a cloth, and people are but insects walking on it. You were already a stone that pulled both towards you; now, with the weight of your beast added, it’s grown really rather ridiculous. You are now the eye of Fate’s hurricane, completely immune to precognition, postcognition and any similar abilities. The beast’s might has brought you outside of even Fate’s reach, and unless you will it, no binding of fate, prophecy or destiny can stay your hand when you want to do something. Furthermore, your luck reaches beyond yourself to cover even your plots and desires now; it’s almost as if there’s an omnipotent author out there who is warping causality to help ensure your success. Even your most half-assed lets-hope-we-get-lucky decisions are karmically boosted, to the point where the vast majority of the time they’ll work just as reliably as an actual well-made plan! And if you’re actually competent at plans, then your enemies will need either the keikaku doori of the gods or else a plot armor/armor-piercer of their own to match you. ---"
600,Hanyou,Generic Naruto Fanfiction,"Okay, you’re special, Jumper. And everyone realises this! You find that people around you tend to practically fall over themselves to grant you artefacts, powers and abilities, be they superpowers or letting you summon their servants as your servants, or something in between. This happens most often with beings of great power and age, demons and demon gods, spirits and plain gods, but affects just about everyone. They never seem to care what other powers you have, even if they come from their enemies. Nor do they have much restraint in handing out the good stuff, making you among the most powerful ever empowered by them at a minimum. They do this most often through letting you share their bloodlines, or souls, or something in that vein, granting you power that won’t fade with time but instead only likely improves, though the latter is far from automatically assured. The bloodlines and powers you recieve in this way never harm you in any way, shape or form, and they always play well with each other, even if it makes no sense.


--- Jinchūriki Boosted (Requires Jinchūriki): While the benefits granted by other gods can be great, nothing quite matches the beast sealed in you. Nonetheless, your beast has much to say and do about these blessings, including some really neat stuff. First, your jinchūriki regeneration has also been boosted, to the point where it can restore lost limbs and return you to full health from anything short of being ground into hamburger. This also affects more subtle things like diseases, poison or even aging, granting you eternal youth and health. Second, not only do your many blessings and boons play well with others but they now play off of each other, synergising and interacting positively wherever possible. The demon’s power also strengthens these bloodlines, meaning that they tend to start growing stronger and richer with time. This can take a long, long time indeed, dependant on the nature of the power and the being who granted it, but it can be sped up massively through certain methods and techniques your beast can guide you through. So thorough is this increase that it’s just a matter of time before your powers match the being who granted them to you, and slightly longer before you cross them and stand at the very epitome of their whole race or species, unless they were already there, of course. Even at this point, while the beast has no more advice for you, you can still keep improving if you can figure out how. ---"
600,Changing Destiny,Flow,"Fate, Destiny, whatever you wish to call it has sway over everyone and any resistance against it is often met with failure. You, however, are beyond fate’s grasp making you one of the few who can say they truly have free will and as such no one can set you on a different path than the one you wish to be on. Fate’s grasp on you is so futile that even if your future-self traveled to the past to tell you what you were doing is pointless it wouldn’t matter for the future can be changed no matter what prophecy, time loop, divine sight, or anything else says. Those who seek to turn you and are protected by the fates or have prophecies about them will find their protection means little as they are killable just like any person. Prophecies, danger senses, those who see into the future and past, divination, and similar abilities that attempt to view or detect your past, future, or even present self will never work. There is nothing by supernatural/magical/technological means that can view your secrets unless you want them to. This immunity makes your presence alone able to disrupt any plans that were foretold or are in the making as merely by existing no one can plan around you. Nothing can ever be considered absolute or certain as you’re the ultimate wrench in everyone's plans. You’re even able to extend this effect to those who you consider your allies allowing you to free people from the shackles of fate and become truly free while also granting similar immunities."
1000,Erwin Schrodinger,Petals of Reincarnation,"An Austrian Physicist famous for his studies into Quantum Physics, particularly his experiments with felines. The Schrodinger’s Box experiment resulted in a particularly scary probability based power being passed onto you. At all times, you know the probability of success of all actions you may take in that moment and with a thought, you may choose to enforce whatever possible route you see. So long as a particular event is possible to happen, you are able to force it to happen. A firing squad would miss every shot at you, even if you stood still and let them take a hundred retries. Similarly, you could kill every one of those men with a single bullet even with no shooting skills of your own. If an action or event is impossible however, you will be left helpless with this power against it. Schrodinger also makes his Reincarnators have the heads of cats when they turn into him."
200,Vacuum immunity,Sonic the Hedgehog,"The void of space is no longer a threat to you. Instead of the freezing cold, and lack of pressure you’ll feel comfortable and everything breathable. It’s as if you never left the earth’s atmosphere. This effect spreads to companions and even stasis pod tag-alongs. (This universe has an odd rule of space being non-lethal to everyone, if you want this to extend beyond this jump you HAVE to purchase this perk)"
400,People Believe in Me,Rise of the Guardians,"It can be tough, starting in a new place. If your power depends on how many people believe in you, then going to a world where no one believes in you is a pretty startling shift. And there will still be some of that, but at least this Perk will mitigate it. You see, with this Perk, in future Jumps you will Insert into each setting with a popular folktale legend based on you and a decent chunk of the world population — about 5% — already believing in your existence. It may not be as much as you had in the previous Jump (though maybe it’ll be more), but hey, it’s a start. Additionally, should you happen to have purchased any residential areas from other Jump Docs, be they as small as neighborhoods or as big as entire galaxies, then all of its resident citizens automatically believe in you and always will.

Capstone-Boosted (Requires: Guardian): It’s all well and good to say you start off with a certain amount of people believing in you, but what about getting more? Should you gain power from how much a certain something is present in the world, be that an emotion or concept or simple belief that you exist, then you will be able to spread that certain something with your very presence. Or rather, events will just so happen to work out as to logically push them into it; it won’t be instant, and with skeptics in particular may take some time, but just being around others seems to guide them into believing in you and what you represent. ---"
100,Personal Inventory​,Overlord,"You have gained a personal inventory. It is nebulously large, enough to store several tens of thousands of pounds at least, and while you couldn’t store a house in it (or living beings) you could easily store plenty of suits of alternate equipment, weapons, potions, piles of coins, food, and other such things. Taking things out of your inventory requires reaching into it, which will make it appear as if you are reaching your hand into a dark hole in mid-air. For an additional 50 CP the inventory is arbitrarily large and can hold as much as you feel like putting into it, so long as no individual item is larger than a normal house. No matter how big your inventory you’ll always draw out the things you intend to, and will instinctively know what is in it. Items held within are in a sort of beneficial semi-stasis. Food or drink won’t spoil and neither will anything within decay or rot, however if an item inside would benefit from time progressing (such as a magic item regaining expended charges on a set schedule) then it will still do so, to whatever extent is most beneficial. These effects are active no matter what level of Personal Inventory you purchase."
600,Under the Same Moon,Rise of the Guardians,"It’s great being able to support your friends, but it’s hard when all of your supporting abilities only work when you’re nearby and you’re nowhere to be found. Fortunately, the Man in the Moon doesn’t even need to be on the same planet to lend his support, and neither do you. If you have Perks, powers, spells, or abilities that in some way support or strengthen others, but only in a limited range, only if some specific condition is fulfilled, only if triggered or activated, or only for a short time, then your allies and Companions will still receive the benefits of all of those abilities no matter the distance between you, even if an ability would normally only be able to affect a select amount of people. (If a beneficial effect might not always be desirable, such as invisibility, then the recipient may suppress these effects at will.) Of course, you won’t be able to stack these benefits twice.

Capstone-Boosted (Requires Guardian): Supporting your friends is nice. But many strangers are just friends you haven’t met yet. If there is someone who you would approve benefitting from a supporting ability you have, then they do, even if you haven’t even met them yet, even if you don’t even know their name. This Perk has a certain amount of prescience; you need not fear these abilities benefitting someone who you approve of now but wouldn’t later on. And for the people you already considered allies? Even more barriers are broken down. Previously, your supporting abilities could benefit someone almost anywhere, so long as they were in the same universe. But now? So long as they are someone you consider a friend or ally, they will benefit from your abilities even in different universes, even if they stay behind and you move on to a new Jump. ---"
600,I See Your Potential,Dragon Ball Z,"Your allies and companions may lament that they simply cannot match you. They can’t hope to catch up, to be the behemoth of power and skill you may potentially become...or already are. That fear is now unnecessary. When you train someone in a skill or ability that is possible for your new student to learn, and one you know yourself, you will find that the gap is quickly closed with enough training and effort. As long as you’re personally teaching your student one-on-one, they will quickly race to the heights of skill you yourself currently rest at, able to make a student into a master with enough time. This only works for one particular set of skills (combat, a particular technology or science, knitting, etc.) at a time, but you’ll find the top won’t be so lonely anymore. Be warned, some people who know of this teaching prowess may take advantage of you and work to ulterior motives after learning what you know...use caution when choosing your students."
600,Those who don’t have the conviction,To Love-Ru,"Anybody that doesn’t really want to kill you just won’t be able to. This means you won’t die from someone accidentally running you over or in a friendly spar, as well as protecting you from someone who is being mind controlled, manipulated, forced or similar. A person has to really want to end specifically you for any chance of success. This also protects you from becoming collateral( e.g. when the town you’re in gets nuked), as long as it wasn’t created/used specifically to kill you. This won’t protect you from anyone or anything wanting/created to kill you(mindless minions and the like included), even if you were to use mind control or something similar to attempt to change their disposition. Like the reverse, controlling them will not change the disposition - only actually changing their minds without force will make them incapable of killing you again. Yes, this protects you against Tsunderes."
