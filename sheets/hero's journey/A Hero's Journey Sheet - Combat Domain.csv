0,Civilian Skills,History’s Strongest Disciple Kenichi) ​(100,"You find it exceedingly easy to apply your martial arts skills to mundane tasks. Leg strength developed through repeated kicking and great leaps could be applied to travel faster, and recreational parkour. Alternatively powerful punches, tight grasps and natural leverage techniques could be used in construction, repair and advanced art or sculpture. You will find innumerable uses when you begin applying your martial arts to everyday life."
0,Jutsu Technique (E Rank),Naruto,"The world of Naruto contains a multitude of jutsu that can do just about anything, from raising the dead to teleportation. While here, you’re guaranteed to encounter situations where you can learn some of these amazing feats, but this perk will ensure that you’ve got something special right out of the gate. You may learn any E-rank jutsu for free."
50,Style Blender,Generic Fist Jump,"You are a genius at combining your fighting styles together, finding their similarities and mixing them into a single, usually superior, style all your own."
50,Martial Art,History’s Strongest Disciple Kenichi,"​The main focus of the series. All who enter this world know at the very least the basics of their chosen martial art as well as its various strengths and weaknesses. The more styles you choose to study, the longer it will take to incorporate them into a cohesive and usable whole. You may also choose any real­world martial art not listed here if you so desire. You will however remain a novice in your style unless you can somehow obtain a master or worthy sparring partner."
50,Clinging With Your Feet,Medaka Box Abnormal,"A very strange martial art is the discipline of clinging to walls and ceilings with your feet, allowing you to walk on them as if they were the ground. You’ve become a master of this art, to the point of being able to use it even when you’re wearing shoes or piloting a mecha. Gravity only holds you down when you want it to. Or when you jump and stop holding on with your feet."
50,Jutsu Technique (D Rank),Naruto,"For 50 CP, you know a D-rank jutsu such as the Body Flicker Technique."
100,Advanced Infantry Training,Generic First Jump,"While you are no Special Forces operator, you have been through Basic Training and Advanced Infantry School, or the equivalent for the setting, and are a highly trained and conditioned soldier."
100,Student of War,Generic First Jump,"The study of history is often the study of war, and you have become an expert at it. You are not only an expert strategist and tactician, you are also an expert at logistics and organization, the unsung heroes of any military campaign."
100,Fighting Style,Generic Fist Jump,"You are at expert level in one real world fighting style, which must be primarily unarmed and could just be street fighting if you choose. This can be taken multiple times. For an additional 50cp, you are upgraded to a master of all your chosen fighting styles, one of the best in the world, possibly the very best."
100,Control,Generic Fist Jump,"When the majority of your fights are organized sporting events, you need to be able to defeat your opponent without actually killing them. You can now restrain any attack you make, so that it will only deal non-lethal damage to the target."
100,It’s No Fun With Two Hands,Bleach,"Not everyone is as blessed as you are in matters of war. Most likely, they’re a whole lot less lucky if they find themselves facing you. But you can be kind. You’re in it for fun too, after all, so why not take a little handicap to make things interesting? You’ve got an easy time weakening yourself, to the point that you’re always able to find a way to limit or suppress your powers and abilities to some degree if desired. It might be a special ability that lets you do it or easily finding devices to help out, but it’ll ensure you can still get a good scrap going. It’ll even retain some of the fun, if you’re the sort to not enjoy it when limited, letting you gain satisfaction from winning under these challenging restrictions."
100,Field “Medicine”,Akame ga Kill,"You are experienced not only with medical care, but how to use it in the middle of battle. This includes how to use it on your enemies, drugs, medicine, places to cut, what to suture you can use them to either aid or harm anyone in the middle of a fight. While it would be rather hard to apply a suture to your enemy, you do have the skill to pull it off, though it is much trickier than just attacking them."
100,Shield Wall,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim,"Since dodging in heavy armor can be difficult, it makes sense to rely on your trusty old shield to tank the blows. You're very good at using it to weather any blow you can't dodge, sometimes even using it to your advantage by directing the enemy's thrusts to make an opening. You're in fact good enough to use it even against ranged attacks, like arrows and even magic, though do keep in mind that if the shield itself is flimsy then it won't be able to take a direct hit; you're not going to be tanking dragonfire with an ordinary shield of common iron, for example. But you will get as much use as is physically possible out of that ordinary iron shield."
100,Pistol-Whipper,Full Metal Alchemist,"Shooting guns isn’t as easy as Fullmetal Alchemist may have you believe. While this won’t give you some crazy skill with guns, it’s still enough that you won’t be too far behind people like Riza Hawkeye, you are a soldier after all. Whatever type of firearm it is, even if you haven’t held it before, as long as it’s conventional, and widely used for the world you’re in, you immediately know the best way to shoot it, get great accuracy like the example above, and the ability to keep it while stressed. This starts off with the knowledge of most of the firearms used in this setting, and how to use and maintain them."
100,Defense Focused,Overlord,"You’re trained and skilled in one particular area, taking damage. Whether it's because you’re naturally tough, particularly skilled at wearing armor, or have masterful use of a shield the simple fact is you can take damage like a champ and get up from hits that would leave lesser men dazed, if not dead outright. Additionally you are particularly skilled at grabbing, and maintaining, the attention of your enemies, ensuring they waste their time targeting you when they could be better spending their time focusing on your less defensively skilled comrades. Just starting out you’ll have a level of skill at rolling with the hits that would leave you easily capable of taking on small groups of armed men, with nary a scratch to show for it, and oftentimes not a scratch at all. You’ll possess abilities geared for gaining the attention of the enemy, even if they would normally ignore you, as well as abilities geared towards intercepting the attacks of others so that they strike at you instead of their intended target. You’ll also have access to several abilities that will allow you to easily repair any damage done to your equipment.


--- (Requires Realm of Heroes): In the Realm of Heroes you’ll be taking on entire small armies of trained warriors (say a hundred or so) and will be unlikely to be injured by them to any significant degree, potentially walking away with no injuries so long as you aren’t careless. Your abilities in maintaining the attention of foes are greater, allowing you to grab the attention of many enemies at once and keep it on you with ease, as well as allowing you to easily intercept the attacks even of enemies that aren’t actually nearby. Your equipment can now be fixed in the middle of battle even as its being damaged, leaving the canny defensive fighter well suited for prolonged conflict. Additionally at this point you will be able to set a small group of allies as being ‘body-guarded’ by you. Half of any damage they would take is transferred to you, though your defensive abilities still apply to the damage in full, meaning it is likely you won’t be hurt very much if at all. ---


--- (Requires Level One Hundred): At Level One Hundred you can easily walk through entire swarms and throngs of ravenous monsters and berserker warriors and not even notice their attacks upon you. You’ll be able to get and then keep, until you allow them to focus elsewhere, the attention of any foe you engage with regardless of whether or not attacking you would be a wise course of action for them, and your equipment is now impossible to break or be damaged by any method so long as you are holding or wearing it. Your bodyguard abilities can now be applied to a massive number of people, and will intercept up to 90% of the damage that would normally have gone to them. Your defensive abilities apply in full against the damage sent your way, as normal, meaning you could potentially tank for entire raid groups all on your own. Finally you gain the Super-Move known as Invulnerable Aegis special ability. You can activate this at any time, several times per day, to render any attack made against you completely and utterly negated no matter how powerful it is. It is one of the few defenses known to be capable of fending off the Dimension Slash ability of the damage focused warrior. Naturally no matter what level you are as a defense focused warrior you’re decent at actual fighting as well, though not quite to the same extent as the magic warrior or monk, and nowhere close to the damage focused warrior. This class synergizes tremendously well with Tireless and World Champion, allowing the defense focused warrior to drag out battles near indefinitely, allowing them to benefit from regeneration, tirelessness, and slowly-increasing strength as the battle grows longer until eventually they’ll be able to batter down just about any opposition. To defeat such a warrior would require quick and overwhelming force, for in the long battle (which they would be uniquely suited to engaging in) they are a nearly insurmountable force. ---"
100,The Hunter with 7 Weapons,Duel Monsters - Shadow Realm,"You’re a fair hand with a blade, aren’t you? You have a great deal of expertise with melee weapons of almost every make and kind, being able to pick up and use any medieval weapon and use it as if you were a veteran right away!"
100,Monk Fighter,Duel Monsters - Shadow Realm,"You are a hardened warrior, you learnt how to strike and not hurt yourself. From now on, you don’t take ‘backlash’ from your bare-handed strikes, i.e if you punch a rock, you don’t get the pain from the punch itself, though if the rock punches you back it won’t protect from that."
100,Good With a Blade,Akame ga Kill,"You are particularly skilled with some type of weapon, or possibly your bare hands, well and beyond what people can reasonably expect to achieve through normal means, but not quite supernatural. Not that a supernatural level of ability is out of the question in this world, and having such skill wouldn't truly qualify as rare."
100,Huntsman Training,RWBY,You graduated from a prestigious combat academy and you have the skill to show for it. You’ve mastered the acrobatic combat that is a staple for Huntsmen and Huntresses and can hold your own against hordes of mindless Grimm
100,Spoon To The Eye!,Arifureta Shokugyou de Sekai Saikyou,"The monsters of this world are many and more dangerous than the average joe imagines, not to mention the war going on and the enmity of the fellow man. Training, all kinds of training are needed and you got it, both from your teachers and from the battlefield itself. You know your way around most weapons, be it a longsword, shortbow, mace, war-axe, war scythe, club, spear, halbert, sabre, dagger, kriegsmesser, longbow, and many, many, many more. As expected, such expertise lets you pick up new weapons and master them to some degree with more ease. Of course, your style is highly unpredictable and unorthodox, being basically created by you, but no one can deny it’s effective."
100,Combat Skill,King Arthur,"Every knight needs to know how to fight. Most are trained to use a large variety of weapons, and most have either average or below skill in each. You don't settle with average however. You have the skill to match even masters in the use of a sword, bow, and seven other melee weapons."
100,Saint-Rank Fighter,Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation,"While you might not practice one of the three famed sword styles, you are undoubtedly a capable opponent in combat, having learned and reached incredible amounts of proficiency and mastery in Saint Dragon Battle Aura Fighting-Style of the Six-Faced World that you could be considered a Saint-Rank in this Combat-Style. While this also gives you all the knowledge of the techniques of the Saint Dragon Battle Aura Fighting-Style, you only master these techniques at Saint-Rank. This elevates your Mana Reserves to the point that you can cast half a dozen Saint-Rank Spells before being exhausted along with elevating your mastery and control of your Battle Aura that it can amplify your physical capabilities to its limits allowing you to become stronger than Advance-Rank Warrior but weaker than Saint-Rank Warrior in pure stats alone. You also gained an incredible innate talent at learning and mastering any Martial Arts-Styles and Powers though this is more prominent in Unarmed Combat-Styles and Magic-Spells which would allow you to reach Saint-Rank starting scratch within three years amount time though it would be faster if you have a master to learn from or if you already have a foundation for it."
100,Saint-Ranked Warrior,Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation,"The training that you underwent since you were a child has borne fruits, and you manage to learned and reached incredible amount of proficiency and mastery in North-God, Sword-God, and Water-God Sword-Styles of the Six-Faced World such that you could be considered a Saint-Rank in this Three Sword-Styles. While this also gives you all the knowledge of the secret techniques of the Three Sword-Styles, you only master them at Saint-Rank of the said secret techniques. This elevates your Battle Aura that it can amplify your physical capabilities to extremity allowing you to rival any Saint-Rank Warrior in pure stats alone. You also gained an incredible innate talent at learning and mastering any Martial Arts-Styles though this is more prominent in Armed Martial Arts-Styles which would allow you to reach Saint-Rank starting scratch within a year’s time though it would be faster if you have a master to learn from or if you already have a foundation for it."
100,Book of Martial Arts,Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation,There are many forms of Martial Arts that existed and there those famous and unknown ones but with this book records all of it. This book has the record of all known and unknown Martial Arts Styles in this world and it also contains instructions of the training regimens for each Style which are detailed and easy to understand that it’s nearly impossible not to understand the meaning and descriptions of each Styles and training regimens. This book also records the Martial Arts Styles or something equivalent that you know or invented. Post-Jump this book automatically updates to include the Martial Arts System or Other Systems equivalent to it in the future worlds that you are in and the book has effectively infinite pages and opening to the desired page or style with just a thought.
100,Caped Combat,With This Ring,"​Fighting with super-strength is not the same as fighting with normal strength: a skilled user will rely on grapples to deny leverage rather than simply punching someone through something as soft as concrete. Likewise, fighting with super-speed, telekinesis, a danger-sense, or some other superpower demands different approaches to combat, both to fight with or against them. You have a great deal of skill fighting with and against supernatural powers and you adapt quickly when fighting with or against new powers."
100,Killed Him with a Shoe,Ender’s Game,You can make anything into a deadly weapon and instinctively know how to get the best performance out of things that actually are deadly weapons.
100,Beast of Gods,Fate/Grand Order,"Could there be any warrior more perfect? Any man more flawless? Compared to you? Not at all. At least when you’re just observing from afar, you appear to be totally without flaws or weaknesses to anyone. You're perfect in aesthetics, though you are quite handsome, but you seem to lack any weaknesses, flaws, holes in your defences or other disadvantages to onlookers. Even those who have special powers to notice such things will fail to do so. It is only after directly interacting with your weaknesses that they can uncover them, such as by noticing that you take much more damage from fire than other sorts of attacks if you have a weakness to fire. Even that will be difficult to notice however, as any injuries you take seem far less serious to your opponents, though your allies can still realise the severity if you wish them to."
100,Shinobi,Generic Naruto Fanfiction,"What with all the screaming jutsu names and giant fireballs and kaiju summoning, its like these people have entirely forgotten that ninja are supposed to be stealthy. Well, good thing you’re here to remind them. You are a true Ninja, a true ‘Old School’ shinobi. You have ungodly dexterity, patience and sheer skill at sneaking. You could sneak through a village full of ninja at high alert while wearing bright orange, and your skills at lockpicking, picking pockets, stealing, sneak attacks and the like, trades which demand stealth like this, are just as ridiculous. In addition, you no longer need to cry out any of your jutsu’s names, being able to just execute any and all of your techniques without even uttering a word. You’re also a dab hand at using the more ‘traditional’ ninja methods of dealing with people, such as poison use and various practical assassination techniques that don’t require engulfing your hand in lightning and running in a straight line at someone. Finally, while you do not gain any supernatural abilities related to stealth, you can maintain any abilities you do have in just about any condition, be it drunk, injured, or unconscious."
100,Combat Experience,That Time I Was Reincarnated as a Slime,This world is a world where the Strong eat the Weak and the Weak serve the Strong and nobody without combat experience is going to survive for long here without heroes to save them. You’ve decided not to rely on something as nebulous as a hero and learned to fight and survive by yourself and gone into a fair amount scraps whether as an Adventurer of the Freedom Association or just as a Monster trying to survive their natural environment.
100,Turtle and Crane,Dragon Ball Z,"You’ve trained in martial arts, earning the title of ‘master’, and it shows. You’ve gained mastery of at least three mundane martial arts of your choosing, and also have a knack for learning new styles. Augmenting your chosen styles with ki comes as naturally as breathing to you, though it may take some extra practice to gain such ease-of-use with ones you learn later in life."
100,The Basics,Generic Xianxia,"Mastering the basics is what makes you advanced, and you have learned the arts of combat a long time ago. As such, your fighting ability has improved. The effects are noticeable compared to a neophyte; you deal more damage, you hit more often, you evade and parry more, you hit where it hurts and it hurts less when you're hit. Ultimately you are better at finding or creating advantages when fighting. This applies whether the battle is a physical, mental, or spiritual one. Additionally you find you have an easier time grasping the basics of any new technique, skill, or ability you learn, though progression beyond the basics will be entirely up to your own time and effort."
100,Monk,Overlord,"Differently from a ‘damage focused’ warrior who chooses their body as their weapon (and is more of a brawler) the Monk focuses on skill and grace, paired with explosive physical strength. Possessing the sturdiest, most flexible, and quickest bodies of all the physical classes they excel at striking when and where it would be most effective, rather than trying to overpower their foes with sheer brute strength. Just starting out you’ll be faster, tougher, stronger, heartier, and with a greater level of finesse (with your body at least) than warriors that chose to focus on swords and armor, though such individuals may outperform you if their equipment is of exceptional quality.

--- (Requires Realm of Heroes): Within the Realm of Heroes however your skin is akin to heavy steel plate at the weakest, and your strikes land with such quickness and ferocity that many bystanders will not even realize you’ve struck until after the fact. Additionally your heartiness will have grown to the point that you could casually resist even strong poisons, and disease and infirmity of the body are a thing of the past. You’ll also possess a number of abilities of a more spiritual sort, such as eventually being able to see the invisible, strike the intangible, ignore the damage reduction of enemies, and reinforce your body, mind, and spirit to significantly superhuman levels of resilience. ---

--- (Requires Level One Hundred): At Level One Hundred your blows could crack castle walls, your fists and feet moving so fast that you do not even appear to have swung them, and your movement is so quick that even with just a casual walking pace it may seem to passersby that you are practically teleporting. Your spiritual abilities will have also struck their peak, able to ignore poisons no matter how potent, understand the hearts and minds of living beings (even if you can’t speak their language, or they yours), and your physical aging will have stopped entirely. This class synergies tremendously well with that of a ‘damage focused’ warrior that chooses their body as their weapon, granting the skill, speed, and grace of the monk alongside the overwhelming brute power of the ‘damage focused’ class. ---"
100,Sorcerous Swordsman,Overlord,"It doesn’t have to be swords actually, it could just as easily be spears, or axes, or maces, or bows, or any other singular weapon type. With that one type you have a masterful level of skill, and the skills of a passable veteran in everything else. You’re skilled enough to face any three of your peers and come out the victor, in sheer skill at least, though a disparity in quality of equipment may swing the odds for or against you and being skilled won’t help you if they’re so fast you can’t see them move, or so tough that your weapon can’t hurt them. In addition you’re well knowledgeable with magic, roughly equivalent in ability to your weapon skills, and with a particular focus on ‘buffing’ yourself to fight even better. Just starting out you’ll easily defeat any of your peers in melee except the truly skilled and specialized, and your magics will serve best to empower yourself (or your friends) to allow you to close the gap even then. Your breadth of knowledge about so many different weapon types allows you a flexibility rarely seen in even professional soldiers and gladiators.

--- (Requires Realm of Heroes): In the Realm of Heroes you could effortlessly defeat entire warrior bands on your lonesome with nothing but pure skill, and your magics to empower yourself could let you come out of such encounters without so much as a single scratch, nor even a shortness of breath. ---


--- (Requires Level One Hundred): At Level One Hundred you’ll be able to regularly defeat entire armies of soldiers with nothing but sheer skill alone, often times while giving them a handicap of only using one arm, and your magics could empower you to such heights that if you truly pressed yourself you might rival the armies of a whole nation of regular men, assuming they were all in one place and didn’t run away once they saw you get really moving. Don’t think that this will trivialize a fight against a peer of equivalent level and strength without considerable effort on your part however, broadness of skill often times is trumped by specialization for good reason after all. ---"
100,Magic Warrior,Overlord,"You’re skilled in magic as well as swordplay. It’s not really on the same level as your physical abilities but you’re not exactly a slouch either. You’re particularly decent at spells meant to debuff or otherwise hinder large groups of low-level foes, as well as spells designed to force singular opponents into unfavorable positions that you can then take advantage of. Additionally you’re skilled enough with both your magic and physical abilities such that you can easily make use of both even in chaotic melee. That said your magic is best put to use putting your foes into unfavorable positions or forcing them to face you where you are strong and they are weak, don’t expect to be blasting armies out of existence with this. Starting out you can easily best small groups of trained warriors via a combination of both might and magic, easily channeling your foes into unfavorable situations and footing in order to take solid advantage of them. You possess magic capable of weaving illusory effects, as well as more physical magics such as changing the consistency of the ground (such as from hard earth to soft mud) or causing negative effects such a grease or sleet to form where you desire. Your magics and abilities that directly target your enemies focus mostly on slowing them down and sowing confusion, often via dazzling them with bright lights, flashes, sounds, and so forth. You naturally have the ability to channel these sorts of powers through your weapon, allowing you to inflict these effects as you hit your foes.

--- (Requires Realm of Heroes): In the Realm of Heroes you could trivially defeat large groups of trained warriors. You could easily sow confusion amongst their ranks via the crafting of illusions, such that they see everyone as an enemy, or everyone as an ally, or for single targets literal confusion as they are stuck by spells that leave them incapable of telling real from unreal or up from down. Induction of vertigo, poisoning, curses, literally slowing people, and even petrification are all possible at this level, and you can even haste yourself. Naturally your melee skills are top notch at this point as well, capable of easily taking advantage of the openings your magic makes in order to make easy kills. Even without the benefit of your magic though your skill is nothing to complain about, easily the equal or superior of anyone that isn’t a damage focused warrior or monk of a peer level to you. ---

--- (Requires Level One Hundred): At Level One Hundred you’ll be able to make literal topographical changes to the nearby terrain, creating gullies, small lakes, pitfalls, cliffs, and more. Your illusions are so powerful that it is virtually impossible to see through them without specific prepared counters, and the debuffs you can layer onto your enemies run the entire gamut of negative status effects, even including potential instant death, and can even hit large swathes of enemies all at once. Additionally your lower-leveled debuffs and effects become passive abilities, allowing you to layer such debilitations onto anyone you strike with your weapon without the need to actually expend mana in the casting. At this level your sword skills are near peerless, easily the equal of your magics, and outside of other peer level warriors it is unlikely you’ll ever meet someone that can give you true challenge in melee. A Magic Warrior benefits tremendously from the knowledge of strategy and tactics that comes with The Long Game, allowing them to effortlessly direct their spells, attentions, and technique in such a fashion as to hinder their enemies into near-inability to act, leaving the Magic Warrior free to take action at their own direction and at their own pace. ---"
100,Damage Focused,Overlord,"You’re trained and skilled in one particular area, dealing damage. You have focused on a singular weapon type to the exclusion of all else (your body can be your weapon), and are at the level of a grand master with it. You could easily best any seven of your peers in sheer skill alone, though skill may not help you if the differences in equipment or physical ability are too far out of your favor. Regardless of that however is your sheer ability to deal raw, unrelenting, damage with your chosen weapon. You’ll be able to pierce through armor with it, deal devastating blows, and cause massive amounts of critical damage to your enemies. Just starting out you’ll be able to slay small groups of trained soldiers with relative ease, and so long as you’re careful you’re unlikely to take any damage of note. You’ll possess a number of special abilities designed for striking with more power, increasing your accuracy, dealing considerably greater critical damage, as well for determining potential weaknesses in a foe.

--- (Requires Realm of Heroes): In the Realm of Heroes you could easily enough defeat the garrison of an entire castle single handedly, and your special abilities have increased even further. Aside from more powerful versions of your previous skills you will also possess the ability to deal wounds that resist natural healing efforts, may ignore the damage resistance of enemies, and in addition you will have learned several methods to allow you to blow through the prepared defenses of a magic caster. ---


--- (Requires Level One Hundred): At Level One Hundred your skills are virtually unmatched when it comes to the slaying of others. You could casually defeat entire armies of men and beasts without even batting an eyelash, and even beings of legendary martial prowess will find themselves merely your peers, at best. Your special abilities are even more powerful, and additionally you may now deal wounds that prevent both natural and magical methods of healing, as well as forcing weaknesses in creatures and enemies that do not normally have them. You’ll also possess the ability to strike at range, well outside of melee, through either air pressure or the simple force of your martial prowess (your choice). Finally you will have unlocked the most devastating of all direct damage abilities. The Super-Move, Dimensional Slash (or pierce/smash). With this technique you will be able to, several times per day, deliver strikes so devastating that they travel across dimensions, bypassing virtually every single defensive measure known. Armor fails, toughness fails, magic fails. Only pure skill and dodging will save your foes from this technique and with this ability before you virtually anything can be killed. Pointedly it does not prevent foes from being resurrected. A damage focused warrior benefits tremendously from also training in defense focus, as their increased knowledge and skill in defensive ability serves only to heighten their knowledge at exploiting the defenses of others. ---"
100,Total Concentration Breathing (Breathing),Demon Slayer,"Requires Total Concentration Breathing

Of course, this baseline assumes you’re practicing an established style...but with an additional purchase of this Perk, you develop you’ll achieved Pillar-level mastery of something more unique, a signature style of sword-fighting that may very well be yours and yours alon."
100,Total Concentration Breathing,Demon Slayer,"Requires Total Concentration Breathing (Breathing)

Buying this Perk a third time, you are the progenitor and grandmaster of a complete fighting style on par with the Breath of the Sun itself - hell, if may not even be a sword-based fighting style. This will allow you to teach others your style as well and like the Breath of the Sun, there will be enough material for other skilled fighters to develop their own variations of it."
100,Marksmanship,Justice League Unlimited,"Although guns might not work against a lot of the supernatural threats you’ll face in this world, it’s still a good idea to know how to use one just in case you come across a regular guy who wants to blow your head off or if you manage to acquire a powerful alien blaster. For 50cp you’ll be able to use either modern weapons like guns, rocket launchers, and grenades, or antiquated weapons like bows and spears as well as a highly trained soldier of the proper era. If you spend 100cp you'll become one of the most accurate individuals on earth with ranged weaponry. Not quite as good a marksmen as someone like Deadshot, Vigilante, or even Captain Boomerange, but with just a few years of practice or experience your skills can equal these legendary heroes and villains."
100,Jutsu Technique (C Rank),Naruto,"For 100 CP, you know a C-rank jutsu like Lee’s Drunken Fist."
200,Way of the Bat,DCEU,"Gadgets and powers can work on their own but adding in martial training will multiply their effectiveness several times over. You learnt since childhood the ways of beating other men into the dirt and making sure that they don’t get back up. You’ve become extremely skilled in several forms of martial arts, covering both unarmed combat, weapon usage and how to effectively use any devices or powers you have gained here in combat. A super strong brawler might be scary but that’s nothing compared to a super strong master martial artist."
200,LET’S MURDER SOMEONE,Medaka Box Abnormal,"A bunch of knives, a spear, a sword, a rocket launcher, a club larger than your actual body- how the heck are you fitting all of this under your clothes? It’s almost like you have some sort of pocket dimension through which to store a truck’s worth of size inside the hidden spots on your body. In reality, you’re just supernaturally good at hiding things on your body, even if the space is inside your mouth or under your armpit. You still have the weight of the things hidden on you but they are entirely undetectable and able to be instantly withdrawn when you desire it, as well as working as an incredibly effective training weight system that will rapidly train your physical strength and speed. ALL ABOUT ME- 200"
200,Combat Analysis,Toaruverse,"Having fought for hundreds of battles you gained preternatural ability to analyze and exploit the weakness of your enemies, at glance you can roughly guess to overall power of a person or group. The longer the fight or the more you stare them the more you can guess their weakness and the full extent of their powers even they haven’t showed it which is very accurate. The stronger you are the faster you can analyze the strength and weakness of everyone and if the gap is too great between you and you’re target you can instantly know everything about your opponents. This also applies to technology or any constructs that you want to find its structural weakness."
200,Not the Head!,To Love-Ru,"Your defensive skills seem to increase whenever you are in actual danger of death or permanent harm, proportionate to how high or immediate this danger is. Evading a sword slash may become easier than evading a punch."
200,Fists of Modern Fury,Petals of Reincarnation,"Sealing the deal? Pshaw, you’ll do more than that. You’ve got the talent and skill to make yourself far beyond what even world class martial artists consider possible here. Barehanded against a squad or three of highly trained, fully loaded Special Forces operatives? They’d been scraping their remains off the wall, quite literally, whilst you’d waltz out of there whistling away. Not only are you a brilliant martial artist, your martial arts also manage to hurt people regardless of the weird abilities they have. It won’t bypass durability or the natural material of their bodies, so don’t try to punch some kind of slime person, but they can’t negate your martial moves with any kind of esoteric ability. They won’t be rewriting the past to get rid of any bruises you’ve given them or using supernatural shields to stop your kicks reaching them."
200,Tank,Generic Gamer,"You were born to be a tank. No, not an army tank — a game-style tank, focused around taking the enemy’s hits so your friends don’t have to. It’s not necessarily that you’re tough, though you very well may be — attacks and hostile effects just seem to have less effect on you. Swords nick rather than slice, electricity treats you like you’re made of rubber, altered gravity has a fifth the effect on you that it should, and so on; it’s pretty weird how resilient you are to everything, but it’s exclusively beneficial, so who cares? It’s not just a matter of being able to take a bunch of hits without going down, though — you know how to redirect strikes to do the least damage to you they can. And, somehow, you’re not only able to enrage your enemies so they attack you rather than anyone else, but you’re able to do the same thing to their attacks, drawing them towards you regardless of their initial target so long as you’re within range"
200,DPS,Generic Gamer,"That stands for ‘damage per second’, by the way. Something you’re great at dishing out. You have a knack for using your powers and abilities offensively, such that you could use even normally non-lethal powers totally new to you to deadly effect, as if you’d practiced with them for decades. You not only have an intuitive grasp of what sort of attacks would be most harmful to a particular enemy, but you’re able to spot weaknesses and chinks in their armor with ease; if that weren’t enough, your attacks seem to actively seek out their targets — and their weak points, if they have any — of their own accord. Your attacks seem to move faster and take less out of you, sword swings ignoring air resistance and fireballs requiring less fuel. Furthermore, your attacks seem to at least partially ignore defenses; this means that they do more damage than they otherwise would, sure, but it also enables you to hurt people with what they’re normally immune to, even when it doesn’t make sense, poisoning someone without a body or burning a fire elemental."
200,Specialist,Naruto,"Every ninja no matter what, specializes in at least one area. Some specialize in ninjutsu, some specialize in genjutsu, and some in fūinjutsu. Specialists possess far greater power and skill than those not specialized in their chosen area. For each purchase of this perk, you can become exceptionally good at learning your chosen specialization. For example, one who picks fūinjutsu would have the potential to equal the greatest of the Uzumaki Clan with the proper training, while those who pick genjutsu could eventually rival Itachi Uchiha himself even with his Sharingan. This purchase bestows all the relevant knowledge and information needed and allows for a beginner to learn everything related to your chosen specialty in a fraction of the time it would normally take. The narrower the focus of your specialization, the faster you learn. This perk can be purchased multiple times, and you can mix specialties for free, such as making a Nin-Taijutsu specialization, but you have to purchase the specialties you want to mix and fuse in order to do so. Barring medical ninjutsu, you can purchase any specialty. For specialties that have multiple different styles, like taijutsu and kenjutsu, you can choose what style you want, such as kenjutsu in either the iai-focused samurai style or Killer B’s multi-bladed style or focusing on the Strong Fist or the Gentle Fist for taijutsu. For those who want to purchase multiple styles, they get a discount, but only if they are purchasing different styles for the same specialty."
200,Specialist - Kenjutsu,Naruto,"Every ninja no matter what, specialises in at least one area. Some specialise in ninjutsu, some specialise in genjutsu, and some in fuinjutsu. Specialists possess far greater power and skill than those not specialised in their chosen area. For each purchase of this perk, you can become exceptionally good at learning your chosen specialization. For example,  one who picks fuinjutsu would have the potential to equal the greatest of the Uzumaki Clan with the proper training, while those who pick genjutsu could eventually rival Itachi Uchiha himself even with his Sharingan. This purchase bestows all the relevant knowledge and information needed and allows for a beginner to learn everything related to your chosen specialty in a fraction of the time it would normally take. The narrower the  focus of your specialization, the faster you learn. This perk can be purchased multiple times, and you can mix specialities for free, such as making a Nin-Taijutsu specialization, but you have to purchase the specialities you want to mix and fuse in order to do so. Barring medical ninjutsu, you can purchase any specialty."
200,Master Monk,Duel Monsters - Shadow Realm,"Day in and day out training has allowed youcombat reflexes that are unmatched by any other’s! When you’re attacking with your bare hands, you could strike with twice the amount of speed as normal, performing two blows in the time it’d take for you to normally land one!"
200,Instinct of Doug,Rune Factory,"So when it comes to combat, monsters are pretty tough to beat, especially ones that you aren’t familiar with. From now when you’re fighting an enemy, you’ll innately know the extent of their abilities and how strong they are. You learn attack patterns, weaknesses, variants, resistances, you name it. As you fight them and win, you become better at taking them down or killing them, even if you shouldn’t be. While this does help you in combat, this doesn’t give you any combat skills or help you to exploit the knowledge you actually have, this just gets you a way to not die within the first 12 seconds or so."
200,Combat Savant,Sekirei,You’re a lot better at fighting than people might think. Using weapons or your fists will have quite a bit more impact against your enemies. You’re light footed and quick to react in combat related situations too.
200,Fist over Hand,Marvel Cinematic Universe Vol. 2,"There is a special power that granted to only those the monks of K’un L’un deem worthy. It is a gift from Heaven itself, that grants one the potential to become so much more than a mere human and to walk with great purpose in their life. But it’s doubtful you want to be stuck with such a burden, so instead let’s work around that and offer this power for a price. Upon purchase, this grants you the ability to collect, harness, and train the mystical force of Chi. This power comes from within and can be used for a myriad of effects including healing others of wounds and poison, increasing one’s strength and reflexes, and even enhanced control over the functions of one’s body. More effects will inevitably be unlocked as you train, with prior effects being able to grow to new heights."
200,Senjutsu,Highschool DxD,"While magic and mana are the universal constants of this world, and magical systems are different ways of utilizing it, other energies and practices do exist in this world. This trick in particular allows you to control and harness your own vitality into an energy called ‘ki’, which when concentrated will strengthen your physical form considerably, letting your fists and feet strike much harder against foes. In addition, it lets you read and sense the ‘ki’ of others, letting you read and predict movements and spy on the enemy’s current state from a distance. Take a deep breath, because now this power is yours to command."
200,Kyokushin Karate,The God of Highschool,"Otherwise known as Full Contact Karate, it is one of the most popular Martial Arts in the whole world, having many millions of practitioners counted and likely even more uncounted. The version you have learnt is far above the normal art that is taught however. You have learnt the Four Pillars techniques, moves that involve the manipulation and enhancement of your life energy to create incredibly destructive blows or blasts or energy. You could even unlock the final secret technique in time, built on using all Four Pillar moves in concert to hit with the force of an entire mountain."
200,Revival Taekwondo,The God of Highschool,"also called Re-Taekwondo, was South Korea’s answer to this. Created by Taejin Jin with WTF Taekwondo as a base, it focused on eliminating what weaknesses remained in Northern style and enhancing the art as a whole with stealth techniques. A perfect counter to the Northern style, it progressed greatly under the hands of its founder, with techniques to manipulate air pressure or apply the force of singular attacks multiple times over being created."
200,Who Needs a Sword?,The God of Highschool,"Not you, that’s for sure. A lot of Martial Arts might seem to need weapons or be made for unarmed use but you’ve realised that it’s all just a manner of perspective. Make a flat palm and swing it around really fast and you might as well be using a sword. You’ve got the ability to be able to use Martial Arts techniques that require a weapon or require not using a weapon with the opposite instead. Your sword techniques can be used with empty hands and your unarmed martial arts can be translated easily into forms that you can utilise with a sword, spear or other weapon. Whilst this ability works instantaneously, the translated techniques will be less powerful until you can actually train their use for a bit to recover that power. And anything that actually does require a specific weapon, such as an ability or move unique to a single sword, cannot be translated to the opposite format with this."
200,Team ABC,The God of Highschool,"You and the other Judges may work often as solo agents but you’re real strength comes out when all of you are fighting in tandem. Rather than spend time hashing out a battle plan in the midst of a running conflict, you and anyone fighting on your side on a small scale will just innately know what each member of the party can and can’t do and what action they’re about to take. You’ll work together like you’ve been fighting partners for decades, even if you’ve only met each other a few times. When you’re off the clock, there’s no guarantee you’ll get along with whoever’s on your side in the slightest but when it comes time to get serious, you’ll always be able to put behind you any grudges and work with your allies, as they will be able to do the same for you."
200,Limit Break,Arifureta Shokugyou de Sekai Saikyou,"You have been gifted with one of the most useful skills that there could be. The ability to multiply all your stats for brief periods of time. A trump card when facing tough opponents. While it starts as a x3 multiplier for mere five minutes, with time and training you will become able to unlock more powerful versions that last longer and boosts you further."
200,Mechanised Martial Arts,Infinite Stratos,"A lot of people might think that putting years of your life into learning martial arts is pointless when you only fight in a mecha suit anyway. You’re here to prove that yes, wrestling is indeed a viable form of mecha on mecha combat, regardless of what the haters say. You’ve got a great enough mastery over one style of martial arts, armed or unarmed, to be able to win national competitions with ease and better yet, you can perfectly translate this martial art to any giant robot you pilot. If you know other forms of fighting, you can still learn to translate them this way, but it’ll take a lot more time."
200,Importance of Control,Dragon Ball,"This is a lesson that so few warriors in this world truly learn - knowing when to hold back or use restraint. When you can shatter stone like glass or move faster than the wind, the world around you feels just a little more fragile. You’ve gained a sense for when your strength or powers will overwhelm someone or something, and the ability to make your blows non-lethal before impact, sparing unnecessary casualties and merely knocking them out - injured, but alive. This control also lets you greatly reduce if not eliminate the risk of collateral damage, preventing it before it truly happens."
200,Only What You Need,Dragon Ball,"How do you make it look so effortless?! When you dodge or strike at an enemy, you’re able to do with incredibly efficient movements, only using the muscle power and telegraphing the absolute minimum of your movements. This lets you enjoy a boost of speed and dexterity, as well as conserve much more stamina than you could normally in a long battle. As a bonus, this can let you look casual and collected in battle, which is impressive to those who watch it."
200,KILLING IMPULSE,Medaka Box Abnormal,"Born to kill, you’re better than anyone can be at it. You’ve got an instinctual desire to kill everything you see but unlike Munakata, you are in full control of this desire. The benefits you gain? That same desire results in an effortless mastery of every form of killing. You are naturally talented in the extreme at all forms of combat, assassination and murder and find it even easier to improve your talents to greater, physics-defying degrees such as becoming good enough with a sword to cut through sound. You are also exceptionally good at avoiding being killed, knowing exactly how to maximally reduce the damage you take from blows, even if you can only shift a few inches at the time."
200,Innate Talent - Martial Arts Prodigy,Overlord,"This probably doesn’t do what you’re thinking. In this world ‘martial arts’ are known as “a warrior’s magic” and are special skills and abilities that warriors (in general, not just people with the Warrior origin) can learn in order to empower themselves and perform supernatural feats. This talent enables you to learn ‘martial arts’ in half the time it would normally require and additionally allows you to activate twice as many martial arts at a time than would otherwise be normal (a legendary warrior might normally be able to activate as many as seven at once, for example, whereas at the same level you would be able to activate fourteen at once). This also reduces the stamina cost of ‘martial arts’ to half of what thewould otherwise be. If people learned you had this talent, and you actually practiced to take advantage of it, you would be hailed as a mighty hero. Example ‘martial arts’ include increased magic resistance, resistance to mind influencing spells, increased physical prowess, amplified speed, the ability to analyze and identify weaknesses in others, the ability to have perfect knowledge of everything within a three meter radius of yourself, the ability to completely nullify the physical force behind a single strike, the ability to hit multiple targets with a single strike, extremely short term (a few seconds at most) combat precognition, and so on. The more powerful the martial art the longer it takes to learn and the more stamina it takes to use."
200,Unnatural Skill,Percy Jackson,"Whether from your heritage or just being that good you've got one particular mundane skill that your feats with border on supernatural. Whether you're a smith on the level of the Cyclopses, a near prescient tactician or a swordsman who is ny unstoppable with a blade your feats will be legendary. You are on a level within your skill such that only other beings of legend can hope to match you. This may be taken multiple times. You may not choose magic but you may choose a particular application of magic if you have it already (so curses, enchanting might work, more specific gets a bigger boost)."
200,Old is Gold,Full Metal Alchemist,"While yes, the only major differences between this world and ours may seem to be just the automail, and the alchemy, there is one other difference. You see, in this world, many of the combatants are what you would call superhuman. Their speed, strength, and endurance is enough to take shots that would kill normal men, do leaping backflips, and pull off the most ridiculous feats of Ninja-like(sometimes literally) balance and dexterity. You too, are no different. You’re a master of close combat on the level of Fon, or king Bradey without the use of his Ultimate Eye. You’re easily able to cut down or beat up scores of men with melee, and if you had superhuman strength or durability, you would be capable of taking on entire armed forces including the armor. To add to this, age does not diminish your abilities in the slightest, and you’re just as dangerous aged into your elder years as you are when you’re but a youth."
200,Total Concentration Breathing,Demon Slayer,"Oh, now it gets interesting. After a certain point, training your body in the classical sense just doesn’t make fighting demons any easier. But! Fret not, because with this, you’re now a practitioner of a Breath Style; at the core of this technique, whatever it happens to be for you, is specialized patterns of breathing combined with precise movements of your blade, evoking something elemental or natural with each technique. At first, this simply makes you a fair fight for your average demon - not the Twelve, certainly, but someone who’s had a few good meals in their lifetime - thanks to your expanded stamina, heavily-oxygenated muscles,  and precisely stylized strikes. You’ll never break a blade (or spear, or mace, or whatever else you fight with) because of a bad swing again, and as your lungs grow stronger, so do you. "
200,Jutsu Technique (B Rank),Naruto,"For 200 CP, you know a B-rank jutsu like Kurenai’s Tree Binding Death."
250,Holocron Collection,Star Wars the Clone Wars,"Small techno-organic devices that contain all the information you need to train someone into a Jedi or Sith apprentice. The holocrons hold basic information about the Jedi and Sith orders, along with instructions for how to build and use lightsabers, and how to harness and wield the force."
300,Blasterslinger,Star Wars the Clone Wars,"You gain an affinity for unconventional weapons and impractical methods of weapon wielding. You easily fire guns akimbo, wield two double-bladed swords at once, and fire typically inaccurate weapons with extreme precision."
300,Ssam Su Takkyeon,The God of Highschool,"Created by Park Il-Tae and Mastered by his grandson Park Il-Pyo, Ssam Su Takkyeon was built as a combination of Re-Taekwondo and Practical Takkyeon, using the latter to overcome the weaknesses of the former. It holds all the strengths, speeds and techniques of Re Taekwondo but adds in the special skills to forcibly control the momentum of the opponent’s body, ways to negate the force of opponent’s attacks while striking back at them and even the ability to ignite the air around the user’s blows by grinding their fists or feet against another surface."
300,Dracule Swordsmanship,One Piece: New World,"Few have taken their mastery of the sword to the levels you have, able to turn a butter knife into a deadly weapon, and capable of cutting through steel. With this mastery, you are able to swing your sword with such precision that you can use the very air as a way to extend your attacks, with none of the force behind it lost."
300,Master Combatant,Arrowverse,"You're proficient in various types of fighting styles, and can more than hold your own against your opponents. Thanks to your experience and training you're able to fight multiple people at once. You've styled your fighting styles of self-defense, offense, grappling, and take-downs after your many mentors. You're an outstanding weapon combatant as well, able to hold your own against the best with nearly any weapon. Your aim is such that with any ranged weapons, you're able to shoot 6 bouncing tennis balls without missing, shoot objects off of people without harming them and shoot with deadly accuracy even while in motion. You can also accurately anticipate an enemy projectile to shoot it down and fire multiple arrows with a bow or throw multiple knives at once. Your skill with melee weapons are enough to hold your own against several skilled opponents, or overwhelm a single skilled opponent. You've received training in all melee weapons, and are equally skilled in them all. You could easily be one the best in the League of Assassins."
300,Jutsu Technique (A Rank),Naruto,"For 300 CP, you know an A-rank jutsu like the Chidori."
400,School of Hard Knocks,Generic Fist Jump,"You have experience with real combat, not just training or tournament fighting. This has sharpened your instincts, letting you quickly find an opponent’s weaknesses and patterns, as well as concealing your own. You are impossible to trick with a feint, and are always aware of your surroundings."
400,Fought Wars In The Ring,Generic Fist Jump,"Some people say violence never solves anything. That just isn’t true. Whether it is beating some common decency into a thug, or winning the Cold War with a boxing match, you can influence people in a variety of ways through the act of hurting someone. This is more effective when applied directly, but if the fight is suitably epic, even spectators can find their views and opinions changed."
400,Hakuda Master,Bleach,"With all the swords being swung around, it might not be surprising to see how limited in knowledge many are with martial arts. Even the Hollows tend to abandon these skills, despite how brutally effective they can be. You’ve gained a mastery of multiple such arts, leaving you equivalent in skill to Yoruichi or Sui-Feng in the ways of beating the shit out of everyone with bare hands and feet. Your mastery of Hakuda makes you a deadly combatant, with a variety of techniques involved. From straightforward offense moves that increase your direct power to a variety of utility techniques for enhanced mobility or endurance. Your martial arts are particularly suited for taking on multiple foes at once, letting you largely negate the advantages by slipping between and playing them against each other. You might not win a fight you otherwise couldn’t but it can let one Captain safely drag out a battle with several other Captain or Vice-Captain level opponents. Lastly, as is rather needed given the ubiquity of swords, you excel at working around armed opponents. Disarming them or just using that unwieldy weapon to their disadvantage, you pretty much nullify the benefit they’d normally claim from being armed while you are not."
400,Nabong Needle Ryu,The God of Highschool,"Created by Na Bong-Chim, this style is weaponised acupuncture, fighting using the pressure points of the enemy and yourself. Working with both needles and bare fingers, the user can weaken his opponents, stop their bodies from functioning right or cause paralysis, cause massive internal damage with light pokes and manipulate the body’s functions such as stopping blood flow or making the enemies body explode from the inside out. The art also focuses on how the user can enhance their own body. Thus it can neutralise incoming techniques that rely on pressure points or similar parts, stop the user’s ability to feel pain, boosting their strength and speed greatly and allowing them to fight under even heavy wounds to their body and the greatest technique of the Nabong Ryu- the removal of the body’s limiters. By releasing a certain point in the brain, this technique multiplies the physical powers and life energy that their body can output but at the cost of immense rebound damage to their body once the limiter removal runs out. To use this technique requires the consumption of a Sage Pill, a mystical fruit from the Sage Realm, something that threatens the lives of even a human on the level of The Six, as it was only meant for the consumption of Demons and Gods."
400,Saint of the Sword,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim,"This isn’t something seen all that much anymore now is it? Perhaps you found an old Redguard who still remembered the art, or your parents taught you, regardless you now possess the abilities of a Sword Singer and more impressively the burgeoning power of an Ansei. Ansei are able to manifest a Spirit Sword with some effort, though without training it’s not all that practical in battle. Right now you’re weak in comparison to the masters of old, though able to scythe through lowly bandits and forest animals you’ll struggle greatly against foes of greater skill and power for the time being. Given time great power, that some would say rivals even magic is possible, ranging from creating shockwaves from your blows to magical storms. As a final note, the greater your skill with the blade the greater your ability with Shehai or Spirit Sword will be."
400,Kaminote Blow,Duel Monsters - Shadow Realm,"A wise karate mouse taught you this ability, in exchange for a warm meal and a soft bed. This martial arts technique focuses all of your striking power into a single knuckle. This may be hard to land due to the small amount of contact you can make with the knuckle, but if it lands it can break through the mightiest defenses in this land, crippling and defeating even heroic warriors in a single attack, and making titantic beasts like the Blue Eyes stumble or even fall upon impact."
400,Mach Speed,Akame ga Kill,"You have trained and fought developing your body and reflexes such that you can run and fight at the speed of sound. Not that dodging bullets is the rarest of skills here, but you are nearly as fast as the fastest people around."
400,Brodik’s Utility,Rune Factory,"So it turns out that you can’t just get into fights if you are absolutely horrible at utilizing your equipment. Honestly, that should probably be a no brainer as far as your concerned. From now on everything that you can use in combat: Melee weapons, ranged weapons, midrange weapons, explosives, armor, accessories, allies, vehicles, giant golems, or whatever else you might you might want, you are able to use it at 100 percent efficiency and effectiveness as long as you are able to wield it. Have a rusted sword? No problem, that is good for taking on a boss if you hit the right spots, and using better weapons increases your odds. If there were weapons or armor that would normally be impossible for you to use, you are now able to wield them at the cost of 100 times the base energy cost for that item. Even if you were to find a weapon from a far-off land that was unlike anything you have ever seen before, you could figure it out just by picking it up. This also extends to your body, awakened and dormant powers you possess, or anything else. Go nuts."
400,Musashi Miyamoto,Petals of Reincarnation,"The famed dual wielding swordsman from Japan, though it seems that he became something altogether quite monstrous as he grew in age and skill. When activated, this power grants the user a transformed state resembling that of a black skinned devil. Possessing twelve arms, each with a supernaturally sharp sword, the state bestows superhuman strength and speed onto the user. Musashi is able to move faster than the human eye can track and cut with enough force that the mere air pressure of the blade’s swings will be enough to cut through castle walls. You also gain all the immense skill of Musashi at wielding the 12 katanas you now hold, making you a legendarily good swordfighter."
400,Morning Hope/Evening Despair,King Arthur,"From the brightest mornings to the darkest nights you shine to the people under your command. With a strong will, and the skill to inspire anyone who cares to listen to your words you are a leader to be feared by those who oppose you. Above all however is the unique ability you possess. You can, through force of will make any weapon you touch emit a blinding light or an obscure darkness capable of obliterating your enemies. Though exhausting at first with use the force of will required to use this ability will lessen. Eventually you might destroy castles with a single blow or even cut down a mountain."
400,Dead Eye,Red Dead Redemption 2,"The Gunslinger. The Trick Shot. The Dead Eye. You are a master shot, able to draw and let loose a firestorm of lead with incredible accuracy faster than just about any man, with a predilection for headshots. What’s more, at times you are able to slow your perception of time to a crawl, allowing you to see the vital areas on your enemies and more easily select your shots, whether it be to disarm or to kill. Those who duel you are fools, and those that try to kill you are dead men walking."
400,Grandmaster of Combat,Young Justice,"You’ve mastered nearly every melee and ranged weapon known to man, and you can keep up with skilled fighters like Batman and Deathstroke- and with even more time and training to hone yourself, you may even surpass them. You also learn fighting techniques quicker, especially when taught by a skilled teacher."
400,Fight On!,The God of Highschool,"Losing a limb can be a fatal sentence for a Martial Artist. The innumerable problems such as lacking a limb and the permanent change in balance would retire all but the best Martial Artists and even those prodigal talents would find themselves severely hampered by that loss. Some learn how to deal with this loss and you’re the best among them. You are able to instantly adjust your fighting style to any sort of damage or loss of body part, never losing effectiveness until you are completely immobilised. Even having a single limb left would let you fight as if you had all four. Having all your arms and legs off might stop you...until a few seconds later when you figure how to fling yourself around with your hips and smash your foes to death with your head. And over time, you may even learn to turn these losses to an advantage, discovering ways to cut down on inefficiencies and strengthen your style after losing the crutches that others call limbs."
400,Immense Skill,That Time I Was Reincarnated as a Slime,"You’re as skilled in a weapon of your choosing as the Sword Saint Hakurou is skilled at a sword. As long as it’s using your weapon, you could handily always “thread the needle” with an almost perfect success rate and anyone you teach is likely to quickly reach at least B-Rank and beyond through mere skill alone. If they go on to become people of import then your own legend grows as theirs grow, for is the one who taught such impressive people not far more impressive than they?"
400,To Slay A God,DCEU,"You’ve got the training fitting for a being raised to kill gods. Thousands of years of practice in every kind of warfare, strategy and weaponry, short of the modern firearms of mankind. This skill is such that you can keep up with people tens of time stronger and faster than you, making up for your lack of strength and speed. You’re the greatest fighter on the planet, with only a single equal in the form of the Amazonian princess Diana. At least in terms of raw skill."
400,Classic Assassin,Akame ga Kill,"You aren't like a lot of the assassins around here, where they break their way in and slaughter everyone, you are skilled at the more subtle skills of assassination. Stealthy entry, properly integrating yourself within an organization, or observing a target for times when they are at their weakest, and then fulfilling your mission with either poison or a careful and stealthy blade. You are a master of proper assassination, and though this doesn't give you much in the way of combat ability(mostly just knowledge of vitals and poisons), you are skilled enough to rack up one of the most impressive kill counts around."
400,Jutsu Technique (S Rank),Naruto,And for 400 CP you know an S-rank jutsu such as the Hiraishin. A jutsu with no associated rank can instead be purchased using mastery with D-rank equaling new Academy graduate levels of ability while S-rank equals Kage-level ability.
600,Six Powers,One Piece: New World,"A superhuman martial arts style, a master of the style will have the strength of a hundred men. Hardening the body to become iron-like, relaxing the body to act like paper in the wind, poking with the force of a firearm, kicking the ground hard enough to dash at speeds that can’t be tracked, kicking with enough force and precision to turn the air into a blade, and kicking off the air so hard that it gives the illusion of flight. These are the basic powers offered, with time and training allowing the use of combinations of these and even being able to learn a secret Seventh Power."
600,Sniper King,One Piece: New World,"Capable of near impossible feats of marksmanship, you are able to hit any target within your line of sight with pinpoint accuracy and the reflexes to match. As an example, you could hit an apple off of someone’s head a mile away with only a slingshot if you only had normal human sight and one working eye. No one is safe from your reach."
600,Champion of Skyrim,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim,"If there was a Fighter’s Guild in Skyrim you’d almost assuredly be its champion. The skill and talent you have for battle is tremendous and fits more in the legendary tales of Ysgramor or possibly even Pelinal Whitestrake than it does reality. To you fighting is an art, an art you’ve mastered, weaving men’s innards like a tapestry with your sword and spear is as easy as dancing your way through the frontlines of a bloody battle without taking a single blow, while felling many of the enemy with ease. As a final boon and to ensure your body can keep up with your skill, your physical form is enhanced further and you’ll find that spending hours upon hours hacking your way through enemies is no issue, nor will shrugging off many wounds. You’re already the stuff Heroes are said to be made of when it comes to the martial way, and yet it seems you’ve still got room to grow. I wonder, how will future generations look back on someone such as you?"
600,Hougetsu Jigen-tou,Rosario + Vampire,"The Youjutsu Moon dimension sword technique lets you use your bare hand as a weapon. This works by ""Delaying your existence"" allowing users of this technique can cut through virtually anything. It works like a saw that can come and go through dimensions. Experts in this technique can manage 100 repetitions a second. You can only do 10. Those who have mastered it can use it to phase through solid objects for a short period of time."
600,The Eight Gates,Naruto,"The Eight Gates are special points in the body that exist to control the flow of chakra within the body. Ordinarily, a person could use no more than 20% of their potential in order to prevent the body from harming itself. With training, an individual can learn to release these limiters, increasing their strength and speed. By taking this perk, you can now open all Eight Gates and survive unlike in canon. You will, however, be incapacitated for a minimum of six months unless you possess a regenerative factor that can counteract your injuries."
600,Lone Wolf,Duel Monsters - Shadow Realm,"They say an unarmed man on his own is powerless before REAL strength in this world, that magic and might beyond a mortal human would fell such a man. But you know that willpower alone can overcome everything, at least for a while. During battle, you can enter the state known as “Lone Wolf”, where you are able to heavily resist the effects of magic and physical damage being greatly mitigated during the fight - blows that would shatter your bones merely bruise, magical firestorms lightly singing you instead of reducing you to ash. However, once you enter this state you will be forced to keep it up until the fighting is over, and when the fight does end you’ll lose this benefit. Still, through your will and this technique, you could truly outshine a magician for at least long enough to kill them with your bare hands. Just take care - even with this durability, injuries can add up quickly."
600,Natural Killer,Akame ga Kill,"Regardless of any clumsiness or other issues, you are a natural assassin. You can handle any distractions in the middle of a fight and always move effectively to result in a kill, in fact your mind clears in a fight making you more coordinated, and makes everything seem more intuitive. You also have a natural ability to understand vital spots in your opponent and understand tactics on an instinctual level."
600,Master Swordsman,Akame ga Kill,"You have trained long with a sword, such that now you could even cut through the armor of a Teigu with an ordinary blade as though it was no more than leather. Your skill is even such that you could cut down ordinary people fast enough that no one in the area would notice, leading even your victim to taking a few steps before collapsing."
600,The Legend of Kross,Rune Factory,"You are a paragon of war, able to take on hordes and hordes of the strongest monsters and soldiers around. You can see the weaknesses of a foe just by looking at them, you know how many hits they can take, and every time you slay one you get an item based on how tough they were, and this stacks with other items drops. Whenever you are using combat techniques you only need a tenth of the normal energy required to use any moves, andyou quickly learn how to improve from each fight, from the lowest of monsters to world ending foes. Everything you know how to use is a weapon in your hands, from taking out tanks with a watering can, to taking out Gelwein with a fishing pole if you ever get that strong. Every form of combat you have can be used with other combat forms, Non-combat skills can be used this way as well, and you can even use combat skills for mundane tasks quite easily. You constantly improve your abilities in combat, from strength and speed, to things like improving your more unique abilities from other jumps.

(Protagonist Boosted) Well now... I guess the previous description is beneath you. In battle your body and every ability you have constantly increases, and even in fights with weak monsters like woolies all of your abilities can increase by up to 1 percent in a one on one fight. With every battle you engage in you’ll learn new applications for your abilities, and you will gain new abilities derived from the old ones you had, either individually or as combinations. If you choose to spar with others, while they won’t nearly gain the same benefits as you at first, they will gain a somewhat reduced version of this non-boosted perk. Anyone you beat in a fight, regardless of if it’s fair or not, will at minimum gain a great respect for your abilities and will grant you one request, provided they live. Have fun mowing down armies or bosses rapidly. The effects of this perk can also be used to upgrade equipment or anything else you own by dividing your boost between yourself and your possessions, but this is guaranteed to be less effective and less efficient than using the blacksmith perks to upgrade them."
600,Evasive Maneuver,RWBY,"You usually need to take damage to lose a fight, and you’re incredibly good at making sure you never get hit. You have an almost supernatural ability to not only dodge and deflect attacks, but to gracefully control the flow of battle as you do so. Your combat reflexes are instantaneous and so long as you are even slightly relative to your opponent in speed, it’s unlikely that you’ll ever be touched. This also boosts all of your skills and abilities when they’re being applied to avoiding damage. Survival is what you do best after all."
600,A Funny thing happened,Marvel Cinematic Universe Vol. 1,"You are a walking bastion of skill and danger. Your martial art skills are so sharp that you could take on a group of trained soldiers single-handedly. Your marksman skills are enough that Annie Oakley would tip her hat in respect, and you could do that while using your weapons to gun-kata the aforementioned group. You've trained enough that you know how to utilize the environment to your surroundings, your situational awareness drastically increased as a result of learning to gauge situations of their dangers and what you could do to alleviate it. People would claim they were lucky to have NOT met you... now if only it could help you choose what kind of doughnut you wanted."
600,Old Fashioned Asskicking,Marvel Cinematic Universe Vol. 1,"You can't always be at the back seat of a fight directing things. Sometimes you need to get out in the field and show your troops you're willing to work alongside them, and they will be invigorated as a result. Groups you fight with will have their morale drastically improved, and their battle tactics improved just as much. Synergy, accuracy, reflexes, and coordination take a very noticeable increase, and you could almost swear that they hit harder too. Guess they're just happy you care for them."
600,God-Rank Fighter,Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation,"When your peers mocked you for not learning the three famed Sword-Styles, you manage to persevere and reach the pinnacle of the Saint Dragon Battle Aura Fighting-Style. Your proficiency and mastery of the techniques of the Saint Dragon Battle Aura Fighting-Style that combines Magic-Arts/Spells and Wushu/Unarmed Martial Arts reached completion and you can claim to be a God-Rank Fighter of the Saint Dragon Battle Aura Fighting-Style. This elevates your Mana Reserves to the point that you can cast half a dozen God-Rank Spells before being exhausted along with elevating your mastery and control of your Battle Aura such that it can amplify your physical capabilities to the limit allowing you to to become stronger than Emperor-Rank Warrior but weaker than God-Rank Warrior in pure stats alone. Completely mastering the Saint Dragon Battle Aura Fighting-Style has given you the ability to meld Magic-Arts/Spells and Wushu/Unarmed Martial Arts into one Combat-Style gaining all of the advantages and discarding their disadvantages. This also elevates your innate talent at learning and mastering any Martial Arts-Styles and Powers though this is more prominent in Unarmed Martial Arts-Styles and Magic-Spells which would allow you to reach God-Rank, starting from scratch, within three years amount time though it would be faster if you have a master to learn from or if you already have a foundation for it. This also allows you to invent, innovate and re-create any Unarmed Martial Arts-Styles and Magic-Spells that you see and face with a few times of experiencing it or observing it and it also bleeds to any Martial Arts-Styles and Powers to a lesser degree."
600,God-Ranked Warrior,Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation,"Well done, you’ve managed to become one and reach the pinnacle of the Three Sword-Styles of the Six-Faced World. Your proficiency and mastery of the secret techniques of the North-God’s Unorthodox and Underhanded Tricks, Sword-God’s Relentless and Light Speed attacks and techniques, and Water-God’s Perfect Defense and Ultimate Counter have reached completion such that you can claim to be a God-Rank Swordsman of the Three Sword-Styles. This elevates your mastery and control of your Battle Aura that it can amplify your physical capabilities to the limit allowing you to rival any God-Rank Warrior in pure stats alone. Completely mastering the Three Sword-Styles has given you the ability to meld any Armed Martial Art-Styles into one Combat-Style gaining all of the advantages and discarding their disadvantages. This also elevates your innate talent at learning and mastering any Martial Arts-Styles though this is more prominent in Armed Martial Arts-Styles which would allow you to reach God-Rank starting scratch within a year’s time though it would be faster if you have a master to learn from or if you already have a foundation for it. This also allows you to invent, innovate and re-create any Armed Martial Arts-Styles that you see and face with a few times of experiencing it or observing it and it also bleeds to any Martial Arts-Styles to a lesser degree."
600,Sword Goddess,Bleach,"It’s easy to think that every Kenpachi is a violent brute. They all favour sheer power and strength, even those that have some technique or intelligence in battle prefer to channel it into using their natural power. But it didn’t start that way. The very first of this line relied not on furious power but on graceful skill. Graceful, terrifying, murderous skill. The countless styles of swordsmanship that Unohana Yachiru mastered in pursuit of the perfection of dealing death were passed down to you, maybe from the woman herself, rendering you her equal in Zanjutsu at least. The myriad styles have endless applications and intended uses, from barbaric greatswords to precise rapiers. Styles to allow the effortless counter-attacks to almost any blow, turning the enemy’s strength against them, or to cut away at the spiritual components of the enemy. Your skill is hardly limited to just what a mortal human would see as physically possible and the techniques you’re aware of make you capable of easily laying low those more powerful than yourself. Unohana, even centuries after she put down her blade, still easily killed the mighty Zaraki many times over despite his physical advantages. If desired, you can exchange this talent in swordsmanship for similar skill for another armed weapon form. Spears or hammers or axes or some of the wilder tools the Shinigami employ. Unarmed combat is unavailable as a choice but otherwise you’ll attain the same vast breadth and depth of skill with your chosen weapon for."
600,Ace of Aces,Infinite Stratos,"There’s the professionals. Then the prodigies. Then you. The IS, and any other mecha, are more like an extension of your own body then a robotic armour. You could easily fight alone a half dozen other pilots at once, each good enough to represent their country as their top pilots, and come out of it smiling and victorious. Even when you’ve just picked up a new mecha, it’ll only take you a couple minutes to get used to the new controls before you’re as good as ever. Piloting is just innate to your very being. Give it a few years and you could fight the Brunhilde, Orimura Chifuyu herself to a standstill. Optionally, Students can choose to become their country’s Representative Candidate with this."
600,Hengen Musou,Rising of the Shield Hero,"You have been trained in the Peerless Transformation Style, a martial art created with the belief that people should not rely on heroes to save the world. A style that does not lean on weapons, but is equally capable of augmenting any. It is the ultimate expression of Ki manipulation, as most of its techniques rely on it. You know how to attack bypassing defenses, and defend in turn from attacks of this nature, by manipulating the opponent’s and your own Ki in turn. Its main technique is Musou Kassei - sucking Ki from the air and using it to further boost your abilities, though it places a burden on the body. It artificially creates something similar to the SP of the heroes, that can also be used to supercharge your magical abilities. It is best used in high-intensity bursts, though if you were particularly talented you may find more benefit in a more constant, low-powered state. You may adapt this style to work on other energy sources, rather than Ki. Chakra, magic, Aura, all may be used in a similar manner with enough practice. You do not need to buy the Ki perk for this, but in that case you will have to learn how to use it by yourself"
600,One Step Further,Dragon Ball Z,"Wait...how did you...huh. Interesting. You’ve managed to unlock a famous technique of North Kai, the Kaioken. This allows one to temporarily push past their current limits in terms of strength, speed, durability, and power for a very short amount of time, letting them multiply it up to one hundred of their original strength. Normally, this technique is extremely dangerous and draining, the body losing many times the energy gained and spent from the boost, enough to knock out or even kill the user if they overtax themselves. However, this version seems to be an improvement of the original - the duration of the technique starts off being able to last for a full minute instead of a ‘heartbeat’ of an instant, and the backlash will never do anything more severe than a stamina drain to your body. As you practice using this technique in both battle and training, you will learn how to multiply your strength beyond one hundred, and while the drain and backlash grows more severe the more you reach for power, this can be overcome or at least mastered with enough time, training, and mastery. The duration may also be extended over time as you master these greater heights, little by little, perhaps even letting you surpass the art of Transformation entirely...it will not be easy, but such lofty heights are within your reach, now."
600,Jumper-Jin,The God of Highschool,"No longer are you a relative beginner in the martial arts. With the purchase of this, you have become one of the strongest beings on Earth. Your skill with any Martial Arts or National Treasures that you have bought is on the level of a member of The Six, humans second only to Taejin Jin in power and skill. Your physical form as undertaken a similar boost in might, with all your physical attributes raised to absurdly superhuman levels. You could survive being punched from Seoul to Beijing, run back in a few minutes and then punch your attacker two hundred kilometres away, embedding them halfway into a mountain. You are not yet on the level of the High Gods but you’re closer than all but a dozen or two people in all the universe."
600,World Champion​,Overlord,"You are the very model of what it means to be a warrior. Your every swing is a master stroke, your every maneuver a brilliant display of skill and ferocity. Your physical combat abilities are boosted tremendously and you will find yourself gaining in strength, speed, and agility the longer a battle continues and the more opponents y face, though this increase in physical power will slowly return to its base level once the battle has concluded. In terms of fighting prowess you could defeat any three peers of your same level, regardless of the difference in equipment between you, with utter and humiliating (for them) ease. Additionally you will find that the better a strategist and tactician you are the more dangerous you become, the knowledge of battle planning and tactical ability combining together to give you a reliable and comprehensive battle precognition that will let you see your enemies moves long before they arrive, and maneuver them appropriately to render them utterly impotent. The greater your skill in strategy and tactics the more far reaching this foresight becomes, though it only applies to combat. You could potentially plan out an entire war with this if your tactical acumen rivaled that of a god, but you wouldn’t have any insight on how to keep your country economically stable afterwards.
