500,The (Potential) Power Of Shazam,DC – Kingdom Com,"Billy Batson made a deal with a powerful wizard, known as Shazam. You were Shazam’s apprentice, and learned the secrets of calling on the powers of a god from him. While you learned many magical secrets from Shazam (And possess considerable magical talent yourself, standing heads and shoulders above the typical magic user.), Shazam never granted you the powers he gave Billy. However, he did teach you how to gain them. You start out with two boons from two DC gods or godlike entities like one of The Endless in your new form. (Permission from said being already granted, somehow.) You may not start out with contracts to omniscient beings or metaphysical forces like The Presence or The Red. However you may fill the slots you start out with similar beings Shazam has made a contract with, such as Zeus or Solomon. You may not start out with a contract with any superhero. Now you can, in future realms, call upon the powers of a local god or spirit or any other skilled person to copy their best aspects when you forge a contract with them. If the god or godlike being dies, you lose this power. You do not lose this power when you leave the world. When you forge a contract with them, you add their power to a pool you may draw on. This functions as a form of power copying, but you still need to maintain the connection until you leave the jump, and then you no longer need a connection. You may only have up to six bound aspects to yourself at a time, and the first letters of the beings’ names will make up a magic word you can call upon. When you gain access to other beings, you may swap in and out the powers of other beings from this pool of contracts. You will have no more access to their power until you swap them back in from the pool. You may also draw upon this power by shouting this magic word, like Shazam, and transform in a powerful form that uses these powers. It can manifest in the classic lightning bolt (which can be weaponized if you shout down the name) or some other elemental display, like spikes of crystal or obsidian to represent earth or a blast of fire to represent fire. Or flower petals or some other plant display to represent nature. These will count as magical. You can grant your contracts to others you have deemed worthy, although they will not be able to pick and choose powers like you can. You will be the one deciding which gods or entities they derive power from. Granting parts of or entire contracts to people will make you lose the portion of the contract you have granted, and granting the entire contract will make you lose them. You may forge a contract with all-powerful, omniscient beings like The Presence with this power, and forging a contract with metaphysical forces like The Red is also allowed. However, you may not gain reality warping abilities with this skill, but gaining any other power is allowed. You will not be any stronger than an avatar of the metaphysical forces you make a contract with. You may forge a contract with literally anyone as well."
100,Cantrips,Generic First Jump,"You have minor magical abilities that you can use at will. These abilities are of the same scale as D&D 3.5ed cantrips, useful tricks like cleaning your clothing or creating a small temporary floating ball of light."
100,Alchemy,Banjo-Kazooie,"You are incredibly capable at mixing together mundane ingredients to create effects that can only be described as magical. For a short time these potions can create temporary copies of you, turn you invisible, or give you shielding."
100,A *th Sense,Invincible,"Sometimes the magic that imbues you reacts. It jolts and seems to highlight items in your vision or alter the way that you hear things. Over time you have learned that these reactions indicate the presence of other magic around you. These bursts of information and awareness appear in the way that is most convenient to the user but processed through the senses they already have. When you are looking at a magic pendant you could see the way the magic moves, you would feel the tingle as a ghost sneaks up on you, the wards laid on a building would shows up in all their glory with a buzzing sound. Regardless, you are able to sense magic through your normal senses and never mistake the sensation of magic for anything but."
100,The Classical Elements,Toaruverse,"There are four classical elements in Western cultures, and if counting the fifth element, quintessence or ether, it matches the five elements of Eastern cultures. You become proficient at manifesting and manipulating the eastern and western classical elements without the need of incantations or focus but with it the element that you are manifesting becomes several times more powerful and easier to control. By picking one of the classical elements and your hair would change according to the element that you choose to further enhance the power of your element by a minimum of ten times. You can also choose all the elements if you don’t mind having a multicolored hair though the boost in the element is only a fourth compared to choosing one."
100,Casting Methods,Justice League Dark,"Speaking backwards, arcane sigils, runes, the language of gods and monsters, mudras, beat poetry, sick dance moves. Whatever it is, you know a method of spellcasting that lets you bypass any other verbal, somatic, or gestural necessities of the Art. Additional buys cost 25CP per casting method purchased."
100,Magical Theory,Justice League Dark,"You take a much more rigorous and scientific approach to magic, having studied the theory of how it works and the methods used to cast it. This gives you excellent talent for rituals and often, you’ll be able to mix and match reagents together to create grand rituals of your own. You’ll also have a knack for understanding any magic you’re aware of, able to instantly study and understand the mechanics of a spell just from seeing it cast. Outside of your rituals however, this perk doesn’t give you the skill or talent to actually cast magic unaided."
100,Magical Agreement,Justice League Dark,"Not much to see here unless you're hoping to go into politics. You’ve got some way to make agreements that you enter ironclad and binding, the exact method left up to your discretion. Entering these pacts will force all parties to hold up their end. And this works no matter how powerful any singular party is. So sure, if you’re feeling frisky, go ahead and make that deal with a goddess. I should say though, these deals only hold up to the letter of the arrangement making them very easy to squirm out of them if they’re worded poorly. Hope you’ve got a good lawyer!"
100,Arcane Caster,Overlord,"You’re the classic wizard. You know how to cast spells like fireball, lightning bolt, haste, fly, invisibility, teleport, charm person, slow, a generous assortment of buffing and debuffing spells, and so on and so forth. You’re also a dab hand at ritual work. In terms of Ranked Magic you start out knowing a fair amount of spells of the third tier, and many more of the second and first.


--- (Requires Realm of Heroes): If you are in the Realm of Heroes you know and are capable of casting spells of up to the 6th tier. Spells of this level are dramatically more powerful than those of the lower tiers and you could honestly claim to be capable of beating hundreds of men on your own with just your direct offensive spells, and could probably manage far more than that with a bit of planning. At this level you’re considered a potential strategic asset worth whole armies as far as the people of the New World are concerned. Such spells include controlling the weather, conjuring forth skeletal dragons, dominating the minds of others (though in an obvious way), fabricating finished products out of raw materials instantly, making some lower tier spells permanent via the Permanency spell, and many more. ---


--- (Requires Level One Hundred): If you are ‘Level One Hundred’ you are capable of 10th tier magic. Most people in the New World don’t even know that this tier of magic exists, or the 9th or 8th tiers either for that matter. You effectively have no match whatsoever in terms of arcane magic power outside of Ainz Ooal Gown himself. Spells at these heights could smite entire armies casually, summon forth creatures that could do the same for you, or ‘buff’ you to heights similar in physical ability to a warrior of your same level, though not with the weapon skills to make good use of it. Spells at this level include ‘reality slash’, which is a watered down version of the Damage Focused Warriors ‘dimensional slash’ (very watered down), conjuring forth major magical servitors such as primal elementals or high ranking angels (or demons), casting Gate, creating potentially permanent teleportation circles, wide area instant-death magic, teleporting over vast distances without any chance of error, shifting into other planes/dimensions of existence, making much higher tier spells permanent via the Permanency spell, and more. ---"
100,Divine Caster,Overlord,"You’re capable of Divine Magic, and also Druidic magic for some reason. This means you’re capable of healing others, curing diseases and poisons, summoning monsters to aid you, casting spells and barriers of protection, turning, commanding, or destroying the undead, entangling enemies in plant life, commanding natural beasts and creatures to aid you, and more.


--- (Requires Realm of Heroes): If you’re in the Realm of Heroes you can cast the ‘lesser’ versions of resurrection magic to bring back the dead, a skill in considerable demand, and your other magics are heightened in potency, often being capable of affecting multiple targets at once. Additionally at this level your nature magics start to really come into their own with you being able to make minor, but useful, changes to the nearby landscape as well as controlling the weather, calling down lightning bolts, and conjuring forth much more dangerous and powerful monsters or creatures to serve you such as elementals or strong magical beasts. You’ll additionally be able to ‘wild shape’ into the forms of animals and such that you’ve encountered though you can’t transform into anything stronger than yourself, and you don’t get any supernatural abilities from doing so, however you do gain the size, strength, and toughness of said creatures. You’ll additionally be able to lift curses upon others, destroy lower level and even some ‘medium’ leveled undead instantly, casting healing spells that affect large groups all at once, and layer several ‘buffing’ types of magics to improve the performance of yourself or allies. ---


--- (Requires Level One Hundred): At ‘Level One Hundred’ you can cast spells of such potency that you could heal entire armies in one go, mass resurrect the dead with no penalty to the person that died, cast spells of protection that can potentially be used to nullify just about any kind of damage you can prepare for, cause earthquakes, turn small forests into armies of treants to turn against your enemies, and your skills in combating the undead are virtually peerless. Your ‘wildshape’ abilities now let you transform into fantastic creatures such as dragons or elementals, and you can even summon forth such creatures as temporary servitors to work your will. You can instantly destroy anything other than extremely high-tier undead, and your divine and druidic magics have hit their very peak. ---"
100,Spiritualist,Overlord,"Dealing with the contracting, binding, and borrowing of power of the spirits of the world the Spiritualist tends more towards indirect effects, subtlety, and supportive roles than those of the other more traditional magic caster classes. This is not a branch of magic dealing solely in summoning, per-se, but it does have more than its fair share of such things. Your spells tend towards beckoning or influencing the ‘spirits’ within your surroundings in order to accomplish tasks for you, and potentially even manifesting such spirits directly either as summons or to empower yourself or others as a form of ‘buff’. Different from druidism which deals directly with the manipulation of nature your approach tends to work through proxy in order to manage such changes for you.


--- (Requires Realm of Heroes): Just starting out you’ll approximate many of the abilities of lower level druids or arcane casters, but in the Realm of Heroes you’ll start to branch off more solidly, focusing on changing the ‘spirits’ of a given area to impede enemies or aid yourself and allies, calling forth spirit servitors in order to directly work for you, or calling forth spirits within yourself or others in order to increase their abilities. ---


--- (Requires Level One Hundred): At Level One Hundred you’ll be able to call forth spirits of tremendous and terrifying power and scope such as genus loci, giving orders to spirits to maintain or change large areas of land (or water) to support your aims (which they will then continue to maintain until such time as you direct them otherwise), permanently blessing (or cursing) the ‘spirits’ of specific bloodlines, or calling forth spirits into yourself or allies capable of empowering them to truly spectacular might. Taking this class ensures that such spirits will always be available in future worlds for you to call upon. Finally these are spells, so you don’t need to worry about your magic shutting down because the local spirits don’t like you. So long as you provide the mana to cast them your spells will continue to work. ---"
100,Saint-Rank Magician,Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation,"Magic is the most common way for a mage to be useful in battle and combat, and you manage to learn an reach an incredible amount of proficiency and mastery in Attack-Magic, Healing-Magic, and Summoning-Magic Category-Types of the Six-Faced World such that you could be considered a Saint-Rank in this Three Main Categories of Magic. While this also gives you all the knowledge of the spells of the Three Main Categories of Magic you only master them at Saint-Rank of the said spells. This also gives you Truncated Spell-Casting which allows you to shorten the incantation for any magic-spells that you have to five seconds or less. This elevates your Mana Reserves to the point that you can cast a dozen Saint-Rank Spells before being exhausted. You also gained an incredible innate talent at learning and mastering any Powers though this is more prominent when you’re learning some type of magic which would allow you to reach Saint-Rank starting scratch within a year’s amount time though it would be faster if you have a master to learn from or if you already have a foundation for it."
100,Spellbook of Knowledge,Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation,This large tome contains the Incantations and Magic Circles to all known and unknown spells in this world. The spells recorded ranges from Beginner-Rank Spells to God-Rank Spells of the three main types of magic. The instructions contained in it are detailed and easy to understand that it’s nearly impossible not to understand the meaning and descriptions of each spell. This tome also records the magic-spells or something equivalent that you know or invented. Post-Jump this tome automatically updates to include the Magic System or Other Systems equivalent to it along with all possible magic’s and similar things available in the future worlds that you are in and the tome has effectively infinite pages and opening to the desired page or spells with just a thought.
100,Basic Magic,Young Justice,"You’ve got basic knowledge of magic, and can perform minor spells, such as changing the colors of objects, weakening objects, and summoning small objects or animals."
100,The Magic Of Mortals,Campione!,"The esoteric powers for mortals aren’t quite the same as those of divine nature, being more akin to borrowing small amounts of magic force from the gods, a prayer answered. Still humans have come quite a way through making do with what they have. You are a prime example of such, being trained in spell and sword with focus on their physically practical applications over versatile occultism from a young age. While you aren’t quite in the same league as the Great Knights that lead their Orders, you could reach them in time given enough effort and opportunity."
200,Jack Of All Spells,Arifureta Shokugyou de Sekai Saikyou,"Magic is something certainly common here, however without talent or affinity for it, it becomes so restrictive that you won’t be using it outside very specific situations during your life. You won the magical Jackpot and have a high affinity for all schools of magic, as well as sorcery in general. There’s no type of magic that you can’t use, and you will find yourself advancing quickly in your magical studies, enough to be called a genius at it. This doesn’t mean you get any or all spells right off the bat, but there’s nothing stopping you to learn them, especially when your talent for the arcane is so broad."
200,Magical Sensitivity,Justice League Dark,"In order to perform magic, one needs a certain force of belief in the impossible, a spark, if you will. And, given the way you truly believe in magic, you’re positively luminous. Many other options here also grant the baseline ability to perform magic but none of them offer this singularly unique benefit: as you grow, your magic does, too. You’ll start out as good as any hedge but your spark will respond to your belief in the impossible. This growth is theoretically limitless but your spark will only blossom whenever you perform or participate in a spell that stretches your limits in some way. How much it grows will be a function of how far you expand your horizons."
200,Spell Purification,Duel Monsters - Shadow Realm,"Spellcasters are crafty, and more than that, they are incredibly prone to making warriors and other targets explode in several colorful ways. While you can work to dispel or counter individual spells, you can risk being overwhelmed against a group of spellcasters or a large amount of spells. This spell acts as a counter, forming an anti-magic field around yourself that greatly weakens or outright negates spells targeting you depending on the arcane power of the original users. This field can also be ‘spread’ to cover an area the size of a small building, disrupting spells similarly to De-Spell, though this will remove the protective field and require you to re-cast it."
200,Chaos Sorcerer,Duel Monsters - Shadow Realm,"The most distinctive form of Chaos’ might is to simply bring things to an end: You may channel the magical powers of Light and Darkness together now to form a destructive orb of power. It is not as strong as some spells, at least in pure firepower, but it is a constant entropic disintegration, very effective against most defenses. While other spells may be a metaphorical bolt of lightning, the power of chaos is a rushing waterfall that breaks its victims down through the sheer torrent of destructive power."
200,Illusion Magic,Duel Monsters - Shadow Realm,"It’s all just one big hat trick, after all. You are able to create visual and auditory illusions that can deceive and confuse the unwary, such as making a row of Magical Hats to hide in. You can even combine this with some clever spatial manipulation magic, letting you change places without your foe being able to guess your location correctly without some way to overcome the illusion."
200,Book of Moon,Duel Monsters - Shadow Realm,"Part of a set of 3 Spellbooks, this book penned by Endymion teaches a spell that allows you to create a massive wave of cowardice in your enemies, as well as cover something or someone you desire in a cloak of magical shadows."
200,Book of Sun,Duel Monsters - Shadow Realm,"Part of a set of 3 Spellbooks, this book penned by Endymion teaches a spell that allows you to reveal hidden objects and people even if they used magical means to hide, as well as grant your allies and yourself a great amount of courage and determination."
200,Light Magic,Arrowverse,"You now have the power to use a form of magic that draws from the positive aspects of the universe, such as hope and joy. Users of light magic can repel the power of users of dark magic. To help channel this magic and any magic associated with good, light, or positive emotions you’ve been branded with a magical tattoo on one of your forearms. Together with your own inner positive aspects your magical protection against darkness and the magical tattoo, you’re capable of defending yourself and others nearby from evil and/or dark magic. With enough hope and joy you can severely weaken and temporarily shut off any evil and/or dark magic from an enemy magician. The amount of time depends on the amount of positive emotions and your magical strength."
200,Maleficium,King Arthur,"Similar to true magic but instead is focused on empowerment, curses, transfiguration, and contracts using mystic runes. Though it focuses on these subjects there is little it cannot do if you know the right runes. Even if it's power for destruction may not be as powerful as a wizard's magic."
200,Flow of Life,Arifureta Shokugyou de Sekai Saikyou,"Dragonmen, Atavists and magic beasts. Those are the three ‘races’ capable of freely manipulating mana. You probably aren’t either, but you do share that ability with them. For starters being able to control mana directly allows you to cast spells without a chant and magic circle, only needing mana and a mental image of the spell you want to activate. Likewise, it allows you to modify to your leisure those spells, changing their shape, properties and range as you wish. The last of the obvious advantages is the ability to limit the consumption of your reserves to pace better the fights."
200,Magical Books,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim,"The art of spellcraft is one that requires an immense amount of dedication and in many ways talent as well. Learning new spells can take ages and this can easily drive many off or act as a massive constraint when time is of the essence. You’ve found a bit of a way around this conundrum, by imbuing a simple book with your understanding of the spellcraft you can create a magical item that when activated immediately passes this onto whoever activated it, though the book is consumed in the process. While this only applies to Elder Scrolls magic at first, you’ll find that adapting it to other systems is an easy process and only requires that the process be fine tuned."
200,Alchemy Set & Tomes,Demon King Daimao,An alchemy set that comes with detailed tomes on charm creation and other such things. You should be able to create some high tier things with what you currently have.
200,Innate Talent - Alchemist,Overlord,"You are capable of brewing potions with magical effects. You can easily create ‘true’ healing potions that provide instantaneous healing rather than healing-over-time, and can make potions for any ‘buffing’ spells you know that are in the ranked magic system such as flight, invisibility, increased magic resistance, physical boosts, and so on. Obviously you must actually know a spell in order to make a potion with that spells effect. Additionally to make use of this talent you must actually have the means to make the potions in the first place such as an alchemist's lab or, for slimes, your own body."
200,Innate Talent - Magic Learning Affinity,Overlord,You possess the rare talent to learn all magic spells in half the time it would normally take you. For example if a spell would normally take a person eight years to learn you could learn it in four years. Stacks with similar abilities from other jumps. Doesn’t give you the ability to use magical styles you aren’t actually trained in or capable of using.
200,Innate Talent - Enhanced Healing Magic,Overlord,"Your magical healing spells are especially potent, doubling their effectiveness and halving their cost. You would be well praised and rewarded as a healer if people knew you had this ability and, of course, if you knew any healing spells. Only affects magic that explicitly heals and does nothing else. Undead that purchase this may choose to gain the opposite of this to empower negative energy spells so that they can heal themselves."
200,Innate Talent - Magical Powerhouse,Overlord,"You are more magically powerful than others. A lot more magically powerful. You’ve got enough magical energy to rival any three other peers of your level, and additionally you recover your reserves of magical energy just as quickly. Spells that deal direct damage, and nothing else, are 20% more powerful when you personally cast them. Scales with level. This talent is utterly useless for people that don’t know magic."
200,Specific Specialization: Crowd Control,Overlord,"You’re really good at crowd control. You know many spells that can be used to halt large groups in their tracks either via entanglement, restricting their movements, making the terrain unfavorable, mesmerizing them, or some other method. Really good. While these spells aren’t directly useful in an offensive role they can easily set up your allies for success, or allow you the time to cast other more offensive magics, and are a tremendous force multiplier when you work with a group. You are particularly skilled at spells designed against single targets, allowing you to trap and bind specific enemies that would often otherwise prove to be too slippery for you to catch. Enhanced mind controlling and illusionary magics explicitly fall under the umbrella of this specialization, alongside improved means of detecting such magics and abilities as well as countering them."
200,Specific Specialization: Evoker,Overlord,"You’re a direct damage dealer. You know a wide variety of damage dealing spells, often elemental in nature or of untyped ‘force’ energy, that are especially potent in destroying your enemies. They are more damaging, can affect more enemies, and are much more precise. You are especially skilled in punching through magic resistance."
200,Specific Specialization: Warder,Overlord,"You’re really good at warding things. Specifically areas, creatures, and items. You could ward a small town so that those with hostile intent against the residents would be cursed the moment they step inside, or could potentially create wards that just keep such people out completely assuming you’ve got the time and are willing to spend the effort making them. You’re also really good at creating wards against specific effects such as mind control, instant-death, curses, and ironically enough wards that will let you ignore other wards. You could even erect wards on individuals to allow them to temporarily ignore a weakness they might otherwise have, such as allowing a lesser vampire to walk about in daylight or allowing a fire elemental to resist cold damage."
200,Specific Specialization: Necromancy,Overlord,"You’re a master of the undead. If you’re ‘Level One Hundred’ you’re a near equal in terms of this branch of magic compared even to the Lich Momonga himself, if you happen to also be a Skeleton or Zombie in addition to being a level one hundred Magic Caster and Necromancer then you are his equal. You can easily create and control lesser undead, which will be permanent if you use fresh bodies as catalysts, and have a particular affinity for instant-death spells. Even if a target should resist one of your instant death spells they usually have an automatic ‘debuff’ effect anyway, such as guaranteed stunning, exhaustion, blindness, or other sorts of curses and abnormalities. If you couldn’t already you can now turn, command, and destroy the undead like a divine caster of your level and if you could already do that then you’re even better at it."
200,Wards,With This Ring,"​Several pre-prepared wards, several books on producing wards, two finished Spell-Eater amulets, and the designs for making more. Enough to protect a small town from magical scrying and moderate magical attacks, as well as enough knowledge to produce wards capable of defending against Lanterns and New Gods. If you purchased a property from this jump alongside this item you may optionally choose for that property to already have wards included and implemented into it."
200,Silent-Casting,Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation,"Normally Magic-Spells require lengthy incantations and occasionally conjoining magic arrays, some talented practitioners can use Truncated Spell-Casting to shorten the length to a few phrases, but you have taken this to the next level and can manipulate mana just by feeling and a little concentration. This allows you to entirely skip the lengthy incantations and silently cast Magic-Spells with just your thought by visualizing it and this also gives you the ability to adjust the size, speed and potency of the Magic-Spells like giving a Beginner-Rank Spell with an Emperor-Rank Spell potency. This also applies to other worlds Magic-Systems that needed incantations or shouting the name of the spells. By default you have the ability to teach Silent-Casting to others that don’t have the talent or ability to use it."
200,Magic,Percy Jackson,"You have been taught the style of magic appropriate to your chosen pantheon. With this alone you are merely a novice but you can receive further instruction. Generally you have an aptitude for a particular branch of magic within which you excel, frequently linked to a god you favor. Magic is very versatile, capable of anything from grand pillars of fire to teleporting entire pyramids. Generally you’ll need training and practice to pull those off though, and will likely be exhausted without some method of supplementing your stores of power."
200,Cantrip Master,Young Justice,"Your mastery of magic has made you very flexible and versatile in the mystic arts, and you can now modify and alter the basic spells in your repertoire. This allows you to do things like changing how a spell is delivered; for example, turning a projectile spell into a spell delivered with a touch. In addition, you can choose where your spells will appear from, so long as it’s within ten meters of yourself, as well as what direction they will go. If you choose to make a spell have an area of affect or a burst effect, it will only be able to affect an area of ten meters in any direction. In addition, if a spell is actually described as simple or as a cantrip in setting, but still has some sort of limit or cost on using it, your mastery of cantrips has made it so you can cast those spells for free."
200,Atlantean Sorcery,Young Justice,"You’re experienced with Atlantean sorcery, allowing you to manipulate water, using it to blast your foes, create waves, and shield yourself. You can also create solid constructs with your water, as well as generate electricity from your body. Advanced practitioners can do even more, such as shooting and creating ice. Comes with free Water-Bearers."
200,Gifted - Wandless Magic,Generic Harry Potter Fanfiction,"​Magic is in your blood, Jumper. And you can feel it. Not for you the crutches that are wands. You can do any spells that normally require magical foci without them, and not lose a single smidgen of effectiveness. Nor do you need to crudely shout your spells, being perfectly able to cast wordless spells. Furthermore, magic comes instinctively to you, meaning you can dispense with the complexity that the more advanced magic usually requires. Spells that would require long chants and complicated wand movements can be done with the wave of a hand, days long rituals can be done with as much effort as a moderately complex potion or ritual would take for an ordinary wizard. Indeed, you can do all magic you know with similar ease."
200,Gifted - Shadow Mage,Generic Harry Potter Fanfiction,"​You are a Shadow Mage, a Wizard with strong abilities tilted towards the shadows and darkness. This can have different implications in different fanfics, but at a minimum you have the ability to travel through the ‘Shadow Realm’, a strange realm that exists alongside the material world and connects all shadows to each other. It’s nearly instant in short areas, and at its longest takes about five or six seconds for you to go from one shadow to another. Also, you have a link to ‘Darkness’. This lets you wield it like a weapon at times, while at others you can use magic based on it. At will, you can shape weapons and shields out of it, though those don’t last long at all. Finally, your link to darkness and shadow extends to the beings that inhabit it. Creatures like Dementors and some types of Vampires consider you one of their own and tend to be friendly towards you, at least until you do something to change this."
200,Gifted - Blood Mage,Generic Harry Potter Fanfiction,"​You are a Blood Mage, a Wizard with strong abilities towards ‘Blood Magic’ and Rituals of all kind. This, again, means different things in different worlds, but the least of the powers you have would be an ability to control your own blood’s flow absolutely, up to and including an immunity to all magic or abilities that specifically targets blood. Beyond this, you have a ludicrously high affinity towards rituals towards all kind, such as adoption rituals, inheritance tracing rituals, or rituals that boost your physical or magical abilities through runecraft or sacrifice of creatures. Indeed, you can outright acquire magical abilities like an incredible physical strength through Re’em blood, magical resistance through sacrificing a Dragon, so on and so forth."
200,Gifted - Mind Magic,Generic Harry Potter Fanfiction,"​You have mind magic! Not only are you a whiz with obliviation and related magic, but you’re a natural Occlumens and Legilimens, which both have their own uses. Your natural Occlumens and Legilimens abilities start out incredibly formidable, akin to someone who’s spent years studying them. With some work you could be a master. Mastery in occlumency comes with an eidetic memory and perfect control over all your tells, to the extent that no one can tell when you’re lying. It also lets you make a Mind Palace, and enhances your ability to recall your memory massively, so that eidetic memory can be of some actual use. Similarly, mastering legilimency allows you to almost instinctively tell when someone is lying, and also makes you a tremendously skilled cold reader. You’re also a dab hand with spells like compulsions, the confundus and the Imperius. Finally, once you’ve developed your talents enough to acquire all of these abilities, by combining them you become able to rip skills and knowledge straight out of people’s heads. It takes less time and effort the more you practice it, but eventually taking mere seconds to seamlessly copy entire lives’ worth of knowledge and skills without the target even knowing it is possible, though it’ll take a lot of work."
200,“Useless” Magic,Fate/Stay Night,"The basics are crucial, something so often ignored by all these elitist snobs. You’ve gained not only knowledge of the techniquest, but near mastery of them. Reinforcement allows you to enhance the qualities of things, such as making a wooden stick as hard as steel, or increasing your vision to rival a hawk’s. Gradation Air allows you to project items using your mana, though these will always only be a hollow shell."
200,Magician,That Time I Was Reincarnated As A Slime,"For several years, you’ve studied magic at various places around the world and you can proudly say you’ve become proficient at the basics of all magic from Holy and Demonic, somehow, to Summoning Magic and beyond. While you don’t have any special talent for it you’ve worked hard and gotten quite skilled at using the magics you know. Otherworlders may have just been given the knowledge and ability by the [Voice of the World]"
300,Magic Flow,Rising of the Shield Hero,"You gain a sense for the flow of mana, something the people of this world tend to use unconsciously. By expending mana when doing something, be it attacking or defending or even mixing a potion, you can improve its effect with no theoretical upper limit, though you very quickly reach diminishing returns. In the context of crafting, this is a big factor in determining an item’s quality score."
300,Fear and Wonder,Justice League Dark,"Magic is something truly miraculous. Yet the deeper most practitioners delve, the more horrifying they realize it can be. You stand someplace between the fear and wonder of the arcane and have come to genuinely respect magic. And it seems magic responds well to respect and just about anything else you feel. You’re about as good as any hedge but that’s not quite what makes you special. Your emotions are powerful fonts of mystical energies, capable of amplifying your spellwork based on how much and how deeply you feel. Benefitting from this empowerment will require “matching” emotions, so to speak. For example, a fire-bolt might become a meteor with enough anger or passion but won’t benefit from you being bored, tired, or sad."
300,Physical Magic,Demon King Daimao,While some may use their mana to manifest fire or something else you use yours to manifest force. You may with some effort increase the damage you do physically by expending mana. A wooden sword could cut through a metal desk with this like butter. You could adapt this to many things with training.
300,Invisibility & Flight Magic,Demon King Daimao,"You excel at running away and staying hidden. While questionable, you may first turn yourself invisible while naked and glide along slightly faster than the wind. With training or a power boost you could easily transfer your invisibility onto anythi you’re strong enough to carry and even keep up with Brave while flying."
300,Summoning,Fate/Grand Order,"The Summoning System is the mechanism through which the Masters of Chaldea intend to summon Servants to fight for them and Craft Essence to enhance or assist those Servants. It is a randomised system, with more powerful or notable Servants and Essence being harder and harder to get. A single roll of this random mechanism requires a single Saint Quartz and will grant a single result, with no guarantees either way. Servants summoned through this method by you will fight for you, with varying degrees of enthusiasm, but they are not companions nor do they receive any additional benefits like companion Servants bought through this document will. In future jumps it will continue to summon Servants, only based off of the world it is currently in, drawing from historical or mythical or fictional or even future beings from that world. It will also continue to summon Craft Essences and such for use. Both these will follow the same rules as they do in this jump."
300,Dragon Pulse Order,Rising of the Shield Hero,"You gain the ability to use the charged energy present in the environment to modify your own magical abilities, a skill that has gone almost extinct. While it would normally require someone to gain the blessing of a Dragon Emperor to learn, we’ll handwave it just for you. By taking energy colored by your surroundings, you may mix it to spells to modify the result, often very markedly. For example, if you had a source of fire nearby, you may take the energy of that fire and mix it with energy from the surrounding air to shape it into a breath attack. Or you may add an element to a spell you cast, though the effects of this type of magic tend not to be very big if you do not have a magical source nearby. Like, say, a friendly dragon willing to provide it. Or again, if you had an affinity for darkness, you could gather energy from the ground, somehow solve for darkness from it, and get black fire as a result. Like an equation, but with magic."
300,Sorcerer Savant,Young Justice,"Your understanding of the mechanisms involved in casting spells now let you copy the techniques of other magical users, so long as you have the capability to cast the type of magic that they’re using. This effectively allows you to learn a spell after seeing someone else cast it, though you’ll still need to master it to cast it reliably."
300,Warring Warlock,Young Justice,"Your magical techniques are enhanced when used against another practitioner of magic, turning every fireball into an inferno and every force field or ward into a nigh impenetrable barrier. Not only does it look flashy, but your onslaught can actually disrupt their spell casting, making countering your magic harder."
300,Mage,Re:Monster,"The magic system of this world works off of several systems for each type of magic, consisting of ten tiers of spell, with an individual’s affinity granting an innate access to a type of magic. For those with an affinity for a type of magic, they naturally gain a spell of each tier as their skills grow to the appropriate level for that type of magic, though a strong affinity is necessary to access truly high level spells. It is possible to learn magic of other types, or other spells of the same affinity beyond those gained from having an affinity for a type of magic, through study and perseverance, though having a bad affinity for a type of magic can inhibit or even completely prevent the use of certain types of spells."
400,Advanced Ritual Art,Duel Monstesr - Shadow Realm,"“Preparation of Rites” may grant you the knowledge and theory, but you’ve got ritual magic down to a science! You can easily prepare and execute a summoning ritual, no matter how specific and easily-flubbed, as long as the materials are available to you. Not only that, but with this you can guarantee that the Ritual Monsters of the Shadow Realm are capable of answering your call, no matter how far you are from the world itself."
400,Dark Burning Magic,Duel Monsters - Shadow Realm,"Of course, knives and hat tricks are nice and all, but that’s not why you spent all this time learning Dark magic, is it? By focusing your magical energies into a single, destructive point, you may create a powerful blast that can reduce castle walls to ash and turn villages into craters. With time and practice, this burning magic may even wipe cities from the map. However, it is draining and has a setup time, which can lead to others interrupting it or making use of magical resistances."
400,Dark Energy,Duel Monsters - Shadow Realm,"You are not so weak as to require a limitation on your powers, like the residents of the Sanctuary in the Sky. You can wield DARK power in the form of lightning, being capable of rending apart a town with a few quick blasts...however, this power is wild and will destroy without regard for who or what is in the way."
400,Book of Life,Duel Monsters - Shadow Realm,"Part of a set of 3 Spellbooks, this book penned by the Heretic Gravekeeper teaches a set of spells that allow you to raise and bind spirits as undead, both skeletal and ghostly. You start off being able to raise Skull Servants with relative ease, and can expand to call upon all sorts of zombie and vampiric creatures as allies with time…"
400,Intercept Spells,Toaruverse,Waiting for the opponent to finish their incantations are very stupid but you can find that many people in this world and beyond still do it but not you. When any of you opponents try cast a spells you immediately know how to counter it even before they manage to say the first words either by hijacking the spell formula and cause the magic to go berserk to hurt you opponents or be outright cancelled it along with ability to predict when would you opponents would try to cast a spell. This also applies to any kind of magic or abilities that needed time and incantations to be used.
400,The Master of System,Toaruverse,Learning one magic to another from scratch is too time consuming and mind numbing even then some persist at doing it in the end they are granted by the greatest reward. With this you gain access to all magic systems in this world along with gaining knowledge of all their basics as well as skills at using it. Your true ability is to combine existing magic systems that you can access into one magic system that has all advantages of the magic systems that you know and discarding their weaknesses and this process is automatic and also applies to your various energy pools that you have. Creating your own magic system is also possible though this process is not automatic and you would have to do it on your own.
400,Magic,King Arthur,"A Rare power within this world with only 1 in 10000 normal humans having the power allowing it's user to bring things into being using Pure willpower and the stamina of the caster. Throwing fire balls, constructing a sword, making it rain, all basic powers that can be acquired easily, but a wizard isn't an unlimited battery of power, more complicated spells take more power and are therefore harder to use. That said with enough willpower and energy there are very few things you couldn't achieve."
400,Shaman,King Arthur,"People seek power in many different ways and forms. Some pray to gods, some sacrifice to demons, and some even risk speaking to fairies. You however look to nature and it's guardian spirits. These mysterious beings are almost everywhere and are a good source of information. Information however is not the only thing these beings gift you. You may call upon their power to revert organic beings to their original state, healing them from even the most grievous wounds. Among other things they've also granted you the ability to create barriers, usually in the shape of a box or wall though with practice and a little creativity they can take the shape of almost anything. The final gift that the guardians have given you is a special technique. If you draw a circle with a hole in the middle, fill it with water, and place an emerald in the middle of it, any unnatural creatures will be trapped inside. The seal is indefinite but can be destroyed from the outside, which will then release the creature inside. These three gifts while powerful were made to protect nature. So while you may use them however you want, when you use them with the intention of protecting nature they receive a small boost in power."
400,The Evolution Of Times,Arifureta Shokugyou de Sekai Saikyou,"The Liberators that created the Labyrinths had few things in common, aside from their hatred towards the false Gods, they did share the tier of power they had. Their magic skills, one could say that other magic is just derivative from those... but you could also say that the degraded magics can reach that level as well. That’s the advantage you have, to create and evolve your own school of magic to the same level as the ‘Age of Gods’ magic skills. Be that you take an existing type of magic and make something incredible based on it or be something completely out of your deranged mind. Only one thing is sure, its power won’t be easily rivaled."
400,Bandwidth and Wavelength,With This Ring,"​Most magical traditions are based on connections: connecting your soul to the world around you, connecting objects to concepts or energy sources. This not only increases your ability to use magic and your ease of using external or foreign sources of power, it also makes it easier for you to connect yourself, others, or objects to the varied sources of energy that exist. Moreover, with a few decades of practice, some serious preparations and major effort, this would allow you connect your soul to a concept or plane of existence to become a lord, as Nabu of Cillia and Klarion the Witch Boy have done. However, you would not be limited to Order or Chaos as they are; the Red, the Green, the Grey, the Subtle Realms, the Shadowlands, a fragment of the color spectrum, Life, Death, or a domain are all within your grasp. But be wary, doing so will tie a portion of your strength to that concept and inherently limit your ability to use opposing concepts or domains."
400,Ahzidal’s Apprentice,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim,"The art of spellcasting has more to it than just flinging fireballs and screaming about UNLIMITED POWER as one electrocutes their enemies. The arts of Enchantment and Alteration stand as testaments to this fact, enchantment in particular stands as a powerful, yet indirect system of magic and when it comes to this branch and the operation of it only the Dragon Priest Ahzidal is your equal. Like him you’ve collected vast knowledge pertaining to the various magical bases of the Mer, whether it be the ancient runes of the Ayleids or the process of harmonizing the seven natures of metal. This craft extends far and wide and with it even a mere band of five hundred warriors could be given equipment powerful enough to fell a powerful race of spellcasters like the Falmer, or in other, more simple words your enchantments are legendary. You could perhaps go even further, runes are simply another language, and if understanding them allows you to use them, then perhaps even others like that of the Dovah might be as well."
400,Enlightenment,Marvel Cinematic Universe Vol. 2,"The language of the Mystic Arts is as old as civilization, my friend. The sorcerers of antiquity called the usage of this language ""spells"", but if that word offends your modern sensibility, you can call it 'programs', the source code that shapes reality. Your eyes have been opened, a sight beyond your sight. With it, you may draw from the energies of the Multiverse itself to conjure spells, make magic! This magic is not like the energies of the Asgardians who treat it as another science. No, infinite possibilities exist if you allow yourself to see them, and you are taking the first steps towards those possibilities. It will be an arduous task to move past being a beginner, and no doubt you will be noticed as you pursue your studies. But you have opened your mind... and the wonders of magic will yours to explore."
400,Pinnacle of Magic,Campione!,"Alice Luise and Lucrentia Zola, the two most renowned witches of this era, masters of not only their power as mikos, but also of their respective ways of witchcraft and hermetic magic. Now, you join their ranks in terms of power, skill and knowledge. Not only you have mastered magic to the same level as them, but also obtained domain over several lost spells and your own miko gift. You could go places with this amount of power."
400,Dark Wisdom,Overlord,"You’ve attained a rare and dangerous knowledge, Magic Caster. Your mind now swirls with the knowledge of magic, theory, and artifice. You now possess the ability to learn any number of spells, regardless of normal restrictions or the normal limits of your mind and memory, and further you can learn to convert the spells and magics of systems unfamiliar to you such that you can cast them with a magic system you are familiar with. You are not joining or fusing magic systems, merely converting spells from one into another. This takes effort and study however, and whether or not it will be worthwhile depends on how interested you are in devoting the time to it. Additionally so long as you’ve seen a spell cast at least once you will, with time and effort, be able to puzzle out its workings. You may need to see it cast multiple times however to glean everything there is to know, so that you might add it to your own list of spells. This ability, likewise, will take time and effort. monster, you can just wait till it’s dead to swoop in and take what you need from it. Or, wait till someone is alone and distracted to kidnap them. This is obviously more effective the more up-to-date information you have, but even if you are completely isolated from the rest of the universe, you’ll still have a feeling when the best time is to leave your isolation and find your fortune. After all,  it’s a little hard to start a bandit cult and unify all the bandit clans if there’s some handsome asshole in a facemask orbitally shelling all the bandits, right? You can just wait that out instead."
400,The Power In This Right Eye Of Mine,KonoSuba,"Some people are born with a talent for magic. Some people think that a little bit of extra skill is enough to call that a ‘talent’. You’re the sort of magical genius that even the Crimson Demons would need to admit was a true master in the making. Magic comes to you faster and better than it does any other. What might take others months to reach you can do in days, even the cost for learning magic skills reduced to fit you. Your magical power is greater too, thrice that of any normal magician your age. But unfortunately, not all magic is quite the same for you. Physical magic, things such as enhancing the body or otherwise doing purely physical effects on you, is unaffected by this increase. It doesn’t quite fit the lifestyle, you see."
400,Unique Magic - Spatial Magic,Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation,"This allows you to teleport and creates portals to any location that you have visited, seen or visualized sufficiently. The expenditure scales with the distance and protection of the location you're trying to teleport or creating a portal to. Within the planet or connected dimension would need mana equivalent to Beginner-Rank to Advance-Rank Spell and a dimension heavily protected like the one Hitogami lives would need mana equivalent to God-Rank Spells. With enough effort and attempt you can reach Hitogami’s Void World or locate Earth with this."
400,Unique Magic - Gravity Magic,Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation,"This allows you to fly and replicate telekinesis to a certain extent, increase or decrease the gravity of the surrounding area hindering your opponents or just improving your physical feats. The expenditure scales to the distance or the potency of the effect like increasing the gravity by two or increasing your strength and speed by twofold and maintaining it by an hour would need mana equivalent to Beginner-Rank Spell but ten times the potency and maintaining for an hour would need need mana equivalent to Intermediate-Rank Spells."
400,Unique Magic - Howling Magic,Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation,This allows you to locate and paralyze or stun your opponents by using your voice as a medium. The expenditure scales with the distance something like a hundred meter radius would need mana equivalent to a Beginner-Rank Spells and the further you want to reach the greater the mana needed. This can also be used to replicate the effects of the Three Main Categories of Magic albeit on a much lesser potency but Magic-Spells that are single target can be used as AoE or be used to surprise attack your opponents.
400,Unique Magic - Magic Disruption,Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation,"This allows you to prevent Magic-Spells from forming and activating or mitigate their potency. You also gain an ability to anticipate and defend against magical attacks directed at you and hinder you opponents from forming or activating their Magic-Spells, all of it can be done with perfect timing. While the cost of using this to resist a Magical-Attack is normally proportional to the Magic-Spell, since you’re paying premium, you only need a hundredth of the amount of mana used to cast the Magical-Spells."
400,Magic,Justice League Unlimited,"Sorcery is a double edged sword, one that grants those who use it incredible power but always at a price that must be repaid. Most spells and rituals only require the user's magical energy or a few disposable trinkets, but major spells, ones that could make you equal to a god, would come with a much deadlier price. Regardless, choosing this power grants you talent and training in the mystic arts equal to that of Felix Faust, Tala, or Zatanna. Right now your possess enough skill to easily project arcane energy blasts, summon a few creatures or items, scry information from objects of importance, transmute individual people or objects, manipulate things with telekinesis, and perform various other feats. With practice and maybe a few ancient artifacts or a deal with a powerful entity you can grow the strength and versatility of your powers dramatically! Eventually, either after a lifetime of study, transcending beyond your current form, stealing magic from numerous other locations and individuals, or the acquisition of an incredibly powerful and dangerous artifact, you could become a magician on par with someone like Morgaine Le Fay, Doctor Fate, or Circie."
400,Thrifty Thaumaturge,Young Justice,"Sometimes, you need to take shortcuts when performing magic. Luckily for you, you’ve turned what other magic users might call laziness into an art form. You can substitute similar regents for each other when performing rituals, casting spells, or when creating magical items. Recipe calls for bottled chi? How about some mana instead? Need soul gems? I’m sure you’ll find these diamonds will suffice. Need the blood of a dragon? I’m sure that lizard’s will do. This can’t be used to substitute ingredients that are integral to what you’re trying to do; for example, if you were trying to make a potion to copy someone’s appearance, and said potion required their hair or DNA or whatever, you’d still need to have that for the potion to work, and if a ritual calls for a specific item you’ll still need to have it."
400,Advanced Magic,Young Justice,"Your magical potential increases greatly, giving you much more magical power and a greater capability for casting powerful magic. You are now capable of much greater magical heights; and are at least on par with Zatanna."
400,High Speed Incantations,Fate/Stay Night,"A rare and much sought after skill, one possessed by the Blue herself. This skill allows you to cast magic incantations in half the time, regardless of their length or complexity, while retaining the full power of the spell."
400,Runes,Fate/Stay Night,"You now have a rudimentary knowledge of Runes, and will fairly easily pick up the rest. At first, you can only create small lights or heal cuts and bruises, but soon enough you may be able to fire blasts of elements or greatly enhance your physical body with them."
400,Spiritual Doctor,Fate/Stay Night,"You have gained a Sorcery Trait, a unique aspect or ability of magecraft, known as Spiritual Healing. With this, one can perform surgery on mental or spiritual wounds as if they were physical injuries, using skill in magic and magical energy to heal them. This could allow the user to bring back the mind of someone who has gone insane or to heal damaged Magic Circuits. Beyond just healing, it is possible to use this trait to do other surgical actions, such as transplanting numerous Magic Circuits relatively safely or taking out Command Seals from a Master's body/soul and implanting them in another person. An esoteric technique such as this however, is extremely costly and requires grea skill in medical techniques in the first place. Whilst you will never lose this Sorcery Trait from overuse like other users, you will need greater and greater amounts of skill the stranger or more dangerous the surgery you are performing with it."
400,The Family Art,Fate/Stay Night,"The true wealth of every Magus family is their magecraft specialisation. The discipline of magecraft that they have spent generations researching, studying, experimenting on and utilising. It's your inheritance or perhaps, your spoils of war or thievery. However you came to possess the knowledge, you have a few decades of training in a magic specialisation of your choice, enough to make you an expert, if human, user of the art, something along the lines of Rin with her gems, though you are still many years from being a master. Maybe you'll even make a breakthrough that surprises those vaunted masters. A list of canon and suggested non canon specialisations will be at the notes section at the bottom of the jump. This perk can be taken multiple times. Magus Heir origin takers get a free version of this perk for one specialisation of their choice. This free perk is much weaker than the above, giving only a few years training in the chosen discipline, not much more then is needed to understand and use the basic functions and concepts of what you picked."
400,Integration,Battle Through the Heavens,"No longer will using two different fire spells together simply act as two separate spells. Much like the Angry Buddha Lotus, they can now be combined into something significantly stronger than even the sum of their parts, caused by the conflict of the two forces meeting. Essentially this allows the fusion of spells of the same type or affinity in order to make an overall stronger spell. This applies for any spells or abilities of the same type/affinity."
400,New Founder,Fate/Stay Night,"While you might not be quite the sort of genius the Three Founders of the Grail System were, you're no slouch in the ritual department. Making rituals is a breeze for you and those you personally make often turn out to be half again as good as you'd expect. It's dealing with stuff that already exists where you come into your own. Loopholes, tricks and abuses of the system just seem to pop up in your mind whenever you're working with a magical ritual someone else has created. Every now and then, you'll even find yourself being led to loopholes you had no way of knowing about, stuff that needed knowledge you couldn't have had till then. It's nothing to worry about."
600,Book of Secret Arts,Duel Monsters - Shadow Realm,"You won’t find this book in the library of Endymion. It holds 3 forbidden spells: The Change of Heart, the Monster Reborn, and Graceful Charity. Change of Heart allows you to permanently change the allegiance and loyalty of any creature you encounter with a weak enough willpower, the Monster Reborn allows you to revive a creature as long as it’s soul resides in the realm you’re in, and Graceful Charity allows you to exchange your magical energy for another kind of energy, either restoring your health or stamina...or any other kind of energy your body may have, depending on how seasoned a traveller you are."
600,Heavenly Creation,Battle Through the Heavens,"There are rare ways to create flames akin to Heavenly Flames. There are also more types of energy from heaven and earth than simply Fire. So surely it makes sense that you would be able to condense this energy into something akin to a Heavenly Flame for other elements, such as water or lightning? Some forms of Pill Lightning are already comparable to Heavenly Flames in strength. Just to do the simplest equivalent would require vast amounts of the element, for you are creating a King of an element after all. Similarly, the environment and source you take this energy from may influence the strength and effect of the Heavenly Element you are creating."
600,Library of Knowledge,Toaruverse,Having a library full of topics from mundane books to magic books of eldritch knowledge would be awesome but would be hassle to protect and relocate. With this you gain the power of a certain index giving you an en encyclopedic knowledge of all one hundred three thousand magic books of eldritch knowledge along with perfect indexing of your memories and knowledge that gives you perfect memory and allows you to retrieve information from your mind easily. You also gain a sub-consciousness that analyze and gather information or data that encounter from all of your five senses and when you encounter problems or questions your consciousness would crossed reference it from your knowledge and memories and give you the right answer with a frightening accuracy. The resistance that you have for mental poisoning even from the grimoires have increased massively that mental poisoning from the grimoires are now negligible or a minor annoyance and the same be said when facing eldritch horrors. This also makes you resistant to insanity giving creatures and events. This encyclopedic knowledge also updates every jump giving you the knowledge and information from all magic and science related books every existed no matter how rare or one of a kind it is.
600,Judgment,King Arthur,"The pinnacle of holiness. You've mastered the arts of the divine and are able to unleash energies that even the most powerful of unholy abominations will fear, with enough time you could purify almost anything. Even your very hands will burn demons if you wish and you may call a huge beam of light down from the skies. The ultimate skill you possess is the white dragon. After a short prayer you can summon a gigantic divine white dragon. It is the most powerful divine ability in this world. With its very presence thrusting life back into the land around it. That is by no means it's only ability though, breathing fire hot enough to melt castles and it's scales harder than any mundane metal make it almost untreatable in battle. Finally the dragon is quite knowledgeable about almost every holy ritual known , and most likely ones unknown to man"
600,Not as Easy the Second Time Around,Invincible,"You don’t exactly know what it is, maybe the curse that empowers you doesn’t play well with others, or maybe it is the bulwark of your being? Either way you find that when faced with unwanted magic or other esoteric energies they do not find purchase with you as they do amongst others. Curses that would cause death wash off your skin as though they were never there, constructs of energy seem to lose coherence upon contact with you if undesired. While you may not be able to wander through the flames of hell itself you will last longer than any, other than the demons that reside there. Yet, those magics you allow are embraced and enhanced by your being, healing that would be focused to a specific area invigorating the entire body, enhancements that are limited becoming more potent and longer lasting.


--- Capstone Boosted (Requires You Have Been Reborn): Something about these atoms from the future has resonated with the empowerment of your being, enhancing your connection to the here and now. Where once your resistance applied solely to magic now its purview has been expanded. You need no longer fear the effects of reality warpers, time paradoxes, the deletion of yourself as a concept, or other such effects for you are rooted within yourself as well as in the here and now. You’re rooted so deeply in fact that it may as well be considered an unchangeable cosmic fact. And to those who warp or alter time, space, or the nature of reality itself, you are. ---"
600,Give It A Shot,Arifureta Shokugyou de Sekai Saikyou,"The Liberators, the mavericks, the geniuses without peer that held the unique Age of Gods magic as Skills and tried to take down the False Gods. While they were all remarkable people in their own right and insightful users of their power, the fact that their Age of Gods magic did the heavy lifting still remains. While other atavists also had powerful skills, none were at the level of these, like you. That’s right, you now possess a Skill with the same potential as the Age of Gods magic that the liberators boasted of. It’s not like you automatically have it mastered, but the potential is there, enough to become a peer to those ancient mavericks that made the great labyrinths, or even greater."
600,Crash The Party,Arifureta Shokugyou de Sekai Saikyou,"It’s difficult to find worthwhile minions nowadays, subjects being too whinny or untrustworthy for the actual responsibilities. But why depend on feeble outsiders when you can have your own homebrew subordinates? You have a power similar to the one of Ehit, to use magic and materials to create sentient life with soul. There are a few bumps, like not being able to create creatures stronger than you from the get go, or the amount of resources needed for each new creation. Cost notwithstanding, you can’t deny the perks of your own programmable and loyal subordinates. Free will and such can be given as well, although they would still be loyal, there’s room for some rebellious streak if you go that way."
600,Black Magic,Demon King Daimao,"Dark necromancy, dark arts, and dark spells. Dark. Black magic is illegal in this world but some versions of it are allowed. You are now adept at both of those. You also have considerable training in alchemy."
600,Grand Summoning,Fate/Grand Order,"The Throne of Heroes can be quite capricious with those it chooses to release into the hands of a Master. You might aim for a Servant and get them in their elderly years or as a youth, before their great achievements. You might get them sans their most legendary equipment or in a flawed, berserk state. You’ve perfected your rituals however and learnt a method to always summon the greatest possible version of your target, combining their most suitable bodies, minds, equipment and powers for you. You’ll summon your Servant or other summon with their most powerful gear, their fittest and most appropriate physical body, their best abilities and their most suitable mental state. Your summons are effectively working at their peak ability at all times."
600,Master of the House,Fate/Grand Order,"Just because you’re a Master, doesn’t mean you can do nothing but supply mana. There’s a long tradition of Masters being genuinely helpful to their Servants and you’re one of the best examples yet. Even if you happen to be a below average Magus in other areas, when it comes to magic that supports your allies, you could help even some of the strongest of heroes. Your support magic, any magic that buffs or enhances one of your allies, is multiplied many times over in effectiveness as long as it is being used on an ally and not yourself. A spell to grant physical strength that might normally only put someone at the peak of human ability could now increase an EX ranked Servant’s strength by a third again. Every one of your buffs will be an invaluable boost to your team, making you just as vital a combat member as any of them."
600,Arcane Ancestry,Final Fantasy 7 Remake,"The blood of the Ancients has fully manifested in you! Unlike the vast majority of Gaia’s inhabitants, you may use magic without the aid of materia. By drawing mako energy directly from your surroundings, you can cast spells. Like Aerith, your combat spellcasting mostly focuses on enhancing your allies, hampering your enemies, and healing the wounded, though you could learn new spells with time and effort. With training, Cetra can also tap into the lifeforce of the planet to communicate with the spirits of the dead, gaining access to their knowledge and memories. One must approach this technique with caution, however, since the channeler also experiences the emotions of the spirits they call on. Good-natured Cetra can even help troubled spirits find peace, destroying them through redemption.


--- Mako Magnified (Requires Limit Break): If Aerith’s abilities are anything to compare to, you must be a full-blooded Cetra! Both your innate power and precision as a spellcaster has been greatly enhanced, and will only grow with practice and experience. Training will lead to slow and steady growth, while an adventure to save the planet would see you grow much faster. By the end of your journey, you’ll be able to match the greatest feats of the last Cetra. If you tapped into the energy of the planet itself, you could create spell effects that span continents. ---"
600,The Abyss of Magic,Overlord,"You stared into the Abyss, Magic Caster, but unlike others you did not flinch away. Your reserves of magical energy are heavily bolstered, far beyond what any of your peers could claim, and the potency of your spells has increased to match your newfound insights. You may now ‘overcharge’ your spells, devoting more time, energy, and magical power into them than they might otherwise normally be capable of handling, allowing you to gain dramatically increased effect as a result of it. Simple fireballs might strike with the force of a meteor if you devoted the energy to it, and even your less flashy or obvious magics can be bolstered to a comparable degree."
600,God-Ranked Magician,Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation,"Through your perseverance on improving yourself, your magic has reach the pinnacle of the Three Main Categories of Magic of the Six-Faced World and proficiency and mastery of the magic spells of the Attack- Magic, Healing-Magic, and Summoning-Magic Category-Types reached completion such that you can claim to be a God-Rank Magician of the Three Main Categories of Magic. This elevates your Mana Reserves to the point that you can cast a dozen God-Rank Spells before being exhausted. Due to your proficiency and mastery of your spells, your Truncated Spell-Casting is further improved which now allows you to shorten the incantation for any magic-spells that you can do a single word incantations. Through completely mastering the Three Main Categories of Magic has given you the ability to meld two or more Magic-Spells into one to reproduce various unique effects and natural phenomena, and this also gives you the ability to combine two or more Magic-Systems into one creating a new magic system with all of the advantages and discarding their disadvantages. This also elevates your innate talent at learning and mastering any Powers though this is more prominent when you’re learning different types of magic and would allow you to reach God-Rank starting scratch within a year’s time though it would be faster if you have a master to learn from or if you already have a foundation for it. This also allows you to invent, innovate and re-create any kind of magic or spells that you see and face with a few times of experiencing it or observing it and it also bleeds to any Powers to a lesser degree."
600,Hasty Hexer,Young Justice,"You don’t always have time for lengthy rituals; you need that spell now! You can substitute any required ritual for some of your inner energy, making a spell that would require hours of work happen instantly at the cost of making you extremely tired. If you happen to have mana or other magical energies like that within you, you can substitute those instead. Burning through all your energy in a short span of time can be dangerous and possibly fatal if you push it too far, but experienced magic users are unlikely to do so accidentally."
600,Order/Chaos Magic,Young Justice,"The forces of Order and Chaos have always been at war with each other, and you’ve just picked a side. You can only choose one type of magic by purchasing this, and you can’t make this purchase multiple times. Order magic has a focus on protection and restoring the natural balance of the world, and is capable of negating and reflecting destructive magic and energy as well as repairing objects and healing others. Order magic is also capable of undoing the damage that Chaos magic and other corruptions have done, and can ward against it with near perfect ability if used preemptively. Chaos magic on the other hand is about corrupting and perverting nature and the elements to suit the user’s will, and can be used to cause plants and animals to grow in size and hostility, as well as to create powerful magical constructs to harass and attack your enemies. Chaos Magic is also capable of transmuting objects, though not into or from materials with supernatural qualities. Both types of magic allow their users to create force fields, shoot magical bolts, as well as fly. Users of Order Magic may be stronger than Dr. Fate or on par with him depending on his host, but users of Chaos Magic are much weaker than Klarion."
600,Mystic Code Crafter,Fate/Stay Night,"You have a wealth of experience with crafting these grand artefacts, and your skill is unmatched among the modern world. With enough study, you could recreate the anti-magic bullets used by Kiritsugu or even the Volumen Hydrangium. With research you can even begin to make your own Mystic Codes, possibly with even more power than these have."
600,Legacy of the Great War,Highschool DxD,"While the War was in a time before time, its echoes can still be felt today - the clashing of holy blades against the infernal devils and their fallen cousins, sundering creation whole and laying low the creator God who led the Angels. These blades have since fallen silent, but they have not rusted or waned - and you’re an example of that. You carry a major bloodline or innate power that was passed down from those days, akin to the Bael Clan’s mighty Power of Destruction...or perhaps identical, if you call them kin. In addition to a unique and powerful magic that will be passed down to your own descendents, you have a natural knack and talent in all things related to combat and warfare...without training, you could lay low hundreds of untrained thugs and even duel an experienced warrior bare-handed. And that’s before you train or get your hands on a Sacred Gear. In time, you will bring entire modern armies to their knees with both your magical and martial might, though mind that your mana and stamina are still finite...but that’s fine. A proper leader should lead from the front, don’t you agree?"
600,Magician Savant,High School DxD,"There are magicians, and then there is the magician, and you firmly belong to the latter. You have mastered almost all types of magic and various other non standard ones. You, at the very least know the basics of every school of magic, from throwing fireballs, to manipulating space, there is little which you do not know a little of. Your control over your mana is legendary, allowing you to use several powerful spells with the reserves of an average magician. Your reserves too have been increased proportionately, allowing you to spam legendary spells. You also have a mental directory of sorts, which stores every single spell which you have learnt, and comes pre-loaded with many spells from your magic system. Whenever you need to use magic, it would look through all available spells and give you the one best suited for the moment. No matter how complex the spell is, if it is in your directory, you can do it without fail. Your body goes into autopilot and performs the spell itself, if you wish; allowing you to destroy and counter the shit out of your opponents, while contemplating the finer aspects of life."
600,The Mystery of The Past,Campione!,"Divine Ancestors, despite being little more than the shadow of their power as Gods, are still leagues above mortal mages. Hime-Mikos and Witches having to work with the measly leftovers of their power. That changes now. You have inherited the ‘full’ powers of a Divine Ancestor, enough to consider yourself near the level of a weak Heretic God. Be in terms of magic reserves, skill, mastery or sheer number of spells in your repertoire. Fighting Gods may be a tall order, but far from impossible if you play your cards right."
600,Bonds of Fate,Fate/Stay Night,"Finally revealed, the secrets and knowledge to the Einzbern's Homunculi creation methods. It's all yours. From the way to turn natural children into basic Homunculi to creating flawless versions of the super Homunculi such as Ilyasviel herself, you've gained not only the knowledge but also the expertise in medicine, surgery and Alchemy focusing on life creation to actually carry out the process entirely on your own. Beyond mere skill, your creations, when they be living beings, seem to be better than those of any other peer on a fundamental level. Life you bring into being with your magics and sciences, from this world or any other, is stronger, faster, and smarter and so on then it would normally be. You could possibly focus this into one area or spread it out even more generally with some work. Taking The Family Art in Alchemy on top of this would push your Homunculi beyond even what the Einzbern family achieved."
600,Average One,Fate/Stay Night,"You're not just some ordinary magician. You're head and shoulders above each of your peers. Magic is like breathing to you. You can easily figure out the mechanics of magecraft you encounter, absorb magical knowledge twice as fast as any other student of your level, find making new spells to be the work of weeks or months instead of years and when you actually get down to casting, your magic is twice as strong as that of any of your peers, while only costing as much as you'd normally use without the boost. You've also got an affinity for the 5 elements. Fire, Earth, Water, Air and Ether. Any spells you use involved with these elements will be a fair bit more effective than usual as well as easier for you to learn."
600,Wish Granting,Fate/Stay Night,"The unique ability of the Einzbern family and one of the most powerful Sorcery Traits in the world. You've finally gained possession of it. This ability allows one to entirely bypass the need for skill or knowledge of magic, instead using the brute force method of expending vast amounts of magical energy to replace such things. In effect, it allows one to expend magical energy to achieve any possible effect desired. This is limited by the tremendously increased energy costs such effects have when compared to what casting the same effect with the skill and knowledge normally required would cost. These base costs are built on whatever magical system you possess and prefer to use for it, though note that Wish Granting cannot accomplish the completely impossible for your chosen system. If you were using Magecraft as a base, you would not be able to accomplish feats in the purview of True Magic, no matter how much magic you put in. Unlike the average user of this Sorcery Trait, it will apply to any form of magic you possess, rather than just be limited to what is used through your Magic Circuits."
600,Holy Hexes,KonoSuba,"Spells becoming more powerful isn’t just a matter of having more mana, at least not in this world. Upgrading those spells more with Skill Points is usually the main path. At least if you can be bothered, which it seems you’ve skipped past entirely. Magic that you use now scales to your general level of power, regardless of how much points or energy you put into it. If you cast a fireball you learnt at level 1, using the same amount of energy, but were a level 80 wizard when you cast it now? You’d be summoning a conflagration that could consume half a town instead of a mid-sized fireball attack. Even things as simple as a low level voice changing spell could become a spell that allows the target to freely make any sound they wanted, rather than just a single different voice. You can still expend energy or points to improve spells, provided the spell can be improved in such ways, even more but their base level of power will rise alongside your own general power level."
600,Merlin Returned,Generic Harry Potter Fanfiction,"​There were ancient tales of your coming, Jumper. Actually, wait, no. There weren’t. But there should have been. You were born to greatness, and this reflects in everything you do. Magic is second nature to you. While you don’t get any skill or knowledge innate with this perk, nor any gifts or talents that pass down bloodlines or through rituals, you now have limitless talent in every single branch of magic apart from these limitations. Besides that, you are a genius at learning magic too, mastering years’ worth of material in days and weeks without even stressing yourself. This growth continues indefinitely, never slowing no matter what. Your grasp of magic and its theoretical framework is such that you can manipulate the very nature of it, and do so with an almost contemptuous ease. You can take apart spells, rituals or even entire magic systems, and put them back together in whatever different arrangement you like, even in entirely new magic systems of your own. Even altering spells in real time is second nature to you, changing their effects, size, scope, everything. As is coming up with entirely new pieces of magic, with due research and innovation. Finally, to fuel all this, your ‘Magical Core’, per se, is proportionately vast. You have a humongous amount of magic at your fingertips, stretching far and beyond any known metrics well into the realm of legends like Merlin and the Founders. This perk follows you in the future too, providing you all of these effects in any and all magic you become able to do. This perk is a capstone booster, meaning that it serves to enhance each of the origin capstones in their own ways. The interactions are mentioned alongside the respective perks."
600,Legendary Healer,Generic Harry Potter Fanfiction,"​You are a good person, Jumper. And this reflects in your magic. You are a healer without peer, being a master at all aspects of it. From potioneering, to tricks of transfiguration, whatever it takes to heal another person is something you are an expert at already. But a talent for healing is well and good. However, there are gifts and abilities of any and all types in the world. Necromancy, Parsel-Magic, Blood Magic, etc. While several are benign and helpful, a lot of them seem like they can only ever be used for evil. Not by you, though. You have the ability to use any and all gifts and powers you have for good and benign purposes. Blood magic can be used as a healing tool, powers that can rip the land asunder can be used to divert floods and prevent earthquakes, an ability to eat souls can be used to instead remove anycurses or maladies lain on a soul, and so on. You have the unique ability to share this ability with others, allowing good people born with “bad powers” to use their powers for good pursuits without issue.


--- Merlin Returned Boosted (Requires Merlin Returned): ​When it comes to healing people, what you do cannot be matched. Not only does your mere presence make most usual ailments irrelevant, you’re brilliant enough that conventional limits and boundaries are meaningless before you. You can cure things like Lycanthropy and Vampirism, regenerate limbs effortlessly, toss back the effects of degenerative diseases and even heal genetic defects. And you’re not limited to the physical problems either. You can help people whose minds have been shattered into nothing pull themselves back together, remove even the most crippling of addictions, and wipe away any and all curses and maledictions. You can even resurrect the recently dead, if you get to them within 24 hours. Simply put, it might take you a while, it might take a whole lot of labor, but there is no disease or injury you cannot fix, no curse you cannot unravel. ---"
600,Dark Lord,Generic Harry Potter Fanfiction,"​There is no such thing as Good or Evil, only Power and those too weak to seek it. You know the truth of this, and you. are. not. weak! Magic is a great and wonderful thing, and among its greatest uses is its breathtaking capacity for harm. You know this, which is why you’re so good at this. You are one of the best at fighting with magic in the world, period. Formal dueling, casual combat or just a magical brawl, you’re very, very good at all three. More than just good, you’re utterly brilliant. Your reflexes, your breadth of knowledge and just your sheer skill leaves the likes of Voldemort and Dumbledore gaping. But more than conventionally used battle-magic, you have the gift of being able to turn any spell into a combat spell. It might require creative application, or it may require some editing of the spell’s wand movements or incantations or whatever, but you have an instinctive grasp for the potential in combat of any spell, and know just how to bring it out to maximum effect. In future world, this extends to all similar mystic or esoteric forces.


--- Merlin Returned Boosted (Requires Merlin Returned): ​Fighting using magic is one thing. Maybe a good thing, maybe a bad thing, who knows? And really, who cares? Because you can go far, far beyond fighting with magic. You can wage a War with magic. Your abilities at using your abilities in combat skyrockets and evolves, taking an entirely more advanced form. To begin with, you can toss around wide, area-effect versions of any magic you can normally do, letting you throw your curses against fortresses and armies instead of individual people. This takes more energy, obviously, but far, far lesser than it normally should. Something to the effect of a tenth as much. And that’s for systems that actually cost any power to cast magic in the first place. You can do this in reverse also, ‘shrinking’ spells meant for battles and sieges to use them in one on one duels. ---"
600,World Walker,Generic Harry Potter Fanfiction,"​You have an affinity for spellwork that has to do with long distance magic, such as transporting people or things, even things like words or messages. Not only are you one of the finest experts in apparition in the world, being an absolute genius at every variation and technique that exists, you’re also capable of extremely fast flight without a broom, which has the curious effect of enveloping you in thick clouds of any colour you like. Apart from this, you’re extraordinary at creating things like Portkeys, Vanishing cabinets or Portals, being able to create Portkeys that can move people as gently as a mother’s touch, and portals that move people around without them even noticing it until it’s too late. Summoning and Banishing spells are trifling to you, even the most powerful or complex ones. You have a considerable aptitude for penetrating wards and defenses when building these things, so much so that with even rudimentary information about the protections on a place, you can figure out how to circumvent them, and with a bit more work you could bring them down outright. These abilities also carry over to any spells that revolve around observing people from afar, be they scrying spells, listening charms or other, similar magic.


--- Merlin Returned Boosted​ (Requires Merlin Returned): Normally even the best of transportation or observation magic is limited by the range, be it a continent or a planet. Not for you such petty limits. Your portkeys can take someone to a different galaxy or a different reality just as easily they would take them next door. You can go into both alternate realities, such as ones where someone who was a boy in your reality was born a girl instead, or where there were twins, or where Voldemort never fell at all. This ability also ensures there are such realities in all future jumps. You can also go to the connected multiverse, even spiritual or astral realms like Faerie or somesuch. This ability covers any form of transportation that you can use. Portkeys, portals, apparition, anything can be used to travel thusly by you. You can’t use it to travel to other jumps until post-spark, however. ---"
600,Legacy of Shalidor,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim,"Yours is a level of raw power and talent not seen in Skyrim for centuries, if not millennia. Your talent for magic is matched only by the legendary Shalidor and you may easily grasp, unravel, and learn even the most foreign of spells with ease. You’ll also find that your natural ability with spellcraft has also lent itself to doing more than simply learning the old. Creating new spells is something you’ve gotten quite good at as well - after all it’s nice to be able to make up something new should specific issues arise. To supplement this your body and soul are able to handle immense amounts of magicka for casting allowing you vast reserves to call upon for any spellcasting needs. Go forth young mage, you’re a legend in the making and with work and research your name may yet stand with the greats."
600,Demon King’s Power,Demon King Daimao,One of the main reasons why people fear demon kings. Possessing the most potential of anyone else while also having near endless mana reserves there is no one that can match your raw magical power.
600,Dragonheart,Fate/Stay Night,"The blood of the dragons runs through your veins now and with it, your Magical Circuits have been transformed into something greater. A Mana Core is like a magical reactor, the difference between it and ordinary circuits being like comparing a single machine on an assembly line to an entire factory. This alone would grant C ranked Mana as a Servant, equal to 3000 magic circuits of high quality, but it's true benefit is in the incredible restoration timeframe it has. Whilst unavailable as a Servant without some way to gain a living body, when it works it will restore the user's magical energy to 100% within 24 hours, regardless of how much magical energy the user has."
600,Absurd Magical Power,Generic Isekai,"Your combination of mana supply, mana regen, and magic potency is absurd. You possess thousands times more magic than other mages in this world, and it regenerates in the same amount of time theirs would. In fact, you have so much power that you can rely on it instead of skill. You no longer need chants, wands, or similar actions and non-consumed resources to cast your magic. By just pumping more magic into a spell, you can intuitively replace the effect with a superior one. One that note, you can also supercharge spells to improve the existing effect."
600,Imagination,Generic Isekai,"It’s funny how far even a high school education can go in a fantasy setting. Now, when you imagine the scientific mechanisms behind a natural process when using relevant magic, the potency greatly increases. For example, imagining the H20’s molecular structure when casting a water spell will increase the amount you can produce, and imagining a flame fueled by gas when casting a fire spell will make the flame look like it’s coming out of a Bunsen burner. The more detailed your imagining and scientific understanding, the greater the effect."
600,Digitized Sorcery,Fate/Extra,"The Magi of old had to adapt, converting the dying system of magecraft into something that could be used to their advantage within the Moon Cell. The results of their efforts are the Code Casts, a digital version of magecraft. Much like them, you can now convert magical systems into a technological variant. This will not be instant and will require a fair amount of research for you to accomplish, but it would let you find a new side to existing systems you possess."
800,Mana Breeder Reactor,That Time I Was Reincarnated as a Slime,"This is the Intrinsic Skill of God that had previously been forcibly passed down from Veldanava onto Milim Nava when she was born. It’s a skill that that allows the user to infinitely generate mana and makes the user capable of using the densest possible type of energy in the world called Stardust energy, the energy of “everythingness” and the counterpart to Nihility, the energy of “nothingness”."
800,Magical Blood,Justice League Dark,"What kinds of poker nights have you been going to? One way or another, your blood is not entirely your own. Demon, angel, dragon, fairy, Old One, take your pick of what kind of blood you want. While this infusion won’t be enough for you to be considered any sort of hybrid, it has turned you into something of a powerhouse. Even Constantine would have to admit you’re his equal in terms of raw mystical strength. You’ve also got a little more vitality, enough to let you keep highly advanced, metastasized, demonic cancer indefinitely muted, just as an example. If you don’t have cancer, then I shudder to think what your constitution and regeneration would be like. This blood also turns you into a battery of sorts, meaning you won’t need to rely on outside sources of energy for your magic and any energies you have can be freely converted into one another or mixed together."
800,Excellent Craftwork,Justice League Dark,"Power matters, knowledge matters, but when it comes down to it, skill might just be the most important trait for a burgeoning witch to have. And you’re an absolute Artist. The efficiency of your spellwork is mind-boggling. You could do more with a flicker of power than dozens of mages working together could even dream of accomplishing. Your enchantments are top-notch to the point that even a goddess might need a few hours to unravel them, if she can unravel them at all. And your sorceries are sturdy; if you paid the right price, you’d be capable of giving near any spell you know an indefinite duration. Turning a mirror into a maximum security prison isn’t out of the question for you anymore. If only you had the power and knowledge for a spell like that..."
1000,Sorcerer's Apprentice,Fate/Stay Night,"You've done it. The goal of all Magi. Reaching the Root of Akasha. Unbound by the limits of modern technology, numerous users or just mortal limitations. You've inherited one of the 5 Great True Magics...sorta. You see, just making you a master of True Magic would be horribly unentertaining. You weren't even going to be offered it until that kindly old man with the red eyes popped in and made a suggestion. You are getting a True Magic, one of the Five known ones of the modern day, but you're starting from the bottom. You have the ability to perform it without instantly killing yourself and a crash course on the basic functions, making you about equal to Rin at the end of the Heaven's Feel story without the Jewel Sword. After that? It's up to you. Maybe you might like to look for the past users, if they're still around? I hear the 5th Magic has some red haired chick as its owner. And that kindly old man we mentioned earlier? Well, he's always up for giving kids a few lessons o the 2nd Magic. Good luck, you're going to need it. Of course, any Magic you do eventually master could be taught to a student. Emphasis on A. Once you reach a high level of skill in your chosen True Magic you’ll be able to awaken the potential for it in one other being and teach them too. Once they reach the same level of skill that you unlocked this potential at, you may choose another student. Or if they drop out or die. True Magic is quite dangerous after all. You may buy multiples of this perk but only the first purchase is discounted to Magus Heirs."
1000,Playing With Marbles,Fate/Stay Night,"A Reality Marble. An incredibly rare and powerful technique. It is the forcible projection of your inner world, the core part of you, into the real world around you. It creates a dimensional pocket of sorts that draws in all those around you for a period of time, creating an arena of your design in which to fight. In this arena, you also gain a powerful new ability, such as summoning copies of legendary weapons you have encountered, calling past allies to your side, negating any use of magic and so on. Whatever this ability is, it can also manifest to you outside of your Reality Marble in smaller, weaker forms such as only summoning a small handful of the monsters within your inner self, rather than the thousands you might be able to call upon if you fully manifested it. These realms cannot last forever, the World around you exerting immense pressure because of the changes you have made to reality by the use of this. Thus, no Reality Marble can last longer than a few minutes, though experience and skill improves this over time. Your Reality Marble is based around a concept of your choosing though no matter what it's base is, it cannot be any stronger then the Reality Marble that one Emiya Shirou eventually becomes able to create as the Heroic Spirit- Archer. Unlike normal users of this ability, your mind will not be twisted or changed in any way through the purchase or use of this. You will also begin with a great deal more skill in the use of the power, the equivalent of twenty years of training in the ability, enough to make it last for a full 30 minutes before you are too tired to maintain the field for any longer and must rest the ability."
100,Talismonger,Overlord,"This class bears a lot of similarities to classic oriental magical traditions in that you cast spells via the use of special talismans that you can create. Only you can use the talismans you create (unless the other person has ‘Use Any Magic Item’). You’re not quite as focused in the arcane side of things as an Arcane Caster, and not as good at divine magics as a Divine Caster, but you make up for it in dabbling in both at the same time and having a fair amount of exotic or otherwise unconventional magics you can call up. Where you really shine though is that you can prepare talismans with specific spells ahead of time, allowing you to effectively ‘cast’ those spells when you’re not in combat and then keep them in reserve until they’re actually needed. In this fashion you can dramatically increase your combat endurance via intelligent preparation. Crafting these talismans takes you a bit of time, effort, and some resources and they’re only one use, but it’s dramatically easier and cheaper for you to do than anyone else could ever possibly hope to claim. Just starting out you know a fair amount of spells to inflict negative maladies upon your foes, and defeating a large group of armed warriors is as simple for you as cast a few of your magics and then letting time do the rest.


--- (Requires Realm of Heroes): In the Realm of Heroes you have a fairly even mix of both arcane and divine spells, however your spells in those disciplines are not as powerful, broad in scope, or quite as versatile as an individual that specialized in those classes. Your single and area target debuffs and curses however are substantially better than either by a considerable margin. You will be able to inflict a large variety of negative status effects, such as confusion, insanity, vertigo, torpor, poisons, the more powerful ‘toxins’, polymorphing, petrification, instant death effects, and more. You bread and butter, such as it is, is that you are capable of debilitating foes, whether they come individually or in large groups, to such devastating effect that often times the battle is won without you having to deal any ‘direct’ damage at all. You are equally skilled at defending against such maladies. In addition your Talismans can now hold two spells at a time, however they must be the same spell. ---


--- (Requires Level One Hundred): At Level One Hundred your abilities have hit their peak. Your spells and debuffs can now affect entire armies of individuals all at once, wreaking utter havoc amongst your foes with singular castings. You could easily poison small cities all at once, or leave an army of statues standing in a field with only the slightest bit of effort. Your debuff and debilitation spells are still your main workhorse, however you know an even mix of both arcane and divine spells of up to the 9th tier, with your 10th tier spells being filled out with your class specific spells. Your talismans can now hold three of the same spell at once. ---"
200,Chakra Books,Marvel Cinematic Universe Vol. 2,"It can be difficult for those who are unaware of the world around them to grasp that they know nothing. It can also be difficult to show them just how small their worldview has been all this time, or help them. But the first step to learning is awareness. This is a substantial supply of books regarding the body, such as a map of the nervous system, MRIs, and more importantly, chakra points and how to open them. These maps for the body will help bring awareness to would-be students, and how to show them the wonders of the world or themselves. For an additional undiscounted 100CP, you may also gain a substantial collection of spellbooks that will assist in helping yo learn the formation of spells, the art of drawing energies to power them, and the basics in casting them Just be aware that the warning labels come AFTER the spells."
200,Daoist Arts,Campione!,"An Asian form of spellcasting, based on the Feng Shui, Astrology, and other traditional Asian beliefs and centered in the manipulation of qi. Doubling as a type of martial art, it gives the practitioners several advantages that other mages lack, including the ability to cast spells with a set of movements instead of words and manipulating qi (life force) for a myriad of effects. You start with a great grasp of the basics and some advanced techniques, your talent being enough to master this art in a few years of practice."
200,Magical Tradition,With This Ring,"Earth has many magical traditions that can grant amazing powers. You gain a journeyman’s level of education in a tradition of your choice. You can learn the hermetic traditions of Europe practiced by the White College and Merlin (what may be considered traditional wizardry, staff with a knob on the end is optional), druidic magic as practiced by Cornwall Lad to manipulate the elements and weather, Atlantean magic and its powerful biomancy and hydrokinesis, Heavenly magic’s dual focus on healing and purifying its targets of such things as illness and foreign or demonic influence as well as drawing power from the Source and the Silver City. Demonic magic bears a focus on sharing or stealing power, corrupting and empowering others with sin, and the summoning and binding more typical of devilish cults. You can even pick to learn the arcane traditions of Martian sorcerer priests, focused on mental manipulations, alterations, and enhancements. This may be purchased multiple times to gain multiple traditions."
200,Fulfillment of the Contract,Duel Monsters - Shadow Realm,"Summoning Ritual Monsters is often a costly endeavor in terms of magical reagents and whatever else the creature will desire. You may not want them around, either, but...you’ve found a workaround at least. You can create a “Contract” with a Ritual Monster or a similarly powerful and alien beast, now. This mystical pact will grant you a measure of that being’s power as long as you stay to the precepts of the contract, which is often decided by the Ritual Monster themself(though you’re free to bargain with them safely.)"
200,Specific Specialization: Summoning,Overlord,"You are really good at summoning magics. Creatures you call up are more powerful, longer lasting, and often tend to have special abilities they wouldn’t otherwise have. Maybe you called up frost wolves that have a chill aura rather than regular wolves, or maybe that fire elemental you called up can spawn more of itself that will then also fall under your control. This explicitly works with summoning magic you know even outside of this jump, granting your summoned creatures extra strength and abilities thematic with their nature. If you were to purchase this alongside the Augmented Summoning innate talent your magical summons would be fearsome indeed. Why bother dealing with something yourself when you could send a disposable minion to do it for you? The perfect ability for masterminds (or the lazy). Summons made via the Ranked Magic system are perfectly loyal to you unto death, and you’ll find that with this that loyalty applies even to summons via other magic systems. Creatures and beings of godlike power, however, may be able to resist the enforced loyalty clause. Summon Mab or Cthulhu at your own risk. Additionally most summons are temporary, and the enforced loyalty is only in effect while they are serving as your summon. Keep in mind when using summons from other jumps that some summoned creatures have long memories, and may seek you out on their own if they feel you abused your influence over them."
200,Innate Talent - Magic Item Creator,Overlord,"You’re really, unnaturally, good at making magic items. If you know how to make something then you can make it magical. Spoons, bowls, armor, books, weapons, toasters, anything. You actually have to know some magic in order to enchant items with a magical effect, and you don’t gain any skills in actually making items, so if you want to make magic swords you’ll have to learn some magic and then how to make regular swords first. You can copy down into scrolls any spell you know, which others can use to learn those spells (if they are capable of using that magic system and put in the time to study) or use them as one-use magic items. Additionally any magic item you create will be marginally better than it would have otherwise been, regardless of whatever abilities you might have brought with you from other worlds. You don’t have to have this talent to make magic items or spell scrolls, but someone that does have this talent will always be much better than someone that doesn’t."
300,Always a Price,Justice League Dark,"It’s a mantra you’ll hear time and time again while you’re here: Magic always has a price. And while that will always remain true for you, it seems the universe is willing to negotiate. You’ve got a way of not paying the normal price of magic and not suffering the after-effects associated with many spells. Instead, you simply offer the universe an equivalent amount of energy and you’re good to go. Now of course, some of these costs (like souls or worse-than-death madness) will have steep conversion rates. But if you’ve got the juice to pull it off..."
400,Spell Absorption,Duel Monsters - Shadow Realm,"Why let the efforts of your enemies go to waste, though? Better yet, why not recycle a spell you no longer have a use for? You can absorb the energies of a spell or enchantment cast by you or someone else (though you need to identify the spell or magic in question for the latter), letting it restore your magical energies and a tiny portion of your physical health if you had sustained prior injuries. While a useful tool and good for turning enemy magical weapons into glorified paperweights, your body can only contain so much energy,and absorbing the enchantment of items or apocalyptic spells is liable to destroy your body from the inside of you cannot contain it. Also, the original effect of the spell or enchantment is lost upon absorption."
600,Alchemy,With This Ring,"Alchemy, strictly speaking, is the art of using knowledge and preparation to shape the arcane without using your own magic. This is useful for several reasons. Firstly, effects achieved by alchemy are replicable by others: any potion or formula you make can be replicated by anyone else. Secondly, any price for magic is either extracted from the ingredients directly or paid for by the recipient of your work. Thirdly, as it is not limited by a mortal caster’s power, the effects of alchemy can potentially reach godly levels of power. The Garrick Superspeed Formula and its derivatives, the Danner Super-Strength Formula (which has been confirmed to work on all terrestrial mammals and can grant a human strength comparable to the Superman), Lazarus Pits, and more would eventually be within your grasp with this perk. If taken with the perk “Bandwidth and Wavelength” this would allow you to combine aspects of different magical traditions or sources of power to create more powerful effects, such as combining biomancy, chaos magic, and flesh taken from Starro the Conqueror to create an incredibly powerful mind control system."
600,Spell Reproduction,Duel Monsters - Shadow Realm,"There is no need to re-invent the wheel when it comes to magic, even with the various esoteric schools that exist in this world, from Attribution manipulation to enchantments. You need only walk on the shoulders of giants after stealing their notes. After witnessing a spell in action, you can quickly process the steps and energies involved in its execution, letting you memorize it and potentially use it yourself. This works best if you actually take time to digest and study the spell in question, however, especially for complex or powerful spells that may take weeks of study. While incredibly unique spells you are incapable of learning (due to a lack of an innate power or lacking the energies for it, for instance) remain impossible to cast for the reason involved, you can ‘adapt’ the spell to a magic system or school of your choosing. While the costs will be proportional to what you’re substituting for, and may not be a perfect recreation, you will find the mixing and matching of spells much easier to accomplish."
800,Esoteric Knowledge,Justice League Dark,"Maybe you were wandering through a tomb and came across an ancient sorcerer who killed your dad and then zapped the lore of magic directly into your skull? That’s about the only explanation I can think of for your arcane expertise because your knowledge of all things spooky is positively encyclopedic. Traditions, creatures, spells, rituals, ingredients, myths, a stunning amount of it tucked away in your head. Your understanding of the mystical world has breadth and depth like no other. There is another benefit, however. Because this knowledge was given to you by the Hand of Fate, you’ll find that it automatically and passively updates, granting you a few tidbits every day. The knowledge you gain from these passive updates will be extremely random. But researching a topic will see related knowledge grow explosively. The rate of these active updates will be proportionate to the time, effort, energy, and/or quality you put into your study. And when you enter a new jump, you’ll receive this same brain zap all over again, instantly learning enough to make you a world-class expert wherever you go. You can choose to focus your start-of-jump mind zaps on certain cultures or disciplines. On its own, this perk won’t help you sort or recall these facts; you’ll likely still need a ton of books and notes to help you organize everything you know. Furthermore, this knowledge isn’t total. Every brain zap will only cover about 50% of a setting’s traditions so there will still be many secrets for you to discover. If you want to upgrade this perk, you may spend 300CP to boost your knowledge to 67% of the world’s traditions. And you can spend another 200CP to boost it again to encompass 75% of in-jump esoterica. With an additional (and final!) cost of 100CP, you’ll start with an 80% understanding of mystic traditions. You may use your discounts on these upgrades."
0,Magic Circuits,Fate/Stay Night,"Magic Circuits are the spiritual circuits within the souls of any Magi, though they also form a nervous system-like physical representation on the body. These not only generate prana, the basic magical unit made through the combination of Mana and Od, but are also what allows any Magus to manipulate their energies to cast magic. They vary greatly in number and quality between individuals. Strenuous use of them can cause pain and numbness, whilst any use at all will heat the physical body up. You begin with an average amount of circuits, 20 in total, but each circuit is of exceedingly high quality, equal to the Circuits of Tohsaka Rin. They will not naturally grow but artificial means to increase them do exist."
100,Magic Circuits (Extra),Fate/Stay Night,"Requires: Magic Circuits

You may also purchase extra 30 Magic Circuits for every 100cp you pay extra here."
