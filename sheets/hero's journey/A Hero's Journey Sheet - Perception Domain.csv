Cost,Perk Name,Source,Description
0,Paralyzation,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to lock up the muscles of a target’s body, paralyzing them. It can work on just about anyone, but has severe limitations with its use. The user requires three seconds of sustained eye contact with the target before activation. Additionally, either party breaking eye contact causes the effects to wear off."
0,Interject,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user has the ability to disrupt a target’s chain of thought by interrupting them as they speak. This causes them to completely lose track of whatever they were talking about, allowing the user to stop speeches or arguments in their tracks. No long term memory effects."
0,Mustard,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk has small antennae that give them an acute sense of gravity, allowing them to always tell up from down even while disoriented. This inherently gives better coordination as the user is able to twist and flip while always knowing up from down. It also gives a general sense of day and night by sensing the moon’s pull. The user of this Quirk gains no inherent additional agility to better make use of their Quirk, needing to become better at it themselves."
0,Peeper,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user has x-ray vision, allowing them to see through solid objects and surfaces to peer at what’s beneath. The thicker and/or denser something is, the more difficult it is to see through. Perception of what lies underneath becomes blurrier and unclear. Difficulties begin with anything thicker than your pinky finger. You really should be careful where you’re aiming this. Some things are better left unseen."
0,Brail,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user has a heightened sense of touch that has a complex interaction with the language processing sections of the brain. Through this, the Quirk user is able to read from physical mediums of writing such as magazines or books by simply laying their hand on the cover. The Quirk user must know the language they’re attempting to read. Doesn’t work with text not recorded in a physical medium, such as that on a computer screen. Only a few times faster than reading it through ordinary means."
50,Enhanced Sense - Sight,Justice League Unlimited,20/10 vision by default and eyes so healthy you'll never develop any visual impairments. Not only is your vision perfect you're also capable of focusing and magnifying your vision to clearly perceive things on a microscopic scale or from several hundred feet away.
50,Enhanced Sense - Hearing,Justice League Unlimited,"From listening to the quietest of background conversations to hearing a signal normally inaudible to the human ear an entire city away, you can clearly perceive pretty much any sound within a massive area, however you'll have to filter out most of the background noise in order to keep yourself from going insane."
50,Enhanced Sense - Smell,Justice League Unlimited,"Hunt someone down by the scent of their blood or detect hazardous substances from several hundred feet away, your sense of smell is better than that of many animals on earth and can be used as a valuable tool in things like hunting or detective work."
50,Enhanced Sense - Taste,Justice League Unlimited,"Your taste buds are so sensitive that you can detect flavors from across an entire room, and tell if something's poisoned or expired with 100% accuracy. After enough time you could probably use this ability as a limited substitute for your actual sense of smell."
50,Enhanced Sense - Touch,Justice League Unlimited,"Your sense of touch is sharp enough to detect the faintest bit of texture, movement, and temperature of anything you come in contact with. You could feel out an imperfection on something that looks perfect or even tell when someone’s approaching you by the sensing the subtle shifting air currents."
100,Sherlock Scan,Generic First Jump,"When examining a location, object or situation, the parts of it that are important or relevant to you in some way will stand out, calling your attention to them, without distracting you from your surroundings."
100,Collector’s Eye,Generic First Jump,"You can always tell if an item, technique, person or whatever will fit into your collection. You can also instantly determine an object’s value and have a perfect memory for the contents of your collection."
100,Zoom,My Hero Academia,"This Quirk allows the user to zoom with their eyes to see farther away with greater detail and clarity, with a maximum range of 5 kilometers. The user of this Quirk narrows their peripheral vision as they zoom, causing them to potentially miss things readily apparent in their default line of sight while focused on something far away."
100,Infrared Ray,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to scatter infrared rays that they can use to sense their surroundings in every direction well enough that they could function fine while blind. This increase’s one’s situational awareness. The Quirk picking up on things outside of human perception allows a limited ability to sense someone’s emotions by focusing in on them. The sense is hazy unless focused however. The infrared rays may be scattered and disrupted by certain kinds of electronics and sensors as well, nullifying its usefulness."
100,Echolocation,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk’s ears and vocal chords are specially adapted, allowing them to project infrasonic screeches that bounce around the environment before returning to them. The sounds they get back give them a clear picture of their surroundings, allowing them to navigate even in an otherwise void of sensory deprivation. Materials that can absorb sound and loud, constant noise that can drown out your screeches can render the sense hazy and hard to use"
100,Ultraviolet,My Hero Academia,"This Quirk gives the user the ability to see the ultraviolet light. This allows the Quirk user to see colors that others can, enhance perception of certain chemicals within their surroundings or locate objects in less than optimal conditions like certain insects in the dark. The utility in tracking and forensic analysis is not to be underestimated. The downside is that it can’t be turned off, and the world wasn’t really designed for someone with your eyes. You detect messes that others can’t see and that can be real gross. Ignorance is bliss."
100,Watchmaker,My Hero Academia,"This Quirk grants the user microscopic vision that can be used to inspect whatever the user is looking at in extremely fine detail. If desired, the user would be able to scan each individual pore on a target’s face, or observe microscopic organisms like amoeba. As an added benefit, the user has the ability to make excessively fine, controlled movements for use in interacting with the details the user is able to observe. Due to the nature of the ability, the user tunnel visions extremely hard when in use, causing them to lose perspective even over things in front of their face. Takes a moment to zoom in on features, requiring steady observation."
100,Killing Intent,Akame ga Kill,"While the ability to sense killing intent is hardly rare in this world, such that it could be considered an essential skill for soldiers. You however can sense even the smallest amount of killing intent that someone directs towards you, insuring that you will almost never be taken unaware. With a bit of time, or something to enhance your senses you might be able to detect particularly bloodthirsty people, and their general direction. Works of course better at detecting people the more bloodthirsty they are, and the more killing intent they release. Also helps to judge how powerful a person is when releasing their bloodlust."
100,Players on the Board,Marvel Cinematic Universe Vol. 2,"There are days where people say you have trust issues. That you are too paranoid. Of course, all you have to do is point to the grubby little HYDRA agents trying to leech money off of you like a parasite for them to shut up and realize why you're like this. As you spend time with people, you'll notice their quirks and little things they say. Over time this adds up, and you'll be picking out who your subordinates are REALLY working for, separating true loyalty from the backstabbers."
100,Internal Affairs,The God of Highschool,"When it comes to an organization with the size and reach of Nox, it’s almost impossible to keep out absolutely every spy and rat. Nox reaches across the entire world and has hundreds of thousands of members, potentially even more. Now while you can’t spot each and every single little leak, you’ve got a sense for when individual factions are forming within any organization you are a part of. You’ll be able to find these factions out and get the details on them without being noticed, even if they’re not working against the organization from within. A secret group policies your organization without the knowledge of the majority of the members? You know what they do and who they are. A shadowy board of directors each lead a different group that compete for their own interests? You’ll know whose allegiance belongs to whom. When it comes to sniffing about the power politics in your group, there’s no one better then you."
100,Leaf on the Water,Dragon Ball,"Ki is a life energy that flows in all things, even if it’s a miniscule amount due to lack of training or focus. You are able to sense the presence of living beings through it, pinpointing their location through their life energy. This obviously can’t detect artificial beings made of machine, but your sensory range starts at the size of a small town, and can eventually sense even further than that with training. You also get a vague idea of how strong they are compared to you."
100,Helping Hand,Toaruverse,For some reason you can’t help but stick your nose on where it doesn’t belong since you could not ignore someone in trouble. By sight alone or having conversation with them through the phone you can recognize the signs of someone are troubled by something or someone. Through this you gained preternatural ability know what words to say to gain their trust so they would tell confess their troubles with you. This also helps you make it easy to convince someone to confess their secrets if the said secret af ects you or someone you’re trying to help.
100,Protection Detail,Star Wars: Attack of the Clones,"It might not be the most glamorous job, but it’s certainly an important one and you’re rather good at it even if those you are protecting are actively making it more difficult for you. You can sense when those you want to defend are in immediate danger, and you have such precision with your weapons and abilities while protecting others that you will not accidentally harm them in the process. When acting in the defence of another you could slice apart small but deadly creatures on a sleeping person’s pillow without hitting the person or even damaging their pillows."
100,Lift Their Hearts,Rise of the Guardains,"Who are you, Jumper? What is your Center, your core? What have you, as a Spirit, sworn to inspire? Choose wisely, because whatever it is, it’s a part of how you see the world now. When you look at a person, you can see how your Center affects them, how present it is in them and their life, whether they need more of it or less of it, and how to bring it out in them. It’s all fine and dandy to never lose what your Center means to you, but sometimes it’s better to look outwards than inwards and see what your Center means to others."
100,See If You Believe,Rise of the Guardians,"Spirits can only be seen by children who believe in their existence. But with this Perk, you can see Spirits even if you don’t believe they exist. Post-Jump, this allows you to see through invisibility, SEP fields, and other non-mundane forms of stealth."
100,Natural Instinct,Pokemon Mystery Dungeon,"Humans have lost most of their natural instincts in favor of reason and the like. Likewise Pokemon who have formed larger, more intricate societies, gave up their more powerful combat instincts in favor of other skills and mindsets. You didn’t. Your senses are sharper, your combat instincts more pronounced and your spatial awareness is only matched by Lucario and their like with their Aura vision. Regardless of your form, you will never lag behind in any of these fields compared to the greatest of each that you know."
100,I Need a Hero!,Fate/Stay Night,"A hero is one who is noted for their courageous and noble acts. What's one of the most noble acts one could do you ask? Why, helping other people of course! For you, helping people is like instinct. You always know when someone needs help near you but also a rough idea of how they need help as well as some idea of whether you can help them or not. Never need you waste your time helping someone who can't be saved again! What's that? A real hero tries to save even those who can't be saved? I suppose you'll be needing Patience then. The patience to put up with a year or two of being friends with a real ass of a man while trying to save him from himself."
100,Radar,Demon King Daimao,"You can sense where others are based on if they have mana. This equals out to a short distance but can be extended further with adequate training, meditation, and concentration."
100,Doomed Planet,Superman: the Animated Series,"You have a natural intuition for natural and unnatural disasters. You can feel twisters, earthquakes, and artificial explosions long before they happen, and the bigger the calamity the stronger and earlier the feeling. A small flood would be a slight feeling, while massive planet ending cataclysms will be a heavy and unmistakable sensation. After a while you will start to get familiar with the flavor of each kind of disaster and be able to recognize it easily."
100,"Stay Aware, Stay Safe",KonoSuba,"A little bit of warning can make a world of difference. Knowing that someone is out there on the hunt for you lets you prepare for the fight and even a hint of what kind of foe starts you off with an advantage. Whenever you have an enemy or there exists a being in the world that is likely to become a threat to you, you’ll be aware of their existence. You won’t know where or who they are or why they are a threat but you will know of their level of power in relation to you and be aware of what sort of being they are. An ordinary human, a Goddess, a mage and so on."
100,Cosmic Awareness,Star Trek – TNG + DS9,"You have the incredible supernatural ability to perceive alterations in Space-Time. You'll be able to instantly know when your surroundings have been altered. This ability allows you to perceive changes made by events, (Singularities.) objects, (Mind altering artifacts.) people (Q.) and creatures. (Giant energy beings.)"
200,Evaluation,Generic Fist Jump,"When you don’t have any background knowledge, you need to be able to read a situation quickly and effectively, and most of all, you need to figure out who you can take, and who you need to avoid. With this, you have a perfect sense for how dangerous a person or situation is, both to you and in general."
200,Always Ready,Demon Slayer,"A Demon Slayer has to be ready for anything on the battlefield and willing to accept that their lives, from the moment that they choose to join, are a battlefield in and of themselves. As a result, you’ll never catch a Demon Slayer by surprise, which now applies to you. You have an uncanny sense of when things aren’t as they should be, preparing you for ambushes and traps ahead of time as if they’d never been hidden - should your foes try to catch you off guard, they’ll find they’ve only given you an advance warning. While this won’t give you exact information on the danger, it will provide you enough detail to avoid stumbling into harms way and allow you to react appropriately when the danger is triggered."
200,I Can See!,Dragon Ball Z,"There’s no need for flowery language here: skilled fighters in this world are FAST. Faster than the naked eye or ordinary reflexes could keep up with, or even faster than a speeding bullet. Lucky you, you know how to keep up. While your own movement speed and reflexes may or may not be up to par, your mind and eyes can follow the motions of things and people moving at supersonic speed with ease. With this, you will never be lost upon spectating a fight or following the speed of an opponent heading towards you at full force. You will still need to train yourself or gain the ability to keep up with such velocity...but it’s far from impossible, now. Take care - somethings may still be too fast for you to follow if the gap is too wide."
200,Trajectory,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk casts a 20-meter by 20-meter cube shaped grid of awareness around them made up of numerous smaller blocks just four centimeters wide each. The user of this Quirk measures speed, rotation, mass, shape and trajectory of anything that passes through one of the six walls of one of these smaller cubes, allowing them to calculate where it came from, where it’s going and how fast it’s going to get there. The more walls something passes through, the easier it becomes to predict and react to it. This Quirk can quickly allow the user to measure and adapt their motions to become more and more precise. The nature of this Quirk means information doesn’t come in smoothly. If something for whatever reason instantly changes direction while inside a cube, the user’s predictions can actually cause them to be caught off guard."
200,Diagnosis,My Hero Academia,"This Quirk can be used to give the user incredible amounts of varied and specific knowledge on the body of those visually observed. With this power, the user is able to get precise measurements of all kinds, age, medical conditions, broken bones, birth marks and more. The longer the user continues to observe a target, the more details they are able to learn, almost endlessly. Useful for locating enemy weaknesses or applying medical treatment in equal parts. The user must continue observing for additional details and observe a target in person. Collected details through this Quirk can be remembered incredibly well."
200,Lie Detector,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user is able to detect a number of things from nearby individuals, including their heartrate, breathing and perspiration. These tells and how they’re processed allows the Quirk user to determine the current mood of those around them, as well as if they’re currently lying. The Quirk user is unable to turn this power off, often feeding them too much information about those around them. A world without lies isn’t what it’s cracked up to be."
200,Situational Awareness,Toaruverse,"Others may only have five senses but you are dif erent and unlike them you have a sixth sense or also known as instinct, this allow you to sense any danger to yourself especially if their harmful and dangerous to you. It also allows you to instinctively position your body to minimize the damage that you would receive or dodging it all together so long it’s not beyond of your body’s capabilities and if you have the ability or powers that would allow you to dodge it or protect you it would unconsciously activate to help you.

With this you gained a preternatural ability to sense any crimes and injustice around you along with those who are planning to commit a crime. This also gives you an incredible deductive and analytical ability at solving crimes, puzzles and riddles as the more complex and hard for them to be solve, your deductive and analytical ability scales up to the dif iculty. Just seeing the crime scene alone would allow you to guess what caused someone’s death or accident to happen and as you grow more experienced and faced identical things before would allow predict and guess who the criminal or solve puzzles and riddles instantly."

You gained a preternatural ability to know and sense if someone or a group that you’re fighting or having conversation knows your weakness be it superficial or complete knowledge of it.

200,Seer,Dragon Ball Z,"​: When your friends can fly around a planet in a few hours of time, it can be a little annoying trying to keep up with things and people. Luckily, you have a solution. Those with ki training can sense energy levels at increasingly distant ranges, depending on how strong or powered up the target is, with those actively using it being the ‘brightest’ and easiest to detect. You can now close your eyes and accurately view the scene from your target’s perspective and the area around them, able to watch and hear events unfold around them as if you were right next to them. The only limitation is your ki sensory range, and things that may block ‘scrying’ this way."
200,Emotion Sense,Demon King Daimao,You are able to sense emotions in a short range around you and tell where they’re coming from. This too can be improved like Radar.
200,My World,Naruto,"In this world illusions or as they are named Genjutsu are one of the most prevalent disciplines of the ninja arts. Masters of these arts can control the senses of their target by manipulating the chakra in their central nervous system. Through clever application, they can manipulate targets to do whatever they desire. There is one famous genjutsu where, upon being snared, the target could be trapped for decades in the hands of the caster, causing them to be at their absolute mercy. With this perk, you have been rendered completely immune to all types of hallucinations and illusions of any kind, regardless of the caster, source, and power behind it. Even the famed Tsukuyomi and Infinite Tsukuyomi would be rendered harmless against you. So, no being stuck with three days of torture and forced to watch your entire family being killed constantly."
200,Search and Locate,Tate no Yuusha no Nariagari,"Life is sometimes unpredictable. There would be times that you would be separated from your companions and you need to find them without clues. Finding your missing companions is easier than before. As you now have the ability to innately know which direction your companions, party members, pets or familiars are regardless of distance even separated by dimension or a different world. When you’re actively looking for them you are likely to come across information and clues about their situation. If there is something blocking you from reaching them you’ll find a way to remove or bypass this obstacle."
200,Flimsy Paper,Medaka Box Abnormal,"Never been much for a stable view on life or reality, you’ve got a sense for when the medium around you has changed. You’ve grown used to the constant feeling of creation as some author writes you into a story but when an unplanned change happens, you’re always aware of how and when that change has occurred. When someone warps or alters reality in the setting that you are in, you are instantly aware of that event’s time and place and what has been changed."
200,Observation,Flow,"You’ve got a keen eye on you more so than the rest of people here. With a mere glance you can analyze a person and know their motivation, current emotional state, who touched them at summer camp, and any powers they have even if they are hidden from supernatural senses. Even picking up on an enemies weakness with just a look is within your grasp. With that sight beyond sight, you’re immune to any and all illusions, mind altering, and pretty much anything that tries to trick your senses."
250,Byakugan,Naruto,"The Kekkei Genkai of both the Ōtsutsuki and Hyuga Clans. This bloodline grants the bearer near 360 degree vision around themselves, with the only blindspot being a narrow space above the first thoracic vertebra. The exact range of the Byakugan is dependent on the user and can be improved with training. Your Byakugan starts out with a very generous one kilometer range. Barring barriers made of chakra there is nothing the Byakugan cannot see through. And yes, you pervs, that includes clothes. Of course, just because you can see anything within a range doesn’t mean you can view it all at once unless you possess a powerful enough brain and multitasking skills. The Byakugan can see chakra and can even distinguish clones from the original. Due to its ability to see through most objects, the Byakugan can see inside the body and even the chakra pathway system. In future Jumps that do not possess chakra, the chakra-viewing abilities will translate into seeing energy and lifeforce, or other energy types inherent to the setting. You may choose for your Byakugan to be in both eyes or only one, with no effect on the capabilities it grants. You can choose to merge this with other dojutsu and choose what it looks like. You receive one free purchase of Specialist focused on Gentle Fist Taijutsu. You may start as a member of the Hyuuga Clan for no added cost if you wish to do so, with a guarantee that you will not be marked by the Clan’s juinjutsu if you choose to be a member. The Ōtsutsuki possess an enhanced version of the Byakugan, as described in the Otsutsuki Race."
250,Tenseigan,Naurto,"Requires: Byakugan

For an extra 500 PP, you also possess the Tenseigan, the Byakugan’s ‘evolved’ version. These eyes bestow the ability to manipulate gravity similar to the Deva Path of the Rinnegan. They also grant access to a unique Chakra Mode. This form enhances the physical abilities of the user to the point where they can go against Naruto Uzumaki’s senjutsu-enhanced Nine-Tails Mode. This mode also grants access to 10 Truth Seeking Balls and access to all five nature transformations as well as Yin, Yang, and Yin-Yang Release. The balls can also be imbued with the user’s Chakra to amplify their power and can be freely controlled and reshaped. The appearance of your Tenseigan and Tenseigan Chakra Mode is up to you. Your Tenseigan won’t ‘break’ when you sustain significant damage like Toneri’s did."
250,Eternal Mangekyō Sharingan,Naruto,"Requires: Sharingan

For an additional 500 PP, your Sharingan has evolved into an Eternal Mangekyō Sharingan (EMS). In addition to possessing all of the normal Sharingan abilities, the EMS gains two unique abilities, along with the power of Susanoo. The pattern of your eye is up to you. Tsukuyomi- By making eye contact with another person you can trap them in an illusion of your design. This ability can alter the target's perception of time, allowing you to make time flow slower in the illusion than outside, allowing you to fit weeks of torture into the span of mere moments. Within the illusion, you are God: whatever you desire, it happens. Amaterasu- This ability allows for the production of black flames that will not stop burning until the target is destroyed or seven days and nights pass. Unlike normal fire, this cannot be put out by water and will not die out on its own until the aforementioned time has passed. The only other ways for Amaterasu’s flames to be dealt with are for the user to choose to disperse the black fire, or for the flames to be sealed away with Fuinjutsu. Amaterasu can burn any material, including other flames, until nothing remains. Kagutsuchi- This is the ability to manipulate the black flames of Amaterasu, changing the shape of the flames or controlling whether it burns something or not. With this power, the user could cause Amaterasu’s flames to cover their sword without destroying it, instead letting it destroy their enemies. Shin’s Object Control- With this ability you can brand any object you desire with a single touch. Doing so lets you use your Mangekyō Sharingan to telekinetically manipulate that object. There is no limit to the number of objects you can affect with this power. Shin’s Portals- You gain the ability to create a sort of warp portal. Normally this is limited to places where other instances of the eye are located (and if you have methods like clones or otherwise you are free to use it as such) but since you're paying CP you may warp to personally branded objects and places (This could be the same mark as Object Control if you have both powers). Although fast enough to catch someone off guard, this is nowhere near as fast nor as versatile as the Hiraishin technique barring extraneous perks or training. Kotoamatsukami- A powerful genjutsu that can manipulate a target’s thoughts perfectly and absolutely without anyone being the wiser. Even being aware that they are being affected isn’t enough to free them. Unlike Kamui, both eyes share the exact same ability. This counts as 2 powers Kamui- This ability allows the user to transfer objects to and from another dimension. Transferring from the dimension can be done with varying degrees of force either simply appearing or flying from the exit point which is categorised as a spiralling void that targets swirl into or out of. Kamui can also be used to travel to and from that dimension meaning that anyone trapped there and trapped forever unless the user allows them to leave unless the target possesses their own version of kamui or another way to travel dimensions. There are two types of Kamui- a long range version and a short range version- each of which must be purchased individually. With the short range version, the user can apply it to themselves, sucking themselves into the dimension and then exiting in any location they want. This is a nearly instantaneous process, allowing the user to avoid attacks, escape threats, or travel long distances in a short period of time. To suck others into the Kamui dimension, the user must physically touch the target. Another application of the short-range version of Kamui is intangibility. This is done by transferring body parts that would have been in contact with the overlapping matter into the Kamui dimension. This can be done to anything the user is touching and wearing. The user can utilise this to travel through barriers, travel underground, and escape attacks. The long range version creates an invisible barrier space around the target, and anything within that barrier is pulled toward the centre, transferring the target to the Kamui dimension. This can be used offensively by creating a barrier space around parts of a target and dragging them into the dimension without taking the entire target, ripping them apart. The greater the user’s chakra, the faster and more powerful the Kamui becomes. For both versions, anything that has been pulled into Kamui can also be launched out as a projectile at a speed greater than or equal to the speed upon entering Kamui, allowing jutsu or attacks to be stored and released similar to a sealing scroll.  Susanoo: A power common to all Mangekyou Sharingan users with both eyes, this is a gigantic humanoid avatar made of the user’s chakra and serves as powerful defensive armor and an extremely dangerous weapon. However, it will take time and practice in order to completely manifest a perfect Susanoo, and by default, you will start only able to manifest your Susanoo’s ribcage form. You can decide your Susanoo’s looks and colour but remember all Susnoo’s appearances derive from Japanese mythology. By default, most Susanoo’s final forms resemble Tengu. Upon purchase, you gain 600 PP to spend in the Susanoo Customization Section only."
250,Sharingan,Naruto,"The Sharingan, otherwise known as the Copy Wheel Eye, is the dojutsu of Indra Ōtsutsuki and his descendants. The Sharingan grants 2 broad abilities: the Eye of Insight and the Eye of Hypnotism. For the former, the user can see chakra, though not as well as the Byakugan; it can see chakra through some obstructions and detect irregularities in chakra flow. In future Jumps, you will be able to see energy but when it comes to irregularities this will translate into lifeforce, chi, or whatever each Jump’s lifeforce is called. The Sharingan also grants increased abilities of perception, enabling a user to, for example, copy pencil movements, read lips, imitate taijutsu, etc. If a Sharingan is properly developed, it can allow a user to see even on a cellular level. In combat, a user can quite clearly track high-speed projectiles and enemies, and they can easily see muscle tension, allowing the user to more easily predict the enemy’s moves. The last ability of the Eye of Insight is the ability to copy almost any jutsu they see, regardless of whether it is genjutsu, ninjutsu, or taijutsu. They can then either use what they copied as the original user did or modify it to their liking. However, bloodline abilities cannot be copied, and the user requires any prerequisite abilities in order to copy a jutsu. Now for the Eye of Hypnotism. The user can perform genjutsu simply through eye contact, with it they can suggest thoughts and actions to the target, influence their perceptions, and in some cases even completely control them. However, while a target is being controlled, their eyes will take on the appearance of a Sharingan. Users with sufficient skill and practice will be able to control others without this visual tell. The baseline Sharingan’s final two abilities are Izanagi and Izanami. Izanagi is a genjutsu applied to reality itself, giving the user control over what is and isn’t for as long as it’s active. This is only used when the user (or another) is in danger, allowing them to negate injuries or even their death. However, performing this comes with the price of permanently blinding the Sharingan they perform the technique with.  Izanami is a technique that enthralls the target into a loop of events that will continually replay within their minds, and each time a loop is repeated, any physical damage that is incurred is healed. Unless the target can acknowledge the results of their actions that led to them being placed within Izanami, they cannot leave even if they know it. Like Izanagi, performing Izanami will blind the Sharingan that the technique is cast with. Blinded eyes will return to their unblinded state at the start of every new Jump or decade whichever is sooner, and Izanagi or Izanami can be used twice total per Jump. If you purchase either level of the Sharingan, you receive the Specialist: Genjutsu for free due to the Sharingan’s ability to cast genjutsu with a glance. "
300,Acceleration,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user is able to temporarily accelerate both their physical movement speed and perception up to the point that it appears most things around them simply aren’t moving. Although in reality this only lasts the barest fraction of a second, the Quirk user by their perception has several seconds to do whatever they feel like doing, such as throwing multiple hyper speed punches, disarming enemies who have them surrounded, dodging a massive attack right at their neck and so on. The level of heightened speed and perception is so great that there is a small cooldown between uses where the Quirk must recharge."
300,Rage,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to inflict headaches and a kind of “input lag” on the target’s nervous system by having them become angry with the user while focusing on them. The effects start off rather minor at first, but become more severe the angrier the target becomes, not just at the user but in general. The lower end might be easily ignored, but the top end is nightmarish. The target will experience searing migraines and their body will seem to move several seconds after their mind tells it too, putting them in a perpetually tedious, painful state that worsens their mood. The only limitation is that the effects can wane and even break if the target manages to calm back down to normal."
300,Transfusion,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user has a number of oddities in their biological makeup revolving around cell memory and the rapid shifting of their body and the bodies of others back and forth between a stem cell state. It all begins when making contact with another person. The Quirk user is able to phase their body parts through organic matter, exchanging cell memories with the target in the associated body part. In basic terms, the Quirk user may exchange injuries or physiological conditions with a target. Flesh and bone warp near instantly when the bodies are then separated. Broken bones of the Quirk user become broken bones of the target. A target’s stab wound becomes the stab wound of the Quirk user. The Quirk user does have some ability to displace injuries on themselves, however. The Quirk user is able to inflict injuries they’ve had in the past on their targets, the memories of these injuries kept behind in their cells. Despite their body modification powers, they can’t actually eliminate injury, just shuffle it around."
300,Search,My Hero Academia,"This Quirk allows the user to track and monitor and observe up to 100 people at once, including their location relative to the user and physical weak points. This gives a complete awareness of what each of the marked targets is doing, albeit with more or less attention on their activities depending on the priorities of the user. The user is vulnerable to being ambushed before having time to mark a target, a maximum of 100 people as previously mentioned, and loses focus of anyone who travels too far away."
300,Foresight,My Hero Academia,"The holder of this Quirk is able to see the entirety of the target’s future, second by second, for one whole hour. The user sees the future like frames of a film, and can only see the target from a third-person perspective as well as their surroundings. This has multiple conditions for activation and limitations due to its immense power. The Quirk user must touch their target, then make eye contact with them to activate the Quirk in the first place. The user of this Quirk can only activate this Quirk one per day, but the futures they see are 100% accurate barring outside of context circumstances."
300,Peek,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to slow down their perception of time to a crawl and look up to ten seconds into the future, running a simulation of events. The user is able to act as if experiencing things in intervals of 10 seconds, testing what reaction there is to the actions they take until they’re reverted to their starting point. The user is able to test multiple scenarios while paused to see which course of action may work best for them. When finally resuming time, they’ll also be able to mimic the actions of a future they played. The limitations for such power are severe however. The user can experience intense headaches with prolonged use of this “slowed time perception.” Additionally, the user only has 100 seconds total per day that they can use to see and decide their future."
300,Auto-Pilot,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user gains a secondary intelligence within their brain that scans the five senses of the user to the absolute extent of what is possible for them to perceive, even if the user doesn’t understand the information like it does. If danger is detected by this intelligence, it will temporarily take over and help the Quirk user dodge or counter. While less than impressive in words, it offers supernatural levels of threat and damage avoidance that may see the Quirk user walk away from a stroll through a battlefield unscathed. The Quirk user may shut off or suppress their autopilot if needed. The Quirk user may synchronize with their secondary intelligence, massively enhancing their senses and processing power for a short time. Synchronization however is extremely taxing on the mind."
300,Vector,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user becomes profoundly aware of kinetic energy, momentum and vectors of movement within their environment. The Quirk user is also aware of how much energy they can generate, the ways they can move and how to do so. This provides the Quirk user with great insight on how to exert force, traverse any given area, and how to redirect the forces at work around them. With great effort and no superhuman ability, the Quirk user would be capable of catching bullets with their bare hands. The Quirk user still has normal senses otherwise, and is only aware of the forces at work above. This means the material composition of objects in their environment is up to them to figure out, leaving them open to mistaken approaches, and tricks devised by clever foes."
300,Visions of allies,Sekirei,"Every now and then you’ll get visions of possible allies or even love interests. They won’t happen immediately, but they’ll happen frequently enough and you’ll always meet them after or before having the visions."
300,Super Sensory,Sekirei,"You are sensitive to other, more non-human entities. You're capable of feeling them or just outright knowing where they are or even who they are bonded to or romantically involved with if you make an effort to do so."
300,Demon Eye - Magic Power Eye,Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation,"The most common of demon eyes, magic power eyes allow the user to view magic power directly, the eye appears to be a deep green color, and has a cross-like pattern, with something like 4 extra pupils appearing around the main center pupil. Post-Jump this would allow you to see all kinds of energy from all magic systems and martial art systems like ki."
300,Demon Eye - Clairvoyant Eye,Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation,"The clairvoyant eyes allow the user to see far away, however, the ""focus point"" is difficult to control, rather than acting as a scope. The clairvoyant eyes seem to change the perspective of one's vision, while walls and clothes will stop your vision. You can maneuver around obstacles, with the amount of mana determining the distance from the user."
300,Demon Eye - All-Seeing Eye,Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation,"The all-seeing eyes allow the user to see all things in the world, even being able to find specific people, and peer into labyrinths. But a dense enough magical power can hinder the sight of the all-seeing eyes. However if purchased here you could pierce most magical barriers and dense magic power with regulating the amount of magic power used."
300,Demon Eye - Foresight Eye,Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation,"The Foresight Eyes allows one to see into the future, seeing possible outcomes. It's difficult to control ""focus point"", which in this case means how far into the future one wants to see. The further one tries to see, the more outcomes are shown to them, but these outcomes become blurred together. However if bought here you’ll only see the one outcome that they would do with the maximum of ten seconds into the future."
300,Parahuman - Inference Engine,Worm,"Your power provides you with a massive subconscious database of everything you have ever experienced, and is constantly examining all of the various data to come to make deductions based on the facts you have. Your power feeds these conclusions and the relevant information to you, providing you with nearly perfect inference and deduction capabilities, far beyond what is possible for even the smartest human being. Your power is able to work off of incredibly small bits of data and information, most times seeming to pull information out of thin air, but inaccurate information can result in incorrect conclusions. Your power is unbelievably accurate though, and constantly corrects itself, meaning you should only come to false conclusions if you push it past the things you have data points for. Sherlock Holmes in his wildest dreams looks like a toddler compared to you, and not a very bright one at that."
300,Parahuman - Thought Implantation,Worm,"You are capable of sensing all minds within a several hundred yard range, along with their emotions and their thoughts, conscious or otherwise. You can implant emotions and thoughts into peoples’ minds, which from their perspective are indistinguishable from their own. These can be conscious or subconscious, and as complex as you yourself are capable of imagining. Note that thoughts include a lot more than just mental dialogue. Subtlety and finesse will pay off more than brute force with this power, but you should never underestimate the ability to just overwhelm somebody’s mind with a particular emotion or thought. As a side effect of this power you have an incredible understanding of how the mind functions and the nature of emotions and thought."
400,Farsight,Final Fantasy 7 Remake,"The ability to intervene is worthless without the planning and foresight necessary to envision your goals. You have been granted the Whispers’ insight, allowing you to identify everything you need to reach a certain objective. If you wanted to dismantle Don Corneo’s criminal empire, you could pick out which pieces of his kingdom would need to be destroyed first. If you decided to bring Cloud home to Nibelheim, you would know what events would have to occur to guarantee he arrives. You can still be surprised by a truly unpredictable factor, and this doesn’t grant any direct control over the actions of others, but you know better than most how to make your goals a reality."
400,Aware Of Your Surroundings,Akame ga Kill,"In the heat of battle people can often be taken by surprise from people they aren't aware of. Not you however, you can keep track of your surroundings and notice any changes, never will someone manage to get a sneak attack on you while you are preoccupied. This gives you quite the advantage when faced with multiple foes, as you can keep track of all of them and their attacks as easily as if there was only one. Though that doesn't mean you have the ability to respond to all of their attacks, that's on you."
400,"One Shot, One Kill",Sword Art Online,"The term ‘eagle-eyed’ tends to be something of an exaggeration, a reference to how someone can spot something extremely tiny or far away easily and keep track of it, even if it’s moving quickly through cover. Basically shorthand for calling someone observant. Well, in your case it’s a reference to how effectively you can hit something, being able to spot and pierce a far-off target with projectiles or strike pressure points on a person’s body despite them being nothing but a tiny dot to most folk. No matter what it is, as long as it’s something you can see and interact with in some manner - whether by swinging a sword, shooting a projectile or something else entirely - then you have the ability to hit that target. Pinning a sword with a grappling-hook arrow as it plummets to the ground amidst a collapsing tower, while on steady ground which shakes and shudders randomly? You can do that."
400,"[Born Bad, Grew Up Worse]",Medaka Box Abnormal,"You were born weak, contemptible and pathetic. Others looked down on you for it but you knew it for something more. A strength that let you see all the many flaws of other people, because of your deep familiarity with those same weaknesses. With just a single glance, you can pick out every flaw, weakness and hole that someone has. Be it in their powers, their fighting style, their personality or their body, you know of every flaw that they have, even ones not related to things you know, such as them being aesthetically un-pleasing despite having no experience in fashion or beauty. No matter how someone might try to hide it, you’re able to see it. This even works on objects or organisations, allowing you to pick out all the holes and cracks to take advantage of."
400,Iron Guard,Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation,"Your childhood was a nightmare as you were often left in the woods to train to survive the wilderness and as a result became perceptive of your surroundings. This grants you an incredible spatial awareness that you are always aware of your surroundings allowing you to sense and locate people and monsters without using your five senses. This also makes you skilled at luring or gaining your opponents attention and focusing their agro towards you and leaving them vulnerable for your companions. When you are protecting someone, you know where to position yourself, where you can defend them from every threat and intercept attacks meant for you or them even without looking at it."
600,Late For A Conscience,Final Fantasy 7 Remake,"Turks are tasked with brutal work. Threats to public order are to be “summarily put down.” Planning for this, you now have a sixth sense for detecting potential threats and sources of chaos, as well as the ruthless efficiency to quash these risks before they even emerge. Your ability to preemptively intervene and strike first will both ensure the success of your faction’s goals and guarantee the safety of those you watch over. This unrivaled security may involve ugly undertakings, but you’ve never shied away from a little wetwork.


--- A Better Way (Requires Limit Break): Perhaps one doesn’t have to surrender freedom to ensure safety. Your prediction of threats now borders on the supernatural, and you may use these advanced warnings to explore more moral alternatives. Want to subvert the growing power of a rival faction? You could intervene with a bloody coup or humanitarian assistance and achieve similar results. You don’t need to “spare someone a guilty conscience” when you can accomplish the job by other means. This also works inside your own organization. Tired of being pieces on another player’s board? Your effectiveness lets you accomplish your mission, no matter what your superiors say. After all, the current head of the Turks, Tseng, rose to power even after disobeying an order to kill his boss. Perhaps morals do have a place in this world of blacks and grays. ---"
600,In The Zone,Young Justice,"When you’re in the thick of things, your mind goes into overdrive. The world seems to go in slow motion, you notice and analyze every movement for possible threats, and your body instinctively moves to dodge and avoid danger. You’re capable of dodging bullets by moving before their fired, and can easily floor a group of henchmen before most have the time to react."
600,Everyone hates Retcons,With This Ring,"​The problem with time travel is that other people are capable of using it. You now have a certain resistance to changes in the timeline. If someone alters the past, you’ll keep your memories of the original timeline as well as your new history. If someone tries to erase you from history, they will fail. Assassination attempts against child you will fail just as they failed against Adolphe Sax. If your parents/grandparents/ancestors are killed or sterilized, you will be born to others with a basically identical social standing and context. If they set the universe to loop to prevent the progression of time, you will be aware of that loop and your place in it. Additionally, this gives you insight into temporal based combat in implementations both subtle and gross."
800,Rinnegan,Naruto,"A dojutsu normally limited to the Ōtsutsuki bloodline, one who wields these eyes can utilise six different Paths with each containing six unique abilities, as well as employ all five basic nature transformations, and yin, yang, and yin-yang release. The Deva Path grants control of both attractive and repulsive force. The Asura Path allows for the altering of the user’s body, creating mechanical weapons from their body. The Human Path grants the user the ability to read the mind of any target they touch by pulling out their soul. The Animal Path grants the ability to summon various creatures to aid the user in battle. These creatures are virtually immortal and can be resummoned if destroyed. Doing so requires no hand seals or sacrifices, and this Path can be used to summon people as well. The creatures summoned are up to the user's imagination. The Preta Path allows the user to absorb chakra in any form through physical contact or by projecting a barrier around their body. By directly touching others, you can drain their chakra directly, while the barrier can be used to absorb ninjutsu and genjutsu, absorbing the chakra from the techniques as soon as they make contact with it.. Post-Jump, this is changed to include any energy. However, care should be taken when absorbing energy with potentially dangerous effects, like natural energy for users not properly trained in senjutsu. The sixth Path is the Naraka Path that allows the user to summon the King of Hell to either interrogate or heal. To interrogate the target, the user first has to catch hold of a person. The King of Hell will then unzip its mouth and release a tendril-like hand, which in turn draws out the target’s lifeforce in the form of an elongated tongue. If the target lies to any question asked, the King will remove the tongue and consume it, killing the person. If the target tells the truth, they will be left alive, though significantly exhausted. The second ability is one that repairs all damage. To use it, the King of Hell will ingest the injured body using the tendril arms, and after a while, the injured will emerge completely healed. Bodies and souls can also be transported through the King of Hell. What many don’t know is that there is a seventh Path: the Outer Path, which controls power over life and death. Using this Path, the user can revive the dead, transmit their chakra into black receivers, and manifest demonic statue chains. As you are paying CP, summoning Gedou Mazou won’t cause you to be stabbed by receivers like it did to Nagato. Also reviving dead doesn’t end up with you dying, it still however uses a ridiculous amount of chakra if you revive something akin to a whole village population. The black receivers are rods that are formed out of the user’s chakra. Not only are they incredibly durable and sharp enough to pierce human bodies with ease, the user can also transmit chakra over large distances by stabbing someone with them and transmitting chakra to them. The user can disrupt the target’s chakra and throw off their movements, immobilising them, and even controlling them if they are close enough. The chains this Path generates are powerful enough that they can suppress a Tailed Beast with ease and bind anything they touch. Finally, the resurrection of the dead this Path grants is limited only by your own chakra, meaning you will require large amounts if you wish to resurrect an entire village the size of Konoha at once with no issues. Exceeding your limits while doing so could easily lead to your demise. You can also use the Six Paths of Pain technique by embedding black receivers into a corpse, allowing you to channel your chakra through the receivers into the body, completely controlling its function. You can speak and see through the body, as well as perform jutsu through it. However, due to this, the appearance of the body's eyes are changed to look like a Rinnegan. This can be used to control one body or multiple. The most famous users are able to control even six different bodies, though there is nothing that says that is the max. When using multiple bodies, the user can see through all their eyes at the same time, and can use any of their jutsus through them. The only limitation is that techniques that the controlled bodies do not possess the prerequisites to perform, such as Kekkei Genkai. However, each corpse can be imbued with the powers of a single Path. Be warned, if the transmission of the chakra from the user to the bodies is interrupted, the bodies will stop moving. Also, the appearance of the Rinnegan is up to you; it can look like Sasuke’s, Momoshiki’s, Madara’s, or Urashiki’s. Again you can merge all the dojutsu together. Limbo- This ability allows the user to project a shadow of themselves into limbo, a plane which coexists alongside the physical that is invisible to others, barring those in possession of a Rinnegan or Six Paths Chakra. The user can form four of these shadows, with each one possessing the same abilities as the user, including out-of-Jumppowers. The shadows are invulnerable to nearly any kind of damage, with only Senjutsu chakra being able to damage them. Amenotejikara- A space-time ninjutsu that allows the user to displace themselves between spaces, causing them to instantly swap themselves with anything they desire, even if they are not looking. The user can also target objects and individuals with this technique, allowing them to shift them to another location. Even ninjutsu can be shifted to ensure it hits its intended target. You can even displace yourself by switching places with the air. However, the longer the range of your substitutions, the greater the chakra costs will be. Sasuke’s Space-Time- This technique allows the user to create portals to other dimensions. This requires large amounts of chakra to use. Pattern Recognition- This allows the user to analyse patterns inside codes and by comparing them to similar patterns. Chakra Edible Creation- This ability allows the user to fully absorb the bodies of their targets and turn them into chakra-filled fruits. When someone eats these fruits, they will permanently gain access to all the abilities possessed by the individual that became the fruit. As you are paying CP, your edibles will not cause the eater to gain a demonic appearance unless you want them to do so. The user can also absorb chakra and transform it into chakra pills that grant an immense but temporary boost in power and temporary immortality, though the amount of chakra required is immense. Post-Jump, you can do this with all kinds of energy. Absorption- ThIs ability allows the user to absorb chakra-based techniques and then reproduce those techniques as many times as they desire. So long as you have absorbed a technique once, you can unleash it an unlimited number of times, and can choose to augment it beyond the original level if you have the raw power required to do so. Post-Jump, you can do the same for other energy-based attacks. Temporal Rewind- This allows the user to warp several seconds into the past. This ability requires an enormous amount of chakra, so much that even someone like Madara would be unable to use it consecutively."
