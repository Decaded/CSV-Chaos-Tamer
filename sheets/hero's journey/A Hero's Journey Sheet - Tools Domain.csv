0,Draught of Unleashed Potential,Generic Xianxia) ​(400,"It has long been known that the human body possesses severe limits. Muscles can only strain so hard before they tear from their ligaments, bones will snap and dislocate under so much pressure, internal organs such as the brain will bruise and bleed if the body is moved too quickly and even the mind itself is limited in just how much it can store and retrieve fluidly. This elixir was meant to resolve these weaknesses, using the unlimited power of the soul to shore up the body’s weaknesses. But humans cannot be improved all at once, and even after taking this rare and powerful elixir, there is still work to be done. By drinking it, the limitations on human growth, both physical and mental are removed. The more you train your body physically, the stronger it will become, the more strain it will be able to take and the faster it will be able to move. The same benefit applies to one’s mental abilities as well, the more the drinker studies and acts upon the knowledge they have acquired, the easier it is for them to retrieve and use that information in novel and useful ways. Its sole weakness is that humans are not naturally meant to last forever so these abilities will degrade from disuse, requiring the person to train nearly constantly to both improve and maintain these qualities"
0,"The Caloric Stone (Overlord) (800): The actual origin or source of the Caloric Stone is a near total mystery. It forms only from large concentrations of the Seven Prismatic Ores, legendary divine materials that possess qualities far and away above anything else. Why this occurs, or even who first discovered the Caloric Stone, is unknown. While held the Caloric Stone grants the usual benefits of a World Item upon its bearer, providing protections against negative status, instant death, being trapped or held, scried upon, and so forth, trumping even the effects of other World Items. However, while useful, those are far and away the least impressive aspects of the stone. The truth of the matter is quite simple; the Caloric Stone is the ultimate crafting material. No matter what you are making, no matter how mighty, no matter what other materials are included, adding the Caloric Stone will make that item or bit of craftsmanship better.Food, drink, weapons, armor, buildings, vehicles, golems, indeed anything that can be crafted can be quantifiably made superior (by an astounding degree)",N/A,"by the inclusion of the Caloric Stone in its creation process, as the stone expands the possibilities and power of what can be done with crafting. If you were to use particularly mighty materials in the creation of something, say ingredients on par with those usually used in the making of a Divine Tier item, the resulting piece of equipment would be truly legendary, halfway between the status of a Divine tier item and a World Item. Obviously, and unfortunately, the stone is expended when used.However, since you’re paying at a premium, you are guaranteed to receive a new Caloric Stone exactly one month after using it, appearing in whatever location is most convenient for you. You may explicitly hand this to other people but you need not fear losing it. If separated from your person in a fashion you didn’t intend it will appear in the closest convenient location for you a day later. However if it was used in this time frame to make something then you must still wait a month for it to respawn. The Caloric Stone is utterly unique and cannot be duplicated or copied via any method."
0,"The Ring of Elru (Overlord) (800): The world of Elru was ruled by a magocracy of unimaginable wealth and prosperity, and at its head was the God-King of Elru who wore this ring upon his finger. When Elru was destroyed by the World Serpent in its attack on the World Tree this item, a World Class item, was all that remained. Magic users that wear this ring will find that the potency of all of their magics has been doubled, and that the cost for casting those magics has been halved. Additionally it provides protection against all mind controlling effects or compulsions as well as instant-death effects, negative status effects, and scrying effects, trumping even other World Class items that have such powers.These things are all well and good, but the true power of the ring and the reason the God-King of Elru wore it lies in its last two abilities. The first is that three times per day the person that wears it may cast any spell, ritual, or magic they know that requires material components, or that drains ‘experience’ or ‘lifeforce’, or indeed any other requirement... instantly and for free. The second is that the Ring itself may be used to create as many Yggdrasil Gold Coins as the user desires, seemingly creating them out of nothing and appearing at any designated point (or in the users inventory if they have one and desire that)",N/A,", however they can only create about a million coins a second. The ring itself is made of orihalcum with seven bands that run along it, each one made of one of the seven prismatic ores such as Scarlet Gold or Living Blue Soul. It is soulbound to its wearer and cannot be stolen, given away, destroyed, or lost by any method short of death. Additionally it is utterly unique, and it cannot be copied or duplicated in any way whatsoever using in-jump methods."

50,Hooded Cloak,Generic Harry Potter Fanfiction,"​This is a hooded cloak for you to wear, in a colour of your choosing. Looks stylish, and it can change to any other hooded garment at will. The main thing about this, though, is that it makes it very nearly impossible to figure out who you are. Your voice is changed, your face hidden, and your build is non-distinct. No mundane methods can pierce this secrecy, no matter how advanced. Among magicals too, only those who are the very best at these things stand a chance.

But all the same, it’s good stuff, and it’s yours. This a full set of equipment, with full armour, and one two-handed weapon, two one-handed ones, or a weapon and a shield. Each of these is one of the finest pieces of it’s type in the world, capable of laying low S-Rank Ninja and even doing serious damage to beings like the Bijuu. Moreover, they needn’t remain at this level forever. Indeed, each piece of this gear improves in all fields of quality right alongside you, always remaining as much better as its base state is to a normal academy graduate."
200,Crafting Materials,Generic Isekai,You have a collection of respawning supernatural crafting materials from this world.
200,Scholarship,My Hero Academia,"Some schools may have difficult tests and entrance exams to weed out unwanted or those not cut out for their classes, but certain people can skip this process. You have this nifty scholarship which you can use once per Jump on whatever school you may be applicable for, suddenly gaining a solid recommendation from someone trusted by the staff or leadership of the school and whatever tuition is needed to attend. In this Jump, you could use this to bypass the testing phase even for somewhere upscale like Yuuei or its rival schools just like Yaoyorozu. A special note though, adults can’t suddenly get back into middle or high school, but they could still use this to get into and attend various colleges and universities both here and in later Jumps."
200,Slush Fund,Invincible,"You now have access to a slush fund, all of the money in this fund is yours, and as far as any government or other organization is concerned fully above board with all pertinent taxes paid. This fund contains 2 billion American Dollars in buying power circa 2017. All money in this fund can perfectly convert into whatever the local currency is. Money can be withdrawn through cards the fund generates if you wish (debit or credit) or into physical and legal currency by simply willing it to appear. This fund has an additional 2 billion added once per year at midnight on New Year’s Eve. This fund can be accessed through whatever the standard is for your locale. If bought multiple times each additional purchase of this perk increases the base amount of the account and annual amount refilled by .5 billion. (E.g. buy it twice get 2.5 billion, buy it three times you have 3 billion base + 3 billion added to the account per year.)"
200,Robot Suit (Drone or Armour),Invincible,"You have a high tech suit of armour, or drone on the level of those created by Robot Rex in his final confrontation with the Viltrumite host. This suit is almost good enough to fight on par with a veteran Viltrumite in the hands of a skilled user. It is immensely durable and fast, and it augments the user’s senses and reaction times. It is chock full of high tech weaponry of essentially every kind (lasers, plasma, missiles, etc...) and if destroyed is replaced in 24 hours."
300,Devil Fruit,One Piece: New World,"One of the rarest treasures in the seas, you have come into possession of a Devil Fruit. It’s exact nature is up to you, but keep in mind there can only be one of each kind, and even the weakest of powers granted are an incredible boon. Unfortunately, the price of eating one of these is the loss of your ability to swim, and becoming weaker when submerged in any kind of water. Post-Jump this weakness to water goes away. Can be taken multiple times."
300,Supreme Grade,One Piece: New World,"Much like Dracule Mihawk and Edward Newgate, you now own one of the 12 Supreme Grade Weapons, the very pinnacle of what weapons should be. Having been drenched so much in Armament Haki, they are able to bypass any supernatural defences or immunity even in the hands of a novice, and cannot be destroyed by any means known in this world."
300,Talisman,The God of Highschool,"Hanging around your neck is a pretty piece of jewellery. Could be a golden cross, a string of pearls or just a nice little amulet with a picture of someone precious to you. This necklace is able to draw in the life energy that flows through your body, with no upper limit on how much it can store and no level of decay in what is stored within the item. At any time this Talisman is on your body, you may reach into its stores of energy and draw out as much as you want, up to the limit of what you have put in over the time you have had it. Store a little bit every day and you could find yourself with a huge emergency reserve after a few years. Why, you might even be able to crush one of the Gods beneath your feet if you let those years of gathering go in one shot."
300,The Elder Wand,Generic Harry Potter Fanfiction Jump,"​Possibly the most powerful wand ever made. Made either by Antioch Peverell or Death, no one wielding it can be beaten in a magical duel by anyone who is in death’s power. That is, no one who counts as a mortal can beat you in magical combat while you have this. This wand doesn’t protect you from thieves or assassins, and if lost in such a way, will not return until the jump is ended unless you go take it back yourself."
300,The Resurrection Stone,Generic Harry Potter Fanfiction Jump,"​This is a small black stone, about the size of your average pebble. This too, was made either by Death itself or by Antioch’s brother, Cadmus Peverell. Turn it over three times while thinking of the name of any dead person, and you may summon the shade of the person to you. The shade has no powers, but the exact same memories, knowledge and personality the person had in real life. One thing to take note of is that while you may summon anyone and they will come, they are not bound to answer any of your questions or tell you anything. You are not their master, after all."
300,The Cloak of Invisibility,Generic Harry Potter Fanfiction Jump,"​This is the third item of the set of Deathly Hallows. Again, made either by Death or by Ignotus, the third Peverell brother, this cloak is a timeless, eternally functional invisibility cloak. In addition, you don’t age while you have this on, but only when you have it on completely, meaning no part of your body should be visible. No magic except that cast by the Elder Wand, or of a similar strength can penetrate this invisibility, and attempts to summon this cloak from you fail. In addition, you can always see it unless you want otherwise."
300,Wakandan Armory,Marvel Cinematic Universe Vol. 2,"By this point, there are likely questions about Wakanda. Questions on why they would hide such wondrous technology if they had the ability to change the world so thoroughly and elevate humanity into an age of prosperity. The answer is that not every piece of Wakandan technology is applied towards peace if entities like Ultron and Klaue are any indication. This purchase grants you access to such technologies, with things like Sonic Spears that can destroy a tank when it is fired, or Vibranium Gauntlets which can fire energy blasts capable of sending entire groups of people flying backwards and subdue low-level superhumans. There’s even cybernetics here that could fire off blasts of concussive pulse waves that could crush vehicles and disrupt some forms of nanotechnology. Please be careful with who you arm with this. You may apply a discount to this if you instead take only one item each."
300,Legendary/Vassal Weapons,Tate no Yusha no Nariagari,"Be it the legendary or vassal weapon they are powerful spirits in the form of weapons meant to save the world. Each of these weapons take a variety of forms, some are meant for fighting while others are meant for support. Pick the form of your weapon, it can be a carriage, scythe, sewing set or something that belongs in a category like hunting tool. You can import existing equipment like weapons, armor, accessories, everyday items or even a set of equipment. Depending on its form most of its abilities and function will be geared towards its form but it would always have ways to attack. The weapon possesses a gem that acts as the functional matrix to activate abilities, this gem persists in every weapon form. The legendary/holy heroes cannot gain experience if they are not 1km apart but it doesn’t affect the experience gained by their companions. They cannot equip weapons with intent of using it for battle other than the legendary/vassal weapons. The weapons cannot be removed and if thrown it would appear back to the heroes’ hands. It prevents the legendary/holy heroes from traveling between worlds unless they get express permission from powers such as a guardian beast or the spirit of the legendary/vassal weapons but vassal heroes can freely move between worlds. As this is Jumpchain to be fair it doesn’t matter if you choose a legendary or vassal weapon all of it gains 4 strengthening methods. Pick a strengthening method in the Notes Below, 1 passive-method labeled as Core and 3 active-methods. Its main power is to absorb the parts of monsters, materials like rope, ore, herbs or items to unlock new forms with abilities based of the absorbed parts or materials. As the wielder of the weapon it removes your level cap that everyone in this setting has aside from the legendary/vassal heroes allowing you to level-up without limit. It has the function to automatically craft items with the limitation that the recipe must be known by the hero and only dropped items or created items by the hero can be used but the result is fixed to normal quality. Upon defeating an enemy, there is a chance that it may drop special items that include weapons, armor, crafting materials, and monster parts. This also makes the heroes immune to slave seals and other control-type curses, and inventory that can be used to store items. Grants a hero-exclusive energy called SP that is used to activate the weapon skills. It provides strengthening methods that drastically improves the weapon forms or the hero. The spoken language is translated to the user's mother language but doesn’t translate the written language. When the waves occur the weapons automatically summon the heroes and their respective parties are transported to close proximity to the waves of calamity. Then copy identical forms of the weapon and store them for later access. Even transforming into different variations forms of the weapon that grants you equip bonuses, such as stats, skills, and abilities. The variations can become mastered with enough experience, allowing the user to permanently retain the equipment bonuses even if they switch transformations, some bonuses remain exclusive. It multiplies the experience that yourself and your party members gain that everyone will reach levels that would normally take years of intense training and hunting monsters in months. Unlike the original, these weapons purchased here are soul- bound to the user, cannot be stolen, dismissed by the legendary/holy wielders, corrupted, severed, sealed, disabled or hacked by any authority, abilities or items. This gives you access to all of the strengthening methods in the Notes Below. As the legendary/holy heroes you can gain experience even fighting near other legendary/holy heroes and it doesn’t affect them too. Even equipping other weapons with intent of using it for battle is possible and the legendary/vassal weapons won’t prevent it. You don’t need permission from a guardian beast or the spirit of the legendary/vassal weapons to travel between worlds as you can travel freely. The automatic crafting only needs the recipe and the raw materials of existing monster parts, ores, herbs etc... can be used for crafting now but the result is fixed from normal to excellent. Even the inventory is now directly connected to the warehouse allowing you to take items via your legendary/vassal weapons or auto-crafting can directly access the warehouse for ingredients. When crafting manually the completed items are recorded to the legendary/vassal weapon with their recipes allowing you to auto-craft them later. The crafting speed of the auto-crafting is based on your level and actual skill making it craft faster and in larger quantities the stronger and skilled you are. The translation even translates the written language to the user's mother language. You are not limited to copying weapons in the form of your legendary/vassal weapon, as you can now copy a scythe even if the legendary/vassal weapons form is a sword. Then unlock a sword form with the stars, abilities and skills of the copied scythe. The experience that yourself and the your party members gain that everyone will reach levels that would normally take decades intense training and hunting monsters in months. Certain locations, items, skills and abilities cannot prevent you from changing your weapons forms or preventing you from teleporting. You can bestow energy to vassal weapons that lost their world to restore it into perfect form and keep it functioning, No matter which version you have both had this function. When unlocked multiple but similar forms it merges into one form that has the stats, abilities and skills of its fragments. Any monsters that you train/raise always turn into a queen/king of their race and count as followers. There's no duplicate bonus abilities from new forms, it can be either an upgrade, new ability or stat bonus. You have three forms of teleportation, 1 allows you to teleport on set locations you've been, 2 allows you to teleport on registered or nearest dragon hourglasses, 3 allows you to teleport on where you left your pins. Then transporting entire armies into waves of calamity provided you register the commander officer of the army into your party as Back-up Battle Formations. After this jump you would unlock all Strengthening Methods that you don’t have but its enhancements are only half the potency of the original."
300,Tinker Tech Cache,Worm,"You get a decent sized cache of Tinker-Tech whose nature is up to you. Whether you want a large variety of computing and programming devices, an armory full of futuristic guns and weapons, or maybe just a ton of Tinker tools for your personal use. There is nothing crazy in here, but even basic Tinker-Tech is far more advanced than anything on modern earth."
400,Police Scanner,My Hero Academia,"Looking like some completely normal police scanner you’d buy off the internet, this isn’t something so simple, and neither are the reports coming through. This police scanner alerts you of crimes in progress in your current town or city, or just in your immediate area. This includes crimes not currently reported, allowing you to rush off and prevent injustices that may have passed under the watchful eyes of the law."
400,Power Pole,Dragon Ball Z,"A copy of Goku’s own Power Pole, now tailored to your use. A magical weapon that can grow to 28 times Earth’s diameter from 1 meter, or anywhere inbetween. It cannot be destroyed or broken, but it can be lost. If somehow lost beyond your reach, you get a new one the following week."
400,Experimental Dust,RWBY,"A very complex and experimental blend of Dust. Tentatively dubbed Annihilation Dust, it seems to unravel matter on an atomic level when activated by aura. Very dangerous, but potentially supremely useful. Hopefully you can make good use of it. You receive a single crate of it which renews every week."
400,Book of The Pagan Heroes,Campione!,"One of the few Grimoires written by human hands and that possess written spells and magic inside. It contains spells strong enough to harm Gods and Campiones, although mastering them may take a while. It was based in the myths and records of several god-slaying beings in pagan religions."
400,The Level Upper,Toaruverse,"An audio file stored inside a portable music player when one listen to it, it can turn a level zero into a level one within a week for one hour of listening per day. The abilities of the user gains tends to be the abilities that they want one way or another unlike the original this version of the Level Upper has no nasty-side ef ect and traps and the only downside is it takes time for one to increase their level once they become a level one. Once someone becomes a level one it would take ten years to reach level five with one hour of listening per day as additional hours would have no ef ect and you can also spread the audio file if you want. Post-jump you can use this to give a normal person with Esper ability that they want and they would only need to listen for an hour to become a level one but the time needed to reach the level five is still the same."
400,Big Globe,Rise of the Guradians,"A large model of the Earth. You may identify a specific grouping of people, such as children who believe you exist, or people with hope in their hearts, or simply people with blond hair, or some combination, and have the globe be decorated with spots of light in each location with a person fitting that description. Updates in future Jumps, should you travel to a place where the geography is different."
400,Soul Weapon,Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation,"This weapon is crafted from a piece of your very soul especially a beautifully crafted blade and scabbard. Its initial qualities are that its unbreakable, sharp enough to cut steel in its purest form and it never dull its edge along with an ability to weaken someone's Battle Aura or Defensive Magic/Abilities. It also grows sharper and stronger the stronger you are as it has the ability to weakened someone’s Battle Aura or Defensive Magic/Abilities scales on your level of power, as Saint-Rank Warrior you can bypass a someone at the same level’s Battle Aura or Defensive Abilities and weaken a King-Rank’s Battle Aura or Defensive Abilities and etc... It also has defensive measures that only you and those that have your permission to wield it as if not the sword would increase its weight that even a supernaturally strong person can’t lift it. You could import existing weapons to gain these enchantments."
400,Magical Power Armor,Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation,"A magical armor that increases the wearer's physical capabilities by replicating Battle Aura of a Warrior. Unlike the original and its successors this version is a lot more practical that it’s small and thin enough to cover your entire body except the head along with it auto adjusts to your size and build to be worn underneath the wearer’s clothes unnoticed. The material is strong enough to take several hits from a God-Rank Warrior or Magician before being damaged and any damage it sustains would slowly be repaired completely within a day. Its main power is to grant the wearer an Artificial Battle Aura that increases their strength, speed, durability, reaction times, spatial awareness and resistance to magic that would rival an average God-Rank Warrior. It also has its own power source and can operate for an indefinite amount of time. You may import existing Power Armor or Mecha that you own to enhance them with this magic array and materials of this magical armor along with any changes and improvements that you done with it would be permanent. On the side-note those who have Battle Aura will be added to the Artificial Battle Aura of the Magic Armor further amplifying the effects of the Magic Armor allowing you to rival the Fighting God with his Golden Armor in pure attributes only."
400,Epic Wand,Generic Harry Potter Fanfiction Jump,"​Now where did you get this beauty? This is a wand, of the very highest quality and power. In fact, it might just be safe to say this is one of the most powerful, best-crafted wands in the world. And it’s made specifically for you. Firstly, it is compatible with any and all systems of magic you can use, regardless of whether or not they normally use foci. And it’s not just compatible, but actually amplifies the effect of any spell you cast with it by an order of magnitude, if not slightly more. Even spells that don’t exactly depend on power have their effects boosted in whatever way would best make sense. You may choose the boost to be less than the maximum if you want people to be unaware of how potent your spells can be. Finally, magic cast with this wand is utterly undetectable to any means other than someone seeing or hearing you doing it, whether directly or through having been looking at you remotely somehow at that exact time. This does not mean that anything you enchant with this will register as mundane, but rather no one would notice you actually enchanting it. It does, however, make it so that nothing can be traced back to you, scrambling any ‘magical signature’ you might have. As an extension of this effect anyone attempting to “check” your wand to see what spells have been cast through or with it will be unable to detect any spell use you would not want them to know about. It expands into a cane or a staff at your will."
400,Human Transformation Pill,Battle Through the Heavens,"Generally at rank 7, a magical beast is able to assume human form. This grants them the advantages of both species. That is why this pill is so valuable. Being a rare tier 7 pill already makes this extremely valuable, but this miraculous pill allows those who consume it to gain the body and cultivation speed of a human. To humans this means little, but to magical beasts it would mean that those who are ranked lower than rank 7 could directly and notably increase their cultivation speed."
400,Bow of Hercules,The God of Highschool,"The mighty bow of Heracles himself. A single shot from this bow, even from a normal human and with a normal arrow, has the power to split a truck in half and destroy the road behind the vehicle. As the user’s power increases, so too will the force they may fire the arrows with, as long as their physical strength is also matching. Any arrows fired are also coated in a weakened hydra’s blood, which will weaken any struck target’s body over time."
400,Mjolnir,The God of Highschool,"A super heavy war hammer made for one handed use. The hammer is also able to emit blasts of lightning but it’s most special property is in fact the ability of the wielder to absorb the hammer into their body. This allows the user to charge their physical strikes with much greater force than usual, imbue their body with huge amounts of electrical power to attack foes with and continue to use the usual traits of a National Treasure even with it inside their own body."
400,Walmung,The God of Highschool,"A dark silver broadsword with a bird wing shaped hilt, it covers the users’ right arm in plate armour when brought about. This sword is especially strong in how it enhances the user’s attack power, enough to make a man ordinarily able to destroy a house with one blow wipe clean a whole city block with a single slash. It is also able to enter a defensive mode, spreading the plate armour on the user’s right arm to cover their entire body."
400,Purest Holy Water,Tate no Yuusha no Nariagari,Curses are nasty things and being inflicted by one would be troublesome to cure. But do not fear this holy water is different from the once you can buy in this world. It can instantly dispel weaker curse and mental corruption or anything that can be classified as one. Even the curse and mental corruption received from the cursed series can be removed with multiple dosages from this. Upon purchase you would receive 3 bottles and another 3 every month all directly inside the warehouse. This can be purchased multiple times without discount. In the future world this applies to all types of curse or those can be classified as one.
400,The Key,Flow,"This key is something that would make most thieves salivate at the mouth for it. If you touch this key against any physical lock, no matter what sort of lock it is, then that lock will open up. This doesn’t even stop at physical locks as the key can open up supernatural locks such as a locked personal dimension. Although for these you have to be in close proximity to the owner of said locked dimension or be right next to the dimension itself before it’ll open."
400,Ace of Winchester,Arrowverse,This magical rifle was created by an unknown mystic during the time of the Old West. This .44 lever action repeater has been enchanted to never miss when fired and has the power to outright annihilate most demons.
400,Armor of the Gods,Arrowverse,"Just like Savitar you own a high tech battlesuit from a possible future. This battlesuit is made from an unknown metal, dubbed “Strange Metal”, this allows the user to enjoy the immunity to static buildup and extreme heat that’s associated with going at extreme speeds. To get into or out of the suit the user has to bend over opening the backside up, this allows for exiting & reentering the suit very rapid. When out of the armor, there is a rudimentary AI on board that allows you for a limited time to remote control of the suit. The armor is linked to an unhackable special program which monitors your vitals, speed, has an ultra-high definition live camera feed, and allows for two way sub vocal audio communication with anyone linked to the armor electronically. While wearing the armor helps corrects your gait for more efficiency and less time on the ground therefore increasing your speed. For non-speedsters this increases your movement to that of a novice Speedster, which is 200mph. For Speedsters it can only do so much but it does increase your maximum speed by 1 Mach. Aesthetically the default look for the armor is to inspire fear and intimidation, with an otherworldly glow given off by neon colored circuitry in the eyes and underneath the armored plates, the color is up to you. You can customize it to however you wish for it to look. For offense the suit possesses a thick, retractable spike mounted on each wrist. The armor is at least a foot bigger than you and with its mechanized parts and material the armor gives the user great strength, allowing you to effortless lift, drag, and send a full-grown man flying through the air with just one hand. Defensively the “Strange Metal” is extremely resilient and durable, both small arms & high caliber rounds as well as a direct energy weapon seem to just richochet off without any damage to the suit. However it can be vibrated through and isn’t to similar or harder materials. If any part of the armor is broken or removed can be telekinetically summoned back to the rest of the suit if it is close enough. Lastly the armor is very cold resistant, with the user being able to instantly burst out of being frozen solid unfazed. You may import any existing armor you own, and it’ll gain all the above properties."
400,[Normalise Solution MK 2],Medaka Box Abnormal,"A very special fluid, much advanced from the initial creation that Youka Naze made. The Normalize Solution MK 2 is a special fluid that can disable the supernatural powers and traits of any being that takes the substance inside their body for several minutes, no matter how great those powers were. After those minutes are up, the powers will come right back though. You’ve got a special, very tough injector that can pierce metal with ease along with 5 vials of the Normalise Solution. You’ll get replacements for any used vials a month after they were used."
400,Omnachine,DC – Larfleeze,"This strange device adapts itself to suit your current need. As its name implies it can do almost anything, from performing on-the-spot surgery to changing a person’s sex to transferring their consciousness into a rock and programming the body to serve you in their stead. While its offensive uses are severely limited, it's hard to match the Omnachine in sheer utility. Normally it takes the form of an undetectable and incorporeal essence about your person, but manifests itself in a form best suited to the task at hand when summoned. You can summon and reshape it with a thought, although it always appears to be made from blue energy and loose strands of lightning."
400,Purified Hero Water,Naruto,"A specialized liquid from Takigakure with special properties that is produced once every hundred years from the giant tree that hides the village. You have a small container of such a liquid. This can be drunk to temporarily boost someone’s chakra by a factor of ten, without any loss of control. Normally boosting your chakra by an order of magnitude would have a steep cost, shortening the drinker’s life by an order of magnitude as well. Yours has been purified by the power of Jump-Chan, however, and only makes the drinker exhausted for several days after the effect ends. This container normally refills at the beginning of each jump or every 10 years, whichever comes first. Anyone else who drinks this without your permission gains no benefit from it. In that case, or if it is lost or destroyed, you will find a full container in your possession the next morning. For 400 CP, this container is always full, but no single person may gain the benefit of drinking hero water more than once every ten years or each Jump, whichever comes first"
500,Canon Teigu,Akame ga Kill,"Do you have a particular liking for any of the Teigu in the series? Well then with this you can buy any of them, but Shikoutazer(if you take Esdeath's Demon Extract you won't get her timestop), and be assured that they will be compatible with you or whoever you wish them to be. Note though that this gives you a copy of the Teigu, you can't remove someone's Teigu by buying this."
600,Tech Jacket,Invincible,"Created by the Hyper-Intelligent Geldarians, it is the ‘most powerful weapon in the universe’. The tech jacket is an extremely advanced and potent piece of technology. This suit of hyper-advanced armour is capable of flying, reaching FTL speeds, giving its user the ability to develop advanced weaponry and tools as the situation demands, in addition to enhancing their physical abilities and taking care of all of the user’s physical needs in perpetuity. This armour allows a normal human with no real training to take on a Veteran Viltrumite and emerge victorious, though it would not be an easy fight. This tech can self-repair in real time and has unlimited stores of energy, along with seemingly the entire repository of Geldarian tech. The jacket is able to generate new technology based on it’s users knowledge, and is unhackable by anything in this universe. Whether the jacket has an A.I. or not, as well as its personality is decided when this item is purchased. When the full armour is not desired it can shrink down to small patch somewhere on the users body, and become weightless. Normally due to executive decree 574-3 the jacket can not be removed, however, by the grace of CP this jacket can be removed, and put back on when desired."
600,Style Book,Medaka Box Abnormal,"Now this is something unique. Styles are a power used through language but so far, it has only been through spoken words or, rarely, non-verbal but still bodily communication. The book you hold in your hands can change all of that. This Style Book allows the use of Styles and other powers or actions through the written word. By focusing on a Style that you know and writing out what you would normally say, you are now able to use it on any who read those words. You can even do this with other powers you have or other actions. By writing in the single power you would use or short action you would take, and expending any energy or other costs you’d need to normally expend, you can seal in that particular power use or action for later activation. Then so long as you can see the page, you’re able to activate it at will with a word and unleash what was stored. A spell to create several flying blades could unleash that metal torrent from its pages from a distance or a sealed in punch could send a phantom fist flying into the face of the one holding the page. You can remove pages from the book and it will never run out of pages either nor weigh more because of it."
600,Golden Hourglass,Flow,"This small hourglass is made completely out of gold and can easily fit in the palm of your hand. Besides the high selling point, this hourglass has the ability to seal any being regardless of power or origin inside it. Once someone is sealed inside the hourglass there is nothing that can unseal them internally or externally except you. You must merely touch any being in question with the hourglass and they shall be sealed forever although only one being may be sealed inside at a time. To make up for this however, you are able to use any powers or skills that the sealed being had to their fullest potential."
600,Materia Collection,Final Fantasy 7 Remake,"Though many use the crystalline magic known as materia, SOLDIERS are best known for augmenting their arsenal with the stuff. You receive a sturdy briefcase containing a wide array of these small spheres of mako. You can use blue materia to imbue your attacks with elemental effects and increase the range of your magic. Or perhaps you’d prefer to use purple and green materia to enhance your attributes or grant you new spells to use in combat? Yellow Materia can be used to augment your own powers and grant new combat abilities. Most powerful of all, you could use rare red materia to summon powerful creatures to fight at your side. Your equipment can only hold a few materia at a time, and not every materia is suited to everysituation, but you have a wide enough assortment that you could equip an entire fighting party and still have versatility to spare.


--- Rare Stock (Requires Limit Break): With this upgrade comes both power and variety. Not only do you have triple the materia at your disposal, but the individual quality of each crystal has increased dramatically. Purple materia that once doubled your health will now triple it. Red materia that once called on Ifrit and Shiva for help now summon the mighty Leviathan and Bahamut. Alone, this effect would be impressive. However, you also receive a second benefit. Now included in your carrying case is a device SOLDIERs used to fuse materia together. By melding two kinds of materia together, you can create synergistic combos, power boosts, and even brand new effects. Combine two Cure materia to double the healing effect. Fuse a Poison and Power Attack materia to create a unique Poison Slice ability. Post-jump, you may use this device to fuse other kinds of magical artifacts together. So long as a magical effect is contained in a physical vessel, such as a scroll or potion, you can mix it with other magics to create complementary combinations. ---"
600,Compass of Eternal Paths,Arifureta Shokugyou de Sekai Saikyou,"Oscar's final masterpiece. Or a modified version of it, at least. A single compass that has been imbued with conceptual magic to make it capable of finding any place, person or object. Be in this world or another. Not only it marks the way towards the desired object, but it also gives the user a mental image so it can be easier to identify the location. Unlike the original, this one requires basically no mana to use. Beware that knowing where lies what you want and getting there are two different things, and just knowledge might not be enough."
600,Divine Tier Equipment,Overlord,"The best there is. Short of World Class items you will never find equipment of superior quality than this. Gods would, literally, be willing to wear equipment of this level. This isn’t surprising because that’s usually where the Players of YGGDRASIL got them from. These provide supreme boosts to all class abilities you purchased with the ‘Class Skills’ perks. In a battle between opponents of similar skill level the one wearing Divine tier equipment will virtually always defeat the one that isn’t. The boosts that this set of equipment provides are unrivaled, and the various potent enchantments that adorn them are some of the best you’ll ever find, barring deliberate and painstaking effort on your part. Examples include potent regeneration, permanent high-tier haste effects, dramatically lowered casting/energy costs for spells and skills, extremely high tier spells/skills that can be used a few times per day for free, and various other things.Your equipment is a step further. Your equipment has not only been created with Divine tier materials, but they were also infused with the power of the Caloric Stone during their creation. While you sadly no longer possess the stone itself you do still retain the full benefit of having your equipment halfway between Divine and World Item. The boosts, abilities, bonuses, and effects from equipment of this tier are staggering and in the opinions of many “completely unfair”, leaving even Divine Tier items in the dust. However while their benefits are obscene, their protections won’t be able to stand up to the direct effects of actual World Items."
600,Power Ring and Battery,DC – Larfleeze,"The weapon of choice of the seven Lantern Corps, Power Rings use ancient Maltusian technology to harness and control the light of the Emotional Spectrum. While inert without inhuman levels of the necessary emotion, when powered it can fire energy blasts, create hard light constructs, grant you flight and an environment shield for intergalactic travel, among many other abilities. Certain Corps also have unique powers that come with their rings. Violet Rings can trap people in crystals to convert them into more Star Sapphires, Indigo Staves can teleport a small group across the universe and brainwash people into compassion zombies, Orange Rings can steal the identities of those they kill as Energy Avatars and create constructs that impede your enemies’ attempts to concentrate, and Red Lanterns have napalm blood that they can spit out as an attack. Your Ring can be sentient and capable if mentally communicating with you and other rings if you want, but this is optional. Your ring also won’t be restricted like some others. Green Rings don’t have the usual limits placed on them by the Guardians, Blue Rings can function independently of Green Lanterns, and Red Rings won’t kill you by taking them off. Comes with a handheld Central Power Battery that can create new rings and batteries and recharge them. Created rings can have custom rules like non-lethal only or brainwashing the wearers with its emotion."
600,[Ancient] Quality Item,Re: Monster,"the item is an [Ancient] quality item, which usually possess multiple abilities, such as the shield used by Kichi after he became an Ogre or Failnaught, an elven bow that generates magic arrows and will never miss what it’s aimed at if it isn’t blocked. Most [Ancient] quality items are artifacts, items obtained from a dungeon run rather than being made."
600,A Familiar Lightsaber,Star Wars The Original Trilogy,"Known throughout the galaxy as the ancient weapon of the Jedi, this powerful energy blade can deflect both laser and blaster bolts and cut through virtually anything. During the Clone Wars people would frequently see them in the hands of the brave Jedi warriors fighting one the front lines but now they’re only found in the possession of the Empire’s most dangerous agents. Owning a lightsaber is illegal and normally this thing wouldn’t be worth the risk since it’s unlikely you have the skills or desire to use it, but unlike other lightsabers this one is special. It hums and pulses with Force energy as if it was alive and whenever you touch the weapon you can feel the memories of a hundred duels flow into your mind. Within this lightsaber is the spirit of a powerful Force user. He cannot communicate with the outside world but he can give you and anyone who wields his old blade the skills required to use it. So long as someone holds this lightsaber they will, depending on their alignment, possess the skills of a Jedi Knight or a Sith Warrior but the moment they sheath this weapon all that knowledge will disappear."
600,Fragment of Paradise,Fate/Stay Night,"A single large shard of Avalon, the Noble Phantasm of King Arthur, his legendary sheath that held Excalibur. Implanted within your body is this shard, undetectable to any outside observer as it takes a purely spiritual form whilst inside your body, though you can remove the shard at any time. Whilst not near the full power of Avalon itself, thus it cannot be used in the same defensive manner, the shard does confer a vastly extended lifespan to its owner, several centuries of life in your prime at least, as well as a significant healing factor. Injuries that would take a normal human months to heal, if ever, would disappear within a week and even wounds that could not naturally heal such as severed limbs would heal eventually, given enough time."
600,Time Sphere,With This Ring,"​This Time Sphere is an almost fully functional time travel machine, shaped like a sphere several meters across. For you, however, it lacks general functionality. It can identify time travel events and temporal distortions, remove you and others from the universe to shield against retcons and broad temporal changes, and it can piggyback on other Time Travel devices and spells, but cannot travel through time of its own impetus except by simply waiting. It is locked to prevent others from using or accessing it, contains sophisticated computer systems, and will not be damaged by most attacks."
600,Cane of the Sage,The God of Highschool,"A powerful artefact belonging to the Jade Emperor. Not primarily used as a weapon, it is instead a powerful transportation and clairvoyance magical item. It can open portals to any location in any other realm without the need for meeting the conditions normally required to enter those realms and can even forcibly bring across things from those realms, from people to even bringing over an entire dimension to fuse with the current one, though these feats require a truly monstrous amount of energy to enact. It is also able to act as a scrying portal, locating almost any target with ease, though there are some locations and targets that will be able to block its vision."
600,Holy Grail,The God of Highschool,"The legendary cup that contained the blood of Christ. This simple purple glass cup is overflowing with red liquid. It is able to heal humans around it of almost any wound, no matter how severe, so long as they still remain alive. Its true purpose however, is the ability to seal the powers of heretical beings and tear them to shreds. While it requires a lengthy incantation, once complete, a golden light will shine from the cup in all directions and any God or Demon that is touched by it will be torn apart. Only the strongest heretical creatures will be able to resist death from this light and even they will find themselves badly harmed. However, this light may only be summoned three times per year."
600,Three Imperial Regalia,The God of Highschool,"A set of three legendary artefacts from Japan. The Kusanagi Sword, Yata’s Mirror and the Yasakani no Magatama. The Kusanagi Sword is a powerful magical blade that is able to summon gigantic snakes from any wound it creates in another being, which will proceed to attack them. Yata’s Mirror summons a gigantic mirror like shield which will provide absolute protection from all but the strongest attacks before breaking and quickly reform in a few minutes whenever it breaks. The Magatama, a necklace of small objects, are able to work as powerful elemental explosives, unleashing a storm of whatever element the colour of the Magatama represents and they slowly replenish over the course of a day."
600,Cauldron Vials,Worm,"A case containing five vials of Cauldron formula. Unlike other formulas these have no risk of mutation or death, being perfectly stable. Whoever drinks these is guaranteed to get a power that would be relatively powerful compared to the average parahuman. Aside from the powers suiting their host in some way (more aggressive people getting aggressive powers for example) these are completely random. These have no effect on you. The case refills itself once a year. Outside the jump these still work despite the lack of shards or entities, simply giving the equivalent of a parahuman power. The case itself is indestructible and unless purposefully given away will reappear in your warehouse if lost."
600,Artifact,With This Ring,"A magical artifact or weapon of immense power. It could be a power source comparable to the Star-Sapphire (which, in at least one universe, was converted into the Violet Central Power Battery), a weapon comparable to the Sword of the Second and Third, or even a bound spirit of comparable strength and wisdom to Nabu, willing to teach you magic or boost your power."
600,Divine Artifact,Percy Jackson,"Somehow you have obtained a perfect replica of a legendary item of your pantheon, be it the monkey king’s staff, Hades’ Helm of Fear, Thoth’s original copy of the Book of Going Forth by Day (with extra annotations and the really useful bits uncensored) or any other item that catches your fancy. Just be sure to have a decent explanation of how you got it for those who will inevitably question it. You may receive a discount on this in exchange for it being the real one that you somehow stole with the owner wanting it returned alongside your head on a silver platter, if they recover it by the end of the jump you lose the item forever."
600,Buster Destruction Sword,Duel Monsters - Shadow Realm,"The legendary Buster Blade was said to be able to slay nearly any Dragon on this land, and was a great asset in the ending of the Age of Fire as he charged the Blue Eyes Clan alongside the Dark Magician. A great deal of it was his own expertise, but a substantial amount was due to a blade like this. This sword is ritually attuned with the supernatural ability to Slay. That is to say, if dipped in the blood of a creature, it gains a supernatural strength against the creature, as if it were many times as powerful a blade(andit’s already sharp enough to cut a tree in one swing)! It can only be active with one kind of blood at any time, but you can easily switch between the creatures it will “Slay” with a dab of that creature’s blood. Manslayer, Wizardslayer, Fiendslayer...It’s only desire is to slay"
600,Space Racer’s Gun,Invincible,"You have the most powerful gun in the universe. This gun of unlimited ammunition shoots beams of unblockable might. The red beams fired by this gun can blast through every single thing it has ever come into contact with in this universe. Every beam shot will continue to fly for eternity blasting through everything in its way. The beams from this gun can outpace a veteran Viltrumite in a straight line, even in space. Please, use this gun with caution as its blasts have been shown to blast straight through planets without ever slowing down. Regent level Viltrumites would turn and run rather than take a blast from this gun head on. The final ability of this gun is that it bonds to its wielder, allowing them to summon the gun at high speed to their hand whenever they wish it. As you have bought this gun with CP you are designated as its wielder and you may change its designated wielder if you wish. Otherwise, once its wielder dies, permanently (so if you have a one-up it stays bonded to you), the gun bonds to the next sapient that picks it up."
800,The Bracelet of Arnessa,Overlord,"Arnessa was a world that prized personal strength and valor above all other things, but despite its citizens fervor it was proven to be not strong enough to drive off the World Serpent before their own world was doomed. This bracelet, a World Item, was held only by the greatest champion of Arnessa and was passed on to future champions via their worlds version of the Olympics held once every decade. It is of burnished gold and inlaid with countless intricate etchings showing a variety of sporting competitions and gladiatorial themed figures. This item bestows upon its bearer a fortified defense, tremendously increasing their durability and intractability, and serves to amplify their strength in line with that. Its bearer will be three times as strong as they were prior to wearing it, and further they will be protected from mind-altering effects, negative status, instant death effects, protection from detection and scrying magics, and freedom from attempts at restricting movement trumping even the power of other World Items.The reason for this is that Arnessa had something of a history with competitors that would seek to cheat their way to victory, and so means were sought to prevent an easy defeat of the reigning champion. Its final ability, and by far its most potent, is that it makes the one that wears it completely invincible to physical damage. While worn the user can only be harmed by attacks or effects that are not physical in nature. It is soulbound to its wearer and cannot be stolen, destroyed, or lost by any method short of death, though it can be given away freely. Additionally it is utterly unique, and it cannot be copied or duplicated in any way whatsoever using in-jump methods."
800,The Anklets of Solundrum,Overlord,"This pair of anklets are all that remain of the World of Solundrum after the attack on the World Tree. They are made of one of the seven prismatic ores, alexandrite, and appear to be silvery in color with a strange purple sheen. Both are marked with many precious stones and intricate runes; The left has a pictograph of a man seemingly circumnavigating the whole globe, and the right a pictograph of a man with a spear attacking a beast as his arm seems to blur. They were originally worn by the heroic Hunter Durlast, famed for his ability to run down and dispatch even mythic beasts with his blinding speed and masterful evasions.When worn as a set they triple all the personal movement methods of the wearer, such as flight, foot speed, or any more exotic methods. They also triple the attack speed of the user and increase their reaction times so they can make use of their new speed. Additionally five times per day the wearer may flawlessly evade any single attack or effect that the wearer is both aware of and has time to react to. In the event of an attack or effect that would kill or incapacitate the user the anklets will automatically activate, retroactively if need be.They also provide a resistance to mind-control, negative status, instant death attacks, protection from detection and scrying magics, and freedom from attempts at restricting movement which trumps even the effect of other World Items. Their final abilities however are perhaps their strongest. Whenever the wearer is trying to genuinely run from an opponent they will always be fast enough to escape. Similarly if they are pursuing an escaping enemy they will always be fast enough to catch that enemy no matter what methods are attempted to evade. However, these effects only come into play if either the wearer or their opponent is genuinely trying to escape or disengage from the conflict.It was often joked in the world of YGGDRASIL that while the anklets made whoever wore them into a deadly and fearsome combatant that could run down anyone that they were actually more suited to cowards, who wanted nothing more than to run away. These anklets are soulbound to their wearer and cannot be stolen, given away, destroyed, or lost by any method short of death. Additionally they are utterly unique, and cannot be copied or duplicated in any way whatsoever using in-jump methods."
800,Reach Scarab,Young Justice,"You have a Reach Scarab implanted in your spine. It’s special in several ways; for one, it is permanently “off mode”, meaning the Reach cannot take control of the Scarab- and therefore you- in any way. Second, it can be removed from your spine without killing you. Finally, despite being sentient the Scarab does not take up a companion slot as long as it remains in Scarab form. The Scarab grants its host several superhuman abilities: It is capable of constructing objects and shifting shape with nanotechnology, has highly advanced scanners capable of scanning for life forms through buildings and detecting when others are lying, translating seemingly any language, projecting holographic images, extreme durability, flight, and sonic and plasma weaponry."
800,Blade of Tathagata,The God of Highschool,"The sword of the Jade Emperor himself. A simple katana and matching sheath, neither with any embellishments or additions. This mighty blade possesses no innate power, save its limitless cutting edge. A single, lazy slash was able to slice all of South Korea in half and the blade was also able to destroy the cloned Ruyi Jingu Bang. It can summon gigantic waves of incredibly hot flame at the user’s command and even the sheath of the blade is powerful enough to split in half the super massive swords wielded by Nephilim without any action on the user’s behalf. Even if somehow broken, a feat only accomplished once by the Monkey King using over a hundred National Treasures and multiple Charyeok at once, the blade will be replenished to pristine condition within minutes."
800,The Wand of Endless Spells​,Overlord,"The final artifact that remains of a world whose name was forgotten to history in the wake of the attack of the World Serpent. No doubt, however, it must have been the product of a civilization of unparalleled magical might and knowledge. The wand itself is made of an unidentifiable, and seemingly indestructible, polished wood that seems to drink in the light around it. With runes etched up and down its length and filled in with the seven prismatic ores, it seems to thrum in the hands of those that hold it, the power within clear to the senses, alongside a nebulous feeling that the wand itself is... waiting. For what, precisely, no one can say. However in the meanwhile its powers will serve well anyone that is blessed enough to carry it. The first effect of the wand is the standard protections granted by a World Item, protection against instant death attacks, negative status, all forms of mind control or compulsion, and all attempts at scrying or information gathering magic. Its true power however, and the one that it was named for, is as straightforward as it is powerful. The user of the wand may freely activate it to cast any spell from any style or system of Ranked magic no matter the tier, with the singular exceptions of Over-Rank Magic and spells that are uniquely restricted to special classes (such as the Catastrophe spell of the World Disaster class). The wand can only channel a single spell at a time however, and it takes a few seconds for it to “switch” to a different spell. Additionally, it cannot be used to cast a tier of magic that the person wielding it is not themselves capable of using (so someone that could only use 6th tier spells would be restricted to 6th tier spells, until and unless they become capable of spells of a higher tier). Further, it gives no innate or inherent knowledge of magic or what spells are possible, so truthfully speaking it will only shine in the hands of someone that is already a powerful and knowledgeable magic caster. In future worlds it will adjust to include any and all new spells and magics possible, short of anything comparable to Over-Rank spells or similarly “unique-class restricted magics” however like before it will not inform the user of what is possible, so it will require experimentation and knowledge in order to bring out its full potential. The Wand of Endless Spells is utterly unique and cannot be copied or duplicated by any method using in jump methods, nor can it be destroyed. If lost or stolen it will reappear on your person (or in your warehouse) precisely one day later."
1000,[Phantasmal] Quality Item,Re: Monster,"the item is upgraded to a [Phantasmal] quality item, which are only attainable by either conquering an [Age of Gods] dungeon, by receiving a god’s full blessing, or by fully awakening a Sacred Treasure. Rou’s Airgeatlahm, upgraded on his evolution to Overlord, and the Sunlight's Soul Sword Hisperiol fall into this level of power."
1000/500,Monkey King’s Implements,The God of Highschool,"The great Monkey King had four mythical artefacts that accompanied him on his war against the Gods of Heaven and each of these are now made available to you for purchase, granting you perfect copies of the weapons that are loyal to only you. Each artefact is a separate purchase, though every purchase after the second is discounted to 500, for Demon origin takers and for non-demon origin takers."
