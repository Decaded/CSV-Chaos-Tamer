Cost,Perk Name,Source,Description
0,Graffiti,My Hero Academia,"The user is able to change the color of whatever they touch to any color in the rainbow and spread that color as they please from the point of contact up to a meter. Despite the colors of the material actually changing, the effects can be removed as if it was wet paint with moisture and a little pressure such as water, sweat and skin oils. No residue remains"
0,Ice Cube,My Hero Academia,"This Quirk allows the Quirk user to produce perfectly chilled ice cubes by shaking a closed fist, causing them to fall out of their fist. Crushed ice and dry ice are options. Ice Cube uses body moisture as a resource to generate ice. Several average coolers could be filled before the quirk user starts getting thirsty."
0,Lighter,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to able to produce flames over their thumbs by snapping, using the air in their lungs as fuel. Using this Quirk allows one to either sustain a small flame for a bit by parceling out their breath, or blow it all away in a small fireball that leaves themselves breathless. Limited by lung capacity."
0,Scarface,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user has the power to have their voice originate from any point within a small radius around their body. This gives them limited ability with throwing their voice and a particular talent with ventriloquism if they pursue that. Coincidentally, the Quirk user is unable to open their mouth while making use of their Quirk, and for several seconds after. This can be threatening if their nose is suddenly sealed."
0,Uppercrust,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to create and spread a hard, jagged material made of keratin among other things from their hands, allowing them to protect their firsts or bind enemies. The strength of this material is similar to fingernails, but can be layered to strengthen it. The user is unable to produce much at once and the quality of the material can degrade with stress."
0,Waterworks,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to produce an outrageous flow of tears and project them a great distance, similar to a pair of hoses. This also allows them to cry on command. While the user has a kind of inner reservoir of additional water for the tears to draw from, it’s rather small, meaning the user is heavily limited by their body’s moisture, needing frequent water breaks."
50,Trampling On Your Dignity,Medaka Box Abnormal,"If you’re going to send a message, you might as well do it in complete overkilling style. There’s really no other way to go about things. Whenever you want, you’re able to call up text in whatever font and size you want to float around you in the air, spelling out anything you want the words to spell out."
100,Air Walk,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user has the capacity to float and levitate though the air as if weightless. This can be used to reach difficult spaces, scout from above, move yourself out of range of enemy retaliation and basically all the other applications you can imagine for flight. Air Walk bestows a high degree of control over the user’s movement through the air. Conversely, this flight has low acceleration, and the faster the user is going, the less control they’ll have."
100,Black,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user is able to merge with anything seen as the color black. This includes shadows, which are simply black due to the absence of light. The Quirk user may move quickly around and through anything they’re currently merged with, enabling quick movement. The Quirk user may ready this ability ahead of time to instantly merge with something black upon contact. If the current target of possession is destroyed, the Quirk user is forced from their hiding place, which includes shadows dismissed by light. With time comes potential for manipulating their hosts."
100,Brute Strength,Generic Gamer,"You are incredibly strong. You can lift cars straight up into the air with a bit of effort, and your punches can dent steel. This isn’t just regular strength that’s boosted to superhuman levels, either — it’s a sort of Superman-style tactile telekinesis that ensures whatever you’re lifting or holding won’t fall apart under its own weight, also allowing you to catch objects or people falling from a great height without any harm done to you or them."
100,Came in Through the Window,Rise of the Guardians,"It’s helpful, being able to walk through walls. You’ll be able to experience that first hand, as you can now travel intangibly through any non-magical solid less thick than you are. Let not mere mortal barriers give you pause. This effect does not extend to any people you might be in physical contact with, not even if you’re carrying them."
100,Confession,My Hero Academia,"This Quirk allows the user to force anyone they ask a question to answer with the truth to the absolute best of their abilities. This can even allow the user to get the truth to questions the target may be suppressing or not fully aware of, like their true feelings on a touchy subject. This Quirk is not only an extremely potent interrogation tool, or for psychological torture. As it only allows for forcing out the truth to the questions the user asks, the user must know what questions to ask and how to ask them to get the best of this ability."
100,Crystallization,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user is able to produce crystals from anywhere on their body. These crystals are very hard, though not unbreakable, which allows them to give themselves a form of crude armor as the situation calls for it. The Quirk user may grow them near instantly, though body hair inhibits structural integrity. The Quirk user has difficulty shaping their crystals, which may leave them somewhat awkward in some situations."
100,Disintegration,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to destroy anything they lay their hands on, causing it to slowly crumble to bits. The user must lay their entire hand and five fingers on their target. Unfortunately, this Quirk is always on, meaning the user must be incredibly careful not to lay their entire hand on anything they want to keep intact."
100,Double,My Hero Academia,"Double is a quirk that allows the user to create copies of themselves or others with a touch, up to two at a time. The clones have the same personality and abilities as the original which may either be a boon or a risk depending on who you clone. This includes their Quirk. This is not without its fair share of caveats however. Due to the autonomous nature of clones, they have the potential to rebel if they don’t like their lot. The first clone made of someone is much less durable and will dissolve into black liquid when injured too much, the second clone will be even less durable than the first. Finally, the Quirk user needs a stellar mental image of whoever they’re copying to make a proper clone of them. This includes various measurements and features."
100,Four Colour User,Medaka Box Abnormal,"A lifetime of collecting comics has paid off well. By making comic book sound effects with your voice, you are able to empower the connected actions by a fair margin. Yelling out POW as you punch someone would see them hit with significantly more force while exclaiming BZZZT as you electrocuted them would make them get rocked by half again as many volts as before."
100,Lightning Quick,Generic Gamer,"Well, not that quick, or anywhere near it, admittedly, but it’s a cool name. Your top speed lies at about half the speed of sound, letting you cross multiple football fields in mere seconds. But there’s a difference between being fast and being quick, and you’re the latter — in addition to your incredible speed, your reflexes are instantaneous and incredibly precise. The deftness and dexterity you possess is beyond even a lifetime of training; other people occasionally fumble, but not you. You have a gymnast’s flexibility and walk with a dancer’s grace."
100,Matsurou Ashikabi,Sekirei,"You have a gift. A very powerful gift. You can dampen or outright cancel supernatural or other non-human abilities, reducing their effectiveness for a full hour after direct contact with them."
100,Mystic Eyes of Charm,Fate/Stay Night,"Your eyes possess the power of love. By looking into the eyes of another being, you can create a growing affection for you in their mind. A mere glance will give the equivalent of a crush on you for most non-magical beings whilst several minutes of uninterrupted eye contact with those same could create feelings of deep love that last for days at a time. Longer then this would create longer lasting feelings of course. Whilst incredible willpower might allow a mundane mortal to temporarily resist, they're rather out of luck as this magical trait quickly batters down the defences of mundane beings. Any supernatural being however, can quite easily shrug off the effects so it is unlikely you will be able to ensnare any but the weakest supernatural beings."
100,Mystic Eyes of Fire,Fate/Stay Night,"Your eyes possess the power of flame. With them, you have gained a control over fire and heat. You can ignite flammable material within sight with a blink. You can also naturally create and manipulate heat and fire within your field of vision. At first, this will be limited. You might be able to create several small fireballs or raise/lower the temperature of a single room by a few degrees. Eventually, you'll be able to create and fling around person sized fireballs, create temperatures that boil people's skin from their bodies in seconds or snuff out house sized fires with a thought."
100,Mystic Eyes of Pressure,Fate/Stay Night,"Your eyes possess the power of punches. Or is that meant to be force? Either way, it's the same effect. You are able to create impacts on anything that you can see. These impacts are exactly like if you went over and punched whatever you are aiming at, with all the shape, size and strength of your fist. You can't make more than one eye punch every few seconds for now but you can probably work this down to around one a second if you're really punch happy."
100,Mystic Eyes of Trick,Fate/Stay Night,"Your eyes possess the power of illusions. You are able to hijack the five senses of other beings with nothing more than brief eye contact. Your skill with this new ability is limited at first. You might only be able to subtly influence one or two senses at first and anyone with supernatural powers would be able to negate your influence. But give it a few years of practise, and with something this fun how could you not practise, and you could find yourself being able to overwrite all five senses of any human as you please, as long as you had eye contact when you started. Sadly you can only influence one person per eyeball at a time, though you only need eye contact once. Supernatural beings aren't immune to your powers but it's not impossible for them to resist like it is for mortals either so don't be surprised if anyone too strong or skilled can see past your tricks."
100,Plasma Generation,Arrowverse,You're able to shoot plasma beams through your eyes and charge your fists with energy to create strong attacks.
100,Run Like Hell,Generic First Jump,"You have a talent for running from trouble. You tend to choose the best path to lead to safety, you are a bit faster than would be expected, your endurance is extraordinary, and you are extremely sure-footed and agile."
100,Shake,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to vibrate whatever they touch, including the strength and speed of the shaking. This also makes the user more resilient to other vibration based abilities. Using this power, the user can shake apart and break brittle things quite easily, change the shape of the battlefield, rattle an enemy and other things you would use vibrations for. The user of this Quirk is limited by the aftershocks of their own ability, becoming stunned or even immobilized for an extended period of time if they shake something with too much strength or speed."
100,Shapeshifting,Arrowverse,"You're able to shapeshift into any person you've had physical contact with, even copying the clothing they were wearing. This allows you to instantly change the color and texture of your body, allowing you to replicate clothing and other materials on your own body. For complex items it just gives the appearance of it, but not the function; for example copying a person's watch isn't going to create an actual watch, but something that looks like one but doesn't count time."
100,Skeleton Key,Generic Medical Drama,You can lock and unlock any physical lock with a touch. Also works on knots.
100,Sonic Scream,Justice League Unlimited,Blast people away and wreck both vehicles and buildings with defining yells. Your super powerful sonic screams can be easily controlled allowing you to use this power for both lethal and non-lethal attacks. Keep in mind that while this ability is powerful you'll be limited by the amount of air in your lungs and holding a scream for too long could potentially cause you to pass out.
100,Star Blessed,King Arthur,You are blessed by the stars in the constellations. this gives you a minor power based on the constellation you chose.
100,Super Human Durability,Arrowverse,"Withstand very high levels of physical damage, immunity to small arms fire. With training you can gain immunity to calibers up to anti-material rounds."
100,Super Strength,Arrowverse,"The power to lift much heavier objects and hit harder than is humanly possible, strong enough to lift a small car overhead to start with but it progresses enough you’re able to bench press a tank."
200,Albert Einstein,Petals of Reincarnation,"Another great scientist of the world, this time the man who created the theory of relativity and more besides. Einstein’s studies resulted in a power that allowed him to teleport between two spaces, now passed down to you. You are able to, by sticking out your tongue, teleport instantaneously between any two spaces. You’re also able to selectively take anyone or anything within a few feet of you with you, including only parts of people if you wish to cause some rather horrific injuries. However, you can only teleport to spaces you have physically been present in, the exact spaces mind, and that space significantly changing or being damaged will erase the record of you having been there and prevent you from teleporting there until you’ve physically moved there again."
200,AUTO PILOT,Medaka Box Abnormal,"You’re able to set your body to work independent of your mind, letting it defend, attack and act solely based on your reflexes. No longer reliant on your reaction times or what you notice and focus on, your body will move perfectly and at full speed to attack, dodge, block or reach any foe or action you could normally do whilst your mind is free to think independent of this. Your body is still slaved to your senses however and cannot move faster than it normally could, only better, and thus it remains possible to trick your reflexes, though if you choose to focus on your actions at the same time as you have Auto Pilot active, you can erase this problem and increase your effectiveness even more. You can turn this Auto Pilot on and off."
200,Avalanche,X-Men Evolution,"You generate powerful seismic waves from your hands which can cause highly destructive effects. These waves cause any form of inorganic matter to shatter or crumble to dust. When directed at large objects, like a building or the Earth itself, these waves create effects similar to those of an avalanche or an earthquake within localized areas. With enough time spent you’ll crumble entire skyscrapers with your quakes. This gives you a limited degree of geokinesis as well given the waves can be used to create thrusting pillars of rock for ranged attacks, create trenches or earthquakes, and even redirect earth-based substances to an extent."
200,Big March of Animals,Duel Monsters - Shadow Realm,"The beasts are united against civilization, they have a camaraderie even as they hunt and are hunted by one another. You can bring this camaraderie to bear, and call for a crusade of creatures: With a wild howl, you can call for a temporary union of wild beasts around you to strike and overcome your foes! Although if you wish, you can use this for reasons beyond simply attacking, and use the unique capabilities and teamwork to serve your goals."
200,Clones,My Hero Academia,"This Quirk allows the user to expel glowing, ectoplasm-like slime that can then be transformed into clones of the user. The user can either create numerous clones of the same size as the user or expend more ectoplasm to make bigger clones. The number limit is normally in the tens for same size clones, but can fluctuate depending on mood. A good mood increases the number a bit, while a bad mood decreases the number a bit."
200,DEVIL STYLE,Medaka Box Abnormal,"Those Main Characters better watch out because you’re about to take away one of their biggest advantages. Around you or in things you are involved with, you remove the influence of fate and luck. Plot armour ceases to be a thing, lucky coincidences never happen and fate and destiny are barred from having any effect on the actions of any involved. Around you, it comes to the individuals’ own actions to decide the fate of the world and not any unseen force of luck or fate."
200,Elasticity,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user is able to bestow elasticity to whatever they touch, including large objects, the ground and even the air. This can be used to manipulate the environment to one’s advantage, such as creating trampolines for 3D movement, or trapping others in air-based rubber walls. The Quirk user is unable to affect living things with their Quirk, limiting them to environmental and object-based manipulations. The Quirk user may not manually disable the effects of their quirk. Objects affected will instead return to normal after a moderate amount of time has passed."
200,Esper Ability - Accelerator,Toaruverse,"Through a series of experiments, drug usage and the like, that individual will be able to achieve and substitute standard reality with their own personal reality. You may choose one of the cannon abilities below in the notes. All abilities bough her starts at level one and would reach level five within ten years even you’re living like a normal student and seeing combat at least one to three times a week would cut down the time needed to reach level five by half. After reaching level five you can reach level six within two hundred fifty years faster if you have training perks and been on combat frequently. For additional 200cp you may choose a different Esper ability from cannon examples.

Accelerator: It creates a thin field of AIM around you, which allows you to manipulate the vector values of anything you touch or around you. The passive ef ect that you do not need conscious control, may deflect or redirect bullets that strike you or the pressure wave of an explosion without requiring you’re awareness of the threat and many more. The active ef ect of the ability requires active calculations in order to maintain it, as even a slight error can nullify the ef ect but it can allow you manipulate vectors instead of redirecting them."
200,Esper Ability - Dark Matter,Toaruverse,"Through a series of experiments, drug usage and the like, that individual will be able to achieve and substitute standard reality with their own personal reality. You may choose one of the cannon abilities below in the notes. All abilities bough her starts at level one and would reach level five within ten years even you’re living like a normal student and seeing combat at least one to three times a week would cut down the time needed to reach level five by half. After reaching level five you can reach level six within two hundred fifty years faster if you have training perks and been on combat frequently. For additional 200cp you may choose a different Esper ability from cannon examples.

Dark Matter: It allows you to create and manipulate an unknown material from outside of this universe to attack. The material that you create defies the Laws of Physics, which can produce twenty-five thousand dif erent types of energy. The substance can apparently shape into any form you desire. The most obvious of this is the six angelic wings, which grants you the power to fly, blow powerful gusts of wind that is af ected by the power, and have sunlight pass dif ract upon it to form harmful rays of light."
200,Esper Ability - Electromaster,Toaruverse,"Through a series of experiments, drug usage and the like, that individual will be able to achieve and substitute standard reality with their own personal reality. You may choose one of the cannon abilities below in the notes. All abilities bough her starts at level one and would reach level five within ten years even you’re living like a normal student and seeing combat at least one to three times a week would cut down the time needed to reach level five by half. After reaching level five you can reach level six within two hundred fifty years faster if you have training perks and been on combat frequently. For additional 200cp you may choose a different Esper ability from cannon examples.

Electromaster: It allows you generate and manipulate electricity. You can also able to sense all phenomenon related to your power and all electric fields from the surrounding nature, along with all magnetic and electromagnetic information are processed subconsciously whether they want to or not. Unique to Electromaster is the ability to be influenced by electromagnetic waves, even to the extent that they can feel unpleasant towards which manifests itself as something like being watched. Moreover, they are capable of detecting other Electromaster if there isn’t any interference."
200,Esper Ability - Meltdowner,Toaruverse,"Through a series of experiments, drug usage and the like, that individual will be able to achieve and substitute standard reality with their own personal reality. You may choose one of the cannon abilities below in the notes. All abilities bough her starts at level one and would reach level five within ten years even you’re living like a normal student and seeing combat at least one to three times a week would cut down the time needed to reach level five by half. After reaching level five you can reach level six within two hundred fifty years faster if you have training perks and been on combat frequently. For additional 200cp you may choose a different Esper ability from cannon examples.

Meltdowner: It allows you to forcibly control electrons in the ambiguous state of an electron where it is both particle and wave, and when they strike other objects the electrons are unable to react either as particle or a wave because of their state. The ability usually takes on the form of a high-speed beam of light that can easily melt through thick metal walls and cause things like refined alcohol to explode with its heat alone. Another radical application of this is limbs and by emitting a power similar to a rocket, it can perform high-speed evasion that is fast enough to escape an explosion."
200,Fly Around the World,Rise of the Guardians,"You know what really helps with spreading your Center? Being able to get places fast. You have some form of enhanced personal mobility. Maybe you have iridescent glass wings that are razor sharp, doubling as weapons. Maybe you’re extremely agile, and you can move faster and jump farther than any human ever could. Maybe you can achieve flight by riding the wind like a snowflake. Maybe you can teleport between shadows. Maybe something else. It’s really up to you."
200,Fuel Siphon,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user is able to inhale and absorb the stamina/energy of whoever they’re touching. This can quickly drain a victim to the point of incapacitation if contact isn’t broken. Drained stamina can be used not only to reinvigorate the Quirk user, leaving them fully refreshed. An overabundance of drained energy can also be channeled into temporarily increasing the Quirk user’s size, strength and durability, leaving them even more powerful than before. As previously stated, there are two conditions for this Quirk. The user must breath in, taking a deep breath, and sustained contact is required for the duration of this time. Breaking contact or preventing the Quirk user from breathing in can interrupt this Quirk’s effects and leave a victim with a chance."
200,Glamour,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user may emit a mist from their mouth, which can then be manipulated to form complex visual and auditory illusions over a wide area. Sound and appearance with a bit of thought can reach lifelike realism or become a fantastic spectacle. The Quirk user must emit their mist before forming illusions. The Quirk user’s mist will dissipate given enough time, cancelling the illusions in place if not replenished."
200,Gun Visible Colour,Medaka Box Abnormal,"They'll never expect such a childish gesture to be so dangerous. You've got finger guns now, letting you make a gun shape with your fingers and then have that hand fire off invisible bullets of force at the enemy. Each bullet is about as strong as one of your own punches but you're not limited to just firing invisible pistols. So long as you can roughly mime the use of the sort of gun, you're able to use that instead. You can cock and fire an unseen shotgun or ready up an entire chain gun, though you are limited to real world guns in this way."
200,Healing Factor,X-Men Evolution,"You possess a high-rate of cellular regeneration with far greater speed and efficiency than a normal human. This healing factor allows you to heal from superficial to deep and serious wounds in a couple seconds along with missing limbs or anything internal in at most a minute. Even falling from an airplane, landing face first on the ground, and breaking every bone in your body won’t keep you down for more than a few seconds. This regeneration also makes you immune to all forms of illnesses, poisons, and diseases. You are nigh-impervious to age & cellular decay via constant cellular regeneration so expect to live a few centuries in your prime before starting to see the slimmest glance of aging."
200,Healing Touch,Superman: the Animated Series,The power to restore biological life to optimal conditions. In a less than a minute you can heal any injuries and cure any illnesses of any biological organism that you touch. Does not work on yourself and cannot revive the dead.
200,Isaac Newton,Petals of Reincarnation,"One of the most famous scientists in history, the man who formulated the law of gravity, motion and other kinetic objects. Calling back to the way he was first inspired, Newton grants you the ability to create a limitless number of apples. You are able to control gravity within 4 metres of these apples, with enough force to crush people to gooey puddles or even partially bend space around them. Newton also makes his Reincarnators have heads that look exactly like giant apples."
200,Landmine,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user has the capacity to turn anything they touch into an explosive, including other people. After that point, they may remotely detonate that explosive with just a whim. Anything detached from the original object, person or thing will detonate still. The explosions themselves are actually fairly weak. While they may be rendered dangerous with numbers, most things with moderate structural integrity can remain in-tact even after detonation"
200,Lip Service,Medaka Box Abnormal,"With naught but a kiss, you’re able to change someone’s life. You can give a person an ability you possess just by kissing them and, if they agree, even take an ability of theirs in exchange for what you gave them. You can take what you gave back with another kiss, though you can only take back what you gave and if what you gave was lost or modified, it will be lost to you. Through this method anyway. Besides, who doesn’t like an excuse to kiss anyway?"
200,Molecular Acceleration,X-Men Evolution,"You take the potential energy stored in an object and can convert it to pure light, kinetic energy, thus “charging” that item with highly explosive results. The only real limit of this ability is the time required to charge as the larger the object is, the more time it takes to charge with most charging taking place through direct skin contact. The power of the explosions is dependent on the mass of the object you are charging, as a charged playing card explodes with the force of a grenade while a bus will cause a huge explosion. You can also accelerate an object's kinetic energy instead of converting its potential energy; for example, charging a Bo staff with enough kinetic energy will have enough power to level a house."
200,Need For Speed,My Hero Academia,"This Quirk allows you to slow or accelerate any moving object the user comes in contact with by a factor of up to twenty, including yourself. This allows the user to slow an attacking enemy to a crawl, speed thrown projectiles to bullet-like speeds, accelerate suddenly as desired or produce danger, hanging obstacles. As an interesting side-note of this Quirk, objects slowed by it keep their momentum, impacting as they would at normal speeds if something touches them. Does not alter the perception of time for those affected, for good and bad alike. The effects only last as long as an object continues moving, ending when it stops. It may only affect a moving object, meaning it can potentially be planned around by someone who becomes experienced with it. Either from repeated encounters or during battle."
200,READING MINDS,Medaka Box Abnormal,"You’re able to receive electrical signals given off by humans or machines and interpret those signals, effectively allowing you to read the minds of any being with a brain or thing with electronics. It’s possible to focus your power instead of just taking in everything around you at once, something you may want to do given how difficult it can be to sort out all the signals at once, but your targets being in poor conditions can muddle the signals and make it harder to interpret what they will do. Focusing too much on one person can force you to feel their physical and emotional pain, so be careful to not go too far. On the other hand, possessing this power allows you to greatly increase the power of any electricity-based powers that you or those you are in contact with possess."
200,Recovery,My Hero Academia,"This Quirk allows the user to rapidly accelerate a target’s natural healing by extending their lips and kissing the previously mentioned target. With this, even grave injuries that would have taken months to heal can be healed in a matter of seconds, although not without a cost. The target pays for this healing with their own stamina, causing severe exhaustion if an injury is, or injuries are, too serious in nature. This means traditional healing may be required or recommended in some cases, or applied in small doses over time."
200,Shapeshifting,X-Men Evolution,"You can alter the formation of your cells allowing you to shapeshift into any human, animal, humanoid or semi-humanoid being of either sex. This power can lets you mimic any kind of clothing, as well as other materials, producing shoes, glasses, watches, etc. You are able to imitate retinas, fingerprints, scent and voice patterns perfectly. While you won’t replicate powers you can mimic the physical capabilities of whatever form you take, gaining the power of flight as a bird, fangs, and claws as a wolf, etc. With training or time, you’ll gain the ability to split into multiple shapes, such as a swarm of bats, gaggle of snakes, or several scorpions. You could even disguise yourself as a puddle of water, liquify parts of your body to avoid attacks, regrow new limbs, reshape your body to flatten, stretch out and expand, and can change your body to have claws or hammers for hands. The general rule is that you can go no smaller than a mouse and no bigger than a fairly large bear. Finally you have a template of who you originally were at all times."
200,Softness,My Hero Academia,"This Quirk allows the user to soften anything they touch, allowing them to make wreckage easier to remove or destroy, or turn the ground into quicksand. This Quirk’s effects can travel along a surface from the initial point of contact in whatever direction the user desires, allowing them to only soften a line to the side or in front of them, or everything for several meters from the point of contact. The user is unable to affect living matter such as people, animals or plants. They also seem limited by body moisture somewhat, becoming dehydrated with prolonged or repeated use in a short timeframe."
200,Somnambulist,My Hero Academia,"The quirk user is able to produce a highly potent, sleep-inducing aroma from their body on command that can quickly propagate through an area. Even highly aggressive individuals may soon lose consciousness upon getting a wiff of it. The sleep inducing aroma does have the weakness of enemies needing to actually breath it in for it to work, meaning those who can avoid doing so will remain unaffected. The aroma is more effective against the opposite gender compared to the same gender of the quirk user."
200,Teleportation,Justice League Unlimited,"By opening up wormhole-like portals you can travel anywhere you’re familiar with seconds. These portals can take you and small groups of people to any location you know by memory or can see in pictures, videos, or magical visions. The exact distance you can travel is practically unlimited, you could easily make a trip from earth to new genesis, escape the void of space by opening a portal back to your ship, or retreat from battle by teleporting back to your secret base. Pretty much the only significant limitation of this ability is that you cannot use it to travel to different universes."
200,Twin Impact,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user has the capacity to secondary impacts at the site of any observed impact. This secondary impact is many times stronger than the initial impact, allowing even smaller impacts to transmit considerable force. The Quirk user need not be near, or be the one who caused any initial impact, simply being required to observe the impact in person to double it. They may not, however, double any impact more than once. Secondary impact force is highly difficult to moderate."
200,Size Shifting,Justice League Unlimited,"You can either grow up to the size of a football stadium or shrink down to the atomic scale, or both if you purchase this perk twice. Changing size won't negatively affect your mass and density which means you can still hit as hard as you normally would while shrunk and if you grow to the size of a small building your punches will have about that same amount of weight added to the force of their hits. Any clothing or equipment you’re wearing will change size with you,"
200,Zero Gravity,My Hero Academia,"This Quirk gives small pads on the ends of each of the user’s fingers that can be used as a medium to “shut off” an object or person’s link to gravity, making them weightless. The effects of this Quirk may be cancelled at any time by touching the pads on the user’s fingers together. The primary limitations are weight and using it on one’s self. If the user activates their Quirk on a combined amount of objects higher than a certain weight (around three tons) they’ll begin getting sick to the point of vomiting. Using this Quirk on themselves will cause this effect much faster."
300,Speedster,Unknown,"Requires: Super Speed

Need to do more than just speed. Now you’ve gained a connection to the Speed Force; a mysterious semi sentient parallel dimension which gives Speedsters their powers. The Speed Force has given you more than just Super Speed for it has charged your cells with massive amounts of electricity. When accessing the Speed Force, you generate electricity from your body, most noticeably trailing your body as you run. Also you can share your immunity to the rigors of going fast by enveloping those that are touching you with the Speed Force. You can also vibrate can vibrate different body parts for various effects. This can mask you from being clearly perceived or distort your vocal cords to disguise your voice. You can vibrate to forcibly expel any toxins that affects you. By vibrating you can also generate great amounts of heat to recover & even be kept thermally insulated from extreme cold. By vibrating your molecules at the frequency of air, you can physically pass through solid objects. With training you can do this with multiple targets, such as an entire moving train and hundreds of passengers. You can also harmlessly pass through living individuals. He can also pass through the highly complex objects in universe that's vibrational frequencies differed from your own. Alternatively, you can use this as a weapon by passing your punch through a person's body, incapacitating them. Or by vibrating your hand and passing it through a person’s heart or brain killing them. By vibrating at varying frequencies and with different levels of force, you can create small tremors and can induce extreme amounts of jolt on any target you touch, even disrupt the inter-molecular bonds and cause it to shatter. Your vibrations can even shatter objects into fragments. Greater your speed the stronger the tremors are, to the point where you can create a small earthquake by moving at top speeds. When you gain enough speed you’re able to pierce through the time barrier, space barrier & dimensional barrier. When you bypass the time barrier you may enter different points in time and arrive at a destination with pinpoint accuracy. You can do this in one of two ways; either enter timelines independent from yourself and unaffected by his travels or perform a time do-over, wherein you ""merges"" with your temporal counterpart to be fully immerse in the timeline. Regardless of the changes you makes, this leaves you unchanged allowing you retain all memories of the previous timeline in addition to the new timeline and differentiate between the two. Through training you’ll be able to ""create"" a time remnant by traveling back to moments before your current self-time travels, hailing from a future that no longer exists. This allows you to be two places at once, enabling you to interact with the world for two separate actions simultaneously. If desired, you can create dozens of time remnants at once. Be warned if you abuse this too much, or change the time too much, then the Speedforce will send Time Wraiths or if the changes are too grievous the Black Flash. These beings are the enforcers of the timeline, if they catch you they will kill you or erase your existence rapidly. So be careful not to abuse your powers too much. When you pierce through the dimensional barrier, you can break open portals between dimensions, allowing you to travel to any other universe within the local multiverse, including the main Earth called Earth One. If desired, you can also bring others with you. At first you cannot consciously control this, but through training you break open portals of your own accord and consciously chose your destination, even into the Speed Force itself. Lastly when you pierce through the space barrier you can open space breaches, enabling you to shift and warp about and appear out of nowhere to new locations. When combined with super speed, your actions can appear as if you’re in multiple places at once by rapidly moving through these breaches to new terrain. Post-Jump you’ve become a conduit for the Speed Force itself, allowing the Speed Force to follow you throughout your travels. Lastly the Time Wraiths and Black Flash will no longer bother you. Everything you see Barry Allen do you’ll eventually be able to do as well if you train & push yourself to improve. What’s not known to a few is the fact the Speed Force is an intelligence that’s existed since beginning of time. It’s taken a shine to you and should you spend six months within the speedforce voluntarily, all soft caps will be removed. You’ll also subconsciously learn the speedforce language, a language that conveys lots of information with just a few symbols, which when studied will unlock the ability to share speed with non-speedsters for a short period and/or take away speed from speedsters for a short period of time."
300,[Raff-Rafflesia],Medaka Box Abnormal,"Through your hands you can now channel the power or rot and sickness. You’re able to corrode and dissolve anything that you touch or that comes near your hands. The rate of corrosion and area of effect can also be controlled by you, enough to rot away whole buildings in a few seconds at its best. You’re also able to use the corrosion to rot dirt and earth, enabling you to grow and control plants to a quite unexpectedly scary extent, including doing things like creating plant men soldiers to fight for you. You have full control over this power."
300,Black Hole,My Hero Academia,"This power allows you to generate small black holes at the tips of your fingers. The black holes can suck up and disintegrate any matter at the atomic level as well as certain forms of energy such as light. This Quirk is highly volatile and can easily be used to kill people or cause large collateral damage if not regulated properly, or even be turned back on the user."
300,Creation,My Hero Academia,"This Quirk allows you to produce different objects from any exposed part of your body. Apart from living things, you can create virtually any object. Due to the incredible power, there are a few requirements however. To produce an object requires knowledge of its atomic configuration ahead of time. The Quirk user’s body breaks down fat at the molecular level, reconfiguring into the various objects produced with this Quirk. Larger objects need more exposed skin, necessitating light clothing."
300,Demon Eye - Absolute Void Eye,Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation,"The Absolute Void Eye can create an immense, insurmountable barrier around areas. While you could hold off an army with these and prevent people from entering, the drain is significant. However if purchased here you can create an independent barrier over an object or area but the strength and duration of the barrier depends on how much energy you used to create it."
300,Demon Eye - Absorption Eye,Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation,"This eye absorbs magic. Normally the eye would absorb magic indiscriminately, it would absorb any magic you cast as well. However if purchased here you can use select the targets the eye absorbs. Post-Jump this will include any type of magic or energy, and you can choose to let the energy disappear entirely or absorb it into your own reserves."
300,Edge Master,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user has the ability to create and project bladed implements and weapons from their body ranging from swords and axes to chakram and guillotine blades. Projected bladed objects can potentially be sent flying at high speeds towards a designated target along straight or curved flight paths, though they’re unable to fly in a complete circle unaided. All bladed objects are made out of some form of high quality iron alloy that has the capacity to sheer through solid concrete without chipping or deforming. The Quirk relies heavily on the user’s focus in order to form the bladed objects above. If distracted or just careless, the constructs can come out warped, brittle, deformed or otherwise lower quality. Mental exhaustion may become a problem for those mentally weak. Otherwise, Edge Master takes minimal stamina for continuous production"
300,Elemental Conjurer,Sekirei,"You may pick one element to create and manipulate. Fire, water, wind, earth, ice, darkness, light — provided it fits on the periodic table, it counts. Creation and manipulation of this element comes easily, and the only real limitation you face is working out what you can use it for."
300,Healing Kiss,Sekirei,Your kiss just brings out the best in those that experience it. They feel rejuvenated and more alive than ever. Your kiss can relieve both mental and physical stress.
300,Myth,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user has the ability to transform into a larger and more powerful form. This form emulates the appearance of a mythological creature of choice, selected at the time of purchase, and bestows a number of physiological changes and abilities based upon that choice. The choice of a dragon could give protective scales, wings, fangs, claws, and a tail, as one example. The choice of a kraken could enable the ability to breath underwater and bestow a number of powerful and dexterous tentacles, as another. Otherwise magical abilities based upon those creatures like immortality or passing through walls are not included with the transformation. Physical abilities within this form, no matter the choice, are far greater however. This form is often between the size of a bus and a two-story house. This transformation is more stamina consuming than the Quirk user’s base human form. Specific weaknesses such as gaps in natural armor or inability to handle certain temperatures vary depending on choice of creature made."
300,Parahuman - Alexandria Package,Worm,"You have the standard flying brick powerset, insane strength, durability, and flight. You can toss around over 30 tons, your strength enough to tear through solid steel like tissue paper. Your durability is incredible, requiring high explosives before you even start to feel it; and your flight tops out at around five hundred miles per hour. As a secondary power you possess enhanced intelligence and perfect memory. Your power also enforces the Manton Limit on things that try to affect you, meaning that even elsewhere a telekinetic can't pop your brain, or somebody who can conjure flames burn you from the inside out. Yes, this explicitly includes Behemoth’s kill aura, and will even protect you from Ziz's telekinetic brain fuckery."
300,Parahuman - Blink,Worm,"You are capable of teleporting to any location within two hundred yards with only an instant’s thought. When you Blink you may modify your physical orientation and momentum to anything that is physically possible for you. This power is especially suited to rapid teleportation chains, and you are immune to any disorientation or imbalance that might result from this. Secondary Thinker aspects grant you superhuman spatial and situational awareness needed to use this ability to its fullest, along with the capability to handle sensory input faster than possible for any other human being. You can also Blink targets you’re touching, or take them with you, whether that is people or objects, up to around five times your size."
300,Parahuman - Browbeat,Worm,"How does personal biokinesis, a protective force field, and tactile telekinesis sound as a power set? You’re nearly impossible to completely incapacitate or subdue due to your combination of powers, and any one facet of your power being negated tends to be covered by others. Nullifying your force field and telekinesis doesn’t change the fact that you’ve already shifted into a superhumanly strong hulk, and at any other time you’re a juggernaut who can wreck opponents with just the tiniest glancing blow. Strength for your telekinesis is 30 tons over your base physical strength, and your forcefield is durable enough to casually tank… well, a tank. The creative uses of your biokinesis are nearly limitless."
300,Parahuman - Corrosive Contact,Worm,"Your touch hyper-accelerates and optimizes entropy in targets, which for most means they almost instantly disintegrate. This power can affect contiguous material up to five yards away from the point of contact, and your precision with it is enough to do things like casually carve out new doorways with a tap. This power is enough to almost ignore simple physical durability, although beings like the Endbringers will ""merely"" be hurt pretty bad by it. Works on energy just as easily as matter, and you lack any Manton Limit to stop you from effecting living beings. You're completely immune of course, and have perfect control over this ability."
300,Parahuman - Doormaker,Worm,"You are capable of opening portals to any destination you can think of. These portals may remain until you decide to dismiss them, and their size is limited only by your powers growth and the effort you put into them. These portals are capable of crossing dimensional boundaries, and into alternate mirror worlds. Post Jump you can still reach such destinations, but note that peculiarities of the particular world may change the fundamental nature of how these might function. Post-Spark these portals can connect anywhere in the multiverse/omniverse."
300,Parahuman - Friction Modulation,Worm,"You are capable of not only ignoring friction, but reversing its effects to increase your speed and momentum instead. This can continue with no upper limit, and any negative effects you would suffer from the forces involved are negated. This includes kinetic force that would cause damage to you from your own actions, so despite your speed you cannot strike with any more force then you can safely handle. Your control over your movement and inertia also allows you to redirect your momentum and inertia in any direction at any time, allowing you to zip and bounce around a battlefield at insane speeds effortlessly. Your reaction time and reflexes scale with your speed, allowing you to act and react normally. May also be extended to people and objects you are touching to bring them along with you. You have perfect balance and poise while under the effects of this power."
300,Parahuman - Imaginary Form,Worm,"You’re capable of warping your physical form into a mental projection, which can be roughly anything you can imagine up to roughly twenty feet tall, or proportionally larger if your base size differs from human norm. This form doesn’t need to be biologically or physically viable, a swirling nimbus of light or a massive beast made out of fire is perfectly fine, and will interact with the world as those forces normally do. Your body itself is able to be casually reformed from any damage it might take, but you still possess a core somewhere within it that will result in your demise if destroyed or significantly damaged. Reforming your body is relatively quick but takes mental effort, and doing so continuously will fatigue you. Note that while you can become anything you can imagine, this doesn’t mean you can just imagine “A thing that does X” and have that ability. An understanding of physics will allow you to get the most out of this power."
300,Parahuman - Iterative Improvement,Worm,"Each day you gain a certain amount of charge, which you can spend to effectively “enchant” objects with superpowers. The more charge you invest in a particular object, the more you can improve and expand its abilities. A single day's charge would give an object a minor power, but over time you can increase it with no upper limit beyond your investment. These objects only work for you unless you make it otherwise. As you use your power, experiment with it, and it matures from conflict and experience, the amount of charge you gain per day will increase. You can hold about a month’s worth of charge at any one time, any more will be wasted."
300,Parahuman - Memory Blanking,Worm,"When active, your power actively blanks you from the memory of everybody around you, including short term recognition. You could walk right up to someone with a knife in broad daylight, and cutting them would leave them wondering how that happened, completely unable to register your presence. This power works only on living beings. Sensors, cameras, and robots will be able to perceive you just fine. Other exotic senses may bypass this as well, although that depends on their nature, but otherwise people are completely incapable of registering your presence and actions. Imp for example walked right into a villain’s office, hammered a board full of nails onto the floor behind his chair, tied a rope to said chair, and he only noticed her when she deactivated her power and calmly let him know that if he did anything funny he was one tug away from leaking like a sieve."
300,Parahuman - Personal Force Manipulation,Worm,"Within a the space around an inch from your body you are aware of all forces currently active, and you may magnify or lessen them. This lets you turn blows against you into mere taps, while increasing your own into incredibly destructive attacks. You can extend this power to targets you are touching, up to the size of a very large vehicle. You’ll get more bang for your buck by increasing or decreasing multiple forces at a time, like increasing the kinetic force of your strikes while decreasing the physical resistance of the target at the same time. This requires no small amount of finesse, but if properly mastered you’d be a nightmare."
300,Parahuman - Power Well,Worm,"Within you resides an immense reserve of energy that you are capable of calling up and expending in incredibly powerful blasts. You can shape these and to a certain extent manipulate their nature, from kinetic force, to thermal energy, to electricity and more. These are powerful enough to level a city block should you go all out to your upper limit. You also possess the capability of flight, at around two hundred miles per hour. Despite the incredible raw force of this ability, do note that use drains your reserves, and while they are significant when you are fully charged intensive use of your full capacity will require over a week to recharge to suitable levels. Your mobility and raw destructive power also do nothing for your personal durability. Barring other abilities you are just as fragile as a normal human."
300,Parahuman - Warp Spasm,Worm,"By activating your power you are able to enter a berserker rage that warps you into a monstrous and incredibly destructive form wreathed in fire and lightning. This transformation continues to build over time, with no upper limit as long as you don’t calm down, and have the stimulus to feed your aggression. Lacking actual meaningful danger will cause your growth to stall, while lacking any form of conflict or stress will cause your power to reverse its effects quickly. This rage doesn’t impede your intelligence, skills, awareness, or cunning, perhaps even sharpening them as time goes on, but while you are in this state the only methods you can bring yourself to use involve violence, aggression, and destruction. You can snap yourself out of this rage at any time you want, although this doesn’t stop you from losing yourself in it if you are not careful. The exact details of your monstrous state is up to you, whether you want it to be a demonic winged monster, dragon like, or something else. The intense heat and electric discharge you are generating is controllable by you, and gets stronger as you do."
300,Power Plex,Invincible,"You are able to absorb energy of any sort and convert it into electricity at your discretion. Explosion, kinetic energy, really anything can be absorbed and converted by you. You are able to contain and control your powers so that you do not need any technological aid, and with some practice you will even be able to use these powers to fly. The blasts of electricity you can create, while extremely powerful, tend to not be effective on those with extreme durability, as a young Viltrumite would be able to survive you and a veteran would barely feel a tickle. You are weak to crushing attacks and your powers could potentially overload and turn off if you try to absorb something on the level of a nuke in a second. Your powers overloading does not directly deal damage to you but they turn off for a few minutes and ‘reboot’."
300,Red Rush,Invincible,"You have become a speedster. Due to an accident when you were a teen you gained the ability to move and think at massively hypersonic speeds, on par with a veteran Viltrumite in an atmosphere. You naturally generate an aura that protects you and those around you from the effects of your speed, while also allowing you to interact with objects semi normally. If you punch a concrete wall at top speed, your hand would be bruised as if you punched a wall while standing still but the wall itself would exploded into shrapnel from the sheer kinetic energy. This general augmentation also comes with stamina needed to run for immense distances, and lengths of time."
300,Rewind,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk has the ability to turn back the body of those they touched to a previous state. This can be used altruistically to seamlessly heal an individual, or maliciously by rewinding old wounds open again, or rewinding them out of existence entirely. This is a very potent ability and even before active training has the potential to turn someone back minutes or hours in mere moments. With intense training, it has the potential to reverse only parts of someone or something. Intense training would be required either way however, as Rewind is difficult to control by default. It works on activation, being easy to turn on but difficult to stop at first, leaving control a serious issue."
300,Super Anchoring,Sonic the Hedgehog,You have the ability to selectively make yourself immovable. It doesn’t negate the pain but it does negate and redistribute all momentum to the area around you. So it comes off as some kickass looking clash of power. And you don’t even have to lift a finger. The only requirement is that you have to be ready and brace yourself for impact long in advance. Doesn’t always work out when you can’t see it coming
300,Warp Gate,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to create and manipulate a dark fog that acts as a portal. When the user produces a mass of the dark fog, it transports anything it comes in contact with to a nearby location. It can also be used to obscure the user’s identity. The portals that are created are based on coordinates and thus to open them means one must be able to pinpoint the exact position where they wish for each portal to open up into. The main limitations of this power are its precise, coordinate based nature, and the fact that the owner’s body is always present in some manner even if they seem immaterial at times."
300,Wave Motion,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user is able to convert their vitality into pure energy and project it from their body in the form of spiraling shockwaves. Able to control the output and project these shockwaves from anywhere on her body allows for a variety of applications. Weaker shockwaves from the feet can allow for a form of pseudo-flight. Pulsing them from the body can be used to make hairpin turns or sudden dodges in the face of an enemy attack. Then there’s the most straightforward use, extremely threatening energy blasts. As an innate property, the shockwaves always travel in a spiraling flightpath that causes them to travel slowly and awkwardly. As the user is converting stamina into power, fatigue is a potential threat."
300,Enhanced Speed,Justice League Unlimited,"Move faster than a speeding bullet and defeat your foes though the power of velocity and quick thinking. Not only are you able to run up to several times the speed of sound and react just as quickly, you can also use your enhanced speed to increase the force of your attacks, perform complex tasks in seconds, run up flat surfaces or across water, spin your arms or body to generate vortexes, and accelerate your heartbeat to appear dead. If you were to spend 300cp on this power, not only will you gain all of the aforementioned abilities but your movements speeds will be drastically increase to the point where you'd gain the ability to run up to a fraction of light speed, you'll also be able to vibrate fast enough to pass through solid objects and generate explosions. Keep in mind that traveling near light-speed is extremely difficult. At best you'll probably only be able to go up to Mach 40, fast enough to carry an exploding bomb from the center Las Vegas to the outskirts of the city in about a second, without any sort of help. But if you were to receive some kind of technological aid, or somehow tap into the Speed Force, you could vibrate fast enough to rearrange someone's molecules and travel around the entire earth several times in just a few seconds. Keep in mind that accessing the Speed Force is dangerous and you have a very real chance of being absorbed by it whenever you approach the speed of light."
300,Parahuman - Stasis,Worm,"At a touch you're capable of freezing things into a temporal stasis, for up to ten minutes at a time, minimum thirty seconds. Effected objects are completely invulnerable, immovable, and otherwise immune to being affected by anything. Should another absolute effect (such as Sting for example) contest this, then both effects are nullified. Additional touches allow you to reset this timer for any duration up to your max. You are capable of effecting contiguous matter, although this is much harder, able to work only about five yards out. The Manton Effect prevents you from freezing only portions of a living target, at least for the duration of this jump."
300,Parahuman - Sting,Worm,"By unfolding an object through nigh infinite dimensions it becomes capable of ignoring all forces that would affect it, including the physical resistance, durability, or other effects that would meaningfully impede it. You apply this effect on touch (and you're immune to being harmed by this power) on objects up to the size of a large truck. The length of time this remains in effect on an object depends on how much juice you put into it, and when the power wears off the object will physically fuse with whatever it is currently going through. This power allows you to tear through almost any and all defenses like they didn't even exist, only other absolute effects like a time locked object can resist it, at which point both effects simply cancel each other out on contact. Explicitly bypasses all dimensional barriers, boundaries, and defenses. You also have a nigh perfect sense of timing and trajectories, giving you superhuman aim and accuracy. As a special concern for Jumpers, note that magical, conceptual, and other supernatural effects work just fine when it comes to defending against this power, they don’t automatically lolnope it, but unlike everything else they have a chance."
300,Parahuman - Stellar Focus,Worm,"High temperatures within a small space around you (roughly a one to two foot radius unless you limit it or turn it off) are nullified to around sixty-seventy degrees, and for a very good reason. Your power lets you create a miniature sun, which may reach up to the size of a very large truck. Continued effort can continue expanding it but doing so results in diminishing returns and can tire you out. The temperatures generated by this can be enough to lay waste to everything around you in seconds if you’re not careful, and to vaporize stone and steel in almost an instant if you’re openly pushing it to happen. You’ll have to keep your sun small if you want to use it without causing insane amounts of collateral damage and wanton death, but when purposefully guided towards destruction there is very little even among parahumans that is capable of resisting its effects. The range you can control and move it within is roughly two hundred yards around you from the sun's core to yourself."
300,Esper Ability,Re: Monster,"If you choose a weaker power, such as Self Diagnosis (the ability to be constantly aware of your body’s physical state down to the cellular level), then you gain a discount on this purchase. If this was already discounted, you only pay 150cp."
300,Parahuman - Ballistic Transmission,Worm,"Objects you touch can be launched along a trajectory of your choosing (simple ones only, slight curves are fine, figure eights are not) at several thousand feet per second. You can affect objects up to the size of a large truck, and size has no effect on the speed reached. Unfortunately you can't make targets fire slower, so any use of your power is almost by default highly lethal and destructive against anything other than extremely durable targets. If you don’t think this is all that impressive then sit down and do the math when say...that car over there hits something moving at speeds equaling that of a high velocity military round."
300,Drain,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to create a “drain” on whatever they touch that greedily sucks in surrounding or ambient moisture and then force feeding it into whatever has the drain. Additionally, the Quirk user gains especially elastic skin and a strange internal reservoir. When used on the Quirk user, they’re able to potentially balloon themselves with a deceptive amount of water and spray it freely from their hands with condensed cutting force. Due to the way the drains work (one way suck) and water not pairing well with compression, this Quirk can easily be used to pop someone’s head like a balloon, fracture a wall or erode the ground. All drains are sealed when the user clicks their tongue. The user also has a limit to how much water they can hold, potentially bursting, and their upper limit is also rather awkward to move around with."
300,Rex-Splode,Invincible,"You have been enhanced and powered up jumper. Not only have your physical abilities been enhanced to just beyond peak human and into superhuman for every category, you have also gained the ability to charge up objects with explosive energy. You can decide how this occurs, whether you had cybernetics implanted in you or whether you simply have been augmented in a different fashion. When an object is charged you can throw it (or run) and then trigger it to explode at will. The amount of energy that can be contained in an object is determined by its size with larger objects taking more time and energy to charge while also resulting in a larger explosion."
400,Green Lantern Powers,DC – Kingdom Come,"Alan Scott has long since stopped caring about Earth’s problems. But space still has issues, and he must deal with them. In the meantime, you seem to be some strange science experiment by the Guardians to see if they could create a being with no need for the Green Lantern Ring. You were the result, but they’ve placed you on Earth as they found it cruel to expect you to serve them without you having a say in the matter. If you want to be a part of the Corps or not is up you. They had gotten their answer with you, anyway. You possess all the powers of the Green Lantern ring without needing the ring in the first place, even those unlisted. Examples include using own willpower for fears such as hurling blasts, creating hard light constructs, flying, and breathing in space! Along with being a universal translator. You may also access the massive computer of knowledge on Oa and do complete scans of the entire galaxy at maximum. You have no weakness to wood or the color yellow. As a side effect you’ll have green skin for the entirety of the jump. Post jump, you can keep it on you or do away with it as you wish. But more than that, you don’t need to actively maintain your constructs. You could make a huge space palace with your own green light without needing to actively maintain it with your will. Anyone could live in them. Just make sure your cool new space palace doesn’t hit Alan Scott’s. He might not be too pleased with that."
400,[Scar Dead],Medaka Box Abnormal,"Scars never disappear forever. You’re living proof. You’re able to instantly re-open any wound someone you can see has ever suffered, whether physical or even mental, and force it open as many times as you want even if that person heals once more. This power is quite indiscriminate when you want it to be, even able to open wounds and injuries suffered by objects, even if those ‘wounds’ were things like a sword being beaten into shape by a hammer while being forged. It also bypasses any defences against anything less than supernatural powers in general, not counting as an attack against defences against such things."
400,Brit,Invincible,"You have become physically invulnerable: nothing of this universe can damage you physically any longer. You can tank the punches of a Regent Viltrumite, walk through lava, and even geniuses on the level of Robot Rex are unable to figure out a way to harm you. Thanks to this invulnerability your body has also been increased and improved. You always maintain your ideal body shape as long as the minimum amount of caloric intake is maintained and you never gain unwanted weight. You have increased agility slightly beyond peak human with the flexibility of a professional gymnast. Your senses have been augmented, allowing you to see like a hawk, smell like a dog, and hear like a bat, with no risk of damage from overloading them. Finally your strength has been increased allowing you to access 100% of the power of your muscles at all times. This allows you to access the full potential power of the human body without your muscles tearing your tendons off of the bones. With this you could pick up, or with effort throw, a sedan. You may optionally choose to have this power give you snow white hair."
400,Burst Stream of Destruction,Duel Monsters - Shadow Realm,"The power of the Blue Eyes White Dragon should never be underestimated, the three-headed matriarch of the clan able to lay waste to empires as the sun rose and set. You have harnessed the power of her offspring, able to either enhance your own magical attacks with a blue wave of destructive that can turn castles into ashes, and mountains into a collapsing landslide. You may also use the destructive beam on its own without any additional magic. Initially, this is draining and unwieldy, but with time, you may unleash this destruction as easily as the dragons themselves, and increase its power. Let none stand before your might."
400,Heat Vision,Superman: the Animated Series,"A Kryptonian’s deadliest weapon. Heat vision is essentially a high-intensity laser that will scorch anything it touches. This laser is extremely precise, and can be used to heat up cold drinks or lobotomize people as necessary."
400,Kingly Gaze,Fate/Grand Order,"Heavy is the gaze of one as high as you are. Just standing before your eyes will make others feel the truth of what they are and exactly how low they are in comparison to you. Just by looking at a person, you can harm them with the weight of the shame and guilt they’ll immediately feel for opposing you. The weaker they are in comparison to you, the worse this effect will be. Those on your level or above will feel strained in their movements and slightly weakened but the further below you someone is, the weaker they’ll be when in your sight and the more pain they’ll feel for every second they’re under your watchful eyes. If they’re as weak as to be no more than a normal human or less, their minds will simply break from a single glance from you, provided you don’t purposefully limit yourself to spare the mortals."
400,Metamor Stair,Medaka Box Abnormal,"Evolution is a wonderful process. It made these humans that are so fun to mess with, didn't it? But sometimes you can't be bothered waiting a few millions years for something to happen and just want it now. Now you can with just a touch, force anything, be it a person or an object, to evolve to a new and better stage up to twice. A monkey could be made to become a man and then into an evolved form of man. A blade could be turned into a chain sword and then into an energy sword."
400,Purification,Rise of the Guardians,"You can, with but a touch, cleanse things and people of corrupting influences with no lasting harm to them. Erase a poison, remove mind control, cure a curse — return things to a natural state. Nothing in your grasp shall ever be twisted against itself or others. Always passively affecting yourself, but may be turned off if you for some reason feel the need."
400,Telepathy,X-Men Evolution,"The power of the mind is truly a powerful thing. You are able to read and control minds, pick up psychic screams, project your thoughts to others, create powerful illusions that trick all the senses, and can scan locations to find specific minds. Along with that you can influence both cognitive and motor functions in others making them do things they wouldn’t normally do. Altering memories although highly grey can be done as well if you can stomach the ethics. At the start you’ll be able to alter the minds of dozens of individuals at once. With time or training you’ll be able to affects a packed sports stadium which ranges from the hundreds to thousands. Your psychic abilities will improve to the point where you can project your mind outside your body to travel the astral plane, gain the power to fly, and the the ability to create psychic energy constructs/weapons, such as a scythe, swords, and horses."
400,The Power You Wield,Rise of the Guardians,"Most of the time, Spirits go from place to place spreading their Center wherever they can. Sometimes, though, they need to defend themselves or others, and that’s where something like this can come in handy. You have some sort of unique superpower or ability; it’s not directly related to your Center, but should be linked to whatever theme you have as a Spirit. If you’re Jack Frost, you might be able to control all things winter, bringing cold and snow wherever you go and unleashing it in blasts of icy lightning. If you’re the Sandman, you might be a more fantastical version of Green Lantern, creating golden sand at will and forming it into whips to fight with or clouds to fly on or sea life to swim through the air. Your power, whatever it is, need not be combat-related, though. Want to be able to open up underground tunnels that lead all over the world and close behind you? Want to be a master craftsman, capable of forging enchanted swords or making magical toys? Want to be able to gradually summon weak minions to do your bidding? Want to do something stranger? That can happen. Just don’t go too crazy; you’re getting a blank check here, but try to keep it to around the same level of power elaborated upon here."
400,Winging Ceremony,Sekirei,A kiss from you can bring out the latent abilities in others and supercharge their normal abilities for a short period of time depending on where you kiss them. I.E: A kiss on the hand will have less effect than a kiss on the lips.
400,Psychic,With This Ring,"Psychic powers are incredibly versatile: Telepaths can bestow a college level education in minutes with little effort, as well as learn or teach languages with no trouble, beguile the senses with illusions, communicate silently over massive distances, read memories or thoughts, and even control minds. Telekines of sufficient strength can become their own Alcubierre drives. The Tinker’s cap, which bestows both powers, allowed a pudgy man in his 50s to take on the Justice Society (not “a member” of the Justice Society, the entire Justice Society) and win. If you lack psychic powers, you are granted innate telepathy and telekinesis on a level comparable to those granted by the Thinker’s Cap. If you already have psychic powers, then they are boosted by a comparable amount. With practice, you may learn how to phase-shift. You will be a match for a talented martian in terms of power and skill, making you less powerful than Miss Martian (whose can hear whispers of thoughts on Mars from Earth), but more skilled than her. Please remember, a clever and skilled psychic can regularly defeat a more powerful telepath or telekine in both the mental and physical world."
400,Dupli-Kate,Invincible,"Through a mystic curse you have been empowered to be able to use Bio-fission, able to at will make clones of yourself and absorb them. You are able to make an enormous number of clones, each a perfect copy of you, who innately exist in a sort of hive mind (no one being superior to the others, and all working together). When you first activate this power you’re limited to making about a hundred clones, with time and practice however you will discover that you are able to make as many clones as you want. The clones are permanent fixtures in reality and once created, they remain unless absorbed and reintegrated into your body, meaning that if they get crushed they are a pain to clean up. So long as any single clone survives, so will you in your entirety. I suggest you hide one somewhere no one else will find it."
500,UKNOWN HERO,Medaka Box Abnormal,"You’ve been blessed with superhuman strength, so much so that it terrifies all those around you to an unbelievable extent. You’re able to knock down buildings with a single blow and take tank shells to the face with naught but a grin to show for it. And that innate fear? It looks like anyone not at least as strong as you becomes so scared of your strength that you are removed from their senses and memories unless you specifically point yourself out. If someone as strong as you or stronger points you out, everyone else in the area will be able to see you until you leave but even if you are actively attacking those weaker than you, so long as you have not been pointed out, they won’t be able to figure out how they’re being hurt. If you spend another 200CP, you can gain the Theme Song power in addition to Unknown Hero. This will make it so that you’re able to, for a few minutes at a time before tiring yourself out, move at the speed of light itself. You can a series of striking black tiger stripes over your skin when you activate this mode. It also allows you to create several very short lived but entirely physical clones at will. Even if you do not purchase this upgrade, you will be able to deactivate the fear aura you have at will."
600,Adaptability,Justice League Unlimited,"Your enemies will have to think of new tricks anytime they fight you. Regardless of what it is you can't be beaten the same way twice. Get lobotomized by someone's laser vision? So long as you can recover from it you'll always be able to shrug off such an attack whenever it gets used against you again. Adaptations are permanent for the form you're in when you receive them. Any adaptation you develop will protect you against similar levels of damage in roughly the same area, so if Superman melted your brain with laser vision your skull would become immune to energy attacks as strong or weaker than Superman's heat vision, and if you managed to regenerate from a nuclear explosion your skin would harden to allow you to survive similar attacks in the future. Also if you you were ever hi by something like a magical fireball then you'd be immune to both regular and magical fire of the same strength or intensity as whatever spell you were hit by."
600,Angstrom Levy,Invincible,"You were born with the powers to open portals to step between realities. You can open portals to travel within the local multiverse of every setting you enter and can simply move from one to the other. The only problem with this would have been that while every setting has this local infinite multiverse and you’re are able to open portals to travel through it, you do not know where you are in the multiverse or where you are precisely within each universe. However thanks to the grace of jumpchain you now possess the equivalent to knowledge to what Angstrom Levy would attain through gathering up all of his copies, that of knowing innately where you are in both universe and multiverse as well as the general features of the universe in question. Thanks to this the portals that you open to parallel realities no longer have to be in the exact same physical location as where you are standing. This knowledge updates in future worlds. You are also able to open portals to other parallel dimensions should they exist naturally in the setting, such as the Never Never in Dresden files, Heaven and Hell in DC, or parallel realities in Marvel for example. You are limited to the local multiverse until post-spark, upon which you can go anywhere."
600,Esper Ability,Re: Monster,"Like Rou, you possessed an ability before coming to the world of Re:Monster, and also like Rou, you’ve maintained that ability even after being reincarnated into a new body. These abilities vary greatly and can range from the fairly mundane to the truly powerful. Common examples include Teleportation, Psychometry, Telepathy, and Psychokinesis.


--- Empowered (Requires Protagonist): For an additional 200cp, undiscounted, or if you possess the Protagonist perk, you can instead gain a truly potent ability, such as Rou’s [Absorption] ability or an equally potent ability that allows for a constant degree of growth. Examples are given in the notes section. ---"
600,Goemon Ishikawa,Petals of Reincarnation,"A famous Japanese outlaw, whose accomplishments were believed to be mostly mythical because of how fantastic they were. His legendary thieving skills grew into the dual power you now possess in this state. Goemon grants the user two powers, one in each of their arm, that become glowing black appendages when in use. Their Right Arm is the Arm of Thievery, able to selectively ignore any outside influences to steal things, allowing the user to phase their arm through objects and steal things within those objects before phasing back out. Taking all of someone’s blood without leaving an entry wound is as easy as stealing a section of a rock to hide within the resulting hole. This arm can also be used to steal powers from other beings, which are then utilised with the left arm, the Arm of Usage. This arm is the one through which all stolen powers are channelled, though the powers are only degraded versions of the originals."
600,Guardian,Rise of the Guardians,"The Guardians were founded by the Man in the Moon to protect the children of the world. Most of the time, their duties consist of doing what they probably would have done anyway. But occasionally there will come a threat to the children of Earth, and in such times the Guardians are called to defend. To aid in this, you gain power when protecting others. Be it chasing away a child’s bad dreams or protecting them from the hordes of the Nightmare King himself, you shall never be stronger than when you are defending others, particularly if doing so puts yourself in harm’s way, boosting your power up to five times what it might normally be. This boost becomes even greater the more vulnerable and defenseless whoever you’re protecting is; the more they need your help, the better you’re able to help them. Additionally, once per Jump or ten years, whichever comes first, if even a single non-follower who believes you exist is in danger, you may come back from the dead to protect them."
600,Imagine Resistance,Toaruverse,"Unlike the certain protagonist whose powers is uncontrollable and also negates his own luck, yours is dif erent. You gained a controllable version of Imagine Breaker that doesn’t negate positive things for you like luck or someone healing through magic or abilities. This power emits a skintight barrier around you that protects you from internal and external harmful ef ects and damage from all supernatural powers like magic, esper, and divine powers. It can also be weaponize to dispel or negate powers and abilities which can be applied to any weapon that is connected to you or things that you are holding. While it can be applied to weapons that you’re holding or connected to you but this is not passive and you have to actively apply it to your weapons. At the start it can dispel or negate abilities and powers equal to a level five Esper and reduce the damage and effects that you would receive from higher and more powerful ones and the ability to dispel or negate abilities and powers would grow stronger as your overall power grow, as powers with the same origin as original Imagine Breaker it won’t af ect or cancel out each other."
600,Original Way,The God of Highschool,"When humanity first joined the Heavenly War against the demons, they were weak and useless. It was only when the Gods granted the Humans a portion of their power, the original way of using Charyeok, that the humans became the near endless military force they were in those times. You are have the ability to make contracts like these with any being, gaining use of an imbued part of their power in return for favours or services of some kind, in the same way as a Charyeok works. Whilst convincing them to take the deal is up to you, once you have received the power, any harmful side effects that might come about from making use of it, such as the ones suffered by Humans making used of the Original Way of using Charyeok, will be greatly reduced. Using borrowed power that significantly ages you by decades might only add a year or two to your overall age."
600,Power Absorption,X-Men Evolution,"The mac daddy of the superpowers. Why have one superpower when you can have them all? Temporarily of course though. Like a certain Rogue, you too can gain the memories, skills, and powers of beings that you touch by absorbing their life force and weakening them, possibly into a coma if you aren't careful. Those that are stronger than you can resist this up to an extent although if they severely dwarf you in power then there is no absorption. You are able to select specific skills like dancing with a light touch but full on skin to skin contact will result in you getting the whole deal. Longer touching leads to longer usage of powers up to a 24 hour period. If you’ve gone beyond and absorbed a person’s life force to the point of their death then that power is permanently yours for the taking and it can even be improved beyond what the original owner was capable of."
600,Silver Eyes,RWBY,"You have the Silver Eyes of the warriors of old, said to be capable of killing Grimm with nothing but a single look. Your eyes start off weak, only activating in times of great need, but in time you will reach this level of power as well. When your eyes reach their zenith, you’ll be able to kill lesser Grimm with glance, and petrify greater ones with minor effort. In future Jumps, you may choose a single enemy type to gain these same effects on."
600,The Coloured Man,King Arthur,"Pick from ten different colours. You can change your skin to match that colour, and as long as every item you wear is that colour you get a boost to dexterity, durability, and strength as well as a magical enhancement Or power based on the color."
600,Titanic Strength,All-Star Superman,"Would you believe that people who can throw down with the Man of Steel aren’t as uncommon as some think? For years, Superman has battled foes capable of withstanding his super strength and hitting back with just as much force...and whether you’ve had a hell of a workout regimen or special genetic traits, you’re among them. Like Samson and Atlas, you possess enough physical strength that you could wrestle the average Kryptonian and come out on top, your body likewise tough enough to withstand such blows, and a minor healing factor that would let you snap broken bones back into place with a little adjustment, though not enough to spontaneously grow limbs back. You may lack the versatility of a Kryptonian, but that doesn’t mean you should be underestimated!"
600,Super Speed,Arrowverse,"You’ve gained the ability to go superfast! Your physiology has been augmented into a lean-muscular frame well-beyond peak human condition. This lets you to easily handle the rigors of your speed; you can resist high-level friction, inertia, air pressure, reduced oxygen, & kinetic impact. This allows you to run at superhuman speeds starting at 200mph, along with the agility and perception to match. This also accelerates your healing capabilities, healing yourself completely from injury in a matter of hours or days. Your ability to heal is unable to regrow limbs, but if you're fast enough you can reattach a limb to the stump, before your healing factor heals the wound. Your speed is soft capped at Mach 40 at which point you find it harder to improve your speed without serious time invested in training. If it relates just to speed, anything Barry Allen can do such as dodge bullets at just Mach 1 speed, or run up buildings & across water, you can do it too. However everything else you see Barry do requires..."
800,Conjunction User,Medaka Box Abnormal,"Every day, miracles are happening around the world. From child birth to heroic feats of courage and strength, the everyday impossible is always happening. But you’re not about what’s just every day. You make the really miraculous things happen. When you use this style, usually by reciting the word ‘therefore’, you are able to make the least possible thing in the current situation the most possible thing. A girl cutting an airship in half or winning against an opponent they could not ordinarily defeat at all. It’s a mighty ability that, with careful use, can allow you to succeed in almost all things. But it cannot make the impossible possible and it will only ever make the least likely thing into the most likely, which may not always be exactly what you want to happen."
800,Lost Password,Medaka Box Abnormal,"When the fools try to crawl their way up to your level, you'll be waiting at the top with a hammer to slam down on their hands and send them plummeting back to the distant ground. On contact, you are able to deeply and permanently weaken any being that you touch. You are effectively able to 'return them to level one'. This removes anything that they do not naturally have or that is not the basic knowledge and common sense that an average adult of their race would have. They'd lose all their training in combat, all the skill in using supernatural powers, lose any powers or abilities that they did not innately possess, have the raw power that they have reduced to what they had at the very beginning. They retain their memories and can still function but will in effect, be a level one character compared to whatever they were before."
1000,Skill Creation,Medaka Box Abnormal,"For someone who already has so many powers, one might come to think they’d not need any more. But never underestimate the allure of new toys to play with or how happy others are when you share them. Skill Creation is an Abnormality that gives you the power to create powers, within certain limits. The powers you are able to create are outlined by the powers you already have available to you. You are able to use any ability or trait that you have, whether it be a superpower or a magic spell or a personality trait or some physical trait, and use any of the component parts to create your new powers. This way, you can grant copies of your own powers to others, create hybrids of your existing powers for yourself to use or make weaker versions of your powers before granting them to others. You can make as many copies of any power you can create as you desire, it costs nothing and takes nothing more than a thought from you, though having multiples of the same power will not allow you to use more than the effects of one at a time. When it comes to handing powers out to others, you may do so instantly provided you can see all your desired targets presently. This Abnormality also allows you to retake what you have given out even if you cannot see the recipient at the time."
1200,Anshin’in,Medaka Box Abnormal,"A mysterious being has appeared once more in this world. A being that can’t be called human yet looks like one. The second member of the Najimi family has appeared and it’s none other than yourself Jumper. But what’s this? You don’t have any powers yet. How strange for such a high priced option. Perhaps you should wait a bit and see what appears to you. You see, the power of Anshin’in is not one that is immediately expressed but one that is infinite in time. The power to develop more powers, independently of anything else and at a rate that makes all things outside of it really quite silly. You automatically develop new Abnormalities at a rate of 3,779 new powers per year. That’s about 10 new powers every 24 hours. A stunning rate isn’t it? Not all powers are equal however. The vast majority of powers that you gain are ultra-specific to your immediate thoughts and wishes at the time and quite limited in ability. Looking at yourself in the mirror one morning and wishing you didn’t need to use a razor to shave would give you Rather Razor [The shave facial hair from faces with a thought power] while wishing you could punish the driver who cut you off in traffic later that morning may give you Back Wheel Burnout [The ruin the back wheels of any car you can see power]. Now and then, you can gain powers with greater scope and magnitude, especially if you are desperately needing them or have a great connection to the potential power. A lifelong pyromaniac stuck battling a foe in a dry forest has a good chance of developing Foolish Friendly Flames [The create and control fire power]. These good abilities are quite rare, especially if there’s no pressing need for them, and even more powerful abilities are even rarer. As you get older, in the scale of orders of magnitude older, better powers will begin to become more and more common for you to regularly develop."
1200,Fact User,Medaka Box Abnormal,"Did you know that you fortune cookies are from China? Honest truth. Did you also know that when you tell a lie now, it becomes the truth? I promise I’m not lying. You have the ability to turn any lie you tell into the truth, changing reality to match your words. All you need to do is have someone other than yourself there and to tell them a statement that begins with ”Did you know...”. As long as that person believes, even for the briefest of moments, that you have not lied then the lie you told becomes the truth. If they can manage to prove that you were lying or have some ability that allows them to uncover lies, reveal truth or destroy illusions, then they can revert your lies and any effects they have had on the world and the beings in it. However, if they cannot do that, then they are essentially helpless before your tricks."
