Cost,Perk Name,Source,Description
0,Badger,My Hero Academia,"This Quirk grants the power to lengthen and harden the user’s nails a bit on command. This can be helpful with peeling tags, clawing people, poking through plastic, scratching a particular itch and so on. Comes at the expense of the effects not being very potent."
0,Bendy Fingers,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user has a heightened range of movement within their fingers, allowing them to bend backwards and side to side as easily as normal fingers could be curled forward. This heightened flexibility and dexterity is exclusively in the fingers."
0,Hardening,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to harden any part of their body. This protects them against not only physical force, but also heat and shock. Such protection is minimal to start, but as with most Quirks can be trained up tremendously. Hardening effects can be worn down with repeated abuse."
0,Permeation,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to become intangible, causing everything to pass through them harmlessly, with many conditions and caveats. When the user sinks into an object with their power and deactivates their perk, they’re shunted out due to matter being unable to overlap, popping them back up on the surface. The major limitation is obvious, the user causes everything to pass through them, including light, air, varying small particles, vibrations and so on. This essentially causes their senses to stop functioning due to lack of input until the user shuts off their Quirk. This can be incredibly dangerous due to the user being unable to breath, hear or see."
50,Iron lungs,Sekirei,"You can breathe in dangerous smoke, smog, and even fatal chemicals without experiencing any harm from the substance in question"
100,Cast Iron Stomach,Fate/Stay Night,"You've been through Hell before. Felt it's very essence pour straight down your gullet and boil in the pits of your stomach. You found the whole ordeal rather scrumptious. Whether the food is ferociously spicy, eye wateringly sour or just plain dangerous to put in your mouth at all, you can gulp it all down without a care in the world. You can still enjoy every bit of it but you'll never fin yourself gagging or choking on your food and you'll certainly avoid any of the dreaded after effects of certain foods like a spicy Mapou Tofu. It does need to have been intended as edible food for the general populous, so pouring poison or metal down your throat won't do anything but hurt, but even the nastiest or most dangerous of actual foods are now totally safe."
100,Comfy Knees,Meddlesome Kitsune Senko-san,"A pillow isn’t the only thing that is extremely comfortable to cuddle, and sleep on. There are some parts of the body that are just slightly too bony or hard to be truly comfortable. This effect makes it so that your whole body is like a giant huggable pillow. People would as happily fall asleep on your knees as they would in your arms, no more endless shifting to get more comfortable."
100,Enhanced Sulong,Requires Mink,"Requires: Mink

Where other Minks must rely upon the Full Moon to activate this transformation, you are unique. You are now capable of accessing your Sulong Form at will, with the side effects of prolonged use greatly reduced. Keep in mind, they are not gone, as continuously accessing this form for extended periods of time can and will eventually kill you."
100,Evolution is a function of Time,With This Ring,"​And you’ve had centuries to a millennium more of it than most of earth’s population. Most people today are stronger, smarter, and healthier than people a thousand years ago, and not just because of better access to healthcare, education, and nutrition. You gain a minor boost to all your stats, physical and mental, that means your potential is about fifty percent greater than it was. While this doesn’t grant you an Olympian physique, it does mean that if you work out to reach your peak, no normal 21st century human would be able to match you."
100,Food,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user is able to bite, chew and digest almost anything they can get their jaws around, even snapping off chunks of reinforced steel and swallowing it with ease. Due to the effects of this Quirk when in use, the user digests things extremely fast, allowing them to eat and eat and eat as if running on an empty stomach. Of course, the user has to actually be able to bite something for this Quirk to come in handy, and toxins can still make them sick, but otherwise this renders their jaws insanely dangerous."
100,Heavenly Flight,The God of Highschool,"Several wings sprout from your back, numbering anywhere from two to six as you please. These wings grant you the power of perfected flight. Independent of any actual wing beats and thus perfectly controlled, you may fly through the air as fast as you can run or swim, yet this form of travel requires no effort or exertion on your part. These wings may also function as shields or even weapons, being just as tough and able to be trained as your arms or legs."
100,Hypertrophy,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to greatly enlarge one of their body parts at a time, vastly increasing their strength and durability in the process of doing so. A single arm could be grown to match the size of the rest of the body. Muscles are greatly strengthened in the process of enlarging the body part. The user is limited to one body part at a time, and enlarged body parts are still vulnerable to possible injuries normal flesh is vulnerable too."
100,In The Blood,Campione!,"Eugenics, baby. Blood ties are important for a reason and now you have control over it. You can choose any of your traits, powers or gifts to become a sure pass down to all your blood descendants. It could be your miko gift, your magic reserves or even some natural predisposition or talent you may possess. Whatever it is, it will become a trait carried over all your blood-related descendants."
100,Iron Density,Sonic the Hedgehog,"You’re tough and durable it’ll be exceedingly hard to break you. You could be tossed around at mach 2 and still have all your limbs intact. Sure it didn’t stop that metal pole from piercing your lung, nor the blinding pain but at least your insides aren’t jello!"
100,Longevity,My Hero Academia,"The possessor of this Quirk has functional immortality, being able to continue aging with no real upper limit, similar to certain animals like lobsters. The Quirk holder does not degrade over time like normal humans, being able to collect a vast array of skills, experiences and knowledge over their long life. Those with Longevity and the Hero or Villain may start with a decade or two of additional experience. The holder of Longevity is in every other way a normal human, still potentially vulnerable to dying via disease, accident or being murdered by someone else."
100,Magic Hands,Meddlesome Kitsune Senko-san,"You really do have magic hands, at least that is what people tell you. From massages to petting, your hands are great at making other people feel great. They will practically melt at the touch of your fingertips. Not only that, like with most skills you’ll only get better with time and practise."
100,Mink,One Piece: New World,"Native to the traveling elephant Zou, Minks are an anthropomorphic race of mammalian animals that are physically superior to humans. They can project electricity from their hands to strike at foes, and have a powerful transformation under the full moon, but it comes at a serious cost."
100,Natural Disease Immunity,King Arthur,"This give you complete immunity to natural diseases, but while it gives increased resistance you're still liable to get magical and man made diseases, so while it probably won't kill you try not to piss off some wizard or mad scientist. Also protects from poisons of all kind."
100,Peak Condition,Young Justice,"A combination of good genetics and your active, hectic lifestyle means that your body is always at the peak of what’s possible for a human. This doesn’t grant extra intelligence, but it does increase your brain’s processing power and grants great memory recall, as well as sharper senses."
100,Peak Performance,Mushoku Tensei,"The results of training your mind, body, skills and magic reached perfection which allowed your skills to be ingrained into the very core of your being. This elevates your physical abilities to be roughly equal to an Advance-Rank Warrior or Peak Human without Battle Aura and you can maintain this peak form without further training and can only improve from there. Your mind has also improved, granting you an eidetic memory with perfect recall and indexing and you can also process a lot more information faster and seal away any undesirable memories. This also stops any of your physical, mental and magical energy and skills along with any other aspect of yourself from degrading or atrophying due to lack of use or time"
100,Pliabody,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user’s body has extreme range of motion and pliability, like dough with muscles. Through this range of movement and potential for contortion, they can bend, stretch and flatten their body parts using their muscles as the shaping force. If the Quirk user is overpowered, their body might contort against their will, leaving them in awkward situations. There is a limit to the Quirk user’s pliability, and damage can be incurred from being stretched or flattened past these limits."
100,Protecting Yourself,Flow,"It’s a dangerous world out there and because of it the body needs to be forged. Your physical capabilities, intelligence, looks, senses, etc have been enhanced beyond the peak of human potential to the point of being superhuman. You’re faster than the eye can see, can easily jump over buildings like a human grasshopper, and have the strength to punch a person clear across the room while breaking the wall in the process. You know a variety of martial arts and even the skills to handle a multitude of weapons. While you’re not exactly a master martial artist you’ve yet to lose at combat with those who have decades of experience."
100,Restful Sleep,Arrowverse,"Crime is usually fought at night, but crime never sleeps. You however do need to sleep, just not as often. You can get a full night's rest with just an hour of uninterrupted sleep. How this is achieved is up to you, perhaps as a Martial Artist you can meditate. Maybe as a scientist you were exposed to something, and it could be as mundane as the awful police coffee keeping you awake."
100,Super Endurance,Rune Factory,"Apparently, there isn’t a lot of time to slow down when monsters are chasing you and you only have so much time in the day to deliver the mail. From sunup to sun down, you have an abundance of energy, and all you need to recover from constantly running at your maximum speed nonstop is a quick little break with a hot cup of milk or just some water, and then you’re good to go."
100,Tough,Rosario + Vampire,For your species your exceptionally tough nearly super human or super youkai as the case may be. If your human you are not bullet proof but can take a beating and survive even a few hits from a youkai. If your another species then your toughness is increased in a similar fashion.
100,Tough as Nails,Generic Gamer,"You’re not quite bulletproof, but you are bullet-resistant — you could walk through a hail of the things and come out the other side with only a few small bruises to show for it. This toughness is not merely skin-deep — your durability extends all throughout your body to cover even your insides; there will be no being clever and targeting your eyes as a weak point, because you don’t have any. And you’re more than tough — you’re vital. You can hold your breath for nearly half an hour before your lungs start to burn, you only need a few hours’ sleep each night, and your endurance is such that you’d need to run a marathon before getting winded. Only the most deadly of diseases and poisons can slow you down. You even seem to heal faster, such that injuries that might incapacitate others for a week will only keep you down for a day or two."
100,Tsunade,Naruto,"Ever since you were young, you were gifted with immense physical strength, even when you were only a few years old. As you grew, so too did your strength, and it has advanced to the point where you can split the ground with just a finger, break a Sannin’s ribs, both their arms and rupturing several of their organs with just a punch, and even break through a Susanoo with only half a dozen punches."
100,Minor Blessing,Percy Jackson,"For one reason or another you've got a god who cares slightly about you and has seen fit to grant you some minor boon within their domains. Choose one god from any pantheon and gain a minor boon from them. The god will care slightly about you but unless you go on to further distinguish yourself it will be more of a minor interest in your affairs than someone they feel the need to help (Effectively think a diminished version of one ability a demigod might have, think minor ones are stuff along the lines of breathing water, lucid dreaming, or appropriate vague extra senses, useful but nothing especially major). This can be taken multiple times."
150,All-Killing Ash Bones,Naruto,"Requires: Shikotsumyaku

One of Kaguya’s signature abilities, the All-Killing Ash Bones are a fearsome weapon truly deserving of their status as a certain-kill technique. The user is capable of extruding ultra-hard bones from their body and using them as melee weapons or firing them as projectiles. When these bones pierce a living organism, the bone and the target both start to deteriorate, quickly disintegrating them and leaving their bodies as nothing more than ash."
150,Boil Release,Naruto,"A Kekkei Genkai produced through the combination of fire and water affinities, this bloodline allows the user to manipulate hot, corrosive vapors for a variety of different purposes. It can be used to produce acidic gases potent enough to dissolve even the most durable of substances, or to generate powerful steam that can melt the user’s surroundings."
150,Crystal Release,Naruto,"An anime-exclusive bloodline unique to only one other individual. As its name suggests, this bloodline allows the user to convert any matter into crystal whether it be the ground beneath their feet, the moisture hanging in the air, or the person standing next to them. If desired, the target can be crystallized down to the cellular level, preventing them from being uncrystallized without the user's aid. The user will also be able to manipulate the crystals quite easily. This cannot crystallize pure energy, so chakra, fire, lightning, and other similar phenomena are immune to this ability’s effects. The weakness of this bloodline is that it is susceptible to lightning and energy-based attacks, and a certain sound wave can break the crystals apart. The color of your crystals is up to you. Earth Release is a component of Crystal Release."
150,Ice Release,Naruto,"This bloodline from Kiri allows for the manipulation of snow and ice, either by using pre-existing snow or by creating it outright. This bloodline requires both water and wind elemental natures. Beyond merely creating ice, the user can produce ice mirrors that they can enter and travel between, planting ice particles onto a person causing them to freeze to death, making ice dragons, and more. Unlike normal ice, the ice produced by this bloodline is greatly resistant to melting by fire. An Ice Release user can also voluntarily lower the temperature of their body and their surroundings to the point of causing snow to fall."
150,Shikotsumyaku,Naruto,"Descended somehow from Kaguya Ōtsutsuki, this bloodline grants the user the ability to control their osteoblasts (cells responsible for bone production) and osteoclasts (cells responsible for breaking down bones), and the ability to regulate the bones’ calcium density. The user can grow as many bones as they desire and with alterations they wish e.g. they can extract an arm bone from their body and alter it to be as sharp as a blade. The user can also create entirely new and original bones, such as manipulating their bones to create a bone drill. Due to the calcium control, the user can make their bones denser, increasing their power and toughness, strengthening their bones to render themselves highly resistant to damage. The user can manipulate their bones after or as they are being formed, causing them to break through the skin. The user can choose to keep them attached to their body or pull them out. Bones can also be forcefully ejected similar to bullets."
200,Armoured Juggernaut,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim,"Heavy armour is great isn’t it? The ability to wade into battle shrugging off arrows, magic, and blades alike, what’s not to like? Well one thing, it’s heavy as can be and will quickly tire out many given some time. This drawback doesn’t really apply to you. You recover from exertion at an astounding rate, to the point that even continuous and strenuous running or hiking in the mountains while wearing Daedric or Dragon bone armour wouldn’t phase you in the slightest, furthermore this unnatural endurance also applies to general health and strength as a warrior. Naturally you’re also quite skilled in the use of heavy armor, being able to make far greater use of it than most and being able to easily cover any weaknesses it has. Now go forth warrior, and let your enemies flee as your armoured form smashes their lines to pieces!"
200,Assault,My Hero Academia,"A simple Quirk, this one allows the user to increase the speed and power of their punches. Scaling off of the initial power of your punch, even a weakling could pulverize brick with a single bullet fast blow. Those who work on power and form will see incredible gains in return. Outside of the destructive potential of the user’s arms, the rest of their body lacks the offensive presence and protection, opening up potential for brutal counters."
200,Blood Knight,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user has minor regeneration and heightened blood regeneration that allows them to lose multiple times the blood that would be lethal to any normal human. Additionally, it holds unique coagulation properties. Whenever the Quirk user is injured to the point of drawing blood, their blood instantly spreads and coagulates in the form of flexible plate armor. The more the Quirk user is injured, the more seriously they’re injured, the more armor of blood they’ll gain making them harder to hurt. At the moment the user is wounded and the blood first starts to coagulate, it still has the capacity to block small arms fire before hardening into a much more protective state. Attacks powerful enough to push through before the armor fully hardens can brutally harm the user before their protection goes up."
200,Boundless Stamina,Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation,"Unlike the magicians who tend to be stationary during combat, the warriors need and use more stamina in combat as they are more likely to run around the battlefield. With this, you have gained boundless stamina that will allow you to fight and train for a month without resting or sleeping and a year if you decide to push yourself. You would only need to rest or sleep an hour per month to fully recover your stamina and mental fatigue and return to peak condition and a full day should push yourself like fighting or training for an entire year. This also removes muscle pains and cramps from not exercising for too long or stretching first before doing a strenuous activity."
200,Brick,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user has a more powerful and efficient physiology compared to the average man or woman. Musculature weaving, bone structure alteration, there are a number of complexities, though in basic terms it means they’re much stronger, faster, tougher and enduring than others. The Quirk user could throw cars through the air, outrun them on the interstate, and just feel pretty sore if they actually got run over. The Quirk user has a higher metabolism, requiring them to eat more than others. Takes active practice to reign in their strength for delicate work."
200,Foldabody,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to control the thinness of their own body and stretch, allowing them to spread or unfurl themselves while becoming thin as paper or more so. This allows the user to pass through incredibly narrow passages or strike completely undetected. The primary limitation is the time it takes to transform, and movement is a bit tricky after doing so."
200,Genomorph/Human/Kryptonian Hybrid,With This Ring,"​You have greater strength and durability than an Atlantean, x-ray vision and enhanced senses, a predisposition to telepathy that could be developed with technology or magic; but you're weak to red-sunlight and kryptonite, which will leave you in pain and at the level of a normal human, but functional. You cannot match a full-blooded Kryptonian, fly, or use heat vision, but the right technology or arcane work could allow you to overcome this lack of power. Expect Superman to be uncomfortable around you."
200,Gifted - Magical Animagus,Generic Harry Potter Fanfiction,"​Your animagus form isn’t a run-of-the-mill animal, but rather a magical being, such as a dragon or a unicorn. You have all the powers a normal specimen of this animal might have."
200,Gifted - Magical Resistance,Generic Harry Potter Fanfiction,"​Somehow you have skin like a Dragon or a Basilisk, which provides you an incredible resistance to harmful magic of all types. This ability is strongest in your skin, allowing you to tank mighty spells without even noticing them, but it’s only slightly less potent elsewhere. This Gift works through absorbing the magic used on you, meaning that sufficiently strong magic can still affect you, it’s just that the bar is sky-high now. Ordinary spells like jinxes and hexes aren’t even noticed, a fireball that would vaporize anyone else leaves you mildly smoking, and dancing naked in Fiendfyre would give you a slight burn. This works not just on deliberately cast magic, but also on magical gifts, be they possessed by humans or beasts. Unless they’re exceptionally powerful, of course. A Dementor’s aura does nothing to you, nor do the weaker diseases of a Nundu’s breath. There is one single exception to this however. The Killing Curse isn’t hindered in the slightest by this."
200,Harpoon,My Hero Academia,"The user of this Quirk is able to project steel spikes on lines resembling rope from their body at bullet like speeds, the spikes growing barbs to anchor themselves upon penetration. The user is able to retract the barbs and/or reel the spikes back in with similar intensity to their projection. The user is also able to fire additional harpoons from the lines of other harpoons. In completion, the user is able to use this power to swing and pull themselves quickly or attack from multiple angles. There is a fair share of limitations attached however. The spikes are formed from a deposit of iron collected from the user’s blood. This means they can only project ten at any one time, and if any are lost, such as the line being severed, they’ll need to be replaced over the course of several days."
200,High Caliber Body,Final Fantasy 7 Remake,"Those who fight for the resistance are NOT your average cityfolk. Whether they look like it or not, these brave men and women can keep up with the best troopers Shinra can field, and most of them are cyborgs! Whether you want Barrett’s rippling physique or prefer a less obvious look, you have the strength, endurance, and durability to fistfight giant robots. Heck, you could even keep up with a SOLDIER, for a time. There are still some challenges that are beyond you; the monsters of this world can only be matched by SOLDIERs and their enhanced bodies. That said, pushing your physical form to its limits has yielded some incredible results. After all, if your body is your weapon, you might as well have the best available."
200,Innate Talent - Physical Powerhouse,Overlord,"You are just straight up more physically powerful than your race should be. If you’re a human you could easily lift and throw a full grown horse a few dozen feet, run at speeds comparable to said horse, and possess endurance enough to match three of said horse. Unlike many Innate Talents you don’t actually have to do anything or learn anything in order to make use of this. Races other than humans see a similar boost to their physical abilities in line proportional to what would be normal for their race. Scales with level, and applies to other races you might have from other jumps."
200,Jūgo's Clan,Naruto,"This unique biological trait allows the user to passively absorb natural energy from their surroundings and actively utilize that energy without prior training. The user is able to transform either part or all of their body by exposing their fluids to natural energy. The exact aesthetic of these transformations is up to you, but what remains consistent is that the user gains enhanced physical abilities, boosting strength, speed, stamina, reflexes, durability, and perception. This transformation also boosts the power of the user’s techniques. The user will also be able to create weapon-like appendages from their own body which can possess numerous possible functions. You can create wings to fly, grow gills to breathe underwater, create cannons to fire chakra blasts and even more. Because you are paying CP, you will not have personality problems or lose control of yourself, and you can turn this ability on and off as you choose."
200,Muscle Augmentation,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user is able manipulate and amplify their muscle fibers, and even have them harmlessly protrude from the Quirk user’s skin. Through these abilities, the Quirk user is able to massively increase their power, speed and resilience. They may also use their muscle fibers as makeshift tentacles to bind others or manipulate nearby objects in their surroundings. The Quirk user is only able to amplify their existing muscles so much, requiring exercise that can build up their base musculature to make the most out of this Quirk. The Quirk user is only able to amplify their muscles, leaving other parts of their physiology vulnerable."
200,Namekian,Dragon Ball Z,"A proud, slug-like race of warriors and mystics alike, the Namekians come with a naturally regenerative ability and strong durability, as well as a natural ki ability. They can become stronger through training, only require water to survive, and can turn themselves giant after sufficient training, letting them become stronger for a time. You start on planet Namek."
200,Pure-Blooded Devil,Highschool DxD,"Originating from the Underworld under the guidance of the Four Great Satans, these infernal beings of myth actually look almost identical to humans, save for the ability to manifest black wings and sometimes possessing pointed ears. All Devils receive many benefits from their physical forms, such as superhuman strength and endurance, as well as enhanced senses which includes the ability to see in the dark. This comes with a natural aptitude towards magic, though they take more damage from holy weapons, such as those of Angels."
200,Strong Constitution,Rising of the Shield Hero,"You have quite the strong constitution. You become unnaturally resistant to mundane illness and diseases, immune to poison and alcohol, you don’t even get dizzy from spinning too fast if you don’t want to."
200,Unsealable,Naruto,"The possibility of being sealed away inside an object or a person is a threat to even immortal beings like the Tailed Beasts and those revived by the Edo Tensei. Luckily for you, something about your nature resists the effects of fūinjutsu, rendering you immune to being sealed. Even your powers resist sealing, preventing others from suppressing your abilities by placing seals on your being. Post-Jump, this perk will protect you against sealing and imprisonment through means other than fūinjutsu, such as magic."
200,Uzumaki Clan,Naruto,"The descendants of Asura himself, the Uzumaki were once the cousin clan of the Senju that were wiped out decades ago leaving only a handful of survivors, you among them. As a descendant of Hagoromo, you possess unusually large chakra reserves and an incredibly strong life force, allowing you to live longer and age slower, as well as granting you the first tier of Regeneration Ability. You may also purchase the second tier of Regeneration Ability for only 400 PP. You could even temporarily survive the removal of a Tailed Beast from your body, though medical help will be necessary to survive past the initial removal. Your chakra bestows upon you three different abilities. The first is the ability to heal others by feeding them your chakra, the second is the ability to create chakra chains powerful enough to bind the Nine Tails itself, and the third is the ability to sense chakra across continents. You also gain a free purchase of Specialist tailored to Fuinjutsu."
200,Werewolf,Rosario + Vampire,"A wild beast like monster that is normally in it's human form but transforms in to a werewolf on moon light nights. It lacks the unique abilities of most monsters but is a physical powerhouse with speed and agility unrivaled by any other kind of monster and the potential for strength nearing that of a vampires. Their strength and speed increases proportionately with the light of the moon. On a full moon they are capable of matching even a shinso vampire in battle do to their blinding speed. They have super human strength, agility, endurance, toughness, they have a regenerative healing factor. They have wolf like senses and in their werewolf form their claws and fangs are very tough letting them bite through cinderblocks and some metals."
200,Youko,Rosario + Vampire,"A generic term for various classes of spirit fox. Represented by the Nine tail fox, many of which have very strong supernatural energy. It generally appears as a Human sized or larger fox with one or more Tail. They are actually humanoid though possessing hands and the ability to stand upright; though they may choose to walk around on all fours. Their appearance is prone to changing as they gain more tails. A jumper choosing this race start with one tail but will gain more as they grow in wisdom, power and increasing their Youki (Each extra tail represents a doubling of your power with a maximum of nine.) By Beating together their tails (or tail) they can generate Kitsune-bi a fire powerful enough to fatally injure a human. They can also learn techniques with this to cover their bodies with it and to generate it from their hands. Certain particularly powerful Youko can learn to take on a battle form. In battle form their bodies are optimized for combat greatly enhancing their strength, speed, durability and power overall."
200,Vampire,Rosario + Vampire,"This nigh immortal race is among the strongest Youki. They look human but tend to be very attractive, pale, have red eyes and silver hair. They are super strong, Super-fast, boast incredibly regeneration and toughness. They also possess the ability to transform their Yōki (Spiritual) energy in to strength to increase it further. They Possess the ability to hypnotize people by gaze convincing them to let them suck their blood. They also excel at deception and lying. They are able to sense other monsters by detecting their Yōki (Spiritual) Energy. They possess the ability to bite a person and inject them with their blood possibly reviving a human or vampire who is freshly dead. Humans may gain temporary vampiric powers from this but doing it too often may kill them or turn them in to ghouls (a mindless degenerate version of a vampire). Vampires also possess the ability to shape shift though most vampires are loathe to use it because they tend to be obsessed with creating and maintaining an attractive form. Vampires as the strongest Youkai paradoxically possess the most weaknesses. They are weak to holy weapons/abilities, Silver, Crucifixes, and their abilities are nearly debilitated by pure water which also causes them immense pain as if they had been exposed to electrical current and negates their Vampiric Abilities. Vampires are forced to use herbal blends in water so they can bathe and cook. Vampires avoid Garlic and are very susceptible to sunburns"
300,Asgardian,Marvel Cinematic Universe Vol. 1,"One of the most iconic and well-known species of this world, Asgardians have made their mark on Earth as Nordic gods while the Nine Realms see them as protectors and enforcers of peace. The average Asgardian is strong enough to lift around ten tons and could even train to lift up to twenty, while possessing significantly greater durability, reflexes, and coordination than humans would. Asgardians also possess an innate affinity for battle and war that sees them performing beyond almost all the other races in regards to combat. Along with healing faster than normal, it is little wonder that they are seen as among the strongest of the Nine Realms. Should you desire, you may instead be one of their genetic cousins, the Vanir."
300,Atmosphere,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user gains incredibly powerful, high capacity, high efficiency lungs. The complex nature of their lungs and unique attached organs allows them to synthesize all but the most toxic, deadly gasses breathed in into perfectly safe oxygen. Conversely, this same system can transform whatever air is inside their lungs into numerous other gasses and aerosolized chemical cocktails. With these things in mind, the Quirk user gains super breath that can blow people off their feet, inhale with vacuum force, puff themselves up with helium to temporarily float, knock enemies out with sleeping gas, submerge as long as a whale with a single breath and more. With all of the Quirk user’s varying abilities being tied to their lungs, they must be facing enemies for both offense and defense. Even with the super lungs, the Quirk user is unable to breath while submerged. Sealing the Quirk user’s mouth deprives them of most applications."
300,Born a King,Generic Xianxia,"You personally are the one your kin would point to and say that you are what all aspiring warriors should be like. Among your peers, you are the strongest, fastest, most beautiful, most talented, and the most able in combat with both your innate powers and without. You're basically the Captain America of your species, and have won the genetic lottery so to speak."
300,Life Return,One Piece: New World,"The body is a strange and wonderful thing. And now you have a large level of control over it. By stretching your senses, you can control your body to the point where your hair might as well be a few more pairs of arms. You can also use this to eat a large amount of food, digest it almost immediately, and use the nutrients to quicken recovery time from weeks to days or regain your stamina. You can even use it to burn off any extra fat you might have."
300,Parahuman - Assimilation,Worm,"You are capable of merging technology or non-living materials into your body, your power recording their properties and allowing you to manifest them at will. These objects require a little time to digest, but once that is done you can manifest them with your body in any way you care to imagine. Assimilate titanium and turn your bones into it, turn your arms into weapons, bud computer systems along your nerves to add processing power, and overall transform into an ever-shifting cybernetic monstrosity. Larger pieces of technology are possible but you’re limited to being about five times your base size, space ships and the like are probably beyond you. Expendable resources will be provided by your power assuming you have assimilated a sample of them. Ex: Bullets, fuel, etc. Doesn’t work on magic, but does on magi-tech, since it is sufficiently “science”."
300,Parahuman - Quantum Evolution,Worm,"Your body exists in a perpetual state of quantum uncertainty, and suddenly warps and evolves based on the stimulus around you to better fit your needs and desires, primarily survival. Falling off a building would result in you growing wings, bullets find themselves flattening on bio-armor that wasn't there when the weapon was fired, and strikes in combat will find natural weaponry perfectly suited to their target shaped by the time they land. The nature of this power means you can casually switch back to your base form, and regenerate at high speeds. Retaining a change will result in its constant refinement and enhancement, the effort and energy that would be spent on adapting instead of being constantly funneled into improvement. Issues like muscle memory and being unused to your forms changes aren't a problem, you are able to use them instinctively. You can exert conscious control over your power’s changes, either total or simply guiding it in your preferred directions. Your power can evolve anything physically possible for a biological system, although it's an admittedly generous definition. Your power is a lot like Crawler’s, you’re just not permanently mutated. You do not possess a core, relying instead on your regeneration and adaptation, though you’ll never suffer negative effects from needing to regenerate your brain or similar issues. Too much of you beingnia destroyed or damaged at once can still end in your death if you’re not careful."
300,Peak Human Training,Arrowverse,"You're in top physical condition from enduring intense training, you have a well-muscled and defined physique. This must be maintained through extensive training regimen. You've become fast enough to take down three trained assassins simultaneously. Your reflexes can catch an arrow shot at you and seamlessly fire it back plus catch a sword-strike from an immensely skilled opponent. While lean in frame, you're deceptively strong, able quickly incapacitate the much larger opponents and likewise effortlessly break a man's neck. You've become very sturdy, such as being unfazed by having a pool stick broken across your chest. You also has very high vitality, enduring long periods of free-diving before needing air."
300,Radiation Resistance,Marvel Cinematic Universe Vol. 1,"There's a lot of dangerous things in this world, and unsurprisingly radiation is likewise an issue. Not anymore with this selection. You now have a much higher tolerance to radiation; it would take wearing a suit of uranium rods while inside a nuclear fallout zone to affect you now. As a bonus, this also gives a good resistance to other harmful energies such as Asgardian magic or the energy blasts of Inhumans. It's still recommended to not be hit by these energies when you can, this just helps you out with it."
300,Temperature Modulation,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user is able to survive extreme temperatures. More notably, the user has the power to manipulate their own body’s temperature leave their body hot enough to melt steel with their bare hands or freeze water with a touch. What’s more, the Quirk user can either let their body’s adjusted temperature radiate or isolate it to their body or even a specific body part. Takes a moment to ramp up or lower temperature, making it hard to use it in a reactive capacity, which can prove dangerous."
300,Like A Spider,Marvel Cinematic Universe Vol. 2,"Aren't you just a quick little bugger? I'm not sure if you were bitten by a radioactive gymnast or something, but your agility and reflexes are enough that you could dodge just about any punch a human could throw at you while in combat with three people at once. For an additional 100CP there was a LOT of radioactivity in that gymnast, because now it's enough that you could dodge bullets shot at you while even pulling off some of the martial art speeds seen in movies like the Matrix. Of course if this isn't enough, you can always throw in one final purchase of 100CP and just make it a freaky radioactive spider, to actually give you danger-sense precognition and the ability to crawl on walls. Just where did you go to get bitten like that?!"
300,Senju Clan,Naruto,"The second clan descended from Asura, this clan is known as one of the two founding clans of Konoha alongside the Uchiha. Like the Uzumaki, the Senju possess incredibly strong lifeforce and unusually large chakra reserves, as well as the ability to learn far quicker than others which lies in the origin of their name Senju: thousand skills. Senju Clan members receive a discount on any one jutsu to reflect this. You also receive the first tier of Regeneration Ability for free and may purchase the second tier for 400 PP. For an additional 200PP(600PP total) you gain access to Wood Release. This bloodline allows the user to create wood from their chakra and manipulate it in any way they see fit. The constructs created can range from a simple cage to complete houses to detailed costumes around the user to a mountain sized wooden golem able to go toe-to-toe with a Tailed Beast. As long as the user has enough skill and chakra, they can create anything out of wood. One of the most versatile jutsu available is the Wood Clone Jutsu, which creates a duplicate that is capable of travelling far from the user, easily communicating with them and has the ability to merge with plants and trees on top of being able to use other jutsu. This bloodline also allows the user to suppress a being's chakra, even beings as powerful as the Tailed Beasts. Wood Release is a combination of Earth and Water nature affinities."
400,A Most Divine Constitution,The God of Highschool,"A divine being is rarely one who falls to physical infirmities or the meagre wounds mortals are capable of producing. Even amongst Gods, your sheer endurance is remarkable. While most Gods would resist any mortal disease or poison, you are able to shrug off even the strongest of supernatural poisons or disease. And when it comes to being killed, it’s a trial and a half to actually make you stay down. You do not truly require any of the organs that frail humans rely so much on. Instead, so long as your body is at half there, you will survive and fight onwards. Even being reduced to a smoking, blackened skeleton from the waist up would not slow you down for a second."
400,Absorptive Stomach,Generic Isekai,"You possess the ability to safely eat anything. You can safely digest totally inedible materials, and all poisons. Anything you eat may sustain you, but more importantly, your body can gain permanent enhancements from whatever you eat. The strength of these enhancements is based on the strength of whatever you are eating, so while growth from devouring weakling monsters may be slight, victory over a powerful opponent offers a great opportunity to gain power. The nature of the enhancements will change based on the qualities of your food. Eating tough armor-like materials will help increase your defenses, while eating things like muscle tissue, claws, or fangs may improve your strength. Eating monster parts with unique properties will occasionally cause you to gain those properties, in the form of a new skill at base level."
400,Divine Ancestor,Campione!,"Born from those Gods that lost their divinity and Authorities, reincarnating as something more than human, but not quite Gods. Remnants of ancient power, but not to be taken lightly. This power is alike such occurrences, a fail-safe, if you must. Once per jump, upon your death, you may return yourself to life in a weakened form, with only a mere half your power available to you until the jump ends. Much like a Divine Ancestor, you won’t be much more than the shadow of who you were at your perk, although you could probably regain full power with some sacrifices..."
400,Mystical Leech,Fate/Stay Night,"For most people, the only way to recover used up magic is to just rest and let it replenish naturally. Some take magic from others, willingly or not, and others use much more sinister methods. You've got a way seen only once before. Just the act of eating normal food is enough to replenish your magical energies. A quick stop at a fast food drive in might only give you enough for a fireball or two but a full five course meal will bring you all the way to fullness. But what if you were to eat something with magic innate to it? Such as say, a living person with magic circuits? Or perhaps a powerful magical artefact? Having this sort of meal will not only fill you up much more than the equivalent normal meal, but you'll find that your maximum energy capacity actually increased permanently. Just chowing down on any old wizard might not give you too much on their own but the stronger the magic user or magical item, the greater the boost you'll find yourself getting. Of course, you could always just gorge yourself on the snacks. People tend to notice that sort of thing though."
400,"Resist, Overcome",Arifureta Shokugyou de Sekai Saikyou,"When you were born you had only three things with you; your mind, your soul, and your body. The same things that you will take to the grave. Those are sacred, you can’t, you won’t let anyone mess with them without your permission. Poisons, curses, paralyzation, ailments, sickness... everything that could be called a ‘status effect’ completely fails to affect you. You can’t be poisoned, nor cursed, nor possessed, nor drugged, nor stopped by any of those ailments, no matter their origin, be magical or mundane. That’s not to say that you’re completely invincible, for example, a poisoned knife cutting you, this perk makes so the poison have no effect at all in you, but the cut itself would hurt. This can be toggled on and off, or select certain things to bypass it, in case you want to get drunk."
400,Tamaranean,With This Ring,"​ Like Kryptonians, Tamaraneans draw power from solar energy. Unlike Kryptonians, Tamaraneans do not suffer a weakness to kryptonite or red sunlight. These golden humanoids have strength comparable to an Atlantean, can produce energy bolts from their hands and eyes, are capable of enduring hostile conditions and surviving in the vacuum of space, can fly under their own power in and out of an atmosphere, can heal from injuries far faster than humans so long as they have access to sunlight, and can live for several centuries. Additionally, Tamaraneans can learn new languages by kissing a native speaker, a trait that seems far too useful to have been the result of natural evolution and might be the result of the Psions tampering with Tamaranean genomes in the past. Their home-world, Tamaran, is currently under Gordanian control. The alien invaders take tithes of slaves and materials, and have bombed Tamaranean industrial and technological base down to almost nothing. In the broader galaxy, Tamaraneans are largely considered brutes or barbarians as a result."
400,Weaknesses? I have no weaknesses,Invincible,"Something interesting happened when your powers activated for the first time, the weaknesses that normally plague those like you seem eerily absent. You now find that the specific weakness that your powers suffered from are conspicuously gone. The limitations of your powers are all present and accounted for, but the things that could bypass them entirely no longer can. A Viltrumite would find that sounds that would normally cause pain, and potentially death among their kin do not affect them at all. A werewolf would find that silver no longer hurts them, though they may still be reliant on the Moon depending on the specifics of their curse. Someone with a weakness to a specific type of radiation, or even wood, would find that they no longer have anything to fear from those things. Have fun turning the tables on those who thought they had you boxed into a corner."
400,Divine Child,Percy Jackson,"You are the direct child of a god of your associated pantheon and gain various benefits from this. You gain lesser manifestations of your parent's domains as well as generally being better than an ordinary mortal. You may take most any god as your parent but to take one of the heads of a pantheon as a parent you must take the ""Fate finds you interesting"" drawback receiving no points for it (you can also do this with a lesser god to get greater powers). Generally this will give you insight into and some control over your divine parent’s domains, a son of Poseidon for example can control water and ships, talk to horses, cause minor earthquakes and is empowered within water."
500,Demi-Servant,Fate/Grand Order,"You are the successful result, the only genuinely successful result, of one of Chaldea’s greatest experiments. You are either a Demi-Servant or a Pseudo-Servant, depending on your Type. If you are Human Type, this has fused you with a Heroic Spirit to make you a Demi-Servant. If you are a Servant already, you will be fused to a human form that will make you a Pseudo-Servant. A Demi-Servant is a fusion between a Servant and a modified human that allows the human to make use of the powers, Skills and Noble Phantasms of a Servant they are bonded with. You know and are skilled in the use of all of these abilities and items, though you might not quite know all the tricks as the original did just yet. You gain the Servant Type in addition to your original one, though you do not gain the 100cp for free, as well as access to the Servant Supplement as described for those of the Servant Origin, with 1000SP and all associated discounts and freebies."
500,Dovahkiin,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim,"Perhaps the Last Dragonborn isn’t really the last anymore, perhaps Akatosh has decided to be generous, or maybe your benefactor just snapped their fingers regardless one way or another you’re now a Dragonborn. As a Dragonborn you gain an innate understanding of the Thu’um and similar languages with the ability to learn them by pure instinct like a dragon, allowing you in time to create new shouts. Alongside this whenever you slay a dragon you may choose to devour it’s soul, gaining all the knowledge it possessed in life, in essence you’re taking everything it was into yourself. These souls empower you whenever devoured and give you a considerable boost to your mystical and physical abilities. The other man or woman will still be around should you not take the scenario below. As one final boon, being that your nature is so intertwined with prophecy you’ll find that fate will assist you at times, and make the impossible quite possible should you work at it, such as a mere human warrior being able to bring down the Dragon god of Destruction."
600,Augmented,Star Trek – TNG + DS9,"You were born with superior capabilities. You're 3x stronger, smarter and more agile than others of your kind, your senses are sharper than normal, you're immune to disease and sickness, and you can withstand energy weapons like phasers better than others. Your blood has also been enhanced with the ability to remove fatal diseases and toxins from other people via blood transfusions."
600,Body of a Saint,Toaruverse,"Being one of the few saints that exist in this world has many advantages and perks along with disadvantages. As having a body of a saint gives you a superhuman body that is capable of performing peak human physical feats at bare minimum and only to improve from there. Your senses are also improved that their several times more acute and sharper than a normal human without overloading your senses. The most improvement is your mana capacity which is several times larger than the strongest human along with better and ef icient mana channeling. You blood also posses healing properties that heal your wounds at accelerated rate and it’s capable of healing non-fatal wounds instantly and stabilize critically wounded person. Unlike other saints you don’t have their nasty side-ef ects that make them weak to attacks that resemble how the Son of God was killed like being stabbed, a crown of Thorns, and the crucifix along with you capable of drawing more power unto yourself further empower your physical feats with the maximum of ten times than your base stats for indefinite amount of time without straining your body."
600,First Class,Final Fantasy 7 Remake,"All SOLDIERs are bathed in mako, but you took to it like a fish to water. Your compatibility with your augmentations was matched only by your skill on the battlefield, rapidly propelling you to the top of your class. Before long, you earned your spot in the elite-of-the-elite, and were given the rank of SOLDIER, First Class. Like the fabled red mages, you are a master with both weapons and magic. Using everything from giant swords to materia, you routinely face down Gaia’s toughest monsters and take on Shinra’s most important assignments. Even an “average” First Class SOLDIER is a one-person army, and your skills will only grow with time. Put in a decade of work, and you might just be a match for Sephiroth. Fight with the best, Jumper.


--- G-Type (Requires Limit Break): Your Jenova-cells are unstable, and can both absorb traits and pass them along to others. Thankfully, you won’t suffer the degradation that usually comes with these genes. You can absorb biological traits and incorporate them into your form. You can also pass your own traits onto others, either imbuing them with fractions of your power or creating entire copies of yourself. This transfer is temporary, but you can choose if the target creature simply loses the gifted traits or suffers lethal degradation when the power is spent. Your ability to absorb and adapt extends beyond innate biological features. Like the Blue Mages of old, you can learn from the spells cast by your enemies, adding them to your own repertoire. You still must survive the effects, and complex spells may require multiple exposures, but eventually you’ll turn your enemy’s tools against them. ---"
600,Freiza Clan,Dragon Ball Z,"Sometimes referred to as ‘Frost Demons’, this mighty alien race is kin to the tyrant Freiza, who controls much of the galaxy with an iron fist. While the Cold Family are mutants who enjoy a huge amount of innate power, you’re not quite at their level to begin with - though you enjoy several benefits to this form. To begin with, while you don’t benefit from something like the Zenkai of Saiyans, your body is durable and even your vital organs become vestigial - you can easily survive and clot wounds as severe as being bisected, though being reduced to tiny chunks can still kill you. You also enjoy a faster growth rate in ki and combat power, even moreso if you train yourself - you can’t lazily breeze through the terrors in this jump by doing nothing, but by applying yourself, you may become a terror all on your own. Finally, as you grow in power, you may create increasingly-weaker ‘forms’ for yourself to both contain and conceal your might, and when the gloves come off and you return to your ‘true form’, your might is terrible indeed. However, this race also suffers from intense stamina troubles when unleashing your true power - unless you properly train, you may find yourself sputtering out into weakness from exerting yourself too much. A surviving adult of your race, you may begin on any planet in the galaxy save for Namek, or at your kinsman Freiza’s headquarters. Be warned that Freiza will be quick to dispose of any threats to his rule, or anyone who is growing too powerful for their own good...even his own kin. Oh, and you can breathe in space and survive in a vacuum. Good to know."
600,Holy Sacraments,Fate/Stay Night,"The Sacraments are gifts from God to his most favoured servants. At first. The Church has long since deciphered the method to apply these incredibly blessings to its most elite agents and you were one such being. Or you just stole the process. Your body has been greatly enhanced by the process, giving you the strength to smash thick trees in half with a single punch, enough speed to outpace any modern race car and durability such that small calibre firearms would be lucky to bruise your skin. Your body also carries an innate holy enchantment, making every unarmed blow you deal like one dealt by a weapon blessed with holy power, exceptionally deadly against the creatures of the night. Finally, your resistance to the corrupting nature and powers of evil beings, artefacts and lands has been greatly increased. It would take a notably strong demon or evil spirit to break through this initial defence."
600,I’ll Remember,Flow,"Time is the one thing one can never have enough of and those who lord over it like a toy are a terrible opponent to face as most can’t resist the flow of it. You are a very special exception to the rule however as you’re immune to all forms of time and space manipulation. Time stops, slows, looping you in time, sending you backward or forward, and any time/space power imaginable will never affect you unless you allow it. Not even those who hold absolute control over time, space, or both would ever be able to affect you. Furthermore, time paradoxes and the like are no longer a danger to you. Someone attempting to retcon, cast you adrift in time, and kill you or anyone you know in the past will have no effect on the present you. Even killing your past self will result in no repercussions such as being written out of existence or other similar fates. Finally, you have intricate knowledge of the space-time continuum which allows you to know whenever someone traveled to the past or future to change something. You’ll know exactly when the time travel took place, who it was, and what has been changed in the current present giving you intimate knowledge of the new reality."
600,Kenpachi,Bleach,"You were always strong. Stronger than anyone you met. Maybe strong enough to be one of the strongest in all the worlds. But even as a kid, that strength limited you. How could you ever connect with others or learn from them? How could you ever enjoy a fight when you were swatting them like flies? Through your own subconscious action or the binding of another, this power was sealed away deep within as potential. Similar to Zaraki Kenpachi, you hold the potential for vast physical and spiritual power, along with a natural instinct for combat unmatched by almost any spiritual being. But this is largely inaccessible now. As you put yourself into deadly battles against worthy foes, you’ll see that power begin to return in leaps and bounds. Your muscles become denser, your spiritual pressure rages hotter and heavier with each battle, until you can eventually reach the same awakening of power as Zaraki did. Even after having reached your full potential, you’ll still have an effortless talent for all things relating to violence. Martial styles are easy to learn, becoming a capable user of techniques with a single day’s learning, and each battle you enter only increases your experience. With every fight, you become deadlier, even if there’s rarely a need to bother with your strength."
600,Nuclear Physiology,Arrowverse,"Your body has been transformed into a living nuclear reactor. With it, you’re able to create large amounts of energy via atomic reactions that occur normally within your body. Normally, this would require a quantum splicer; a stabilizer which merges two bodies together and makes it more controllable. However, it would seem that you are your own quantum splicer, allowing you to use the full power set without needing to fuse with another. Last but not least, you have the ability of matter transmutation; allowing you to manipulate matter on an atomic level and rearrange the subatomic structure into a different substance altogether. To use matter transmutation in non-life-threatening circumstances, you need a working knowledge of Quantum Physics. Even with that knowledge it’s a difficult, mentally draining process to accomplish. With enough practice, it’ll become easier and less tiring. Beware of ionized radiation, for it can temporarily shut down your living reactor state for a short time. You’re able to do just about anything Jackson could do when he first became Firestorm. This includes being able to fly by propelling yourself via directing nuclear blast downwards at a consistent rate, allowing you to fly at incredible speeds comparable to a commercial plane, while being agile enough to dodge missile and AA fire. As a living reactor, you’re able to release the energy in blasts capable of knocking out normal humans, injuring metahumans, burning through solid structures, and destroying vehicles. You never have to fear the effects of radiation damage again, and you’re able to absorb any nuclear energy or radiation harmlessly into your body."
600,Pandora’s Child,Campione!,"Ah, the Campione, the unrivaled humans that managed the impossible: to slay a deity by themselves. They are Pandora’s adopted children and the owners of a few advantages. Now, you’re one of them too. As a Campione, you gain an all- around stronger body, grant you a natural talent to understand any language, an increase in mana that would make even the most untalented into a rival for a Paladin and a natural Magic Resistance that rivals the Gods themselves, making all mortal magic basically useless against you and greatly diminishing the magical attacks from Gods or other Campione. Also, your body will become near ageless, also having an accelerated healing and gaining magic senses if you didn’t have them before. All in all, you could say that it improves everything about your body, not to mention that you also gain [Authorities] from any God you slay. Don’t get too lazy because of this, I must warn you, many Campiones have fell after relying too much on their natural advantages, since there are ways to go around them."
600,Saiyan,Dragon Ball Z,"Once, they were a warrior race, humanlike except possessing the tail of a monkey, and incredible aggressiveness with a tendency towards war and bloodshed. By the light of a full moon, they would transform into Great Apes. They had a natural talent for ki and untapped power and great potential, able to rise even stronger each time they came close to death. But they were feared and coveted for this, and were all but wiped out by the tyrant Freiza. Only a few still exist in the galaxy, and you’re now one of them. You are either in the employ of Freiza at his headquarters, or hiding away elsewhere on a planet that isn’t Earth."
600,True Form,The God of Highschool,"The form you inhabit now is not quite your true form. Not anymore. Rather, think of the body you are in as a lesser, sealed version of your true magnificence. When it’s time to go all out, you can release the seal on your body and take your real form. Ten times as large as your normal body, this true form enhances your physical abilities and any powers that rely on your life energy immensely, enough to easily turn the tables when you’re being pushed to the brink of defeat by a foe much stronger then you are. However, the lengthy time you have spent without this true form renders it a tiresome thing to stay in and it will be a few years of practise before you can stay in it indefinitely."
600,Young Lord,The God of Highschool,"Despite your relative youth, you have been endowed with an immense amount of innate power. Your Divine Powers have been increased many times over, enough that only the strongest of mortals would have a chance against you now, as your Divine Powers are strong enough to wipe clean entire cities in a few shots. You still lag behind the true High Gods of the Heavenly Realm, the destruction of entire countries or more terrifyingly, entire planets, is still years away from you but the amount of power you have at your age is unheard of, save for the case of Satan 666. As recognition for the extent of your power, you have been given the authority to summon Angels and Nephilim in their hundreds to your side at any time you wish. They will serve you loyally and will continue to come even in future worlds when you beckon to them."
600,Dragon,Highschool DxD,"Less of a race and more of power being given form, Dragons are an important part of this world...even if they’d rather pursue their own desires most of the time. Possessing phenomenal physical and magical power, even the ‘Normal-Class’ Dragons can drastically change the balance of power in an incident or area, and thus are treated with caution. They have a body akin to either a Western or Eastern-style dragon that can be anywhere from the size of a building or a human, which they can change at will. They can also assume custom-tailored human forms at will, often necessary to blend in. Two consistent features of your new Race that you possess includes an affinity with an element (Fire, Ice, or Lightning) and the ability to use it as an attack, as well as flight. When enraged, a dragon can enter an empowered state known as Outrage Mode, where their physical abilities increase dramatically and they become single mindedly focused on the target of their ire...though you may snap out of this at will. While Ophis, Great Red, and many other legends still stand head and shoulders above you, there is room for your power to grow...and woe to the fool who thinks ignoring you is wise. And to think, that’s before we factor in training or your Sacred Gear."
600,Half-Blood Viltrumite,Invincible,"You are a Human-Viltrumite Hybrid. As humanity is very close in nature to the Viltrumites and that Viltrumite DNA overwrites lesser species, you can grow to be just as strong as any other Viltrumite out there. You will have super strength, super speed, super durability, and the power of flight. While you do not have super senses ‘per se’, your sight is comparable to a hawk, and somehow manages to operate perfectly no matter how fast you move (even if that is beyond the speed of light). Viltrumites have hyper-evolved and efficient bodily functions such that, holding a single breath of air is enough to last you for two weeks of vigorous physical activity, and you are immune to any and all diseases and ailments bar those that have been enhanced by something comparable to super or hyper science and tailor made to affect Viltrumites. Something like this would take the best scientists of an advanced alien civilization years if not decades to achieve. Viltrumites grow through stress and conflict, so you are able to train your physical abilities or improve through being damaged and healing from it at a comparable rate to if you had trained vigorously during that time. Viltrumites can heal from almost any trauma imaginable, able to get their guts ripped out or being ripped in half, with all it takes to put everything back together is for your bits to be in approximately the right place to heal perfectly, given the time. Due to this healing factor Viltrumites live for millennia, with their aging being comparable to human until they reach physical maturity at which point it slows dramatically. The only issue with this healing factor is that if the heart has about 50% of it destroyed the healing factor does not work, and while it can heal brain trauma (including memories), it caps out at about 1⁄3 of the brain destroyed. Also, as good as this healing factor is, it won’t replace lost limbs. Either reattach them or get a prosthetic.
With age Viltrumites remain semi-comparable to humans as their hair changes slowly to white, though they never get wrinkles, and are able to grow glorious facial hair. Although culturally Viltrumites limit themselves to a beautiful mustache. Finally Viltrumites have a single inherent weakness, the complexity of the ear canals that evolved to allow them to balance while flying in space, this complexity means that the right type of sonic pulse could cause immense pain to a Viltrumite and potentially even death given a long enough exposure.
No two Viltrumites are created equal. Their powers come from their extremely potent and dense tissue, and can be improved through their lineage or simply training. When you buy this perk you start off at the level of a young Viltrumite, able to hold your breath for hours at a time, and move or fly at hypersonic speeds. You are strong and durable enough to give and receive attacks powerful enough to shatter skyscrapers and break mountains. Given around a decade of natural growth (or less provided you train) you grow to the level of a veteran Viltrumite. Meaning you, with the help of a couple others of similar strength, could shatter somewhat weakened planets and receive similar attacks all while being able to move at well beyond the speed of light, although they tend to limit themselves to hypersonic speeds while in an atmosphere. They are capable of flying between habitable planets within a couple of weeks at their top speed, with the stamina to remain awake and aware through the flight. 
Given enough time and training you may even eventually be able to make it to the level of a Regent Viltrumite, though something like this would take about a couple decades (or equivalent) of dedicated hard work, and many life or death battles. Being healed to be better than before by someone with powers like Atom Eve may shorten this time further. A Regent Viltrumite is so strong and durable that a veteran Viltrumite could literally cause their own arms to explode into a bloody pulp from striking a Regent and have the Regent be completely unaffected. A Regent is so quick they could move without a veteran Viltrumite even seeing them, and so strong they could literally cut a veteran Viltrumite in half with a casual swing of their arms, like a hot knife through butter. Regent level Viltrumites are powerful enough that they could fight inside a sun, albeit while taking massive amounts of damage to the point of death or near-death if they stay there for about a half an hour or more."
600,Never Gonna Keep Me Down,Invincible,"You can heal from anything, anything at all. Given time and basic support your body will always regenerate to 100%. You could have your guts ripped out of your torso and all it would take would be to shove them back in, and make sure you have nutrients to survive (if you still need those sorts of things, I don’t know you), and you would be able to heal in a few months at worst without a scar to show for it. You are never at risk of infection, never get sick and left to your own devices you could live for millennia without succumbing to old age. Luckily for you this healing works on seemingly everything, from brains to hearts, though you must remain alive (at least barely) for the healing to kick in. The sole issue with brain damage is that when you heal, while you retain all of your previous memories, you may not make any new ones during the healing process if your brain damage remains too severe. Which means you might get injured and then suddenly come-to months later without any memory of the intervening time period while your brain was healing. This is just by default of course, if you have other powers or abilities for continuity of memory then this won’t override or stop those from working. While this does not really increase the speed of your healing it does ensure that you will heal completely and that the healing will not result in scars.

--- Capstone Boosted (Requires You Have Been Reborn): Those atoms from the future seem like a vigorous bunch. Now whenever you heal from an injury your body takes the chance to rebuild from it stronger. Get nearly killed and once you heal watch your strength catapult from the level of young Viltrumite to the level of a veteran Viltrumite (assuming you were a Viltrumite, of course). Regardless, every time you heal you become stronger than before. A bone that was broken causes your skeleton to strengthen, a ligament pulled would increase durability and elasticity of tendons and ligaments around the body. If one day you were burned, the next you would be flame resistant. Without any outward change in appearance you find yourself evolving and growing to deal with the scenarios the world throws at you. ---"
800,Divine Durability,DC – Larfleeze,"Befitting your heritage, your body is supremely powerful. You can flatten cities simply by moving through them, and ordinary armies would be helpless to stop you as you tear through their defenses with effortless ease. Not even a Lantern could hurt you directly, although they can still restrain you or launch you far off into space. You can also breathe in space. As if your strength influenced your growth, you stand anywhere from eighteen feet to eighteen hundred feet tall, although your exact height doesn’t change how strong you are.

Other-Dimensional Divinity: Instead of your power manifesting through your body, you represent an aspect of reality on a cosmic scale such as despair, desire, or exploration. For example, representing exploration may give you the ability to see into the past, future, and alternate dimensions, an emotion like despair would let you soak an entire planet in it and command anyone infected by it as thralls, and desire could allow you to appear as the most beautiful and incredible being in existence to all who see you, controlling them indirectly through their desire for you. You also have a snazzy title like ‘Laord of the Hunt’, ‘[Name] of All Sorrows’, or simply ‘The Wanderer’, based on your theme, personality, and powerset."
800,Glory to…,Percy Jackson,"Your divinely related abilities are all massively enhanced to the point that you could fight on par with some mid-tier gods. Using your powers is instinctual and nearly as easy as breathing. Also you gain benefits from your divine parent’s more obscure domains. A child of Hades might find themselves able to call up wealth and ghosts interchangeably while one of Apollo could burn his foes and heal his allies with his mere presence. Using your abilities extensively is tiring though and you should be careful not to wear yourself out too much by summoning a natural disaster where something smaller would’ve worked just as well. Generally the stronger your parent or other source of abilities the more you will get to work with, a child of a minor deity will probably get less but get some additional ways to interact with their parent’s domain. Generally a demigod can fight on par with a non combat focused god of a rank equivalent to their parents with this."
800,Kryptonian,All-Star Superman,"Were you miraculously alongside Kal-El as Krypton exploded? Were you part of the shrunken city of Kandor, restored to your full size through miraculous circumstance? Maybe you are an early, successful attempt at recreating Kryptonian DNA by PROJECT, matured into a fully functional clone or offspring of Superman? Either way, you are one of the surviving members of the race of Krypton. At first glance, you are identical to a human - outwardly, anyways. Your internal organs and biochemistry are obviously alien on closer examination. Your true power comes from exposure to radiation from yellow sunlight, which your body absorbs and gives you a host of vast superpowers. First, your base intelligence increases greatly - you are capable of learning new academic subjects within minutes of study, including highly advances sciences and trade skills alike. Secondly, your body strength and durability likewise increase dramatically, allowing you to lift cars, buildings, and more as easily as a normal human could lift a toothpick, potentially pushing several quintillion tons or even an entire planet in time. Your durability is strong enough that bullets and artillery are casually deflected off of your body, and you could withstand planet-cracking explosions and come out with only some burns and bruises. Your senses sharpen greatly, able to view the world on a microscopic scale as well as vast distances away, even witnessing events on distant planets with your eyes or ears, as well as giving you x-ray vision that can perceive as lightly as past clothes or armor, or as deeply as a skeleton, though unable to perceive past lead. Your eyes can also radiate heat vision, able to act as precise as a scalpel or send a city or more aflame. Your breath also has the ability freeze objects and people into ice almost instantly, quickly reducing them to sub-zero temperature in seconds. You are also gifted with flight and super speed, able to move faster than the speed of light, as well as sustain yourself within the depths of space. Finally, the sunlight provided by this radiation is enough to keep your body whole and healthy, giving you a long lifespan potentially measured in millennia so long as your powers are sustained, and acting as a substitute for food, water, and nutrients. All these powers will steadily grow with age and experience, making you a true example of an alien superman. While Superman in his overcharged state is much stronger than what you start with, maybe you can reach that point naturally over a long period of time...? That said, there are downsides. While this won’t be a problem in most day-to-day circumstances, constant use of your powers will exhaust you of the energy your body has absorbed, with the physical invulnerability always being the last to go - and you won’t regain them until you once again expose yourself to the light of a yellow sun once again. Exposure to red sun radiation will quickly drain your powers away in similar circumstances, making you a ‘mere’ human in terms of physical abilities. The force that fuels your physical durability is no help against magical attacks, sometimes even able to bypass it entirely. Finally, the dreaded green mineral Kryptonite will near-instantly depower you upon exposure while causing you great pain, and continued exposure could eventually kill you. That’s not even going into the effects of colored Kryptonite, which can play havoc on your brain. This weakness to Kryptonite only applies for this jump."
1000,Reincarnation,The God of Highschool,"You used to be someone special. Someone very special. In a past life you were one of the High Gods of this world, a being of quite literally Earth shattering power. But for some reason you died or lost your powers and were reincarnated into the form of a child of whatever race you are now. It is only recently that you have become able to awaken your powers, as will be described below. All the following powers, including any supernatural abilities of the items included, will be activated via a transformation into your Godly state. At first this transformation will be tiring but over time you will be able to maintain it for longer and longer until it becomes maintainable for good. Your reincarnation grants you a great deal of powers based on who you used to be. You should pick one God, Monster or other Mythological being from legend to be your original self. Your powers and items will be styled after that figure. The exact power of your Reincarnation will depend on whether you buy the 1000 High God option or the 2000 Supreme God option. The first thing that you gain is the physical abilities and life force of a greater being. You have the strength to destroy entire worlds in a single blow or lift them above your head with both arms and some strain. You outpace the speed of light a hundred thousand times over at least and can take hits that crush planets like humans can take hits from each other. Your life energy is such that you could almost drown an entire world just by releasing your power and that your life energy based abilities will be just as world ending as your physical force. The Supreme God option blows these out of the water. They can destroy a High God in a single punch, move at millions of times the speed of light with ease and laugh off the blows of these same Gods. Their life energy is so great as to terrify even High Gods when fully released and potentially threaten the stars themselves. You will gain 2 unique Divine Powers when you transform, based on the legend of the being you chose as your original self. These may be taken from the Divine Power section, if they fit, or made originally so long as they do not exceed the power level of the 600CP Divine Power options or the 600CP Charyeok options at most. Supreme Gods gain an extra 2 unique powers, which may include things up to the level of the 800CP options in the Charyeok section of the jump. Lastly, you will gain 2 unique items based on your original self's legend. These will be on the same level as the tools of the Monkey King, such as Yeoui/Ryu Jingu Bang or Yongpyo. A Supreme God will gain an additional 2 items that are also on the level of these Divine Tools, both also drawn from their own legend. If there are no items to draw from, it is possible to instead turn powers or feats that they have done into original items, though this must still be based on their actual legend. These powers do not come without attention however. Taking the 1000CP option will lock you into the plot of this setting in a sense. Whatever actions you choose, you will end up fighting against several opponents at the level of the High Gods. If this means you join Mo-Ri Jin in his battle against the Gods and take several on yourself or if it means you face down the humans and find several empowered warriors on the level of High Gods in your way, so be it. The 2000CP option will instead guarantee that you face at least two opponents on the same level that Satan and Mo-Ri Jin reached during their climactic battle, whether they be those two at their greatest power or other, original characters. These battles willb be serious, life threatening ones and cannot be avoided, no matter how you much try. Any allies you have will be drawn away in this time, leaving you to prove yourself worthy of your own power. You may find yourself also remembering your original selves' memories from time to time. They will not harm you or influence you but you may learn something from them, about your powers or about who you used to be."

1200,Medaka Sue,Medaka Box Abnormal,"Could there be any being as perfect as you? Only the youngest Kurokami heiress can match your natural abilities, all of which are described below. Your body, mind and spirit are all incredibly far beyond even the peak of human capability. You possess superhuman ability in adaptability, agility, analysis, awareness, attractiveness, balance, calculation, charisma, cognition, combat, competence, coordination, deduction, dexterity, durability, eloquence, endurance, flexibility, instinct, intelligence, intuition, invincibility, leadership, memory, meta-luck, mimicry, perception, persuasion, reasoning, reflexes, regeneration, senses, speed, strength, tactics, vitality, and willpower. To illustrate the sheer level of each of these traits, some examples follow. Your speed allows you to travel at Mach 20 with no training at all, strength enough to pull thousands of tons just by walking forward, charisma enough to get 98% of a student vote to become student president, regeneration to heal every single bone in your body from shattered to full health in ninety seconds and so on. These attributes will also scale up in the case of non-human species that have greater baselines for their average. Your learning rate is perhaps your most shocking ability. You are able to perfectly learn, memorize, recall, understand, master, and utilize anything and any skill by experiencing or observing it once, within seconds. Even things that take years or even decades for prodigies to learn, you can master, truly master, in just a few seconds. You also have no limitations on how far you can grow or learn, able to improve all skills and attributes and abilities without limit and with no loss in speed. You have total control over all parts of your body, including muscles, bones, flesh, blood, organs, nerves, hair, and veins. All of these can be consciously or subconsciously controlled, moved or adjusted, including improving them through thought to inhuman levels. This control is precise to an atomic level. This also allows you to be immune to any forced control of your physical body. Finally, you have a series of super modes that you can unlock over time. Each one greatly boosts the power of your physical abilities and all of your powers, though at first your initial mode will drive you to a mad fury whilst in it. As you grow and learn to use these, you will be able to retain control of your temper and even all other aspects of yourself, rendering you immune to any attempt to control your mind or body or spirit. Eventually you may even be able to keep yourself permanently within this form or to unlock new, unheard of forms based on the powers you have or that you encounter."
