50,Common Sense,Generic First Jump,"The least common advantage of all. You can tell when something you are about to do is contrary to basic common sense and rationality, or when you are about to do something your Benefactor will punish you for. You can also tell when your emotions are clouding your judgement."
100,Adorkable,Arrowverse,"Everyone knows the brain is the sexiest organ, and you prove that your brain makes you sexier. When you're using your intelligence you appear to others to be more attractive. That being said more intelligent you are, the more intelligence you can show off and more attractive you become. Throwing on a pair of glasses helps you appear attractive faster."
100,Anticipate the Meta,With This Ring,"​Anyone could tell you that spending ten years learning a spell to make walnuts taste slightly like hazelnuts is a waste of time, but not all potential actions are as clear cut. You gain an intuitive sense of how useful a branch of research or practice is likely to be for your circumstances, divorced from personal or societal biases, to the point that you’ll wonder why no one asked the Atlantean biomancers to grow organs for the surface world, or why the supervillain is bothering holding up a bank when he could make more money as a truck driver."
100,Beautiful Mind,Generic Gamer,"It’s hard to really define what intelligence is, precisely, but you have it. Much of that which people mistake for high intelligence is in fact good memory, though you have that, too; the only way you’ll ever forget something is if you want to, with all else remaining caught in the steel trap that is your mind. You’re able to process more, your brain never seeming to get overloaded, nor worn down by overuse; your processing power is such that you can follow two trains of thought at once. And, of course, you’re able to make connections almost instantly where they can be made; you could make a passable impression of Sherlock Holmes."
100,Benadryl Cabbagepatch,Invincible,"You have an incredible ability to make inferences and be correct. You truly are a natural at inductive and deductive reasoning, able to use logic to fill in the gaps in your knowledge, you can guess with reasonable accuracy when others would be left scratching their heads in consternation. This sort of deduction is quite useful when trying to reverse engineer advanced technology."
100,"Charity, Kindness and Fairness",Fate/Grand Order,"Chivalry may be a difficult code to follow but you have it a little easier than most. You have the uncanny knack of being able to always make a fair judgement, regardless of whatever your feelings are on the matter at hand. No matter what situation, you know what the fairest resolution to all parties will be, if there is one. If there isn’t, you’ll be aware of what the closest substitute is. This knowledge may not be too helpful if you’re not in a position to decide such matters but to make up for that, this knowledge will also make you a much more skilful negotiator in hopes that you will be able to put yourself in such a position. You could do a lot of good with this good judgement."
100,Eidetic Memory,Naruto,"You possess a memory that will never forget anything and with an instant recall attached to it. Furthermore, no matter what, you will never be able to forget anything unless you consciously choose to forget."
100,FAIRNESS,Medaka Box Abnormal,"You’re as impartial as impartial can be. Your abnormality allows you to enter or exit a state in which you are completely free of any bias and act with total impartiality. Everyone who sees you in this state will know that you are genuinely impartial too, allowing you to serve as an entirely fair judge and referee for anything they care to name."
100,Fists of Justice,Generic First Jump,"Pick a martial art. Kung Fu, Judo, Jeet Kune Do, Savate, whatever. You are an expert at this form of fighting. It won’t let you fight Superman, but it will give you a handy advantage against someone your level."
100,Know My Limits,Dragon Ball Z,"There is a physical limitation on your body, one you may be all too painfully aware of. The moment where you’re strongest and your physical form goes ‘no further’. You are now fully aware of your physical limitations and internal energy reserves, so much so you could form a mental ‘health meter’ and ‘stamina meter’ in your mind without any real thought. It makes it all the more satisfying when you push past those limits, and you will know how close you are to that point."
100,Life Changing Experience,DCEU,"The accident, as most accidents do, happened without any warning. One moment you were ordinary and the next you were extraordinary. It might have sounded great before the change but more and more you might find yourself struggling to adjust to your new life. With this, you won’t experience those issues. You’re able to quickly come to terms with changes to your life and body, letting you get used to them mentally and come to terms with anything you’ve lost, gained or changed. Perhaps with that out of the way you can really make some progress towards physically mastering yourself as well."
100,Model Jumper,Medaka Box Abnormal,"You won’t get in over your head on account of arrogance anymore, though you should still watch out for your foes being stronger than you expected. With this Abnormality, you are constantly aware of your own limits in all things. You know exactly how strong you are in every way, how skilled you are in everything and so on. You’ll know this in both an objective sense and in comparison to anyone whose power or skills you are familiar with."
100,Model Student,Bleach,"Even with all the adventures in other worlds, you couldn’t bear to let your grades drop. While you’re a decent hand at the academics, your good grades mostly come from the incredible good time management skills you have and the ability to intensely focus on your studies when wanting. Even having only an hour a night might let you cram in two or three hours of study, helped along by a fairly sharp memory. Your teachers might even start giving you quite a lot of slack when it comes to the sudden disappearances, if you successfully show your smarts now and then."
100,Precocious,Re: Monsters,"Monsters live in the wilds of an incredibly dangerous and uncaring world and need to grow up fast. As one such being yourself, your physical development and learning speed are three times faster than normal. This also doubles the effectiveness of anything that augments your training, such as a trainer that knows what they’re doing or a piece of equipment that aids your development."
100,Sidekick Stupidity,Chronicle,"Life’s too short to simply ignore its few exceptional occurrences simply because of an emotion as petty as fear. That’s why, although you might still become scared now and then, it won’t stop you from doing the things you want or need to do. Even mentally quaking in your boots facing down your fears, you’ll be able to keep a clear head and approach the threat logically, with a mind unclouded and a heart unbounded. It also won’t stop you from making stupid decisions, though, like jumping into a hole without knowing about its depth or contents. Do stay smart even in fearlessness, yeah?"
100,Snow Fairy,Fate/Stay Night,"Even when you were little, you somehow seemed to know just what the proper thing to say was. All your tutors seemed bewildered by how you seemed to know their lessons before they even taught them to you. You might not be particularly charismatic on your own but when it comes to manners and courtesy, you have an innate knowledge at all times. No matter the culture, event or family, you always instinctually know what is expected of you and how to perform the courteous actions that are so expected."
100,Studious Student,To Love-Ru,"You’re a good student. No matter the hijinks in your life, you will find yourself always having the time to learn. Knowledge will come easier to you, your understanding of a subject improves quickly under a teacher or with proper studying supplements and you will find yourself always remembering everything you have taken the time to properly internalize, no matter how long it has been."
100,That’s Stupid and You’re Stupid,Dragon Ball Z,"Why does it always come down to “Punch it really hard”? Why are you LETTING him get that powerful!? Doesn’t anyone have an ounce of sense that doesn’t revolve around fighting? Well, You’re gonna have to be the one who actually brings this up. Seeing sensible and actual solutions to situations that would otherwise escalate into violence or out of control madness is a skill you possess now...and it’s going to get quite the workout here."
100,The Quick and the Dead,Generic First Jump,"You think fast, react fast, and move fast. Your reaction speed is peak human, and your thought processes are three times as fast as they otherwise would be."
100,Unconquerable,Generic Worm Fanfiction,"This can be a pretty bleak world, y’know. Good thing you have this. You have, what would poetically be called ‘the will to shatter stars’. There is no hardship, no degree of opposition and no level of pain or suffering that can daunt your intentions, once you make up your mind about something. You can do this all day and you never quit save by your own conscious choice. Forget mere ‘peak human’ willpower, you are absolutely unbreakable. While still being mentally flexible enough to not be a stubborn asshole, of course. But it’d be a shame if after all that you fell to the first Master to happen along, so how about I toss in a flat immunity to all magical, psychic or otherwise supernatural effects, regardless of origin, that would negatively affect your mind? Never will you be enthralled. No dark artifact or villain will ever corrupt you, and no Hyperdimensional Computer will ever successfully hijack your brain-meats."
100,Well of Wisdom,Generic Gamer,"If intelligence gives you more options to choose from, then wisdom is the ability to choose the best of those options. This quality, too, is hard to describe, but you know it when you see it, and others see it in you. You certainly have what people call ‘common sense’, but it’s not just that. It’s as if you see things that others don’t — you’re able to accurately divine a person’s feelings and innermost thoughts, including your own. It’s perceptiveness and intuition, an attunement to the world around you. It’s the ability to overcome your own biases and prejudices, such that to you they might as well not exist. It’s clarity of thought and peace of mind. It’s instinct and intuition. It’s the ability to recognize what feels right and true and discern what doesn’t make sense and why. It’s being able to predict the outcome of events even far in advance. It’s not making stupid mistakes, even those that don’t seem stupid at first glance. It’s the ability to make the right choice, if not all of the time, then almost all of the time. It’s fuzzy, but no less important for it."
200,“They Surrender.”,All-Star Superman,"​: Riddle me this, riddle me that. Sometimes you can’t solve a problem by punching it, and discretion becomes the better part of valor. When presented with a mental challenge or a riddle, you’ll find your ability to solve it increases considerably in competence - logic puzzles become simple, riddles have obvious answers, and you can better match someone in a battle of wits simply by having a new perspective on it. Someone can still be smarter than you or baffle you, but no matter whether you’re simple or smart, your mind will be your strongest ally in these challenge"
200,A fast learner,Rune Factory,"You might know what you need to do, but what good is it if it takes you forever to do it? This should help with that. From now on you are able to learn skills and improve them in half the time required for the skill ordinarily, and if you have any multipliers to increasing these skills, this doubles it. This doesn’t just extend to things like crafting or fighting, but also to everyday things like talking, walking and jumping. There might be a cap on how far you can grow, but with this you will reach the highest level if you just try."
200,American Dream,My Hero Academia,"Good old hard work, it really pays off and you know that better than most. You make a promise, you write up a training schedule, even a new year’s resolution, you follow through. Whenever you promise something, to yourself or someone else, you’ll stay aware of that promise and have the wherewithal to follow through on it even when other things may be distracting you. In addition, your sense of self-discipline has been refined to the point that you’ll actually do that training, fulfill that resolution, even if it would be a pain. You’ll only be failing to put in the work you promised or keeping your word, when you actively, willfully choose to renege."
200,Brainiac,Sekirei,"Or simply Brain-types if you want to be boring. You’re smart an have the brain to prove it. Hacking will be easy and using computers to do your bidding will be a cakewalk. You might create viruses to annoy your enemies, or AI systems to aid you and your ashikabi with whatever they might be needed for."
200,Clan Genius,Battle Through the Heavens,"The term genius is overused in this world. Many of those ascribed the title are simply better than their local peers. They are lauded as geniuses when overall they can only be called average. Generally these people are the cultivators who cultivate quicker. You can now count yourself among the ranks of true geniuses. Not the rabble that fill countless towns, you are a genius even when placed in a big clan. You seem to go up in ranks a hundred times as fast as ordinary cultivators. With your potential, you could one day stand at the top of this continent. This will still take quite a while to get to that though."
200,Comprehension Of The World,Battle Through the Heavens,"The world is a source of great wonder, but it can also be a fantastic source of inspiration. The natural world is filled with mysteries, all you need to do is comprehend them. You are able to take inspiration from it in order to further your skills. The unending noise of a waterfall could help progress your sound skills, the repetitive rustling of leaves in the wind could help you with a breakthrough in your sword skills. You might be surprised how the world can help you, and in what ways."
200,Do the Homework,With This Ring,"​DC has a large intellectual property base with tons of characters minor and major, to the point that only the most diehard fans of the franchise or the most informed residents of its worlds can remember them all. This grants you two benefits; firstly, performing research through publicly available resources will be more likely to guide you to information you find useful or relevant to your situation. Secondly, if you have some form of meta-knowledge about a universe, it will be easy for you to find evidence of your knowledge In universe."
200,Genius,Rosario + Vampire,Your Intelligence is increased to at minimum Genius levels. You learn difficult subjects much faster than your peers and are likely to score at the top of your class in any exam.
200,Genius,Demon King Daimao,Easily one of the smartest people in the school you have no trouble with any of the work given. A photographic memory is something you can boast truthfully.
200,Gifted Intellect,Justice League Unlimited,"Wow jumper you sure are smart. You have to be if you're new to this world and still want to compete with the greats. With a perfect memory as well as extensively fast and optimized mental processing speeds you should have no problem learning and understanding all of the advanced science and whatnot you're sure to encounter in this world. To put it in simple terms, what this perk does is make it so that you can become a brilliant scientist or magician without having to devote decades to learning everything. With less that a year of study you could be considered an expert in whatever field you apply yourself towards and as you continue to challenge yourself and apply your intellect you'll find yourself able to run more thought processes simultaneously. After about a decade you could easily rival a 12th level intellect, allowing you to run twelve thought processes simultaneously, but only if you continuously learn and apply your mind to new challenges."
200,Greasy Fast Lightning Speed,Generic Fist Jump,"Maybe you spent some time chasing a chicken around an alley, or maybe not. Regardless, you are damn fast. Your reflexes are peak human, or peak whatever else you are. You are well-trained in avoiding attacks, somehow reacting even if you are unaware of the attack."
200,Helpful Hallucinations,DC – Larfleeze,"In times of great stress, the ghost of someone important to you will appear to offer you their wisdom, guidance, and possibly snide remarks. Except they aren’t really a ghost, they’re just a hallucination dredged up by your subconscious out of scraps of memory and spare delusions. They’re still plenty useful though, and can help you make important breakthroughs."
200,High Spec,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user acquires incredible intellect that allows them to systematically solve problems in moments that a normal human might find perplexing even after a week. Those with High Spec may figure out how to operate most machinery in moments with a bit of analysis, formulate technically sound battle strategies with Plan Bs and Plan Cs and understand new concepts quickly. The user is also able to quickly gain leadership skills just by figuring out psychological tricks to inspire and command through normal social interaction. All this intellect is useless without the proper knowledge and resources to back it up, and there is no inherent skill to go along with the intelligence."
200,Innate Talent - Golden Mind,Overlord,"You are, simply put, superhumanly brilliant. You don’t necessarily know anything with just this, and it’s entirely possible to have a genius mind and yet still be ignorant, but if you actually bother to go out and learn things, or have perks, classes, or skills that provide you with knowledge, you will quickly find that you can piece together information and clues from even the tiniest shreds. Your intellect is of gargantuan size, and there is a potential drawback in such. If you are not careful to ground yourself, or to find company that can keep up with you mentally, it is entirely possible you might find yourself divorced from the human condition as you simply lose touch with the people around you that can’t possibly hope to keep up with your golden brilliance. Can be mitigated with the correct perks or efforts."
200,Innate Talent - Omnidextrous,Overlord,"You possess the innate talent to use all of your limbs as if they were your primary limb, effectively allowing you to fight or operate with your limbs to whatever degree you desire, and are physically capable of performing in, with no loss of control, skill, or strength. This effect additionally carries over to your mind, allowing you to effortlessly mental-multitask on as many different trains of thought as you desire. This doesn’t let you think faster, per-se, but you would be surprised at how useful it is to be able to focus on every individual thing going on in a battle at the same time"
200,"Intelligence, Civilian Style",Ender’s Game,"The World of Ender’s Game is a world of brilliant individuals. If you feel you can’t compete, you might consider taking this perk, as it boosts your intelligence into the super genius range."
200,IQ,My Hero Academia,"The Quirk user is able to greatly increase their intelligence by drinking tea and closing their eyes. While their eyes are closed, they may mentally envision holographic text with which they can use to track compiled information, and more easily calculate equations or solve problems. Different forms of tea increase different forms of intelligence, though which does what is a process of trial and error. These intelligence boosts are focused, but excessively potent. As the Quirk requires both fresh tea and closed eyes, it’s quite difficult to use in a limited timeframe, such as active combat."
200,Multiprocessing,Sonic the Hedgehog,Your mind has a significantly easier time multi-tasking. Never again will you have to worry about patting your head and rubbing your belly at the same time. Or more interestingly Fighting off a horde of killer robots while holding an argument with your wife about the groceries will be a thing you can do safely now.
200,Patience Of The Ages,Battle through the Heavens,"In the land of cultivators, events happen over the course of decades and centuries. The creation of a high tier pill can take an entire month, much of which is spent monotonously controlling your flame. As such a near endless amount of patience is required. You can have the patience of a rock, ready to weather the ages, and with little change to what makes you ‘you’ over the long years."
200,Precognitive Instinct,Mushoku Tensei,"An instinct that is strengthened to the point that it rivals true precognition. This allows you to sense, predict and evade any incoming attacks or danger to yourself even if you're unaware of it, along with the ability to instinctively know the exact location of the attacker or danger is coming from. This instinct also lets you measure the threat level of a person and quantify the power level into something that you can understand like numbers or ranks, along with mitigating the penalties of visual and auditory."
200,Problem Solving Solutions,Tate no Yuusha no Nariagari,"While not all problems have solutions but you have one solvable by items. When you encounter problems you can think of one time solutions instantly but permanent ones would take time and thinking. Seeing rampaging plants, you can quickly pick the right materials and craft a plant-killer. The fish doesn’t bite your bait; you can craft a fish luring add-on on your fishing rod that would make the fish line-up for you. While you cannot do anything to solve a strained relationship, you can think of temporaryor permanent items to make your life easier."
200,Quick of Thought,DCEU,"Something of a child prodigy you were. Always smart for your age and you remained quite the genius even now. You’re not going to be heading your own corporation but you’re definitely a few cuts above the normal people. Speaking of, those normal people won’t have a problem getting along with you, since you don’t experience the problems that come from an incredibly powerful mind. You find it just as easy and satisfying to spend time with even the most moronic of people in comparison to your own mind and you can live without any difficulty, even if you experience life with reflexes a few million times greater than everyone around you."
200,"Seeing The Sights, All The Sights",Generic First Jump,"When your primary focus is the experiences you acquire and the stories you could tell, forgetting them is a tragedy. You will never have to worry about that. You have a perfect memory, with instant recall, unlimited storage, tamper-proofing, perfect indexing, and protection from any form of harmful memory. This perfect memory is fully retroactive. You can choose to erase memories, leaving a knowledge that something was erased and a basic description of what that memory was, and can restore that erased memory later. Nothing can detect these erased memories or force you to restore them. Your memories can only be read by an outside force with your permission."
200,Self-Made Man,The God of Highschool,"Training in the martial arts on your own is rarely a good idea. Who knows what fatal mistakes you could memorise into your fighting style or what ways you could hurt yourself learning a new technique? You manage to buck this trend to an extent though. Even despite lacking a teacher or teaching materials, you seem to fall into the correct procedures for learning the martial arts on your own. You’ll instinctually correct your movements to be more in line with the style you are trying to learn and you’ll get a warning feeling whenever you’re about to try something that will definitely hurt you. It’s not as good as having a real master teach you personally but you’ll actually manage better on your own then with some ordinary teacher in the martial arts with you."
200,Survival Instinct,Re: Monsters,"With so many monsters, some are bound to be at the bottom, weaker than other creatures by a significant margin, and those that can’t recognize this disparity are quick to die. Not you, though. You have an innate sense of how strong something is compared to you, whether they’re weaker, an even match, stronger, or so far beyond you that challenging them is suicide. You can even tell roughly how wide the disparity is. This does not account for equipment and outside aid (such as teamwork), it works off of what is inherent to the individual, and a clever opponent can still best you if you don’t take them seriously, so you still need to be cautious."
300,ANALYSIS,Medaka Box Abnormal,"Understanding is by far the most important thing. Once you know what you’re dealing with, you can formulate a plan to deal with it. You’re just great at both. You’re able to effortlessly and intuitively analyse and understand anything that you can see or touch. The more complex or strange the thing is, the more time you might need to understand it, but even Abnormalities can be figured out with a few caresses and a couple seconds of consideration. Your understanding tells you how and why anything you’ve analysed works and then gives you the knowledge on how best to bring out its full potential, letting you turn people or objects into the best they can be over time, so long as they’re open to your training plans."
300,Brilliant Mind,Justice League Dark,"Seems like smart people are a dime a dozen around here, especially if you talk to any League members. You take braininess to another level entirely. You learn faster, synthesize knowledge in countless innovative ways, and remember almost anything you experience. If you’re the brains behind a project, people can expect you to achieve quasi-magical results using nothing but your intellect and ingenuity. With just a year or two of research, you could patent a formula that turned you into a half-bat supervillain. Not that that’s something I recommend. Optionally, you have a doctorate level education across three fields, with all the certifications needed to prove that."
300,Genius,Arrowverse,"While you're not Einstein or Dr. Wells level of smart, you're not dull either. You have a mind that qualifies you for being a certifiable genius. You have a thirst for knowledge that rivals Ms. Smoak's own. You hoard and display intimate knowledge in many subjects, such as history, politics, economics, geography, physics, engineering, biology, and chemistry."
300,Mental Alarm,Star Trek – TNG + DS9,"You can now sense whenever someone is trying to read your thoughts or emotions. This ability won't provide you with any defense against mind reading, but it will let you know the identity of the person trying to read your mind."
300,Parahuman - Compounded Computation,Worm,"Whenever you are dealing with a problem, your intelligence scales based on its complexity and scale. The bigger and/or more complex the problem, the easier it is for you. Aside from researching the data to do so, creating a plan to eliminate world hunger would take only as long as necessary to type it all up. This power allows you to make impossibly effective plans, and is even more valuable when dealing with large scale issues. Managing an intergalactic empire’s logistics would be as easy as simple arithmetic for you, and it continues to scale from there. This power is basically useless on small and simple things however. Do note that while you could easily think up a plan to solve world hunger, actually putting it into effect is a whole other story. You need resources and skill to actually use what your power provides you, but you’re easily able to handle things that would be impossible for anyone else due to their sheer scale and complexity"
300,Parahuman - Mathematical Calculation,Worm,"You are now completely aware of the numbers and math in the world around you, from the trajectory of the bullet whizzing past you, to its measurements, vector, and the probabilities of the shooter's actions. Your ability with mathematics is superhuman, allowing you to do even the most theoretical and advanced forms of math instantly with the same ease that you’d breath. Combined with your powers senses this lets you do things like deflect a bullet with your cuff link so it ricochets to strike the shooter, know exactly where the rubble from the explosion will land and where to move to avoid it, surviving very large falls by landing perfectly to dissipate the force safely, and much more. Potentially far more useful though is the manifold uses of this power in areas other than combat. Seriously, your power is math now. The uses of that are incredible. Keep in mind that Thinker headaches are a bitch though, even with your power doing most of the heavy lifting."
300,Parahuman - Path to Victory,Worm,"Your power, when queried with a goal or intent, searches possible futures for the one where you succeed and feeds you information on what you need to do to make it happen. This isn't perfect, being more like playing a video game with detailed set of objectives and the perfect strategy guide than Contessa's canon plot device level Path to Victory, but assuming there isn't any interference from factors outside of your powers precognitive sight successfully pulling off the objectives it feeds you will result in success. You can still make a mistake, or fuck it up, but the part of your goals where you need to know what to do to make it happen is handled for you. Just remember that it relies on your ability to pull it off, and while a path will adjust and modify itself based on the circumstances messing up might result in completely ruining your shot at victory. Paths given are effective based on your desires, but your power decides those parameters by analyzing you. Your biases can very well leak into the path, and even ignoring that you can screw yourself over by not asking the right questions. This power is also much more straining then the others on this list if not used in moderation. Post-Spark this evolves into a full fledged perfect Path to Victory, no limitations, no downsides."
300,Parahuman - Transporter,Worm,"While technically a Thinker ability, its use means we're putting it over here. You basically have a full-fledged Contessa level Path to Victory...as long as said victory is getting something from point A to B. These are always the quickest, safest, and most efficient ways to do so unless you specifically wish otherwise. As long as it is in some way possible for you to do so, you can, and do it perfectly. Thinker headaches are also a thing. Anything beyond transporting a target to its destination is beyond the scope of this power, although that doesn’t mean that clever thinking can’t make this offensively in combat. Bullet A into Person’s Brain B is transportation after all. Just remember that these targets have to be physical things, so don’t try any conceptual or wordplay bullshit to game this power."
300,Royal Expertise,One Piece: New World,"Many problems could be solved if those in charge actually knew what they were doing, so it’s a good thing you’re one of those people! You are a very competent leader for any kind of group, able to keep a perfect balance of Freedom and Order that is needed to keep them functional and happy. But do keep in mind that no one is perfect, and even good rulers can fall short at times."
300,Skillful,Medaka Box Abnormal,"The Skill to be better at Skills, fitting that you of all people should have it. This ability does not provide you with anything on its own, only working when used in concert with other supernatural abilities. Having this allows you to effortlessly master any supernatural ability that you are capable of using, taking vast leaps in skill and experience with every individual use of your power. You'll discover every trick, hidden use, weakness and combination possible with your power as your growth and learning with it skyrockets to light speed."
300,Surgical Strategies,One Piece: New World,"Not everyone can simply rely on pure luck, but you’re one of those who can create your own luck. Your plans are precise and intricate, able to account for all but the most unexpected or chaotic factors. And even when things completely go off the rails, you can still find a way to use the chaos to your advantage to achieve your goals."
400,Auto Reflexes,Bleach,"Battle is in your bones, your blood, your very soul. Where others plan out their moves or train themselves to react automatically, it was always instinctual for you. These automatic reflexes for battle allow you to instinctively react with offense or defense to an attack, with no delay needed to judge or begin trained movements. Even when it’s something you’re not actually aware is an enemy or can’t even see, your spirit still guides you to fight as an instant response. If you continue to rely on the auto-reflexes during a fight instead of planning things out in advance, you’ll find your speed will steadily increase, as does your ability to counter or dodge things you’re reacting to. The gains will fade after the battle is over."
400,Break My Limits,Dragon Ball Z,"Just when you think you’ve hit your absolute peak, you manage to go just a little further beyond. You are excellent at quickly pushing your physical body to its absolute limit, which is useful for training. Speaking of training, you are much more effective at it, and the harder you push yourself, the more you will improve."
400,Brilliant Mind,Generic Naruto Fanfiction,"You are a genius, in the true sense of the word. Your IQ is in excess of 200 and your mental processes are optimized to where you have a truly perfect memory; unlimited storage, perfect indexing, instant recall, fully retroactive, all the perks. Furthermore, your intelligence is so boosted that you can easily detect any attempts at genjutsu or other methods of tampering with your thoughts, memories, or perceptions, and can block them with trivial effort. Simply put, you’re immune to any attacks that target your mind in any way, shape or form. It doesn’t matter if they’re magical attacks, mind control or some semi-mythical doujutsu technique, they bounce off of your mind without leaving any mark at all."
400,Echoing Depths,Arifureta Shokugyou de Sekai Saikyou,"Magic? Preposterous! Ridiculous! It’s merely a type of energy being directly converted into other forms. Incredible and most curious, remodeling our understanding of the world so far, but nothing that can’t be studied and replicated. You’re a genius, a multi-disciplinarian with an unrivaled mind when it comes to unraveling the mysteries of the world. You could very easily create a serum to turn people into monsters, or find a way to grant skills or powers to those without. Sure, some of your creations might need a bit of time or research beforehand, but it won’t be long before you crack the code of this."
400,Gum Up The Works,Young Justice,"If you’re going to mess with someone else’s plan, you’ve got to do it right. You now have a sixth sense for exactly what you need to do to wreck the plans of others, as well as what the consequences of doing that will be."
400,Hyperkinesis,Pokemon Mystery Dungeon,"Your mind and body are in perfect sync. You get perfect balance, motor skills, control, and more. Thought and action are intrinsically linked, with no reaction time beyond the physical limit of your muscles."
400,I Am Iron Man,Marvel Cinematic Universe Vol. 1,"You're not the ACTUAL Iron Man, but you could make a fairly decent knock-off. Power armors, sonic cannons, holographic interface, laser weapons, repulsor technology, you have the knowledge to build these things and more. Furthermore, you can think of different upgrades and modifications to adapt to different situations much easier than normal when presented with a problem that's hampered your technological progress."
400,Innovator,Generic Naruto Fanfiction,"It’s a pain, isn’t it? Seeing all these people who just don’t seem to realize how much they can do with their incredible powers. Well, that’s not something you need to worry about, at least. You have an incredible imagination, coupled with a ridiculous degree of technical capability. You’re able to come up with new uses for practically anything and everything you see, from jutsu to seals. Whatever it is, you just seem to ‘know’ how to apply them in all sorts of clever, innovative ways to achieve great results. This is only a side-advantage though. Your real skill lies in playing around with the techniques and abilities themselves. You have a ridiculously great ability to modify, break down and recreate any and all techniques, be they Taijutsu, Genjutsu, Ninjutsu or even specific bloodline applications. You don’t actually learn them any faster but once you have learned them your mind unleashes a veritable flood of ideas for improving them, applying them in ways no one has ever thought of, boosting their power or broadness though simple tricks, merging disparate techniques, lifting principles and elements from one and applying them to the other, coming up with new variants... and these are just a few examples of what you can do to them. If it still needs to be said, this also massively advances your ability to come up with new tricks and techniques, and lets you easily combo any already-compatible skills and abilities for maximum synergy."
400,John Von Neumann,Petals of Reincarnation,"Brilliant mathematician and creator for the first computer, Neumann’s mathematical abilities earned him a demonic nickname and they’ve become an equally demonic power in usefulness. You are able to understand the world in the form of maths, instantly computing problems that would take supercomputers weeks to solve, and thus figure out the most likely future possibilities of any scenario. Using this knowledge you can predict the moves someone will make in a fight and the best ways to respond to them, provided you have all the info. It’s great for gathering information on people but as it only deals with the numbers you know, you can still be surprised if you don’t keep yourself up to date on your enemies."
400,King of War,The God of Highschool,"Leading a war against all of Heaven and all of Earth at once, when many of your soldiers are as disciplined as a herd of cats, is quite a task. Especially when they are literally a herd of cats. You’ve got a mind like no other though. You won’t just rely on the raw power of a few individuals to win your battles. Not only are you a military strategist almost unsurpassed on Heaven or Earth but you know just how to get a whole bunch of people to work together and combine their powers to take down someone much stronger. And if events happened so as to prevent you from being capable of leading your men, whether on a small or a large scale? They’d be able to function for at least a short time as if you were still there, instinctually aware of what you would have given as orders. Won’t last forever but it’ll make sure things don’t fall apart whilst you’re away."
400,Like a Robot,Invincible,"Your mind is a masterpiece. You think faster than a normal human being; you can process in a second what would have before taken you a minute. You have the ability to split your mind in twain to concentrate on more than one thing at a time. In the beginning you would be limited to dividing your mind into 10 different streams of thought, each of which has the full processing power of your entire mind. Given time however, something on the scale of decades, you will be able to split your mind exponentially more, giving you enough subdivisions to run the world, control an army, and a police force of millions of separate robot suits all the while manipulating global politics. Given even more time, who knows how far you could take this."
400,Massive Potential and Talent,That Time I Was Reincarnated as a Slime,"You have such great potential that even if you were a small Hobgoblin you could keep up around Oni’s and their evolutions through sheer ingenuity and talent. If there is even a small chance for you to get an ability or the like from connections to you or others, like Racial and Class abilities that Unlock or special bonds that grant abilities, you are likely to get it very quickly as long as you have need of it even if it needs special requirements. An example may be the Outsider’s Mark from Dishonored."
400,Mind as an Island,DC – Kingdom Come,"The power of the Emotional Spectrum is both powered by and influenced by emotion. Thus, while it is usually powerful in abundance, it can have a strong influence on the user’s behavior. Worse, if you lack the emotion to power yourself, the Ring becomes useless. You’ve trained yourself to work around these particular weaknesses. First, outside attempts to manipulate or change your emotions simply do not work unless, for whatever reason, you voluntarily allow it. Second, you can isolate your mental processes from your emotions...this dissociation keeps you aware of your own emotional state, but you’re still able to think objectively and act as you would in a calmer situation. This effect can be toggled on and off."
400,Quantum Understanding,Ender’s Game,"You can rapidly come to understand (with no outside instruction) how any system you can study works, no matter how complicated. A political system, a computer system, an interoffice mailing system... doesn't matter. If you can examine it firsthand, you will rapidly begin to understand the basics and eventually even the subtleties will be revealed to you. This is merely an understanding of the rules or principles by which such a system functions, allowing you to interfere with or get the best results out of it. It does not grant you any particular skill in utilizing or repairing the system in question. Understanding the game of Cricket does not make you an expert Cricketer. Knowing how a toaster works does not allow you to instantly know how to fix a broken toaster. Knowing how a martial arts system works doesn’t make you a good fighter, and knowing how a political system functions doesn’t make you a good politician. All it can do is help you to understand what is going on. Knowing how psychic powers work does not grant you psychic powers, ditto magical abilities unless anyone who knows the rules can perform that magic."
400,Real Hokage,Generic Naruto Fanfiction,"It can be easy to stumble into positions of leaderships and/or authority. Becoming a team leader, a Kage, a Clan Head or even conquering an empire, depending on your skill and luck, can be done, and even done easily. Ruling them, on the other hand, is a whole different kettle of fish... for others, at least. You are different. You have a gift for all aspects of rulership and administration that makes you among the very best. This includes everything, from managing the national finances to developing infrastructure, playing at and countering courtly intrigue and assassination games, keeping a finger on your subordinates’ games or competing with other clan leaders in your village, or even other Kages as a village leader yourself. You know what missions to take and give up, how to develop alliances, who to assassinate and who to oblige, how to root out corruption and inefficiency, how to correctly pick out and train useful ministers and subordinates to delegate to... in short, everything you need to both shape whatever organization you’re leading in your own image completely and utterly, and to bring it to ridiculous, obscene levels of prosperity and power. Finally, you can choose one person per organization you lead to take as your deputy/heir, and pass on a lesser version of this perk. No one will question the legitimacy of this heir you have chosen."
400,Still Human,Chronicle,"Not all people handle power well. Even being the manager of a fast-food branch might go to some people’s heads, let alone the ability to contest with most military forces. Some might even get the idea that they are beyond mere humanity, that their abilities give them the right to kill their lessers with impunity. But that’s just not you. Even if your objective superiority might be evident to all, you’ll never forget your roots, and will remember that everyone has their own struggles to deal with. Even that one dumbass driver honking at you for the past few minutes. Your powers won’t go to your head or corrupt you, no matter how strong they might be, and even others cannot force their corruption onto you. No, if you go down a wrong path, it shall only happen due to your own judgment, unclouded by all things external."
400,Supreme Commander,Ender’s Game,"Not only are you a brilliant tactician, but you have an instinctive grasp of how battlefields shift, flow, evolve, granting you an ability to predict enemy maneuvers that borders on precognition."
400,The Schools Ace,Toaruverse,Like many honor students of an elite prestigious school you stand above the rest of any students of the said school with an intellect equal to a genius with the IQ of two hundred. This also gives you multitasking abilities that have no upper-limit and able learn skills and knowledge at fast rate that would take others a hundred years to master where you do it in year along with getting a eidetic memory which would allow you to remember everything that you ever do or experienced this even includes things you hear when you’re asleep or unconscious.
600,Brains Beat Brawn,All-Star Superman,"Every time. When you battle with the likes of the UltraSphinx or even the Man of Tomorrow himself, you don’t swing at them like an angry primate and hope to come out on top. No, you have a more...refined approach. You possess a keen tactical mind, able to predict actions minutes ahead of time using only what you know of your opponents, and can substitute combat prowess and destructive power with intellect. You will find ways to exploit the actions, habits, and ‘rules’ of your opponents to come out on top, whether stealing from them to gain their powers, resolving an issue diplomatically, or otherwise outwitting them. This does not guarantee you will defeat a vastly superior foe, particularly one not keen on the sort of games you play...but victory isn’t always simply being stronger than your opponent, and you will be able to find ways to escape or come out on top with enough work."

600,Bring Out Veronica,Marvel Cinematic Universe Vol. 2,"There's always that escalating threat that seems to loom over your head. Always something trying to make sure that you can't rest, lest you be caught unprepared. It's a stressful line of thinking, but that stress will see you through. Looming threats will spark your ingenuity and manufacturing speed tremendously, allowing you to quickly take stock of the situation and use information surrounding said threats to create countermeasures and machines custom-tailored for the situation in a fraction of the time it would normally take. Knowledge of the monster tearing down cities could see you adapting and fielding a custom armor for taking it down, or learning very rapidly from your mistakes in one fight to adapt your technology for the next fight."
600,Genius Intellect,Young Justie,"Despite your apparent age, you possess one of the greatest minds that the world has ever seen. You’re ability to come up with ideas and invent is nearly unparalleled, and actually building your inventions is child’s play. What’s more, your inventions have a lot more room in terms of following conventional physics; you can create things like teleportation devices, collars that nullify superpowers, and more."
600,Genuine Genius,The God of Highschool,"More matters in a fight then brawn or skill. Having a canny and brilliant mind can allow you to triumph over those with more power or talent then you any day of the week. In fact, you not only possess a merely brilliant mind but one that surpasses all but one other human in its ingenuity and acumen. Your only peer, Baek Seung-Chul, had learnt nine languages fluently and had mastered physics, chemistry and mathematics by age nine, adding mastery of many western and eastern philosophies by age eleven and mastering both medicine and countless forms of modern sport by age thirteen. Not only is your learning rate a match for this genius but so too is your analytical skill. You can easily pick out all the strengths and weaknesses of a martial art, just from witnessing a single serious fight involving a practitioner of it and thus develop countermeasures against that Martial Art to destroy that martial artist."
600,"I Am the Puppet Master, I Pull the Strings",Invincible,"You are a genuine puppet-master, capable of manipulating things globally in the social and political spheres. Given half a chance you could create conspiracies and organizations that operate in the shadows of the world and pull nearly all the strings of power. You can plan years in advance and are so capable with contingencies you could have a preparation for any scenario you could reasonably think up within weeks of you first considering it. You’re so good you don’t even bother with shark repellent because you already arranged to have all the sharks removed from the area long before you got there. Congratulations on winning every chess game you play in from here on out.


--- Capstone Boosted (Requires You Have Been Reborn): Somehow you got even better at promoting your plans and conspiracies. Now you instinctively go for the plan that is the most likely to work and is also achievable far more simply and easily than you would have believed. Beyond this however your plans, and conspiracies, carry a weight behind them. A weight of something like inertia beyond what any plan should have in the real world. The longer a plan goes on for and the further into the future that you plan the less likely it is for your plan to be discovered. If the plan is one you concocted yesterday the wise and observant may be able to stop it, but if you started the plan years or even decades ago? No one will ever see you coming. ---"
600,Mind of a Genius,All-Star Superman,"One part of the promise of tomorrow is the advancement of technology, pioneered by great geniuses like the good Dr. Quintum and the many minds working towards the betterment of mankind. Lex Luthor himself could be counted among these, had he focused his energies differently. You are what this world considers a 9th level intellect, able to hold nine simultaneous thought processes seamlessly. In addition, you find it laughably simple to innovate and advance technology, along with possessing an almost omnidisciplinary engineering ability. You could feasibly make things like shrinking devices, robots, artificial intelligence, teleporters, gravity-manipulating guns and even things as outlandish as a storytelling robot that tells literature at such a high speed and sound frequency that it could generate an escape tunnel. And those are just trinkets compared to what you may eventually make with time and resources - the mysteries of the universe are open to you. You just have to reach out and grasp them."
600,Mindscape,Generic Naruto Fanfiction,"Well then, look at you, with a non-conventional mind! You have a real, proper Mindscape now, Jumper! You have a place within you, somewhere in between your chakra, your soul and your blood, where your mind manifests as something real, as something that surrounds you and something you can interact with directly. This has a number of advantages, as you may guess. You can physically and directly access and modify each and every part and aspect of your own mind, adding things, removing them, sealing them off, so on. Nor is your mind the only thing you have such access to. You can interact just like this with your soul, your chakra... and practically everything else. In addition, you can control this place itself entirely, every part of it. You decide how big it is, how the laws of physics work, how time passes relative to the real world... within your mind you are God. You can also talk to and interact with any beings that are spiritually and magically linked to you. You can even bring in and store items here, though nothing alive can be permanently stored barring shadow clone/soul shenanigans. Even people can be brought in, and depending on how willing they are, even access things about them, and let them access those things, in the same way as you access your own. This will only bring in their minds of course, and their bodies need to be connected to yours in some way, either physical contact or chakra/seal methods."
600,One in a Trillion,Infinite Stratos,"Only one other person in the world possesses the grand level of intelligence you now find yourself in possession of, Tabane Shinonono. Comparing you to any sort of normal human mind would be a joke, because you’re decades ahead of the rest of the world. You think faster, better and so far outside the box they’d need to measure in miles. You don’t know anything more than you do right now but with a mind like this, it’ll be a matter of weeks before you’re zooming past the experts and making the beginnings of something special. Mighty robots, dimensional pockets, space flight and true artificial intelligence are all just the beginning."
600,Plus Ultra!,My Hero Academia,"Not everyone in life gets a good hand every time. Perhaps you lost the power lottery, or you've just got some of the worst tools possible. Maybe you're even just in a tough situation, stacked against seemingly insurmountable odds. No amount of brute force can help you out whatever it is, so what's a kid like you supposed to do? You put your mind to it and never give up, that’s what! You've got an amazing mind when it comes to finding the advantages where none appear to exist. If you have the time, you can turn that crapsack power into something people call cheating! You can make those tools fit for an artisan! You have the power to overcome foes no one thought you could be by the power of applying yourself! As long as you still have hope and the ability to think clearly, your ability to formulate plans and make the best of your situation is second to none. Nothing shall impede your progress, Plus Ultra!"
600,Renaissance Woman,Fate/Grand Order,"Every once in a while, a person comes along who’s pretty much fated to bring about changes to the world. Masters of all they survey, bringing invention after invention and working with concepts decades or centuries ahead of all their peers. The quintessential Renaissance Man, if you will. One much like yourself. You have incredible natural talent in everything you do, whether that be painting or casting spells, fighting or creating artificial homunculi bodies. This natural talent not only allows you to start with a shocking amount of skill in anything you try your hand at, as if you’d already been practising for months, but it allows you to learn even more in any subject you put your mind to than any other, progressing at several times the speed of any of your peers. You could accomplish in just a month what takes other scientist’s years and move on to learn even more disciplines on top of that one."
600,Snake,Fate/Stay Night,"The Snake was the personal martial art of one Souichirou Kuzuki, an art that was impossible to predict the first few attacks from, even from those with supernatural instincts and decades of combat experience, though it dropped severely in effect after those first attacks against experienced fighters. Perhaps you are another student of this martial form or maybe you have your own pseudo- supernatural martial art. One that becomes deadlier the more tired you are? Perhaps you can use wires to slice through stone or steel with a flick of your wrist? Whichever you choose, the rigorous training has brought both your body and your mind to the peak of human ability. Your physical strength, agility, endurance and so on are all enough to compete with Olympic athletes that specialise in any of those alone whilst your mental capabilities let you multitask over a half dozen actions at once, along with placing you on the level of men like Hawking or Einstein in terms of intelligence."
600,Strategic Genius,Ender’s Game,"There is no denying that Ender and his compatriots are brilliant tacticians, but whoever planned the war against the buggers was a strategic genius. You are that kind of thinker, able to chart the course of a 70 year long war across dozens of star systems, without knowing if you’d have a battlefield commander capable of making your dream a reality. Intricate plans that span decades and rely on imponderables and unpredictable variables are your bread and butter."
600,Supergenius,Arrowverse,"Your mind is vastly augmented pushing your ability to mentally process, react, memorize, deduce, analyze, and simply comprehend to surreal levels, able access any thoughts far faster and more efficiently than normal human levels, even exceeding any speedsters. Your intellect will continuously expand, eventually making the intellects of other geniuses seem pathetic in comparison to yours. However as your intellect grows you’ll become increasingly arrogant, erratic, cruel and unstable. Post-Jump the mental instability goes away."
600,The Wise King,Re:Monster,"Humans don’t rely solely on might, but also on wisdom and cunning, for it is the learning and schooling of humanity that allows them to thrive in a world where monsters are so much stronger than they are, building on the foundation laid by those that came before and raising it ever higher. You now share in this trait. Anything you learn becomes the foundation for additional learning, turning what you’ve experienced into learning moments with ease, and making your work into moments of growth. You learn faster. Naturally twice as fast as you otherwise would. But more than this, anything you learn accelerates your learning in other fields. Mastering a skill will provide an increase to the rate of your learning by an additional 100%. Lower levels of mastery still provide an increase, but it is proportionately lesser as a result.


--- Improved Wise King (Re:Monster) (Requires Protagonist): you can push beyond mastery, increasing your skills further and providing even greater benefits to your learning speed. And while you will need to figure out how to go past the common level of mastery, you will always have at least some vague idea on how to do so ---"

600,True Genius,Generic Naruto Fanfiction,"Oh, wow. There’s geniuses, there’s legends... then there’s you. Not only do you have vast potential in just about every Ninja Art out there, but your ability to master new skills, arts, techniques, or anything else is utterly absurd. You pick up the basics of new things almost immediately and improve from there at dazzling speed; a month of hard training would give you the sort of gains that an average ninja would spend a lifetime trying to achieve. This works for everything learnable or trainable, in this world or any other. Physical development, chakra capacity, you name it. And you never need to waste time laboriously practicing or reconditioning what you have already learned; your skills and abilities will remain razor-sharp no matter how long they are left unused. Better still, what real genius ever needs to rely on others? You could teach yourself how to become a seal master just from reading the textbook, learn advanced jutsu from half-legible scrolls fished out of the garbage, and master new taijutsu styles by secretly watching other ninjas perform their daily kata. Nor do you suffer any bottlenecks or ‘down’ periods in your training. Every step on the path to power is as simple and obvious as the very first one, when it comes to you. The only limitation on your ability to learn new skills, techniques, or abilities is that you cannot create new information from nothing or train in powers or special abilities that you don’t have the capacity to use. Lastly, the very first lesson you learned was that genius is wasted without the proper application. Your work ethic is excellent and you not only have the dedication to keep grinding away for prolonged periods of time but actually enjoy doing so.


--- Jinchūriki Boosted (Requires Jinchūriki): Normally there would be a solid limit to what you can achieve even with the many boons this perk grants you. There are certain things you just don’t have innate skills for, elements for which your affinity is just not there. No more of that. The beast within you has a nigh-infinite base of knowledge, and that includes the ability to impart potential for things you just didn’t have before. As long as something is not completely, utterly impossible to use outside of one specific bloodline or some-such, you find that you develop a deep, vast potential for it as soon as you encounter it, and are able, from that point on, to train it just as effectively as you can everything else. In addition to this, you find that the limits to what you can learn, at least, are simply gone. Even though you may not be able to use them, you can now learn any and all techniques, styles and similar, regardless of whether or not it’s supposed to be possible for you or not. And regarding those skills and abilities that are specific to bloodlines or similar, you find that you need to collect a sample of the relevant type, such as DNA from the specific bloodline, or just some blood from that specific race, or a sample of the energy required, before your beast can integrate them into you too, and grant you the same potential, up to and including making you a Hybrid of the race in question, one with all its strengths and none of its weaknesses. ---"
600,True Genius,With This Ring,"No one can know everything, but that won’t stop you from trying. This boosts your intellect enough to take an average adult human to a 10th level intellect. You gain perfect memory, faster processing speed, an intuitive grasp for more efficient reasoning, as well as a world class education in a non-magical field of your choosing. Robotics on the level of T. O. Morrow or Dr. Ivo are a possibility, as are the biological chops of Dr. Otto von Schadel. But the “hard” sciences are not your only options: you could become the best psychiatrist on earth (comparable to the memetic chops of Jessica Yamada), or a historian/archaeologist capable of uncovering the history and nature of legends like Teth Adom or places such as the Garden of Eden. Moreover, if you did not take the “Drop-In” origin, you can choose to be recognized globally as one of the undisputed leaders in your field in this or any future jump."
600,Understanding the World,Re: Monsters,"Everything happens for a reason. The world is a machine, a system that follows a set of rules and interactions; even if many fail to notice or understand them. While many may be content to wade through like blind wanderers in a land of mystery; you are gifted with the brilliance and intuition required to deduce these secret rules. In this way, you could gain a scientific understanding of even the most mind-boggling or poorly studied things; though like any true scholar your greatest strength comes from devising ways you can apply these precious insights in practical ways. Whether that's investigating the most optimal way to cast a fireball, adapting a ritual by understanding which alterations you'd have to make to use an acceptable substitute, creating a true wonder thanks to your intimate understanding of how dozens of disparate enchantments can potentially interact with one another and their medium, or simply introducing a primitive world to the wonders of steam and clockwork, you can understand the principles behind them and apply them in new and interesting ways that will prove to be useful. Why with sufficient research and investigation you may even discover new ways to interact with these unseen systems; revolutionizing fields you've devoted yourself too, or perhaps even pioneering new disciplines of magic! Though the latter would no doubt be a grand endeavor even for you.


--- (Requires Protagonist): With the addition of the Protagonist perk, you don’t even need any tools or aids to help you study these phenomena, instead relying on your own senses and reasoning to substitute for such things. This effectively allows you to accurately and precisely study any sort of phenomenon; without having to deal with cumbersome equipment, or the fact the tool you need hasn't been invented yet. ---"
800,Answer User,Medaka Box Abnormal,"Are you just talking to yourself or is something strange going on? Through this Style, you are able to find out the answer to any question. You need only vocalise your question and you’ll find that your voice then takes on a life of its’ own to talk about the answer. Answers to questions are highly specific and will likely require multiple questions to find out the right questions to ask and to get further detail on the answers you have already gained. You are also unable to find out answers that lie solely outside of the jump you currently inhabit."
800,Leonardo Da Vinci,Petals of Reincarnation,"The great polymath and Renaissance man himself, master of many disciplines and as it turns out, many powers too. You have become a Universal Vessel, capable of learning anything from anyone. Not only do you absorb months or years of information within days, but you are also able to learn what shouldn’t be able to be learned, such as gaining powers by having the holders of powers teach you about their abilities. A few days or weeks of tutelage is enough to start to gain the ability, with it rapidly growing to match the original as you continue to receive their teachings. There is no limit to what you can learn nor how many things you can learn at once in this way, just that you are being actively taught them by somebody or something that possesses those powers."
1000,Path To Victory,Generic Worm Fanfiction,"Do you really want this power, Jumper? Are you absolutely sure? Very well. By purchasing this your feet are now set on the Path to Victory, with no holding back. Since you’re paying premium price you’re getting the fully jailbroken, no downsides, and working just the way your favorite fanfic interpreted how it works version. And unlike Contessa you have no blind spots save for those enforced by Jump-Fiat. Entities, Endbringers, Eidolon, you can see them all as plain as day. If there is any possible route to achieving a goal or set of goals of yours, you know what it is and what it requires. So long as any remotely conceivable path to victory exists, you can traverse it as easily as walking across a room. If a series of actions could possibly be completed by you at all then you can draw upon the Path to let you do so with absolute perfection of execution and timing, first time every time. Your Path also automatically accounts for your own continued survival unless you deliberately choose to sacrifice your life for a goal; nothing short of suicidally overwhelming odds combined with a fiat-backed plot-armor piercer can kill you against your will, even if a desperate situation means that you might have to forfeit a complete victory for continued survival. The merits of living this way might be considered questionable by some people. Still, there’s no accounting for taste. Just in case though, this power comes with a volume knob. You can turn it off and let random chance back into your life again, either 100% or just enough to let you be potentially surprised or defeated while still keeping you from dying. Just... keep in mind that some things are genuinely impossible."
