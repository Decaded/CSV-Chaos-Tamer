100,Engineer,Generic First Jump,"Once you know how to use a piece of technology, you can figure out how to fix it. This does not provide tools or materials, just the know-how."
100,Tinker,Sekirei,"traps, weapons, vehicles, maybe even a power suit, or a mecha? Who knows. The point is that as a Tinker-type Sekirei you are notoriously good with your hands. Building and crafting come as naturally to you as breathing does. Given enough time and effort you might actually be capable of building a mecha or something else grand and amazing."
100,Medicine,Star Trek – TNG + DS9,"Training and knowledge in First-aid, diseases, surgery, anatomy, health and nutrition. You're a fully qualified doctor of the 24th century."
100,Robotics,Star Trek – TNG + DS9,"A combined study of mechanical engineering, and computer science. You learn how to make a wide array of machines, and you could even figure out Android or Borg technology if you studied it enough."
100,Physics,Star Trek – TNG + DS9,"How the universe works. The law of gravity, the conservation of matter & energy, quantum physics, etc. Remember though, there are dozens of creatures in this universe that defy the laws of human physics, so you may want to try and rewrite a few of these books while your here."
100,Physical Sciences,Star Trek – TNG + DS9,"Understanding of the natural laws which govern the physical world. Biology, chemistry, geology and ecology. Again, you may want to rewrite a few of these books while you're here."
100,Engineering,Star Trek – TNG + DS9,"You've been trained in the maintenance and repair of Starships. Not only do you have a significant amount of mechanical and computer knowledge, but you also know a great deal about physics."
100,Communications,Star Trek – TNG + DS9,You're fully versed in reading and operating digital transmissions and sensors. You also have training in linguistics in and diplomacy.
100,Piloting,Star Trek – TNG + DS9,How to operate starships and other space worthy vessels like shuttles and Runabouts.
100,Navigation,Star Trek – TNG + DS9,"Training in how to locate your position and plot courses. You can navigate both with a computer, and without one using astronomy."
100,Surgeon,Star Trek – TNG + DS9,"You’ve been trained in the art of physiological modification. You’ll be able to perform facial and bodily modification procedures that can greatly alter someone’s appearance. At first you’ll only be able to perform minor surgeries, like making a human look like a Vulcan, but with time and practice, you may be able create exotic and terrifying chimeras."
100,Analysis,Red Alert 3,"You can immediately identify any defects in hardware upon casual observation. This is effective on devices, Vehicles, and buildings."
100,Medical Doctorate,Generic Medical Drama,"At the very least, you have all the training you’ll need to work as an Attending or Surgeon­ choose one. You could easily work at a clinic or as a family doctor, or do general surgery. Comes with a common specialty, like internal medicine or transplant surgery. Janitors get all the skills, but none of the pretty pieces of paper to show it. Interns will get the pretty paper soon."
100,PhD,X-Men Evolution,You contain an ever expanding set of PhDs for each field of expertise that you’re knowledgeable in or will be knowledgeable in. People will of course accept these even if they are in fields yet to be discovered or are out of this world. Helpful for getting people to listen to you since they at least know you have the smarts to back what you’re saying.
100,Limiter Removal,Duel Monsters - Shadow Realm,"Overclocking is a useful if dangerous skill, one you have learned how to apply to combat machines or devices designed for fighting. Whether it is a gun or a drone, you know how to double the effectiveness and output of the device’s destructive power...though it will detonate from the exertion after the danger had passed. Stronger or complex machines ‘merely’ short circuit or shut down in need of repairs, while pure robots or simple weapons just explode. Still good for a latch ditch effort. You will need some time to modify and tinker the device in question in the first place, mind, so it’s unlikely you’ll get to try this on an enemy device without time to work."
100,Poison Master,Battle Through the Heavens,"At birth you were put through a bizarre ritual involving bathing in poisons that has left you with a Dou Qi that is poisonous to others. As you grew up, you were groomed in the ways of poison masters, learning about the many different kinds of poisons. Not even an alchemist would have a simple time dealing with you, for your knowledge of poison is in no way lesser than their knowledge of ingredients. This is a profession similar but different from an alchemist. Poison Masters have their own drawbacks: aside from the social stigma, the poison in their Qi will somewhat decrease their lifespan unless they can reach Dou Huang, or have a special body."
100,Time Taught,Arrowverse,"Time travel is real. However the complexities makes it very difficult thing for most to wrap their heads around. Luckily for you it’s been ingrained into your psyche, either through re-education or just been around the block to know a thing or two. With this you know the science behind it, the hazards that comes with time travel, and how to avoid the hazards to the best of your ability. Lastly you seem to be remarkable resilient to changes in your own timeline. Any memories you have of one timeline while another one is established you’ll have memories of both timelines. Also your infantile self is protected in a place & time where your enemies can’t get to, protecting yourself from being erased via infanticide."
100,Magna Cum Laude,Arrowverse,"What good is a scientist without degrees in Science? Or what good is any smart person if he or she can't prove how smart they are? You have TWO doctorates degrees in a science of your choice. To top it off you graduated at top your field of study. Can be chosen multiple times at a discount, each purchase adds TWO more degrees of your choice."
100,Desperate Scientists,Superman: the Animated Series,No matter how deadly the situation you always seem to be able to figure out a miraculous plan to save everyone. If you had to you could recreate entire branches of science to evacuate a planet and terraform a new one in just a few short years. This ability works best when you have plenty of time and resources to prepare with. Using it on the fly will give you very suboptimal results.
100,Gear Head,Dragon Ball,"You know what’s actually useful instead of punching people and causing a couple million Zenny of property damage? Technical skills. An education that is the envy of engineers the world over. Knowing how to properly build and operate mundane machinery. That is what you have, now. In terms of engineering and science, you are considered a budding genius, though this perk doesn’t come with a particular specialty. Put it to good use."
200,In a Tiny Capsule,Dragon Ball Z,"There is a particular brand of science in this world, provided by the titular Capsule Corporation on planet Earth. They store singular objects or even small houses in these tiny capsules. Just hit a button, throw it somewhere with enough space, and BAM. You’ve managed to pick up enough knowledge of this trade to make your own capsules, and store something up to the size of a one-story house in each individual capsule. They don’t come with their own power source, though, so anything you store will need its own generator or equivalent if it’s an actual house. Hm? You already were something of a wiz when it came to Capsules, thanks to an earlier purchase a few years ago? Well, you’re in luck. Your ability to store things efficiently with Capsules has greatly increased the capacity of things you can store - that small, one-story house limit is now up to a things the size of a three-story mansion."
200,Velocity 6,Arrowverse,"A designer drug designed by Harrison Wells of Earth-2 and Caitlin Snow. Wells started the drug design to help Jay Garrick in his battle with Zoom, but the first 5 versions were failures. With help of Snow's biochemistry knowledge they perfected the drug. The drug temporarily enhances a Speedster's connection to the Speed Force or temporarily restore a Speedster's connection to the Speed Force. When taken by a non-Speedster it grants them brief access to the Speed Force, allowing them to run at 100mph but they're unable to pull off Speed Tricks as a true Speedster. Comes with six vials and the formula to make more."
200,It Floats?,Dragon Ball,"It’s not rocket science! Except it totally is. You now know how to construct the common ‘rocket cars’ of Capsule Corporation, as well as being able to construct human-sized jetpacks that are safe for commercial use. You don’t learn much about space travel, but you’ll find it easier to grasp should you start learning."
200,Reverse Engineer,Sekirei,"You can take any non-human technology and rework it for human use. This includes martial arts, weaponry, and even magic should you be in a world that has it."
200,Hacking Skillz,Sekirei,"Your skill in hacking will be half the skill of a Brain-typed Sekirei, or even greater should you actually be one. Computers of all kinds will be your friend and their secrets will be yours to search and use at your leisure."
200,Robert the Builder,Invincible,"You can seemingly build and organize anything with far less hassle and for greater results than most would experience. You are able to be the driving force behind projects large enough to affect entire countries or maybe even the world in its entirety. Somebody ‘glassed’ Las Vegas? Don’t worry, you could lead a project to turn it into the world’s largest and most efficient solar farm that can provide cheap electricity to Half of America. Some super villain messed with the tides the world over? You, with the help of some geniuses, would be able to successfully direct the building of a secondary artificial moon to set the tides to right. Truly, the sky itself isn’t a limit."
200,Dark Factory of Mass Production,Duel Monsters - Shadow Realm,"Nothing is stronger than the fires of industry. You now know how to build the many combat machines and robots of the Shadow Realm, along with how to build and manage factories designed to mass produce them in total automation. You will need some time and resources to build an army rival to the Machine King’s own forces...but after the initial factory is made, you’ll have no shortage of combat-ready mechanical minions on your side."
200,Medicine maker,Rune Factory,"from now on you know everything to know about medicine, herbs, natural remedies, stimulants, performance enhancers and any kind of drug or anything that could be made with pharmaceutical ingredients, and your knowledge updates with every jump you go to, have been to already, or new discovery. You know what medications can help a person heal immediately, stabilize them, numb the pain or anything else you can think of. You are gifted in coming up with new medications as well, or even things like retroviruses, bioweapons, poisons, and nano-viruses in future jumps, although this is mostly knowledge on how to counteract them, if you want to make them, you need to study up. If medicine can’t solve your problems by itself, you will still need an alternative."
200,Changing The World,Flow,"As a person seeking to change the world you’ve gotta have the skills of knowing how to make a change. This is why you’re the best person for the job. You’ve got knowledge of how to turn any society yinto something that will resemble a utopia, the charisma to make the most heinous of opponents agree with you, and anything related to politics will be your bread and butter that no one on earth can match. At a glance, it might seem like manipulation but someone needs to push society to a better tomorrow. Even if you’re a complete nobody it’ll only take a month before you’re at the top of whatever society you’re in and by then you’ll be able to make a real difference in the world."
200,Mecha-Shift Engineer,RWBY,"You possess all the engineering knowledge needed to create, maintain, and upgrade the mecha-shift weapons that are used by Huntsmen and Huntresses, and how to apply these design principles to other projects.This translates to the mechanical knowledge to fit large complex machinery into very small forms, as well as machinery that transforms into different shapes like a sniper rifle shifting into a scythe."
200,Shinobi-Ware,Naruto,"Otherwise known as Integrated Mechanical Ninja Tools, Shinobi-Ware are scientific ninja tools developed as prosthetics for civilians and ninja alike. Currently, these types of tools are not even an idea which is why it’s so puzzling that you know how to make them, or to be more precise, you know how to make microscopic tools that can modify a person's circulatory and nervous system. The tools you can make are revolutionary, capable of altering an organism down to the cellular level, turn people into living weapons, or completely restructure their bodily systems."
200,World of Robotics,Final Fantasy 7 Remake,"Shinra commands a world of metal and industry, all with the help of engineers like you. Whether your boss calls for a flying drone that can project his holographic face, or razor-covered murder ball to chase his enemies down the highway, you have the know-how to deliver the goods. You might need some help to build something as grand as the mighty Airbuster, but with the right resources you could create some incredible machines."
200,Eastern Sage,Full Metal Alchemist,"Legends tell that Amestris learned the art of Alchemy from a philosopher who told the tale of Xerxes’ destruction in a single night. You too share something with this man in that you can teach even the most untalented and thick people arts that should be beyond them considering their knowledge base. You could single handedly bring Alchemy to other worlds, while creating a new era based on its use, and that’s literally too. All you need to do is teach it as if it was a normal subject and a possibility there, and people will develop the capability in other worlds even if they really shouldn’t. You find you can do much the same for your other mystical abilities."
200,Specialized Alchemy,Full Metal Alchemist,"You’ve spent years studying alchemy, and are probably a State Alchemist. Of course to get to that level, there has to be at least something that distinguishes you from the rest. With this perk, minding the rules and limitations of Alchemy, you too have a specialized focus in your alchemical pursuits. This can be one of the canon ones that your In-Jump origin simply recreated through study, or an entirely new one that’s unseen. Whether it’s the transmutation of Chimera, the creation of flames, Transmuting iron and steel weapons and artillery, whatever suits your needs, and wouldn’t be too far out of line for the State Alchemists we see in the show."
200,The Love of Lightning,Fate/Grand Order,"Steam Power! Coal! Electricity! The Nuclear Age! All the greatest revolutionaries have brought new power with them, their obsessions letting them take great bounds over the opposition to advance all of humanity. You share that same potential with one form of technological power, greatly advancing your skill and potential when dealing with technology that uses it. It could be electricity powered tech, steam powered tech or even wind powered tech. Whatever you choose, you’ll be able to make them much stronger, much more efficient and much cheaper than you normally could. Not all energies are exactly equal however, so you may still find yourself needing more resources than normal, though you’d still get the increased power and efficiency."
200,Accelerated Science,Bleach,"Science isn’t meant to be an overly speedy process. Discovering, studying, researching, testing, replicating results and making sure it’s all safe and viable for use. Even something small can take months or years, in the hands of an incompetent dullard. But here, the intelligent make progress beyond any reasonable pace, seemingly only because of their intelligence. Your own research accelerates in step with your cerebral brilliance, allowing a proper genius to fully research and develop ideas in weeks that might normally take months. Those at the top of the field might do it in days or even less, creating incredible new technologies to counter enemies only discovered a week ago. Somehow, you manage to fit enough testing to make these creations reasonably safe for use."
200,The Modern Advancement,Tate no Yuusha no Nariagari,"Going to a medieval fantasy world and being separated from the convenience of modern technology is hard to get used to. You’re good at research and development at replacing manpower with machines. Wanting to find a way to fly without relying on dragons, gryphons, or magic would allow you to develop an airship. Don’t like the idea of monster pulling carriages, you would rapidly come up with an idea of building cars. This essentially allows you to invent machines that remove the need of manpower or relying on monsters even if it’s powered by magic or something mundane gasoline. The machines that you created can be improved indefinitely the more familiar and experienced of the process of building it."
200,Ninja Therapist,Generic Naruto Fanfiction,"If there’s one thing Naruto fanfic has made plain its that the Elemental Nations are suffering from a dire shortage of mental health professionals. Well, until some come along you’ll have to do. When it comes to mental issues, hang-ups, long held psychoses and deep-seated emotional issues, you are the ultimate panacea. It’s almost supernatural with you, the way it works. You have a solid understanding of how people’s minds work, how to tell when one isn’t healthy and how to get it there. You can do it through conversations, proper treatments... or you can do it with a bare-knuckle fight. It’s weird, but whatever you do, even the worst mental issues can be resolved by you in hours, if not minutes. Of course, you didn’t get this good at sorting through other people’s shit by completely ignoring your own. You are a generally well-adjusted, mentally stable person and can remain so even through the normal stresses of ninja life. Lastly, this works on every single sapient being you come across, regardless of how incomprehensible their minds must normally be to you. Someone’s gotta teach the bijuu to stop hating eh?"
200,Research Notes,With This Ring,"This is a set of research diaries by Abednego Danner about his work with super-strength, as well as the research notes of one other DC human scientific hero or villain on their most recognizable invention. Kryptonian, Martian, and other alien tech development logs are not available through this purchase, and it comes with no working examples of tech, only notes that could, with intelligence and time, lead to recreation of their work. You can't take the Danner Formula as-is to grant yourself super strength. If you have access to a sufficiently advanced computer system, such as a Motherbox, Fatherbox, or Power Ring, you will have zero problems adapting it. If you are a skilled alchemist (or a mediocre alchemist with these research notes), you can modify the formula to work on yourself. If you are a smart enough scientist, you can observe the biological effects in rats or some other short-lived mammal, then replicate the changes in yourself. The research notes are enough to allow someone with no magic training and access to low level super-science to recreate the Danner formula and apply them to adults, given they have about six months to run animal trials. As in, “an ordinary scientist working for LexCorp” level super-science, not “Lex does research personally” super-science. The Danner formula is somewhat unique, in that it seems to work on any Terrestrial mammal, which means animal trials can be used to speed up the research cycle. With magical training, research notes, and household reagents, it would take a month to have a mass-producible super-strength serum that lets humans match Superman without being vulnerable to Kryptonite or red sunlight. If you choose the Garrick Formula, you would not get Flash knockoffs; barring mistakes in the production process, you'd get Flash-equivalent speedsters, lacking only the experience necessary to match the (arguably) strongest member of the Justice League. Complete with Speed Force connection. Other useful pieces of technology to research include, but are not limited to: the X-ionization process, which produces bladed weapons capable of harming Kryptonians. The Thinkers Cap, which provides powerful psychic abilities. Crumbler technology, capable of neutralizing Lantern Constructs and almost all physical matter. Cold guns, a lightspeed weapon which reduces the target to absolute zero in violation of all physics. Red Rocket power armor, currently being mass produced for the Russian Army. OMAC combat robots. AMAZO the amazing android. The Red series AI-driven elementalist androids, and more."
200,Unnatural Skill,Percy Jackson,"Whether from your heritage or just being that good you've got one particular mundane skill that your feats with border on supernatural. Whether you're a smith on the level of the Cyclopses, a near prescient tactician or a swordsman who is ny unstoppable with a blade your feats will be legendary. You are on a level within your skill such that only other beings of legend can hope to match you. This may be taken multiple times. You may not choose magic but you may choose a particular application of magic if you have it already (so curses, enchanting might work, more specific gets a bigger boost)."
300,Gadgeteer,Young Justice,"An inventive mind and the knowhow to make gadgets; though they can’t do anything too outside of normal physics, you are perfectly capable of making functional things like grappling hooks, tracking devices, boomerangs that automatically return to you, and trick arrows. In addition to being very cheap to make, any gadgets that you have are almost as intuitive to use as your very limbs,"
300,Hacker Extraordinaire,Arrowverse,"The Information Age is in need of folks of your talent. You're able to hack into just about any computer system connected to the Internet. You're not too shabby at counter hacking and keeping your data trails hidden either. Your love for the computer also applies to the physical side of the machine, allowing you to make sure your computer is running with the best hardware & software there is. Even if it's not yet on the market."
300,Climate Navigation,One Piece: New World,"You have a special gift when it comes to navigation, one almost unseen. Not only can you reach any destination with the right tools, you instinctively know what kind of weather it will be with minutes to prepare. Along with this ability is a great skill in cartography, able to make realistic and accurate maps and charts within minutes."
300,Parahuman - Miniaturization and Efficiency Tinker,Worm,"You can miniaturize anything down to levels that any sane man would consider impossible. A fusion reactor the size of a watch battery would be the absolute minimum of what you are capable of, and you'd be able to make it far smaller than that. Your power also makes you a master of technological efficiency, anything you make needing barely any energy to run compared to what it should and continue to do so for a very long time. These specialties also make you a master of nanotechnology and similar pursuits. Of course you aren't barred from building something big like a giant robot, just that it'll be impossibly efficient and crammed full of more weapons and subsystems then should be possible."
300,Parahuman - Programming and Computer Science Tinker,Worm,"Supercomputers are your bread and butter, and Artificial Intelligence is your idea of a PDA. Data, programs, and digital devices are your playthings, not to mention that your understanding of such systems means you can hack anything that could possibly be hacked. There isn't really any limit on the extent you could push computing hardware, and any kind of software you can imagine is within your grasp. Please do note that flaunting this is likely to attract some attention from a few major players in particular. Then again that might not be a bad thing  depending on your disposition and plans."
300,Parahuman - Medical and Biological Science Tinker,Worm,"You know how to cure cancer, AIDS, and pretty much everything else. The working of flesh and bone is casual to you, with even the most difficult procedures capable of being performed half asleep and blind in one eye as easily as you breathe. You're the perfect medic and doctor, but your skills and knowledge extend much further than that. You could create some truly incredible monsters if you wanted to, whether out of whole cloth or test subjects. Let’s not even get started on biological warfare. Biology and anything to manipulate or interact with it are all within your capabilities. From genetic engineering, to human enhancement, to even cloning with the proper samples and resources."
300,Parahuman - Reverse Engineering Tinker,Worm,"While you still possess an amount of scientific knowledge beyond the curve of modern society, your base technical knowledge is far less than other Tinkers. This is however because your power lets you reverse engineer the principles and workings of anything you can get your hands on, and then apply that knowledge and understanding to your own work. Just seeing a device and watching it function gives you a vague idea as to how it works, and examining something means you can derive the hows and whys as to its functions. This requires time and effort on your part, in addition to the time and resources it’ll take to actually implement this new knowledge, but as long as you put in the necessary investment you can always understand virtually any new technology. Your Tinker abilities will continue to expand as you gain access to new technology and knowledge, with potentially no upper limit as long as you can keep gaining samples to work with."
300,Genius Business Savvy,Arrowverse,"You're a shark in the board room and everyone knows it. You have the skills, portfolio, and the connections to operate a Fortune 500 company. With a bit of effort, you can turn any company into a titan of industry rivaling the likes of, Kord Industrials and Queen Enterprises. You know exactly when to buy and when to sale, with such accuracy that in lesser circles you might been accused of insider trading. However your reputation with the business community is impeccable."
300,REMODELLING,Medaka Box Abnormal,"Why be satisfied with just what you were born with when you can make improvements? Through a variety of methods of experimentation, you are able to directly improve the power and efficiency of living beings or inanimate objects by remodelling them. This can be as simple as making an animal not afraid of powerful people or as complex as turning someone into a powerful cyborg or bringing out latent Abnormal or Minus powers within your own brain, given you can use Remodelling on yourself just as easily. There’s not much of a limit on how much you can improve someone but it will take more and more resources the crazier and stronger the changes you are making are."
300,Blacksmith,Generic Xianxia,"Weapons and armour are not useless in this world. Indeed, one of sufficient talent may create arms and armour that can (and usually do) mean the difference between victory and defeat for those who use them. You are able to make equipment with special traits and great power to aid the one who wields and wears them. What the gear is able to do and how strong it is is dependent on your skill, the processes used, and the reagents that go into their creation - for example, if you wanted to make a flaming sword, you would need a source of magical or conceptual fire to infuse into the blade. With sufficient time and skill the stuff you make can decide the fate of nations, planets, and even entire dimensions. Furthermore the arms and armor you can create are nearly half-again as powerful as they would otherwise be, given similar materials, time, and effort in their creation."
400,Marvels of Science,Dragon Ball Z,"Everyone makes such a big show of power levels and being able to destroy cities or planets with enough destructive power, but you know what makes the galaxy keep on spinning and lets those warriors succeed? Technology! You’ve received an understanding and a knack of a lot of the basic ‘space’ technology in this world that aren’t weapons. Spaceships that move at faster than light, able to cross the galaxy in months. Artificial gravity chambers that can be greater or weaker than Earth’s natural gravity. Recovery pods that steadily heal someone back from near-lethal injuries. This is all part of your repertoire, and more. Who knows? You may eventually make wonders nobody has seen before…"
400,Mystical Mechanica,Dragon Ball,"Did you ever wonder how on Earth Bulma Briefs was able to invent a working radar for a mystical set of artifacts left mostly to myth and rumor? Not anymore you don’t. You are able to create devices that are able to detect mystical energies and properties. More than that, you know how to reconcile magical devices and technology, able to combine the two should you have the skills and abilities for either."
400,Fix the body,Rune Factory,"now you know every medical procedure and you have a deep, detailed understanding of all medical equipment and the like. In fact, you are such a pro at using these techniques that you have a set of skills that would put Dr. House or even sci-fi doctors like Bones or Dr. Carson Becket to shame. You no longer need to cut open a person, inject a needle or otherwise tamper with their body, even if you needed to draw blood or perform an organ transplant, and all that you need is to understand the procedure that you wish to preform, have the necessary equipment and items within a twenty foot radius of you and the patient, and to expend a large amount of energy. You can still use methods that require you to open up the body if you don’t have a lot of energy, but not having to add another cut for a person’s body to heal is a very good thing for their healing process, even causing them to recover a little faster than they would normally be able to on their own. Like the previous perk, your knowledge of medical procedures, equipment or anything other piece of medical knowledge not covered by the previous perk updates based off of every jump you’ve been to already, every jump you go to, and for every new discovery made. You can also pioneer new treatments and medical technologies with your insight, although you may need someone to build the equipment for you if you don’t have the required crafting skills."
400,Sentinel Plans,X-Men Evolution,"How on earth did you get these? The prototype isn’t meant to finished until almost a year passes. Regardless these are Bolivar Task’s plans to even out the mutant playing field with a mass producible robot. The sentinel as it is called is capable of many things ranging from firing lasers, flight to the atmosphere, and has a gel substance which will trap most mutants. It seems like there are even plans for something called a Super Sentinel but current technology make its almost impossible to complete. Maybe you’ll be the first to bring it in then."
400,New Age,X-Men Evolution,"There’s autonomous fighting robots, energy weapons, and gene enhancement in this world with only a few of the brightest minds capable of creating such tech. All this and more are now at your grasp as you can not only build these technological marvels but can vastly improve upon them and others at your leisure. You can create any piece of tech from this world from everything mentioned above and so much more. Creating hydra clones that are completely loyal to you, manipulating the x-gene to create mutants and form your own brotherhood, and much more are the tip of the iceberg for you. You are a fountain of ever growing knowledge in all technological fields areas and have the skills to usher in a revolution."
400,Operation Rebirth,X-Men Evolution,This is some dangerous material that you've found. These plans are on the WW2 early gene enhancement that made Captain America. Included are detailed notes on how to create the rebirthing chamber and everything needed to mass create super soldier on the level of MCU Captain America. The notes even contain a way to not make sure humans do not decay on a cellular level like the original Captain America did along with making sure humans also receive a long life and return to their prime years just like mutants do.
400,Master of Biology,Naruto,"Say what you will about Orochimaru. For all his cruelty and evil, you cannot deny his skill in the science of biology. Utilizing near-modern technology, Orochimaru, and later Kabuto, were able to perfectly comprehend and even reproduce others’ abilities. With only a scrap of DNA, he was able to perfectly reproduce Kekkei Genkai, create artificial limbs and organs, and even create near identical clones of the original. You too possess this knowledge and skill able to rival that homicidal maniac in the biological sciences. With time and practice, all it will take is a single cell for you to unlock everything about a being."
400,Prosthesis Production,Akame ga Kill,"You are a master of producing prosthetic limbs and attaching them to people. While more advanced cybernetics may be beyond you, you could produce limbs that a General wouldn't mind. You could even include some special functions into the limbs like a hand that launches out and can be reeled in, or just guns and blades if you prefer simple."
400,Enhancements,Marvel Cinematic Universe Vol. 2,"Sometimes, people need to be better. Maybe the situation is more than they can handle, maybe they're on Death's door and you need to cheat her out of her prize. The point is, they are inadequate right now and need to be better. You will make them better. Modular technology to create sophisticated power armor, powerful cybernetics to enhance their insides... the knowledge to create them is yours to do as you see fit. Your knowledge even encompasses the first steps needed to understand the various serums that are floating around the world, so that one day you can learn to replicate them... or alter them as needed."
400,Ishvala’s Legacy,Full Metal Alchemist,"Alchemy is a science yes, but like every science in creation, it is one that can be used for great destruction. You are one of the people who realizes the great potential for Alchemy to be used on a mass scale to cause destruction, and find yourself able to quickly adapt your alchemy to such pursuits. Even the most basic transmutation of water is enough for you to create bombs assuming you have a spark, and something like simple transmutation of Walls could be used to crush hundreds by simply turning around and deconstructing it, creating a false forward momentum, and essentially making a giant paste maker. Under combat situations you’re great at identifying what’s best for what, All this and more are at your disposal, and while you do need to do some research to modify and maximize the destructive potential of more complex alchemical processes, it’s still far less than it should take."
400,Blood of Gold,Full Metal Alchemist,"You’re one of the few people that have a talent for Alchemy that can almost be described as simply genius. Like the Elric Brothers, you are the kind of Alchemical prodigy that learns and understands Alchemy like it’s a second Nature. You draw perfect transmutation circles, learn alchemical knowledge adults need months for when you were a child, and could even teach yourself basic alchemy through nothing but books and studying. You also gain a similar talent to other scientific fields of study."
400,Spirit Manipulator,Bleach,"In a world where spirit particles are the basis of reality and power, it should be no surprise that the tools to manipulate those particles are most important. While the science to do with the soul itself directly is beyond you yet, your specialty lies in creating tools that manipulate, expand or empower souls and spirit particles. Gigai or objects to contain souls, the Tenshintai that allows rapid Bankai unlocking even in rookie Shinigami, methods to fuse souls and physical objects together, Reiatsu amplifiers and more are just the start. To look into Reishi itself, you know how to create artificial senkaimon or dangai barriers, even weapons that focus and expel spiritual energy on their own. You won’t be changing the nature of a soul or creating new ones from nothing but you are a master at creating technology powered by spiritual energy or souls, as well as devices that can enhance or control them. Much of this knowledge is already available to you but you have the talent to continuously push it to greater heights, with the right resources."
400,Combat Science,Bleach,"There’s a place for science outside of a lab, for those quick enough to put it to proper use. You’re able to easily apply your knowledge and mental skills in combat to stunning effect, depending on what exact scientific disciplines you focused on. Whatever you know, you’re able to figure out how things work in relation to that and how to use that information to destroy. A Reiatsu specialist could analyse spiritual techniques mid combat, being able to dispel them with their bare hands and own energy once they understand the technique. A doctor could do similar to enemy bodies, finding the most vulnerable points and turning normal cuts into crippling injuries. A psychologist could turn this to hostile mind’s, predicting every move an opponent makes after a short period of study. Your knowledge becomes a weapon to wield."
400,Life Sciences,Bleach,"Some believe that each species is but a component of a greater whole, that hybrids who draw on multiple sources of power ascend to a higher dimension of existence. How true that is may be unclear but the concepts behind the mixing of the races pays worthy dividends. You’re well versed in the science of species, from simply biological knowledge to a wide variety of ways to combine or infuse their unique powers. The science behind the various methods involved as well as the technology to make it happen feels natural to you, allowing you to rapidly make progress in the field. You’re able to successfully cross-breed entirely separate species even despite biological incompatibilities. Adding the spiritual nature or make-up of a Hollow into a Shinigami, or vice versa, is a complicated but quite possible process. Analysing and understanding the unique abilities of a newly discovered race is simple, while you even have the potential to find ways to bind unique racial abilities into devices or consumable items. A pill to temporarily hollowify a Shinigami for anti-Quincy combat, perhaps? The potential of life is limitless, when you have such varieties of life to draw on."
400,Life Seems So Much Simpler When You’re Fixing Things,Star Wars: Attack of the Clones,"You’re good at fixing things. Always were. You have the skills of an expert engineer and mechanic, a great familiarity with the technology of this setting and a rapid grasp of that of others should you encounter them. You are capable of repairing anything that is damaged and even upgrading things if you have sufficient time, resources and understanding of what you are tinkering with. This only applies to mechanical and technological things, nor organics, as you’d need surgeons or doctors for that sort of thing. At least you could fix their equipment while they worked on the patient, and your tinkering would leave the tools as good as new if not better."
400,Scholarly Erudite,Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation,"Wanting to help advance a primitive society would be great and fancy, but pointless if you don’t have the necessary knowledge and ability to do it. With this you gain knowledge equivalent to a PhD in Hard Science and all of its branches and an increase in your ability to absorb knowledge like a sponge, where mere months of learning any subjects Hard Science would allow you to reach PhD-level. When you're doing research and development on a subject so long it's halfway related to Hard Science this increases the speed of the advancement and constantly gives you inspiration to finish it. By default you have the knowledge and blueprints of 21st Century Earth allowing you to build them should you have the skills and ability needed to build Earth Technology and even you could still draw inspiration from the knowledge and blueprints to make Magic Tools in this world."
400,Can’t build a Computer,With This Ring,"​But you know more about technology than these medieval peasants. Just as a modern internet nerd wouldn’t be able to reconstruct the internet if dropped in the year A.D. 1000 but would still be able to work out the printing press, hygiene, gunpowder, and other technologies considered basic now but revolutionary a thousand years ago. You now have the kind of basic familiarity with futuristic technology that would allow you, with some time and minor experimentation, to advance Earth technology by about a century in all fields, if only by passing on the basics of what technology does and doesn’t pan out to current scientist. You gain equivalent familiarity with futuristic tech in all future jumps."
400,Counter Technology,Toaruverse,"Some powers or technology have weakness and especially those Esper abilities have one and you made this into an art on your own. You have a preternatural ability to create and invent technology to counter and neutralize any powers or technology that you have encountered or have enough knowledge of and make them powerless and useless. So long the any powers or technology that you want to neutralize is running the same system, using the same element or working in the same principles your counters will work with all of them without problems. The technologies that you built are impossible to reverse-engineer without your consent even using magic or forcefully analyzing it through technology even if they are trillions of years more advance than yours."
400,Super Science,Justice League Unlimited,"Technology is something a lot of people take for granted, unlike you hardly anyone ever stops to think exactly how a pyrokinetic supervillain might be safely contained, or what you could use to reverse the mutation that transformed someone into a giant slim monster, or even what type of defenses a group of superheroes would need to protect their headquarters from killer alien robots. Fortunately your wealth of knowledge on both emerging and modern day technology is such that you can easily come up with scientific solutions to deal with supernatural dangers, such as building power suppressing super prisons, creating chemical concoctions that can rewrite DNA, and constructing powerful energy weapons that can blast alien threats into dust. Your genius mind will also allow you to build weapons, equipment, and biological compounds for yourself in case you decide you want to become a hero or villain. Right now you’re basically as intelligent and ingenuous as Lex Luthor or Gorilla Grodd but there’s nothing stopping you from learning more or increasing your intelligence using technology or genetic engineering. Keep in mind however that while you may be able to upgrade yourself or others using science, there’s nothing preventing your augmentations from failing or causing more harm than good."
400,Professor T.O. Morrow’s Notes,Young Justice,"These notes detail the creation of the “Red” series of androids, including Red Torpedo, Red Inferno, Red Tornado, and Red Volcano, as well as designs for androids that resemble actual people."
400,Crafting,Rising of the Shield Hero,"This is a catch-all perk that includes the various ways to make stuff in this world. You know how to synthesize and compound medicine, how to forge weapons and armor with various system-granted boni and how to enchant them. To make it fair, you start at apprentice level in all of them and have to work at it a bit to reach the highest levels. This perk includes almost all crafting skills, with the sole exception being alchemy."
400,Legacy of the Tuffles,Dragon Ball Z,"There was a race known as the Tuffles, peaceful and technology-oriented people who lived alongside the Saiyans on Planet Plant. However, they were unable to co-exist, and soon a great struggle began. For what reasons, nobody can know, but the Tuffles were wiped to a man and Planet Plant became the world of the Saiyans. However, their secrets were not lost. You are an inheritor of the technology of the Tuffles, the secrets of their technology. For starters, the famous Scouters utilized by the Planet Trade Organization were innovated and mastered by the Tuffles with the ones used by said Organization being militarized copies! Originally they had even further uses, as fully-fledged mobile computers and communicators. Despite their desire to advance technology and peace, however, they were not unarmed. The war between the Saiyans and Tuffles was a hard-fought one, not in the least because the Tuffles were able to bring beam weapons and armor that was capable of going toe-to-toe with the average Saiyan brute(at best, on par with Bardock). Even now many of Frieza’s underlings(though not the creature himself) could be taken down with these weapons. Perhaps with some research and development, they could be even greater?"
600,Countermeasure Development,Bleach,"You do your very best work when time is critical. When it comes to research and development, you’re far more capable when it’s done in immediate response to a new and still dangerous threat or challenge. Instead of planning ahead as you’re supposed to do, you’re able to accomplish incredible feats when the need is great. The higher the stakes of the obstacle if not surpassed or the bigger the danger of the foe that requires countermeasures, the quicker you become. An invading army of Quincies that already toppled your faction once? You could accomplish years of research and production in just a few hours. A next day challenge from a rival scientist? The boost might only be a a ten percent increase in speed. You need a need to get the speed. You’ll also see your efforts greatly increasing in effectiveness when you aim to create things as specific counters, the more so the better. A weapon made to be only effective against a certain species might exhibit half again as much power, whereas a living being created solely to counter a single person’s powers at the cost of everything else? You could affect those of far greater power than you’d normally threaten with your inventions. The bigger the boost you get, the worse your creation tends to be against anything but it’s focus. The faults of making counters."
600,Evolution of the Soul,Bleach,"At the heart of all things is the soul, the holy grail from which the world can be manipulated and controlled. To create and alter the soul, and life in general, could be said to be the highest and most worthy form of science. Your knowledge of alteration and even creation of souls or biological life is a match for the greats, men like Urahara and Kurotsuchi. Provided you have the tools, it is entirely possible for you to craft new beings from spirit particles, designed to your specifications down to the molecular level. Such a project is grand even for you, meaning that lesser modifications or enhancements are quite simple. Giving someone the ability to melt into liquid and reform in a safe location? Rudimentary. Altering the appearance of a Zanpakuto Spirit or potentially even it’s abilities? Possible, enough to offer it as a paid service. New species entirely, such as the Gikon or the Bount, would never be accidental creations but the results of purposeful development in your lab. You’re not all that good at fixing the injured compared to a healer of your level but you’re very much able to make people into terrifyingly powerful bio-spiritual monsters, if they’re not too squeamish. Though beyond you now, the potential lies even for you to discover the secrets of resurrection, resuscitating lost or mostly destroyed souls and lives even hours after they have passed on. Interfering with the cycle in such a form may bring trouble your way but...the science of the soul calls to you and what greater expression can there be? It’s only natural to progress, as your existing mastery is complemented with the sort of incredible talent that got you here in the first place. Who knows what sort of grand spirits or monsters you might create in time."
600,And Where to Find Them,Invincible,"You are beyond all doubt a super genius. You are a creative and intuitive genius that could build futuristic projects, make armours capable of fighting veteran Viltrumites to a standstill and reverse engineer or better alien technologies that are centuries more advanced than you are. You are also quite skilled at cloning technologies and enhancing normal people far beyond their original limits through cybernetics, genetic modification and incredibly sophisticated gear. Without a doubt you are one of the most intelligent individuals in the world, with a knack for the physical and mass production sides of science. While you can go beyond the more physical sciences, it may take you about fifteen years to properly create a time travel device or a device that would allow you to hop between universes.


--- Capstone Boosted (Requires You Have Been Reborn): Screw being one of the smartest beings on the planet you are without a doubt the smartest being on the planet. Master time travel technology, hop between universes before brunch, build incredible FTL drives. You alone could catapult the Earth into being a major player in the galaxy through technological prowess within your lifetime. Screw reverse engineering alien tech, aliens now want to reverse engineer your tech. ---"
600,Full Viltrumite Database,Invincible,"You gain a full Viltrumite Empire database that adapts to be readable on any computer or similar device. Contained in this database is a copy of every piece of information ever developed by the Viltrumites or any of their slave races. This includes space tech, medical knowledge, history, and even the most classified of military secrets. It even holds the new invention of how to cure species specific super plagues, and lesser diseases."
600,Full Coalition Database,Invincible,"You gain a full Coalition of Planets database that adapts to be readable on any computer or similar device. Contained in this database is a copy of every piece of information every developed by the Coalition or any of their member races. This includes space tech, medical knowledge, history, and even the most classified of military secrets. It even holds the knowledge of how to make tailored super-plagues of killing off specific species with zero chance of mutation or the plague affecting an undesired species, in addition to the creation of lesser diseases."
600,Gero’s Blueprints,Dragon Ball Z,"The realization of a dream many thought was impossible. A form of perpetual energy, true and honest. A doctor for the Red Ribbon army, Dr. Gero, has formulated these plans in anticipation of his greatest creations. You’ve got a sneak peek at possibly the greatest revolution in martial arts technology yet, in the form of these blueprints. Detailed in these blueprints is an engine capable of constantly creating a steady flow of ki from within it at no cost, and even some rough sketches of how one would implant these into living matter. There are also the beginning concepts of a biological android of sorts, able to absorb biomatter and convert it into energy. No strong directions on how it could be utilized, but enough to start the process of researching it...maybe even modifying an existing sample..."
600,Lara’s touch,Rune Factory,"forget about just healing people to what they were before, from now on whenever you heal someone, they get better than they were before. Treat a person with a hunchback for a cold and eventually they will no longer have a hunchback problem, help out a girl with thyroid issues that has a sore throat and then the thyroid problem will just heal, and if you treat someone with a torn muscle then their muscles will become super strong over time. As long as you are treating someone for something, the most debilitating issue they have will end up going away as soon as you resolve the problem they are dealing with, and if they don’t have any other issues, they will just get better all around. You can even cure genetic diseases or muscle memory problems with this.

(Protagonist boosted) Well now, every person you treat will become far better than what I described before. Every trait of a person you treat will become better over time, not just their bodies surpassing their limits, but their own skills improving by your treatment. Their bodies will no longer be limited to peak human strength anymore, and eventually they’ll single handedly fight dragons if you care for them, and their minds will get sharper too. If a carpenter breaks their foot and you treat it, not only will all their carpentry skills improve, but also their foot will now gain traits that would help that person with their trade. If a person has multiple skills, this effect is diminished since it is spread out more, but that isn’t saying much when you can get a rank amateur of a swordsman to be able to fight against hordes of goblins and wolves in no time. This only works if you are either treating someone for a problem, but that problem can be physical, mental, emotional, or whatever other kind of problem they have. People have other problems that are more serious than just their bodies, you know? As a side note, people you heal have a tendency to gain new abilities over time, and every time this occurs the power they gain somehow reflects a part of their personality, either currently or previously, although in other cases it may also be related to their personal and family history or heritage in addition to their own personality and everything. Yes, you can use this on yourself, just hurry up and do it already."
600,Mass Production,X-Men Evolution,"A common theme in the world of technological marvels is that they are either left to groups of select people or only one of them is left in existence. To you however these seem like silly limitations to have when one has the potential to bring so much peace and prosperity to the world with these amazing inventions. You happen to have the best ability for the job of ushering in this new age as well. As long as you look closely at something hard enough and do some basic study it  possible to completely understand the inner workings of any technology or object down to the tiniest details. While this works best for technology anything that is an object will do just fine. No object or piece of technology whether it be slightly ahead of modern times to the cosmic magitech of the future can’t be understood by you.
As mentioned above objects and technology in this sense even has a very loose definition as it can range from robots, indestructible metal, swords that grant the power of gods, to even the ultimate of Macguffins. You’ll be able to reverse engineer and mass produce practically anything you want from in a cave with a box of scraps. The objects will always contain their original properties but you can go further beyond that. You can alter the properties, strengthen them, weaken them, make it so only select people can wield them, and much more. With enough creativity and effort you may even create superior items than the original ever was."
600,World’s Greatest Medic Nin,Naruto,"A title given to only one other, the Slug Princess Tsunade herself. Like her, your ability as a medic is legendary. You are able to identify injuries and other ailments with merely a glance and treat conditions others have deemed impossible. For example, your skills in the medical arts is such that you could heal the necrosis caused by the Dead Demon Consuming Seal or the psychological torture inflicted by Tsukuyomi, easily create cures against the poisons of the great Chiyo, and even heal yourself after being cut in half. There is nothing you cannot heal given time. Obviously, this comes with all the medical knowledge one would expect for a medic of your caliber one example of this is your knowledge of the cellular structure and if you were to perform an autopsy you could easily detect damage at the cellular level and immediately tell what could have caused it and what exactly happened. Of course, to keep your title you can’t just coast by on what you know. So now and in all future Jumps, all attempts to increase knowledge relating to medicine and healing will be learnt ten times faster than every other so-called medic."
600,Punkish Genius,One Piece: New World,"Very few can even come close to your level of technological expertise. Effectively putting you five centuries ahead of the current era in terms of expertise, you can easily grasp any technology you come across with research, eventually able to improve upon it. Given enough time, resources, and motivation, you might even be able to create your own Devil Fruits or technological equivalents."
600,Incredibly Craftsmanship,Akame ga Kill,"While the method of creating Teigu is long lost you are able to create things almost at their level, with some research and a couple other skilled people you might even be able to recreate the lost arts that created the Teigu long ago. You also have all the skills to repair Teigu or other incredible items from near destruction."
600,Bring Out Veronica,Marvel Cinematic Universe Vol. 2,"There's always that escalating threat that seems to loom over your head. Always something trying to make sure that you can't rest, lest you be caught unprepared. It's a stressful line of thinking, but that stress will see you through. Looming threats will spark your ingenuity and manufacturing speed tremendously, allowing you to quickly take stock of the situation and use information surrounding said threats to create countermeasures and machines custom-tailored for the situation in a fraction of the time it would normally take. Knowledge of the monster tearing down cities could see you adapting and fielding a custom armor for taking it down, or learning very rapidly from your mistakes in one fight to adapt your technology for the next fight."
600,Superior Biology,Final Fantasy 7 Remake,"You’ve mastered the biological sciences, allowing you to wield biology, chemistry, and genetics to create customized organic beings. Enhancing the natural abilities of living bodies would be childsplay, and isolating unique abilities from powerful entities would only slightly tax your great intellect. Whether you’re cloning super soldiers or deciphering an unknown alien lifeform, Shinra can offer grand opportunities for someone of your talents.


--- Pinnacle Research (Requires Limit Break): Dr. Hojo has met his match! Whether you’re building magic-reliant technology like mako reactors and materia, designing the next macroscale building project, or delving into Shinra’s more eccentric work, you’ll be at the cutting edge of research and development. Shinra’s infrastructure, from it’s superweapons to it’s multi-tiered cities, relies on visionaries like you. See the Notes section for additional details. ---"
600,Magical Engineering,Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation,"As a genius magical engineer, you are proficient and skilled enough to create and make magic-tools. Apart from your specialty of replicating the effects of the Three Main Categories of Magic, you can create Magic Armor that would rival the Fighting Gods Golden Armor, Automatons with human-like intellect, Magical Prosthetic for those who lose their limbs, creating artificial labyrinths and even create Magic Tools to suppress and mitigate the Curse by other people. This also includes crafting complex constructs; this can include but is not limited to, teleportation circles, monster creation, magical traps and flying castles. Should you encounter a problem, with enough time and research you can invent and innovate magical items that would solve it and even a half-hearted attempt would make the item that you made likely able to suppress or mitigate the problem. This also grants you the ability to convert scientific-technology to their magical-technology counterparts and with enough time and research you can continually improve the magical-technology or magic-tools that you have. You also have the ability to reverse-engineer any scientific-technology and magical-technology that got your hands on with enough time and even seeing a scientific-technology and magical-technology in actions would give you an idea how it works. Unless your tools are directly sabotaged or damaged by an outside force or suffers a major natural disaster dropped right on top of them, they’ll last basically operate forever as their self- repair functions and systems flawlessly recover them."
600,Hands of a Healer,Toaruverse,"Like many doctors who gain experience through many trial and errors to heal others and you seem to be dif erent compared to them you did it through sheer talent alone. You gain a preternatural ability to heal practically any injury and sickness even if it is terminal or a genetic defect along those on the brink of death so long their still breathing, preserving a brain and restoring lost limbs. Unlike a certain doctor you can also fix brain or memory along with spiritual related injuries even it’s caused by supernatural or natural means. You can also give someone eternal youth and restore an old person into their prime or fixing someone’s youthful appearance due to eternal youth to an adult along with extending a person’s life-span this even applies to clones, homunculus and those that are artificially made. This also allows you to undo and heal someone from the effects of any curse or supernatural powers no matter how powerful it is and you can also recognize the signs of someone who has been cursed or been af ected by a supernatural powers."
600,The Overachiever,Toaruverse,"To be a leading scientist of a specialized field you need to be more talented than others that they can only look up to you in envy and to be hired in the Academy City you need to be someone like that. You now have the doctorate knowledge and professional practical skills in every branch of science, engineering and arts along with the ability and knowledge to create every technology existed in the Academy City with the specialization of creating Espers with abilities of your choice or leave it to random chance. You also gain a preternatural ability to reverse-engineer any technology that you can get your hands on with enough time but just seeing one in action would give you a rough guess on how it works and what principles it works on with. The greater the gap of the technology that you know to the one you’re trying to reverse-engineer the faster you can analyze and understand it along with the ability to improve existing technology or those that you reverse-engineer thirty years ahead of its time."
600,Man Made World,Fate/Grand Order,"When Nikola Tesla took the secret of lightning to humanity, he spat in the face of Gods and Magicians alike. He had taken the divine and made it mundane for the sake of humanity and that act gave him genuine, immense power. While some may point how the ridiculousness of his science becoming supernatural, one can’t ignore the power that technology gained, especially against the supernatural. You are a true creator in the same vein as Tesla himself now. The technology you create is supernaturally empowered, becoming more and more so the wider spread your technology is in the world you are in and the more your technology advances that world. If you created and spread around the world the secret of electricity, which revolutionised the entire world, you would then be able to create electrical devices that allowed you to do battle with even some of the mightiest Servants in history. Your technology is also imbued with even greater power than normal when used against Divine opponents, as the Gods seem to have an innate aversion to the progress you bring."
600,Religious Insight,Demon King Daimao,"With this you gain immense insight into this world and how God works. While you might not be able to create anything close to the reality warping power that it can AI, androids, mana generators, and most of any tech in this world with a little studying can be reproduced by you."
600,Technomage,Generic Harry Potter Fanfiction,"​There is so much more to magic than what these stuffy inbred old purebloods believe, and you can show them! You are an absolute master of the art of Techno-Magic. Making machines that run on magic, or just magical equivalents of Muggle technology, or something as simple as just making muggle devices work in magical environments is all child’s play for you. You can translate flawlessly between technology and magic, meaning that you can make technological equivalents to all magic you know and magical equivalents to all technology you can make without losing so much as an iota of the effectiveness.


--- Merlin Returned Boosted (Requires Merlin Returned): ​While being good at merging magic and technology is pretty good, being able to merge wildly futuristic technology with highly advanced magic is better. Not only are you highly skilled at magic, but you’re now just as good at the technology side of it, being a certifiable genius among geniuses. Your merged devices now run far superior to either the magic or the tech would run alone, providing dramatically higher effectiveness and utility. In addition, your skills with the more ‘technical’ branches of magic, such as Arithmancy and such cross all imagined levels. Finally, you can achieve even things normally believed impossible through combining spells and technology. You can dispense with the more symbolic and ritualistic components of any and all magic you do, making it entirely as reproducible as technology. Automated spells, potion-making through machines... it’s all possible now. ---"
600,Superior Modern Knowledge,Generic Isekai,"It turns out that a mundane skill you possess meshes incredibly well with this world’s magic, allowing you to cast magic in a different way, subvert the system’s limitations, and push it into directions not otherwise possible. Improvements made to this mundane skill will improve your skill at using magic in this manner, and vice versa. This is partially or fully a product of a unique ability you possess, partially or fully limiting the possibility of others recreating these effects. The magic of future settings can also be tweaked in this manner, allowing for some system integration that wouldn’t normally be possible. However, this is not the same as combining two magic systems together, but rather allowing them to talk to each other."
600,P.R.O.J.E.C.T. JUMPER,All-Star Superman,"There is always the problem of a successor. It may not be enough to leave behind something like a mundane legacy or everyday humans to be the same symbol you were...you need an heir. Or perhaps, you need a team to work with, one that is just as brilliant and specialized as you are. Or maybe you just want some company? The benefits to this perk are twofold. First, you know how to make superpowers or traits carried by your DNA into ‘exogenes’, often contained within a serum. Anyone who ingests this serum receives the full power of the serum you designed, though it will wear off within 24 hours. Secondly, your bioengineering skills are second to none, able to map a genome sequence of any physical trait you possess and any knowledge within your mind, able to make fully-functional biological clones of yourself or others, and give them as much or as little of yourself as you desire, including ‘exogenes’ detailed above, turning them into innate traits. These clones are fully sapient and capable of learning and being their own individuals, but their base personality and purpose is entirely of your own design, should you so wish it. May Jumper live forever."
600,Gadgeteer,Arrowverse,"The world is a dangerous place, with supervillains and rogue metahumans. This is why you have science to help things out. You're able to make stuff that runs on comic book science. Be it shrinking technology, or a cold gun that fires just a few degrees above Absolute Zero. As long you have the resources available and a working concept in your head the sky is the limit. Doesn't mean you'll get it right the first time around."
600,You Built it Out of What?,DC – Blackest Night,"Would you believe the Cosmic Divining Rod, the source of this oncoming disaster, was built out of a mishmash of parts found in a hardware store in some corner on Earth? Whether from your own mastery of engineering or similar mad inspiration, you have a knack for constructing advanced devices out of nothing but common Earth parts and other easy-to-obtain materials. Spaceships made of salvaged parts? Sure. A rod capable of contacting a particular Entity and manipulating emotions? Why not? You can also apply this to other science or engineering you’re capable of, substituting rare materials with common parts, and working with as much durability and effectiveness as the real thing."
600,Lighting the Lantern,DC – Blackest Night,"The Seven Lights on the Emotional Electromagnetic Spectrum – Will, Fear, Hope, Love, Avarice, Rage, and Compassion. Together, these Lights create Life, and are in turn created by Life itself. And outside of them is Death, the emptiness that covets and despises that light. You now know how to construct devices and batteries that are powered by one of these emotions, letting them be powered entirely by the presence of that particular light. In time, you may eventually construct your own Power Rings and Lanterns, though it will take considerable amounts of work and resources to perfect the art on your own. You may learn to tap into the other Lights on your own, though it will take time and trial and error to do so. Finally, you cannot construct or create White through this perk on your own...only if you earn the Entity’s sponsorship can you create or become a White Lantern."
600,Sane Science,Superman: the Animated Series,"Biology, chemistry, engineering, and physics are your tools. Progress is your purpose. With your intellect and enough time and resources there is nothing you can’t accomplish. From cloning to robotics, nanotech to hard light, computer programming to space travel, anything is within your reach. Combined with the Mad Science power you will be a scientific genius able to equal some of the feats of the Kryptonians like intergalactic travel, Artificial Intelligence, and Phantom Zone Generators."
600,Mad Science,Superman: the Animated Series,"They called you crazy! They said what you were doing was unethical! That was just kids play! Now you’ll show them what it means to denounce the greatest scientific genius of our age! Maybe you’ll make a teddy bear mech to destroy their cars, or a Barbie robot to assassinate them in their homes, or create a green soldier army with real assault rifle action! Those fools will rue the day the day they insulted you! Combined with the Sane Science power you will be a scientific genius able to equal some of the feats of the Kryptonians like intergalactic travel, Artificial Intelligence, and Phantom Zone Generators."
600,Genius of your Age,Sword Art Online,"Kayaba Akihiko, all told, is a genius. Not just in computer hardware, although the NerveGear and Medicuboid inventions have revolutionised entertainment and medical treatment for terminal patients, but also in the fields of computer software and code design. He was instrumental in the goal of crafting artificial intelligence, serving both as the creator regarding top-down AI such as Yui and Cardinal and massive inspiration and guide for the bottom-up AI known as Fluctlight. Now, you happen to be just as smart as him. Arevolutionary in electronic hardware and software design, able to recreate his inventions and even improve on them with your own special touches (or perhaps just more time and prior working examples), you possess all the knowledge and skills this one man was known for. Crafting your own virtual worlds is now entirely possible, as is life born of electronics and computer code instead of flesh and blood. The very secrets of the soul are now known to you, Jumper, in the form of Fluctlight creation."
600,Chaotically inventive Genius,To Love-Ru,"There are people who are said to strive in chaos, but you aren’t one of those, no - you are chaos itself. You are capable of inventing things you yourself aren’t always sure are possible and can not only do this in almost no time, but with materials that really shouldn’t be capable of the things you make them do. The only caveat with this is that the more implausible your inventions get, the crazier the form they take. So while the ultimate multi-tool might only end up looking like a wand, a machine that grants people the ability to clone themselves when they sneeze would act more like a flighty animal. Somehow this never actually causes any harm and only minor setbacks. But that isn’t all. This also lets you combine any items you might possess that are of a similar type, the end result gaining the benefits of both (if one of the items is CP-backed, the result is as well). However, getting a stable result takes a lot of time."
800,Tinker Plus,Generic Worm Fanfiction,"You’re not just a Tinker anymore, you’re the Tinker. The PRT rating scale isn’t really set up to handle someone like you because it assumes that Tinkers will have specialties, and you don’t. You are something never seen before; a genuine omni-Tinker, and one of truly amazing capacity.Your aptitude and intuition for all sorts of research, science, engineering, and design is absolutely unbelievable. If a project is even halfway related to any of the “hard sciences” then you can get it done, and do so with a speed and efficiency that makes even experienced Tinkers working within their own specialities look like clumsy beginners. And you can rapidly reverse-engineer other technology given sufficient opportunity to study it, however complex or esoteric it might be. You can even study and analyze exotic and anomalous phenomena, such as cape powers in action, to hopefully gain inspiration for new Tinkertech.You have a volume knob in your head for making your designs either easily reproducible by mundane methods or totally blackboxed vs. any reverse-engineering or anything in between. You can perform what would have required “clean room” levels of precision assembly for mundane engineers with ordinary tools and under rough conditions. Troubleshooting or repairing tech that you already understand is a job you could practically do in your sleep, and anything you build or overhaul is maintenance-optional. With time and practice your Tinker abilities can improve and grow indefinitely, without any upper limit."
