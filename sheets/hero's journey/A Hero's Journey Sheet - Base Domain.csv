0,Access Key,Personal Reality Supplement,"This is a special key which lets you access your Personal Reality and its contents. When inserted into any lock on any door, the door opens to reveal a gateway into your Reality at a predetermined location within it. You are the only person who can take the key from the lock, the gateway remains open as long as the key is in the lock, and if the key is ever lost or stolen you will find it in your pocket a few minutes later. You cannot close the door as long as you are inside the Personal Reality."
0,Environmentally Neutral,Personal Reality Supplement,"By default, the temperature in your Personal Reality is never too hot nor too cold, the air will always smell faintly musty but scent neutral, and the air will always be breathable… even if two different species with different atmospheric requirements are present in it at the same time…. well, as long as both species are there with permission. This won’t protect breathing invaders. Earth Standard Gravity will be maintained in all areas, and the air will be just humid enough. This also ensures that there will be minimal dust build-up over the centuries, though there will be some."
0,Shelving,Personal Reality Supplement,"Basic metal shelves to keep your goods on, the kind you find in industrial big box stores, sized for pallets and numbered for sorting. You’ll get up to as many as will suit your initial space allotment, but if you don’t take all of them, you’ll need to buy more on your own… they sell them at most business supply warehouses, ironically enough."
0,Neutral Lighting,Personal Reality Supplement,"These lights are nothing special, It’s a color-neutral, source neutral ambient lighting system. It’s not really that bright… think early twilight gloom, but if you want better, install it."
50,Additional Keys,Personal Reality Supplement,"Requires: Access Key

This Access Key Upgrade gives you additional keys to your Personal Reality. These keys attune to whomever you give them to and cannot be used by anyone other than them or someone they freely and without duress or coercion of any kind allow to use the key.

50,Key Link,Personal Reality Supplement,"Requires: Access Key

You may also use a recall function to bring up a list of all the doors that have been accessed by any key, thus allowing you to follow a Companion should you so desire."
50,Basic Accommodations,Personal Reality Supplement,"This provides minimalist accommodations for you and each companion. Essentially the same thing you’d get in Basic Training in the military. A barracks with a bunk and a locker and a camp toilet. If you bought Plumbing, this improves to include a communal shower and toilets. In fact, someone need not be a companion for this to work. Anyone you allow into your Personal Reality will be allotted a similar level of basic living quarters, thus allowing you to turn your Personal Reality into a refugee center if you like. If you have Basic Nutrition, this will provide any such guests as you may invite into your Personal Reality with very basic food equal to 1200 Kcal a day, totally vegetarian. This can support up to a maximum of 1 person for every 4 cubic meters of space in your warehouse per day."
50,The Bigger Pool,Personal Reality Supplement,"Requires: The Big Pool

This Big Pool Upgrade adds a lazy river and an entire indoor beach complex to your Aquadome. You know, like they have in Japan.

50,Kit and Kaboodle,Personal Reality Supplement,"Requires: Entertainment Room

​There’s not much purpose in having a sound-stage if you don’t have recording equipment and instruments.

Even has a never ending soda fountain with all the classic American soft drinks: Coke, Pepsi, Dr Pepper, Sprite, and Mountain Dew. Shakes are also available in any flavor you can think of. Your meal will be available as soon you order so no need to wait!"
100,Resource Generator,Toaruverse,Buying materials and resource cost too much time and manpower especially if the materials or recourse that you need are limited or rare. You gain a warehouse full of materials and resource no matter how common to how rare it is that you need to build any technology that you want. It replenishes used materials every twenty-four hours after you took it out the warehouse additionally it records and replenishes any materials that you add in your warehouse.

100,Trophy Room,Young Justice,"Purchasing this adds a room in your warehouse with several cabinets, display cases, and bookshelves for displaying your various collections and items, as well as ample space for anything else you may wish to display, including statues and paintings. In addition, you can choose to purchase this again to gain any one item from each previous Jump that you’ve completed for display purposes only. Attempting to use it for anything besides display purposes will cause that item to disappear in a puff of smoke and become lost forever. If you’d prefer, you can instead choose to receive expertly made artwork that’s related to the setting in some way. Seems to grow slightly with each completed Jump."

It also comes with all the basic wiring hookups, surge protectors, outlets, circuit-breakers, routers, etc you might need… but you’ll probably want to get a qualified electrician in at some point… or pick up a companion who does that kind of thing.

100,Central Control,Personal Reality Supplement,"This optional purchase hooks your Personal Reality up with a Smart Pseudo-Intelligent Computer System that tracks the location and condition of all items brought into the Personal Reality. It will share that information with you or anyone you authorize to use the system. They do not have to have a key and you can set up varying levels of access. Central Control can also recall your companions to the Personal Reality if you have Portal and command it to or they are killed and you’ve set up automated recall. It can open your Personal Reality Door from the inside if you’ve given it permission to do so, but will only admit those it believes will assist you.

It’s fully equipped with all the most useless and pointless ‘therapy’ types, but it requires purchase of Servant Quarters to keep it staffed, otherwise you’ll need to come up with your own solution to get it staffed. This requires Environmental Controls, Water, and Electricity."
100,Greenhouse,Personal Reality Supplement,"A greenhouse in which you can now grow some of your own vegetables and fruits. I hear that strawberries are especially popular this season. It is set up for soil-ponics, hydroponics, or aeroponics and is contained in a separate structure that has a footprint of exactly half your Starting Size in all dimensions.

100,Library of Babel,Campione!,"Perhaps a name too big for what it is, but its usefulness can’t be denied. This is a large library is a collection of myths, legends, fables and records about gods, angels, demons, heroes and other fantastical beings. It also recorded the cults for each and their transition in time and geography.

Master Bedrooms now have one walk-in closet each."

This adds a force-field to the entrances and exits to your Personal Reality. Nothing unauthorized can pass through these force-fields. The field is fully permeable to anything authorized. A Keyholder’s Access cannot be blocked by these fields. Be aware, some enemies might conceivably be able to enter your Personal Reality without technically ‘passing through’ these force-fields. I don’t know, but don’t assume the Force Wall is utterly infallible. It is also potentially possible that you or your companions might bring something seemingly harmless into your Reality that turns out to be some kind of threat."
200,Storage Solutions,Personal Reality Supplement,"Requires: Shelving

Your Personal Reality now has a specialized set of construction automatons which can produce the appropriate storage option for anything you know how to safely contain.

200,A Little Less Basic,Personal Reality Supplement,"Requires: Basic Nutrition

Although not a huge improvement, this raises the basic food allotment to what can be expected for a middle class working family’s budget. You can set it to the kinds of things your home culture might buy… or simply set it to a random sampling of various cultures’ food purchases. Honestly, it’s fascinating seeing what people buy. Check out Hungry Planet if you can. This is effectively 150 dollars US a week per person, adjusted for cost of living and whatnot. You have very limited brand control."
200,Secret Lab,Invincible,"You have a full kitted out secret lab, hidden in a warehouse of your choice. You own this warehouse outright, and for some reason it continuously gets utilities without you ever paying. The most important things that this warehouse comes with is a fantastic high tech lab and refilling resources. It comes equipped to be fully utilizable by a super-genius to make high tech objects. It has refilling resources sufficient to make and maintain about a dozen drones or suits of armour on par with Robot Rex’s. This warehouse can be added into any new jump or world that you travel to and retains all upgrades."
200,Cloning Tubes,Invincible,"A set of two cloning tubes is now yours jumper. So long as you jump in one, and have enough power. A perfect clone of you will jump out of the other, a perfect copy of all of your powers, abilities, and memories, including entering the tube in the first place. Neither you nor your clone will be able to determine who was the originator, so I hope you like working together. For +100 CP you have changed the tubes. Now your clone comes out knowing it’s a clone, subservient to you and only has a copy of the powers you permit it to have. While it is generally subservient, be careful as it isn’t mind control: if you push it too far your clone may snap and try to kill you."
200,Phantom Babel,Medaka Box Abnormal,"The school has been around for quite a while now and undergone more than a few revisions.

This ten storey tall mish-mash of buildings is quite large and filled with countless entertainment systems, hobby tools, creature comforts and other objects to make it into the perfect den for a bored student like yourself. You’ll find a similar structure existing in future worlds at your school or workplace of the time or you can combine it, just once, into your warehouse or existing property."
200,To Those We’ve Lost,DC – Blackest Night,"A gift for those long gone. This is a crypt themed around your chosen color, standing as a monument to those long gone from your journey or life.

200,Underground Shelter,DC – Blackest Night,"Because the apocalypse happens with such alarming regularity in this world, you’ve secured a secret bunker for yourself to hide out in. Located on the planet you start on, it is a safehouse that only opens for you and those you approve it.

Post-jump, this can become a Warehouse attachment or hidden near your starting location if applicable."
200,Castle Jumper,King Arthur,"A castle that you own and follows you from jump to jump. You can select where it appears in every jump, alternatively it can simply attach to your warehouse if you want. You can have it spawn in at anytime if it’s in your warehouse."

200,Extranet,Personal Reality Supplement,"This handy add on connects your Personal Reality with the local Data Networks of the Universe you’re currently in… not only that, but it gets the kind of performance only really ever seen by ISPs at their hubs. If your current Reality of Residence does not have a Data Network, this will connect to the nearest equivalent.. yes, even if that is nothing more than a town gossip and a local library."

200,Arsenal,Personal Reality Supplement,"Placing your battle armor and sword right next to your wedding dress rarely appears all that practical, so with this purchase an armoury gets added to your Personal Reality, into which you can place your battle armors and your weapons, and same for your companions. Content placed into armoury will be sorted for easy access and will be kept in pristine condition, always cleaned when placed back and minor damages automatically repaired, although for bigger types of damages you’ll have to figure out something by yourself.

200,Shinobi Library,Naruto,"An attachment to your warehouse containing rows upon rows of bookshelves, each filled with scrolls. Here, you can find information about numerous techniques but, unlike the Training Journal, instead of learning actual jutsu, this is a compendium of knowledge on stuff like how each hand sign affects energy flow or the best way to form chakra into an element. With this you could easily develop new techniques, although their power and effectiveness will depend on your intelligence and creativity, as well as analyze the already existing ones to improve, counter or do whatever else you might think of. Post-Jump, new sections detailing the magic system of whatever world you find yourself in will be added here. They won’t be as expansive as the Naruto section at first, but they will grow over time and as you do in-setting research."
200,Airport,DC – Blackest Night,"Did you know Hal Jordan’s previous occupation was an Air Force pilot? Whether you were one yourself or found the job interesting, you own a private airport of your own with a pair of supersonic fighters as a bonus.

200,Portal Control Rod,Personal Reality Supplement,"Requires: Portal

This Portal Upgrade gives you a special device very much like a laser pointer that can be summoned instantly into your hand. Instead of having to directly physically touch a surface to open a portal, all you need do is point at any appropriate surface and a portal will open at that location.

300,Detainment,Personal Reality Supplement,"Requires: Security System

This Security System Upgrade ensures that anybody without correct access authorization who attempts to break into your warehouse automatically gets detained in temporary cells, which are accessed through temporary doors in your Entrance Hall. The cells are not fiat-backed to hold everyone. If you’d have to exert yourself to fight someone, then the cells aren’t going to hold them for long, at least without any upgrades. Detainment will attempt to work on anything that manifests anywhere in your warehouse without proper clearance… as well as anything that had proper clearance and is now clearly a threat. A Keyholder cannot be detained"

This Pipes Pipes Pipes Upgrade provides you with all the water you’ll ever need. Every day this massive Hydrocore Tap can generate enough H2O in any natural form to cover Luna in seas 10 meters deep… let’s call it 500,000,000 cubic kilometers of water. Of course, throughput is going to be a bitch, so the Hydrocore comes with a Global targeting computer and up to a million hoses each capable of pumping out 500 cubic kilometers of water a day… or 5.8 million tons of water a second… or 29 times the flow rate of the Amazon River… each. If this isn’t enough water for you, you might be obsessed, or making a star."
300,Adaptive Inactive Storage,Personal Reality Supplement,"Requires: Additional Space

This Starting Space Upgrade means that your Warehouse will automatically gain a special customized storage space for anything you purchase with CP… But what’s so good about that? This storage space is inactive. That means anything in it isn’t out in a Host Reality, it isn’t out in your Personal Reality. The stuff cannot be interacted with in any way except to pull it out of Inactive Storage… if you have the space to do so. So if it doesn’t fit inside some part of your Personal Reality that can be used for storage, then that item is only accessible if you bring it out of inactive storage into a Host Reality. This allows you to decide if something like your personal continent will be subjected to whatever nastiness is in a given Host Reality. Anything can be put into inactive storage between jumps."
300,Opulent Housing,Personal Reality Supplement,"Requires: Housing Complex

This Housing Complex Upgrade does everything that Luxury does and does it better. Rooms are frankly too big, fixtures and furniture are all unique handcrafted pieces, the walls have murals, the floor mosaics… everything isn’t just top of the line, it passed that miles back. High Ceilings, beautiful feng shui, custom decor for each room… huge closets. Additional Rooms generated every three persons. All Bedrooms are now Master Bedrooms and come with ensuite saunas, day spas, and personal office with reading nook. If you have an incremental purchase scheme, you do not get a refund if you bought Upscale Housing or Luxury Housing first. Opulent does not require Upscale or Luxury to be bought first."

This also comes with automated arms that can assist in disassembling and reassembling complex forms of technology that are of your design.

300,Field of Heart-Shaped Herbs,Marvel Cinematic Universe Vol. 2,"Out of all the Wakandan secrets that lie within the borders of the reclusive city, this one is the most potent secret of them all. It is also the most dangerous. It is a small but potent field, its soil infused with radiation from the ancient Vibranium meteor when it fell to such an extent that it would affect any plant life growing within it, like these herbs. The herbs are taken and ground up so that it may be imbibed, and when the imbiber is buried under a light covering they will find themselves on a spiritual journey to talk with their ancestors... and then rise a greater warrior. Strength and speed that reaches the lower levels of superhuman, durability to survive explosions with minor injuries. Perfect coordination and balance with agility that far outstrips Olympic athletes. It would not be too farfetched to say that the results of this herb match even the ones derived from the Super Soldier formula that made Captain America... and now you have a small field of these plants. Be very careful. After you leave, this can either be a property or a Warehouse Attachment."
300,Vegapunk Laboratory,One Piece: New World,"A hidden, back-up laboratory of the genius Vegapunk much like the one Franky found. The inventions and schematics are centuries ahead of even the modern world, and come with the tools and materials required to make many of these wondrous machines. Post-Jump, you can have this as either a Warehouse attachment, or can import it into the world anywhere you want."
300,Simulation Room,World Seed,"One important device any spaceship captain should have in their arsenal, or any militaristic leader at all, for that matter, is a simulation room. With them, it is possible to train against enemy forces all day long in a nigh-infinite amount of configurations and situations, an invaluable preparation for whenever the real thing happens, at least as long as you have accumulated enough data of what it is you need to fight and analyze their strengths and weaknesses. But it is exactly this problem that the simulation room you have in your possession has solved. As long as you have experienced something personally, you simply need to link your mind with the simulation device, and it will quickly and accurately extrapolate from that information and manage to create a simulation of it that is at least 99.9% accurate, even if you only looked at an enemy fleet and never actually saw its combat capabilities, only growing more accurate as you gain more information. Any amount of people can use this room, its dimensions expanding and contracting as needed and new spots popping up in the same way, and this extrapolation can be used on anyone connecting their mind to it. By default, this is a warehouse attachment, but you can place it wherever you want in the real world"
300,Portal,Personal Reality Supplement,"This optional extra removes the need for use of Access Key, instead allowing you to open a rectangular or circular portal that leads into your Personal Reality on any flat surface big enough to encompass the portal. You can open the portal on any surface you are in contact with or that your vehicle is in contact with… or that your vehicle will be in contact with in less than 5 seconds and within 100 meters if you don’t open the portal. The portal can be any size between 8 square meters and 80 square meters. The portal opens to the same place in your Personal Reality as the Door does and you may still use your Access Key if you want to open a door larger or smaller than the limits of the Portal. Any Companion with a copy of the key may also open such a portal. These portals open at their lowest size instantly and expand to their maximum size over 10 seconds. These portals cannot be closed while you are inside your Personal Reality. Portals will slowly close over a period of 3 minutes if you leave them open and move more than 10 meters from one without closing it yourself, as long as you are outside your Personal Reality. This closure effect can be disabled, but you can’t open a portal if another is open."
300,Absolute Territory,Arifureta Shokugyou de Sekai Saikyou,"Pocked dimensions get all the heat these days, and of course I would offer you something at the stature. This realm is separate from the normal world and about the same size, you can access to it at will and store things in there without trouble. You can personalize it to suit your tastes, though the default look is a copy of the Divine Realm in which Ehit resides. The downside is that you can’t intervene too directly with other realms while in there, you will need to get out if you want to strike someone with a bolt of lightning."
300,Magma World,Battle Through the Heavens,"Underneath the surface of the world is an entirely different one. A world of magma and heat, that would incinerate all but the most hardy of life. Attached to your warehouse is an entrance. Well, hole might be a more apt descriptor. By going down this hole you will enter into the cavernous magma world. This world stretches for hundreds of kilometers, filled with little but roaring pillars of lava that crash into the ceiling and hot fiery energy which permeates the air. This would be an ideal place to gather fiery qi or store plants that require such heats. Fire poison can be extracted from the magma."
300,Sage Pill Plantation,The God of Highschool,"A small plantation of Sage Trees, a few dozen in total, is now in a location of your choice, owned by you. These trees produce their fruit once every few years and the fruit tastes quite horrible. But they’re not eaten for please. Rather, eating a Sage Pill provides a significant increase in the user’s life energy, increasing their overall power for each pill they eat. Eventually, these pills might not provide a noticeable boost but unless you’re punching your way through mountains, they’ll be a handy snack. Normally these would be fatal for humans to eat without some sacred animal tears to go along with it but these trees will produce fruit safe for consumption by any being, not just demons."
350,Treasure Chamber,The Mummy Trilogy,"A large, empty room has been added to your warehouse. While it’s empty right now, when you put valuables inside it the room will expand to hold them, and will even display them in a way that is aesthetically pleasing to you. You can have it loaded with a huge amount of treasure for free -- gold coins, statues, gems, ornate swords, and other valuables."
400,Uchiha Jutsu Archive,Generic Naruto Fanfiction,"The Uchiha really were quite shameless in their day, always going around copying everybody else’s lifetimes of hard work just by using their special eyes. Well, at least you get to benefit from that. 

Somehow you’ve obtained a copy of the complete Uchiha Jutsu Archive, everything that several generations of dedicated intellectual property thieves could copy from every other ninja village, clan and small ninja child in the Elemental Nations. Pretty much any and every technique, seal, chemical formula, pill/cookie recipe or random dance routine that one Uchiha liked can be found here. Any knowledge that wasn’t limited to literally just one person, family, or bloodline or was based purely on sealless chakra manipulation (such as the Rasengan) and thus uncopyable by the Sharingan is in the archive, all of them laid out in such a clear and concise format that any half-competent ninja could teach himself just by reading the scroll. 

This archive will update with a complete set of spells, fighting styles, etc, etc. from any setting that you have visited and will visit in the future. Provided it could be generously called public, or even semi-private, knowledge it will be in here. Only the most super-secret, utterly private techniques are missing; after all, even the best copyright pirates can’t get everything. This place is comprehensively warded against thievery, somewhat ironically, and it would take a team of top-tier infiltration specialists to even attempt to breach it. Of course its best defense is that, at least at jump start, no one knows you have it. Post jump you can have this become a warehouse attachment."
400,Improved Regulation,Personal Reality Supplement,"Requires: Environmentally Neutral

Unhappy with the limits of Environmental Controls? This gives you a much greater range. How much greater? You can control the ambient noise level to generate sounds anywhere between -10 decibels and 160 decibels. Temperature-wise, you can range from absolute zero to 15,000 degrees. Gravity-wise, you can completely negate gravity or ramp it up to what is common on the surface of a neutron star. Humidity? Anywhere from 0% to 150%. That’s not a very dense fog, that’s active rainfall… though this last requires Pipes Pipes Pipes or a very large amount of water in your Personal Reality. As for airflow, you can have F-5 scale winds if you really want them. Hell, go nuts, have the kind of winds only seen in gas giants, the kinds that make an F-5 tornado seem placid. Think Coriolis Winds in excess of 800 kilometers an hour. This eliminates atmospheric dust."
400,POWER OVERWHELMING,Personal Reality Supplement,"Requires: Who’s Got the Powa

Not enough power? Okay, this Who’s Got the Powa Upgrade means that your Personal Reality is now hooked up to the full power of a Sol-Class Star encased in a Dyson Sphere. Congratulations, you’re now a Kardashev II civilization. If this isn’t enough power, you need an intervention."
400,The Garage,Superman: the Animated Series,"A massive garage that would seem to fit better as a parking garage than a private one. This building is furnished with fully automated robotic mechanics that can fix almost anything, provided it is an automobile. While the garage starts with a massive variety of cars that you might expect a high power CEO to own, it also has a special function: expansion. Whenever you acquire a vehicle the size of a semi-truck or smaller the garage with grow an additional parking spot to accommodate it. More importantly, any vehicle that has a space in the garage and is irreparably damaged or destroyed will return, good as new, to its space after one week. After the jump it will become a warehouse attachment."
400,Research Laboratory,Naruto,"A hidden facility equipped with all the tools and instruments you might need to perform experiments and research of dubious ethics in relative safety. This laboratory has cells for containing test subjects and soon-to-be test subjects alike, along with chambers and arenas for any kind of stress tests you might want to put them through. It comes fully and freshly stocked with the basic tools and consumables you’d need for biological experiments, including some fresh tissue samples from an assortment of common ninjas. Nothing all that rare, certainly no Kekkei Genkai samples, but it’s a start. Notably, any biological samples you acquire and store within this laboratory become functionally infinite. So long as you don’t withdraw too much of any given sample at once, you’ll find that you always have more to draw upon for your experiments."
400,A Whole Arsenal,DCEU,"A warehouse filled with all kinds of military gear, in a secret location of your choice. Somehow you’ve managed to gather enough guns, explosives, armour and vehicles to outfit a small army without leaving any trace of gathering such things. You’ve got everything here short of a nuclear bomb, including two attack helicopters and a real live combat tank. Anything taken from here will be replaced a month after it has been destroyed, lost or fully used up and the warehouse itself will appear in future worlds, updating its’ armoury to be appropriate for the current world."
400,Mystical Realm,Rise of the Guardians,"You are the proud owner of some sort of mystical realm. A grand workshop located at the north pole, filled to the brim with supplies. A palace that is also a library, filled with memories. An underground oasis, accessible only through your Warehouse or by teleportation. A lair deep beneath the earth with prison cages that hang over a yawning abyss. Something else. It’s up to you."
400,Ancient Gear Workshop,Duel Monsters - Shadow Realm,"This workshop is filled with spare metal mechanical parts here and there, nothing more advanced than you’d expect out of a carpenter’s shed but surprisingly high tech for this world. It’ll refill with scrap and spare parts every so often. It of course has plenty of tools with which to work whatever mechanical magic you want to here. It attaches to your Warehouse once you leave this jump."
400,Ritual Hall,Generic Harry Potter Fanfiction Jump,"​This is a Grand Ritual Hall. Runes in beautiful script cover most of the floor, there are multiple sacrificial altars, a rack full of the finest ritual equipment in the world, and a closet full of Ritual Garb, designed and made to never interfere with anything you might be doing. In this ritual hall you have, and will always have, everything you need to perform any ritual you might need to do. Specific inks to paint runes, special knives, up to and including a few animals that you can sacrifice and perfect replication of any astronomical events of mystic significance. Blood rituals, power-enhancers, sealing, unsealing, any kind of ritual that has ever been mentioned in a Harry Potter fanfiction can be performed here, and as long as you do your part right, it will not fail due to any external factors."
400,DESCEND INTO THE MAZE,Medaka Box Abnormal,"Beneath a property that you own, or beneath your warehouse, is now a massive facility, numbering in at least a dozen floors and filled with the most advanced scientific equipment that this world has to offer. The door to this facility is only open able to those with superhuman strength that exceeds any construction vehicle or those with the luck of a powerful Abnormal. The facility is staffed with many loyal and intelligent researchers, along with a basic but experienced guard roster, but there are no Abnormals present aside from yourself."
400,Hourglass of the Dragon’s,Tate no Yuusha no Nariagari,The level-cap of this world is one of the truly inconvenient things that exist. You now have a dragon hourglass stored inside of your warehouse. It allows anyone who uses it to class-up to the suitable class for them that would double all of their stats/attributes. Unlike the original this dragon hourglass can perform a limit-breaking class-up that gives a suitable class that doubles all of their stats/attributes of the one performing it. The best part is that your legendary/vassal weapon is connected to the dragon hourglass allowing you to perform a class-up and limit-breaking ceremony without entering the warehouse.
400,Elemental Training Hall,Battle Through the Heavens,"Using Dou Qi skills and controlling your attributed elements, while related, are still separate. This is a library filled with training guides and techniques based on the use of an element of your choice. The techniques within here will slowly increase in strength up to Di level as your own strength and familiarity with the techniques increase. Finish training in all of them and you may eventually end up unparalleled in your manipulation of your element, residing at the very peak of this world in terms of pure manipulation."
400,Secret Base,With This Ring,"​You receive a secret lair of comparable size to Mt. Justice or Challenger Mt. You may choose between a subterranean lair, a hollow mountain, an island, or simply plonk your lair in the middle of an empty field somewhere. It contains room and furnishings for fifty people, as well as specialized equipment for small scale New God manufacturing. Its location is hidden by obscurity rather than magic, though it contains enough automated defenses to deter a regiment of US troops without their armor complement. You may upgrade the defenses or ward the base as you see fit. This base may be added to your Warehouse as an extension or be inserted into future jumps as you wish."
400,Sanctum,With This Ring,"​Your choice of a manor, extra-dimensional castle, or small island. It is warded extensively against magical assault and spying, contains enough furnishings for a family of residents and multiple different workshops equipped for research, ritual casting, alchemy, artificing, or enchanting. It is bound to you, recognizing only you as its master. After this jump it can be added as an extension to your warehouse or placed in each new jump as you desire."
400,Warehouse of Crafting Materials,Tate no Yuusha no Nariagari,"The blood and soul of any merchant and without this even a skilled blacksmith or alchemist can’t craft anything. This gives you raw materials of existing monster parts, ores, herbs etc... for crafting from Raphtalia’ World and Glass' World. The qualities of the materials are excellent and the quantity is enough for you to craft basic medicines, potions and equipment in hundreds per day or late-game-top-tier equipment once a month. The basic/common materials are generated within a day and advanced/rare materials are generated within a week. All of this is directly stored inside the warehouse in a separate room with it being organized and categorized perfectly in chest/box and warehouse shelves. Any new materials need to be stored inside the chest or warehouse to be remembered and generated later."
400,Healing Fountain,Fate/Extra,"A small fountain will be added to your Warehouse. Drinking from this fountain will fully restore your health and all sources of energy, but the fountain's energy will need an hour or so to recharge before it can restore you once again. Drinking during this time will just give you a mouthful of clean water."
400,Workshop,Generic Naruto Fanfiction,"Going out and beating people up is not all there is to being a ninja, certainly not in the myriad worlds of Naruto fanfiction. There’s a lot of space for less... outdoorsy activities, such as seal-creation, weapons-forging, and so on. That’s where this beautiful place comes in! It’s the ultimate workshop, perfect for just about anything you may care to work at. It has a huge supply of papers and inks for your fuuinjutsu needs, herbs and plants for preparing poisons or medicines, a forge and metal supplies for smithing, timber for woodwork, and so on, for anything else you may care to work on. The quantities of the materials generated depend on their rarity and value. Something like ordinary paper and ink, or plain steel and wood, would never run out no matter how much you use, while things like paper from special, chakra-enriched trees would be in far shorter supply. But no matter how rare something might be, so long as it’s not absolutely unique, you can expect to find it here, and in sufficient quantities to work with. At the absolute slowest, for materials of priceless rarity like high quality chakra-storing gemstones or metals, you could expect a supply to regenerate bi-yearly, and proportionately lesser times for less rare substances. In future worlds this workshop updates with materials and ingredients of the respective settings, with the same replenishment rules remaining in effect."
400,Gravity Chamber,Dragon Ball Z,"It’s a large room with a fairly complicated-looking computer in the middle, with red tiles stretching across the floor. In this room, which can be located in your Warehouse as an attachment or an addition to an estate you own, you may tap keys on the computer to adjust the gravity in the room. It can be several hundred times Earth’s normal gravity at maximum, enabling you to train yourself in extremely grueling conditions...or kill yourself immediately, if you get too cocky. Do be careful."
400,A Strange Cave,Chronicle,"Oh my, what have you found here? A hole somewhere beyond the reach of curious eyes, it leads to a rather large cave several hundred feet in the earth, where you’ll find a crystal structure the size of a car. Strangely enough, it reacts to the touch of any life forms by changing its colour and emitting complex radio waves, resulting in a moderately large nosebleed and nausea for humans. But those occurrences are just side effects. The actual purpose of the crystal is to give other people the Power perk, with all that entails. After this jump the cave becomes a warehouse attachment, and you may make it appear anywhere you want in future jumps. The crystal will also work on any other lifeforms you might meet in your travels."
500,Portable Replicator,Star Trek – TNG + DS9,"Much smaller and lighter than a regular replicator, but still just as capable. This device is able to fit inside of a backpack and can be powered of large amounts of solar energy and raw matter. It can create pretty much any known physical object, but it cannot replicate dangerous or complex things like antimatter or living organisms."
600,Room of Requirement,Generic Harry Potter Fanfiction Jump,"Well now, talk about finds! This is a copy of the Hogwarts Room of Requirements, except this one belongs solely to you! It has a pseudo-intelligence of sorts, that reads your intentions perfectly and does its best to provide you with whatever you ask. Being a product of high level magic, it can create any number of whatever mundane objects you desire for purposes of training or even use, although they don’t last long outside the room.In addition, it can mimic any location you wish it to, and do so perfectly, up to and including any fine details and magic. But it won’t be a real-time mimicry, but rather a recreation based on your thoughts. It makes the perfect training room, sex dungeon, or really mostly anything you want it to be.Also, the room provides time acceleration, meaning more time passes inside than outside the room. You don’t age in this time unless you choose to, but any physical improvements made to your body are retained all the same. The room requires a cooldown period to recharge its ‘acceleration’ depending on how high you put the setting, to the scale that using it constantly at the max setting of 24 to 1 for one outside week drains it completely and takes 48 hours to recharge fully."
600,Ancient Library Labyrinth,Tate no Yuusha no Nariagari,"Even if your family is not powerful or influential they manage to acquire rare books around the world. These libraries exist in your family’s mansion that contains a complete knowledge about the world. From information about the waves, detailed analyses of monsters, history of the world and countries, functions of the legendary/vassal weapons, books of magic, martial arts styles etc... The library is large when you’re looking for certain information that exists in the library you would feel the exact location of the book. After this jump you would gain a copy of this library in your warehouse. It would update and record the information and knowledge of the new setting in every Jump."
600,Pill Gathering Realm,Battle Through the Heavens,"This is a realm created by a Dou Sheng alchemist in ancient times. Stretching on for unknown miles, this realm is filled with different extremely rare and wonderful spiritual plants, as well as strong, though mindless, magical beasts. Furthermore, among those beasts are several kinds that love to hoard ingredients. Should you find one of their nests, you would obtain a great windfall. Due to an unsteadiness in the creation of this realm, one can only stay within it for several weeks before they must leave and allow it to recover. Strangely each time you enter, it seems to have changed, and restocked."
600,Personal Workspace,Final Fantasy 7 Remake,"What good is a scientist without a lab? This facility comes furnished with equipment for any scientific discipline you’re knowledgeable in. Raw supplies will be provided to you by local vendors, while a standing contract with your Benefactor will keep rarer ingredients in stock. This lab is sizable, can be personalized, and is a match for any university laboratory or corporate research facility in the world. Now it’s time for science! In future jumps, you may import this labspace into your Warehouse, or attach it to any property you own.


--- Hojo’s Playground (Requires Limit Break): Forget a match, your lab is now far and away the most advanced place of science in the world. Your benefactor has rewarded your genius with an extended line of credit, increasing the amount of resources you can procure tenfold. They’ll even provide you with a small army of followers, should you need lab assistants or... test subjects. You also gain a powerful computer database, preloaded with the collective scientific knowledge of every world you visit. With the knowledge and resources now at your disposal, you could lead the world into a golden age of discovery! ---"
600,Gem of Cyttorak,X-Men Evolution,"This rather unique and humongous gem is a one of kind item that endlessly emits a special type of radiation that has a strange effect on those with mutant powers. In future jumps this’ll mean someone with mutated genetics and innate/biological abilities. When a person bathes in the radiation from the gem for a second, the powers they possess are permanently evolved and enhanced into something many times better than before. The gem does this evolution by using various means such as removing any weaknesses of powers, expanding and dramatically strengthening the powers, and possibly even granting new powers as well. The last one is done with a case by case basis however as not everyone’s power will be enhanced in that way. Should this valuable gem be destroyed another one will reappear in your warehouse a day later."
600,Hyperbolic Time Chamber,Dragon Ball Z,"A copy of the chamber on Kami’s lookout, now accessible from your Warehouse. Leads you to an empty void with a single platform around the entrance containing food and a working washroom. A day outside of the chamber is a year inside of it, and the time you spend within it only counts for the time outside in terms of jump duration. That said, merely entering the chamber is a challenge...the white void strains the sanity of a human mind, the gravity being several times the intensity of Earth. Merely being able to walk into the Chamber and last for an hour is a task of no small magnitude. However, should you be able to survive it, you will be able to train effectively in a very short amount of outside time."
600,IS Lab,Infinite Stratos,"A state of the art and top secret laboratory cross manufactorum of your very own. While this can certainly accomplish a wide variety of uses as either a lab or a customisable factory to mass produce machines, it’s true worth lies in the detailed Infinite Stratos blueprints and instructions that come already inserted into the computers and machines within the lab. This makes this possibly the only place outside of Tabane’s personal lab capable of producing IS, as well as one of the very few places that can effectively alter or customise them."
600,Mountain Retreat,Highschool DxD,"Someone has booked you for a stay at a nearby mountainside resort, Jumper. For the rest of your life, even! This is a comfortable retreat out in the wilderness with a fully stocked hotel and several outdoor camping spots. It even comes with an onsen. Funny enough, when you train or exercise here, you’ll find your gains from such will increase to at least twice their normal rate - three times if you really push yourself. And it has an onsen. Because of course it does. It can comfortable keep all of your companions fed and relaxed, and inactive ones can hang out here. Post-jump, this can turn into a Warehouse attachment or be dropped somewhere safe in a world you’re in."
600,Time-Accelerated Spirit Garden,Generic Xianxia,"This is a Warehouse attachment that is a separate room with a door connecting the two. Inside this room is fifty square acres of sunny, watered, fertile farmland that is tended by helpful nature spirits. The atmosphere in the room is filled with spiritual energy making it conducive to the raising of plantlife, increasing its nutritional value tenfold. Mundane plants grown here that are consumed have a small chance of increasing their spiritual power slightly. While this benefit is almost infinitesimally negligible to cultivators, it is possible that non-cultivators who eat it will become aware of the spiritual energy as it flows into them, allowing them to begin to learn how to cultivate. As long as the door is open and/or if there is a sapient being inside the room, time moves the same inside as it does outside. When closed with nobody inside, however, time in the room moves at a rate of one thousand years inside to one day outside. In short, the plants in here will grow very old, very fast. Rare ingredients that would take thousands of years to mature or millions to grow can now be cultivated within a reasonable timeframe."
600,Training Area,Generic Naruto Fanfiction,"If there is anything that Naruto fanfiction has taught people it’s that training, good, rigorous training, is not just important but absolutely vital. That’s where this comes in. This is a pocket dimension, attached to your Warehouse. In this, you can have training and fights that are... well, whatever you want. That is, you can control each and every aspect of the inside of this area. You can have any opponent, whether a real person in this world or a custom one, with specific skills you want at specific levels, and any number of them. In addition, you can control the size of the arena as well as the terrain, the gravity, atmosphere, the circumstances for the fight and indeed, everything else short of the passage of time. You can have battles on the scale that carved out the Valley of the End, or however much greater you want, with as many opponents, of however high or low power levels and/or skills, as you want. In addition, you impose whatever restrictions you want on some or all combatants involved, including yourself. This includes, but is not limited to editing yours and your companions’ memories to forget that this is an arena in the first place, letting you undergo the experience of proper battle while inside. Of course, if you just want to train in peace, you can do that too, as this area generates endless supplies of everything required, from natural chakra to practice shurikens to ink and paper. Related to this, all injuries, up to and including mental and spiritual ones, and even death, are undone perfectly upon leaving this arena. All mental and physical trauma involved is erased along with any residual memory modifications placed at the start, all ammunition and consumables expended are replenished, etc., leaving behind only the benefits, all of which are preserved perfectly. Death inside does not count as death, not for you and not for your companions. Finally, while you can’t change them while inside, the conditions you can set include being automatically kicked out upon a certain time period passing, or a certain event occurring, anything. The arena will also automatically eject you if you “die” or get into a state you cannot possibly recover from. Now there are certain limitations in place. First of all, while getting ideas from your opponent’s skill and techniques to improve your own is one thing, no abilities or power that let you copy or steal skills or abilities work here, and second, nothing generated in this world can leave this arena. All your improvements must come from within you, to put it simply. If you take a drawback that seals your warehouse you may instead opt to have a doorway leading to this place attached to a physical in-jump property."
100,Digital Database,Personal Reality Supplement,"Requires: Library

This Library Upgrade automatically digitizes every text that enters your Personal Reality, even if it’s already in digital format, and does so safely (spells will contain the correct symbols but not power, memetic or conceptual texts will be rendered harmless). The entire contents of your Library are now completely searchable, indexed, and intelligently cross-referenced, allowing far easier use and accessibility."
100,Alchemist’s Laboratory,Overlord,"A fully fitted and supplied alchemist’s laboratory ready for your use. It comes with the highest quality supplies and equipment required to make magical potions, allowing you to make potions to emulate the effect of any spell you know that could be reasonably made into a potion via alchemy (assuming you know alchemy, at least). The equipment will automatically upgrade itself relative to your own personal skill level, so the more skilled you are the better it will be to reflect that. Reagents for common, rare, and higher quality potions restock themselves automatically on a regular basis."
100,Pipes Pipes Pipes,Personal Reality Supplement,"Purchasing this provides your Warehouse with enough plumbing fixtures to turn the entire volume of your Personal Reality into one massive pool… or anything below that. This provides clean running water with any reasonably common additives you like (chlorine, glacial milk, fluoride), but does not provide a limitless supply, nor does it heat the water. By default, the amount of water this system can produce per day is 1 billion liters or one megatonne of water or a block of water 100 meters on a side, and the default temperature of this water is 25 degrees Celsius. It can support any civilian infrastructure on the same scale as Mexico City or Tokyo. Comes only with the basic hookups. You’ll need a plumber to do the actual piping. We hear Mario’s very good. Bathrooms not included. Purchasing this supplies all facilities inside your Personal Reality with water feeds, and if you’ve Got the Powa, it will supply hot and cold running water as well. These pipes include sewage and storm drain systems, vanishing waste as effectively as they create water. Anything that is not biological waste, loose grime, or liquid waste will be shunted into a special processing venue where you’ll have to dispose of it (such as toys, trash, large trees, etc). This venue will be somewhere discreet in your reality behind a door labeled “Authorized Pipes Personnel Only”. The stuff will be cleaned of biological contaminants for you. The entire Pipe system is self-cleaning and self-maintaining, guaranteed free of vermin and bad odors."
100,Starting Collection,Personal Reality Supplement,"Requires: Library

This Library Upgrade gets you pre-stocked with books you would expect to find in an average town and school library, with a nice spread of books on a variety of topics and in a language of your choice. This comes with 10,000 individual fiction titles and three times that number non-fiction titles covering all normal real-world subjects. Most of the books will be best sellers or classics (80%) and will cover the last hundred and fifty years or so. The other 20% will be more esoteric works, but seldom anything particularly obscure or rare."
100,Basic Nutrition,Personal Reality Supplement,"This option provides a basic (if minimalist) food delivery for you and all companions (metered for a normal human dietary requirement). This delivery comes once a week and is the kind of thing you’d buy on a very strict budget; Ramen, Peanut Butter, Generic Cereal, Dry Beans, Eggs, Tofu, Fresh Common Fruits & Veggies, Canned Fruits & Veggies, Dry Pasta, Salt, Pepper, Milk, Bottled Water, Rice, Flour, Butter, Barley, etc. (Note, you cannot sell the Salt or Pepper for money.) Essentially the purchasing power of 50 dollars US a week per person."
100,Hot Springs,Re: Monsters,"This small collection of natural hot springs is perfect for relaxation, easing physical pains and helping to unwind mental stresses. By default, these hot springs are unfurnished and simply out in the wilderness. In future jumps this hot spring (and onsen if applicable) can be a warehouse attachment or imported into the world in a location of your choosing."
200,Automated Weapons Security System,Personal Reality Supplement,"Requires: Security System
Requires Central Control

This Security System Upgrade adds automated weapon security systems to your Personal Reality. Useful for keeping invading enemy forces from easily overwhelming systems or personnel. You’ll need to supply the weapons, but this will provide ammo and targeting systems for the shooting and maintenance and repairs for between the shootings These weapons will not fire on a Keyholder… but can fire very very very close to a Keyholder."
200,Garage,Personal Reality Supplement,"A garage for you to place into your vehicles, automatically adjusting to meet with their requirements. Any sort of land, air, or space based personal vehicles (up to the size of 12 meters long, 6 meters wide, and 4 meters tall). The Garage has room for up to 40 such vehicles, with every increase in your Starting Size also increasing the number of slots by a factor of 5. The Garage comes with its own entry room and a set of adaptors which can turn garage doors (even non-automatic ones) into Personal Reality Portals. These adaptors respond to the presence of a Key Holder and open the way into the parking area. If you also have the Pond, this installs a Marina which comes with special adaptors for boat slots. Boat slots do not worry about the draft or masts of the boats you part in them, only the distance from the waterline to the top of the primary hull. Each size increase of the total Personal Reality also increases the maximum size of a vehicle by a factor of 5 (60x30x20, 300x150x100, 1500x750x500, etc.)"
300,The Big Garage,Personal Reality Supplement,"Have some vehicles that don’t exactly fit in the Garage? Say… The Enterprise? Light of Terra? Dahak? A Galacti World Ship? The Big Garage can handle it. You start with 4 dry docks, each large enough to house, well, anything. Each additional Starting Size increment doubles the number of dry docks."
200,The Big Pool,Personal Reality Supplement,"Requires Pipes Pipes Pipes

This requires Pipes Pipes Pipes. An Olympic Water Park (diving pool, swimming pools, warm-up pools, etc) is added to your Personal Reality. The pools upgrade with all the newest tech if you have Central Control. "
200,Tashi Station,Personal Reality Supplement,"Requires: Who’s Got the Powa

Did someone say ‘Power Converters’? This Upgrade to Who’s Got the Powa means that your generator now pumps out any esoteric energy type your Personal Reality’s equipment or city-like objects might need by converting some of its electricity into whatever, be that mana, anbaric power, natural gas, ether, the power of love, or the power of rock and roll. How, you ask? FIAT, BITCHES! (insert Air-Guitar Solo Here)"
200,Housing Complex,Personal Reality Supplement,"Having space for all your Companions and Followers can be tricky. Sure, you could pay to have some houses built, but with this option you, and each Companion and every child of yours or of a Companion gains their own bedroom. Every three bedrooms gain a full bathroom and your bedroom has a master bath. It’s not luxurious by any means, but this house (or houses) have 1 kitchen & dining room, 2 half baths, two general purpose rooms (offices, living rooms, game rooms), a few small closets, and a pantry for every 6 people. Individual rooms tailor themselves to the general likes of the individual and come with basic but not quality furniture. Companions who decide to share a room can cause their rooms to merge to create a larger room, but each basic room defaults to 4 meters by 5 meters by 3 meters. Non-bedrooms are on the small side but large enough to function. Floors are basic linoleum and walls are basic low grade paint. Appliances and fixtures are pretty bare bones and the walls are little more than plywood and wood frame. The bedrooms don’t have closets. Any other Personal Reality Extensions can be made part of the Housing Complex or kept separated. Each house must have a kitchen. That’s the rule. No more houses than total number of kitchens. A house may, of course, have more than one kitchen."
200,Entertainment Room,Personal Reality Supplement,"Keeping yourself busy isn’t always easy, and sometimes you just want to relax and listen to some music or watch a movie. This is for you. A six room complex is added to your Personal Reality. Each room is an almost perfect movie theatre, music room, video-gaming theatre, sound stage, or miniature live theatre. There are 24 comfortable chairs in each (the exact level of luxury depends on your housing level). A popcorn and generic candy vendor and off-brand soda dispenser (self-service) are provided at the basic, but will upgrade to name-brands with any housing upgrade."
200,Environmental Controls,Personal Reality Supplement,"Requires: Environmentally Neutral

Not only does this allow you to control the temperature inside your Personal Reality… it allows you to change the temperature, humidity, ambient noise, gravity, and airflow to any and all parts of your Personal Reality independently. Want a one meter cube of freezing cold nothingness surrounded on all sides by temperatures that would be fitting for soup? Go for it. This can change the gravity from 0.00001 gees all the way up to 8 gees, the temperature anywhere from -40 °C all the way up to 180 °C. Comes with a tablet that has all the system controls you’ll need and a big ol’ box of wireless thermostats. The direction of gravity can be easily manipulated in whole or part of your Reality. So if you want to build a Labyrinth style room with doors and stairs going every-which-way, feel free. This virtually eliminates dust build up (1,000th normal)"
200,Game Room,Personal Reality Supplement,"So much free time, so little to do. This room is the answer to that. Not only is it equipped with 6 networked PCs customized for gaming circa the year you came from, it has up to 12 real world gaming consoles and any gaming network required to connect them. The furniture matches your general housing level but will always be at least comfy beanbags. In addition to the PCs and Consoles, you’ll also get a dozen real world arcade cabinets (up to four of the same machine may be counted as a single machine for multiplayer games), a pool table, a billiards table, a two lane bowling alley, a darts set up, and up to six other game specific tables, including table top board games and RPGs. The room comes with a mini-fridge and microwave. And a room for games wouldn’t be very much use without games, so you may select 250 games from the real world to have up to 6 copies each of, and you gain 6 copies of any one new game (all DLC or expansions included) every month. Free of charge. No magical or other-wise powered games included. If you also have the Entertainment Room the two can be combined to turn the rooms into personal gaming rooms using the Game Room equipment."
200,A Lot Less Basic,Personal Reality Supplement,"Requires: Basic Nutrition

This A Little Less Basic Upgrade gives you specific cultural (rural France in the 1880s, Moscow under the communists, biblical israel, etc.) and general purchasing breakdown (X% grains, Y% junk food, Z% fresh fruits, etc.) plus raises the food budget to 300 US dollars purchasing power per person per week. Each week you can change what kind of food delivery you get and where it comes from, including any culture you’ve jumped into along your travels. This still does not give you direct control of what you get, just a general batch of stuff that fits your requirements. You can specify brands you’d like, however."
200,Jam Breeding Device,Duel Monsters - Shadow Realm,"This curious device was found at the bottom of a Labyrinth, and created numerous issues for the surrounding farm folk. Simply put, it produces mindless but loyal(to the one owning the device) slimes that can float through the air. They’re acidic to the touch, but insubstantial. However, the Breeding Device can produce them constantly at a rate of about 1 a minute. This can build up, and even the insubstantial Jams can cause heroes a problem in such a vast number. Be very wary of how long you leave this unattended…"
200,VOWP Cellular Service,Personal Reality Supplement,"Requires: Extranet

This Extranet upgrade hooks your Personal Reality up with Voice Over Warehouse Protocol Cellular Service, and provides you with fiat backed cellphones that are guaranteed to connect to the Personal Reality or to any other cell phone on the service… regardless of what Reality those phones are connected to at the current moment. You gain a vending machine that vends Nokia dumb-phones, iPhones up to 8, and Galaxy S7 smartphones, plus any cell phone (or similar) you supply it with a copy of, as well as SIM cards or the equivalent for other phones. These phones will work just fine no matter where you find yourself, but be careful as they’re just as durable as normal ones and will need to be replaced should they get damaged or destroyed. They must be charged as normal, but get extremely good battery life."
200,Luxury Housing,Personal Reality Supplement,"Requires: Housing Complex

This Housing Complex Upgrade does everything that Upscale Housing does and does it better; high end luxury rugs, lush carpets, parquet wood floors, wood paneled walls, high end furniture, rooms are twice as large as the base, and the cut off for additional rooms is lowered to every four persons. Appliances and Fixtures are very nice and stylish now and the walls are quite soundproof. Closests are now a respectable size. Bedrooms get their own bathrooms. Every kitchen spawns a new Master Bedroom which is now a personal suite (sitting room, bedroom, two walk-in closets each, bathroom with separate whirlpool bath and shower.) New rooms can create separate houses or add on to the main house."
600,Dungeon,Re: Monster,"A private Dungeon of your very own, accessible from your Warehouse or any other property you own. You can scale it between ‘suitable for a total novice to cut their teeth on’ and ‘a serious challenge for you and your party at your full power’ at will, and the Dungeon will generate entirely new layouts or load old ones as you prefer, pushing the difficulty slowly up as you descend. For the extra 300cp, your Dungeon is upgraded to an Age of Gods Dungeon, with all that entails, though it will only count as such when the difficulty is appropriately high. Dying in this dungeon only results in you being ejected and the dungeon being unavailable to you (or anyone else that died within) for 24 "
400,Hallowed Earth,Personal Reality Supplement,"Every inch of your Personal Reality is sanctified. By who? Well... you, I guess. All those within (besides you) are subject to a constant minor blessing that persists for up to a day after leaving that makes them a little luckier and healthier. In D&D terms, a general +1 Morale bonus. Those who worship you as divine may show up here when they die or see visions of you in this, your place of power... though these visions may be merely metaphors for what lies within if they lack the mental or cultural framework to understand."
50,Natural Lighting,Personal Reality Supplement,"Requires: Neutral Lighting

Completely natural lighting that looks and feels and functions as good as the real thing (sun, moon, or starlight). Comes with sectional dimmer switches and can be sourceless or from any lamplike object you bring into the Personal Reality. Purchasing this upgrades all sources of lighting you bring in, even things like TVs and Computer Monitors to be perfectly safe and naturally adjusting for minimal eye-strain. This replaces Neutral Lighting and does not require any power source."
50,Expanded Collection,Personal Reality Supplement,"Requires: Library

The Library Upgrade specializes your library in a specific way, adding books on specific topics, things that you would expect in specialized university libraries. Each purchase of this comes with 15,000 specific titles in the language of your choice (even if such works have never been published in your selected language). The more specific a topic you pick, the more specific these books will be. So picking Biology as a topic will get you books ranging from everything on animals, plants, anatomy, genetics, microbiology and ecology, while picking entomology as a topic will give you extremely detailed books about different types of insects, their physiology, and so on. The subject must be one from the real world, but do remember that there are thousands and thousands of real world books on the occult, so it’s not unlikely you can find what you like."
50,Shooting Range,Personal Reality Supplement,"This adds a high tech shooting range to your Personal Reality so that you and your companions can practice your marksmanship in a safe environment. The Shooting Range comes with a fully functional but harmless copy of any weapon you’re familiar with. They have the exact same weight, balance, and accuracy. These duplicates are colored like nerf weapons so you don’t get them confused if you accidentally take them out of the Range. If you also have the Underside or Arena, you automatically get a self-reconfiguring laser-tag arena. If you have both you automatically get an urban combat training course, and if you have the Woods, you get an outdoor shooting range / wilderness combat training ground. If you have Weather Control, you can change the terrain and climate inside this zone. Said zones’ size depends on how much space you have. If you’re running with only Starting Size, your Laser-Tag Arenas are going to be 40 m on a side and 2 stories tall. Every size expansion applies to the arenas as well, doubling the height and multiplying the footprint by x100 (400 m x 400 m x 4 stories, 4 km x 4 km x 8 stories, 40 km x 40 km by 16 stories, and so on.)"
50,Seeds and Seedlings,Personal Reality Supplement,"Requires: Greenhouse

This Greenhouse Upgrade provides you with a package once a year that contains a random assortment of seeds and seedlings for you to plant in your Greenhouse. Has enough seeds and seedlings to fill half of your Greenhouse and they’re chosen (and labeled) from all the Host Realities you’ve visited, though all are relatively normal plants for their Host Reality."
50,Bath and Body Works,Personal Reality Supplement,"Requires: Wellness Centre

What’s a Wellness Centre without a Spa and Roman Baths? This Upgrade to the above facility provides you with a huge sauna (with or without large burly Russians or Finns to beat you with leaves) including a large snowdrift and ice pond to jump into after your steam, as well as a dozen different Roman-style, Japanese-Style, and Chinese-Style bathing pools of all different temperatures to relax in. Guaranteed to be cleaner than clean and extremely foggy."
200,Fuelling Station,Personal Reality Supplement,"Requires: Garage

This Garage Upgrade has two levels. The first provides all your vehicles with any standard mundane fuel and costs 50 WP. The second level, which costs an additional 150 WP, will fuel any vehicle you have no matter how esoteric the fuel might be, although said fuel can be used only to fuel your vehicles. Attempts to use it for other means may have terrible consequences."
600,Lighthouse,DC – Blackest Night,"A proper station for you and your Corps of choice. This is a large, technologically- advanced base with a smaller version of the Central Battery of your color resting as both a power source and a recharge station for any Rings. It comes fully stocked with living quarters and enough supplies to sustain about twenty people comfortably, twice as many if you ration and share. It also comes with an arsenal of advanced weaponry, including laser cannons and stun rods, as well as durable and advanced armor to use in place of a Ring. Finally, stored in the basement is a forge containing the tools necessary to create your own Power Rings and Lantern Batteries...though it doesn’t come with instructions. The forge can also be used to create other emotion-powered technology. You may set this base down near a property you own, near where the jump begins (if applicable), or as a Warehouse attachment. Inactive companions may inhabit the Lighthouse, if you wish."
600,"Crafting Materials, Supplies, and Tools",Overlord,"You have the good fortune of possessing a regenerating stock of high end crafting materials suitable across all fields of crafting, alongside the tools and workshop space in order to make something with them (you must supply the actual skill on your own however). Materials for low-end magical items (ie: Greater tier or below, as explained at the beginning of the item section) regularly resupply such that you could probably churn out hundreds of such items a day. Legacy tier materials would allow you to craft a few things a day. Materials for equipment at the Relic tier resupply often enough you could probably make a single relic tier item a day. Your materials also include enough for a single Legendary tier piece of equipment every two weeks or so, and the materials for a single piece of Divine Tier equipment would likely take at least two months. However, there is nothing preventing you from stockpiling the materials, as they’ll keep resupplying themselves even if not used up."
800,An Intervention,Personal Reality Supplement,"Requires: Who’s Got the Powa

Well, okay. you asked for it. We need to have a talk about how you’re using this much energy. Congratulations. with this Upgrade to Power Overwhelming, your warehouse now produces as much raw energy as you need to run all your devices… yes, even if that’s a billion UWS (Universe Watts Per Second… or as much energy as an entire Universe contains per second). Seriously though, you need help."
0,Security System,Personal Reality Supplement,"Anybody coming in and out of your Personal Reality is now checked for any authorization you've given them to access it; and should anything about said authorization (or a lack of it) raise any flags in the system, then you will receive a warning about it. This allows you to define just what sorts of authorization different individuals can have to access your Personality Reality, anything from No Access through Temporary Access and Limited Access to Unlimited Access is possible. All this does is notify you. It does not stop them on its own. A Keyholder’s Access cannot be limited by the Security System. Only hand out Keys to those you trust implicitly."
