1,,Free,"Green Orbs, Blue Orbs",Anima Ark Of Sinners,Benevolence,Something you will notice is that when defeated enemies will drop orbs of either a green or blue color. The green orbs restore your ki while the blue orbs restore your health. Of course stronger enemies will drop more orbs of each type. Post-jump enemies will keep dropping these orbs though the green orbs will also refill any kind of supernatural energy source you possess.
2,,Free,Fall Damage Immunity,Anima Ark Of Sinners,Benevolence,"There is no falling damage in this game and so now you will no longer suffer damage from falling from great heights, always landing on your feet like a cat."
3,,Free,Spiritual Body,Warhammer 40K: The Warp ,Benevolence,"Entities formed of the Warp are psychic and spiritual in nature, being composed of psychic energy. Warp entities like Daemons are known to have ways of cheating death, where being ‘killed’ in the Materium only scatters their essence back into the Sea of Souls to reform. Mundane attacks and supernatural abilities that target your physical body will no longer kill you; your body only losing cohesion and soul reforming your physical form after damage or destruction, with the added benefit of being unaging. For the duration of this jump, you will be transported back to the Warp to reform after being discorporated in the Materium. Your physical parameters and supernatural abilities grow at the same rate alongside the strength and power of your soul."
4,,Free,Titan’s Duty,Changeling The Dreaming,Benevolence,"The guardians and warriors of the Kithain, they stand as paragons of martial might. Not only is it difficult to dissuade you away from your devotion to a duty or cause, but so long as you keep your oaths you will find your strength and durability increased beyond mortal limits. Your Frailty, however, is that if you break an oath, you will be weakened severely until you fulfill a different oath."
5,,Free,Where The Heart Is,Changeling The Dreaming,Benevolence,"The busybodies of Kithain society, your Birthrights reflect that very well. Not only can you accomplish any given task in a third of the time needed if unobserved, but you are great at working out the relationships in a community, puzzling out any group’s social dynamics. Your Frailty, however, is that you just cannot ignore someone in need."
6,,Free,Enchanting Dreams,Changeling The Dreaming,Benevolence,"It is often expedient, useful, or necessary for one of the Kithain to bring mortals or other supernaturals into their world and sometimes for less-than-savory reasons. This process is called Enchantment, and one which you have an unusual proficiency in. Not only will this allow them to interact with the Dreaming and chimerical objects as the Kithain do, but they will also be more susceptible to cantrips, overcoming the resistance that Banality would naturally give them. These enchanted individuals can range from trusted servants, to enemies forced to dance to the changeling’s strings, to just a bit of entertainment. Unlike most, you won’t need to redo these infusions of Glamour, as they only fade away when you want them to."
7,,Free,There Are No Strings On Me,Mobius Final Fantasy,Benevolence,"In Palamecia, the world itself has ways of controlling or otherwise bringing it's inhabitants to heel when they act out of place. People with enough willpower however, are immune to Palamecia's attempts at controlling them, or at least they're close enough to immune that the difference is negligible at best. With this Perk you'll no longer have to worry about Palamecia controlling your actions or forcing you to act against your will, although it won't protect you from corrupting influences or others tricking you into doing what they want. Post Jump, if you were to go to a Jump where the World itself has a will of its own, you will find that it cannot exert its will upon you or force you to do anything against your will."
8,,Free,Divine Focus,Final Fantasy Type-0,Benevolence,"The L'Cie are created by one of the four crystals and assigned a Focus. As you are a newcomer to Orience, the crystal is slightly bewildered by your presence - your focus becomes a matter of your own conclusion, though the consequences of adapting a focus is clear. The effects of the focus can be ""turned off"", but while active they drain on your magic reserves constantly.

Suzaku: With a thought, your body blazes with a searing heat, eroding away at the area around you. Those you exempt from its effect are left unharmed, but the heat forms a protective cloak around you that also deflects magic - with a small drain in your magical reserves over time. By dedicating your reserves to this cloak of heat, you can increase its intensity to the point that it ignites objects in range.

Byakko: Your life force is increased dramatically, and the rate at which your body heals from injury increases. But by expending your magical reserves, you can quickly regenerate body parts which you have recently lost, and wounds close up in matter of seconds.

Genbu: Your physical presence is reinforced even further, as a shell of magic seems to shield you. Physical blows lose their edge, and ranged projectiles slow down as they come within range. Magic also seems to have a reduced effect. By increasing the amount of energy you contribute towards this magic armor, its effective range grows slightly.

Souryu: The power of the dragon courses through you, making your body move swifter as air itself seems to part before your presence. Water springs up from the ground where you step if you dedicate more energy to this, and plant life seems to grow vibrantly in your presence."
9,,Free,Immortality,Final Fantasy Type-0,Benevolence,"L'Cie are inherently immortal, retaining the same appearance they had from the moment of becoming a L'Cie. Unfortunately, it does nothing for their memories, thereby making amnesia all but an eventuality unless other measures are taken."
10,,Free,Soul Parry,Stranger Of Paradise - Final Fantasy Origins,Benevolence,"By holding your hand in front of you, you are capable of blocking all attacks and damage from that direction when timed correctly but still reduces the damage taken if you miss the timing. If you block a projectile or spell in this way, you can « hold » on to it and then send it back to the attacker or at anyone else you want."
11,,Free,Clear mind,Final Fantasy XVI,Benevolence,"As you might expect, a berserk Eikon is extremely problematic which is why you have this perk. From now on, you can always keep a clear mind regardless of what you are actually feeling or what manipulations are done to you. This also grants you the capability to calm down berserk entities like Eikons or failing that, dial down the damage you deal them enough that they won’t die."
12,,Free,World Eater,The Elder Scrolls: Dovah,Benevolence,"Alduin, the World Eater. Believed by the Nords to bring about the end of the current world, and to usher in the new one. And yet, it would be a bit difficult to bring about this new world if they were slain by some lucky mortals, or some treacherous Dovah. Much like Alduin, you can only be killed by the hands of a chosen few. During your stay in Mundus, those capable of killing you would be Dovahkiins, while in other worlds it would be a specific, yet naturally occurring, demographic of people."
13,,Free,Hidden Existence,Mushoku Tensei ~ Jobless Reincarnation ~,Benevolence,"There are times that you don’t want others to find you or even find that you exist. This grants you protection similar to the Dragon God's Armlet but more as this prevents someone from using their ability to see your past, present and future, reading your mind, intruding on your dream or summoning your soul to their realm. While the range of this protection only reaches up to the immediate surroundings, you can grant this protection to someone else, like a trusted companion, family or even your spouse. By default this is inherited by your child and their descendants."
14,,Free,Eternal Soul ,Elder Scrolls Online – The Vestige,Benevolence,"You’re a Vestige now, so your soul is... peculiar. More similar to the Animus of Daedra, your soul can now persist even if your physical body is destroyed. In practice, it just lingers on the spot until something or someone does something to restore your body. This has two effects: first, you don’t chainfail just because you ‘died’. As long as you reconstruct your body using whatever means before the end of the Jump, your death doesn’t count. Secondly, you can, in fact, reconstruct your body even if destroyed, and you’re technically ageless. The most common way is the use of a charged Soul Gem from an ally, and there are a lot of shrines that seem to have the ability to do just that around, pretty much instantly. In future Jumps, you’ll have to find a way: if by some chance you are killed right before the end of the Jump, you have one hour to reform your body before the Chainfail hits. Also, be careful about soul magic, Jumper. Soul Trap is not as common as in later Eras, but it still exists."
15,,Free,How Can You Cure Me When I’m Not Sick? ,Marvel: Age of Krakoa,Benevolence,"How downright offensive is it for people to say that treatments that suppress or remove Mutant powers are a cure? As if being born different was a disease? As if having powers was a curse? As if they’re doing you a favor by forcibly stripping you of your natural abilities? And inevitably when a well-meaning but ignorant busybody makes one of these, it immediately gets appropriated by either anti-Mutant hate groups as a terror weapon or used by governments to institute an attempted mass depowering of all mutants. And then there are the people who want to slap a power-dampening collar on you and drag you off to “serve your country” or be “re-educated for your own good,” or the people who feel entitled to tinker around with your genes or harvest your organs. As insurance against those people, you have blanket immunity to any and every attempt to remove, alter, lessen, damage, destroy, copy, steal, or replicate your supernatural abilities, DNA, or other aspects of your abilities or being without your freely given and fully informed consent. Nor are any biological samples obtained from you, be it a stray hair or an entire organ, viable for any purpose other than the ones you donated to explicitly under the same circumstances."
16,,Free,So... You Like to Party?,Marvel: Age of Krakoa,Benevolence,"So this is awkward but, to address another elephant in the room... Mutants, superhumans in this world in general if we’re being honest, have always had a rather liberal attitude toward sexuality and related topics and Krakoa has decided to lean into that as part of creating their own national identity. Just in case you are interested in such things, here’s a blanket immunity to any and all sexually and socially transmitted infections, perfect control over your own fertility and any related bodily functions, and a guarantee of perfect cleanliness and comfort for all involved parties when you are with a romantic or sexual partner. Everything else is up to you."
17,,Free,Resurrection ,The Destiny Universe,Benevolence,"Although they are more well known for their resurrection abilities, Ghosts are in fact capable of healing their Guardians of any wound ro abnormality, until they reach complete physical health. As long as the Guardian is still alive, they can lose limbs, perforate organs, be poisoned, take on radiation, all that and more - and their Ghost can heal them of these afflictions. There appear to be no true limits to this ability, although Ghosts are noted as experiencing ‘difficulty’ healing their Exo Guardians, with some finding it easier just to allow the Guardian to die and start from scratch. As previously mentioned, this even extends to outright death, as Ghosts are capable of resurrecting their Guardians without issue. The only major limitation of their resurrection is that, unless the body is completely disintegrated, they require a corpse to work with - it was this understanding that led to many Iron Lords hiding the corpses of Warlords from their Ghosts, until such a time as they believed they could trust these Ghosts to operate in the best interests of Mankind. "
18,,Free,Truth From Fantasy,Fate/Faerie Britain,Benevolence,"Here is a simple fact: this world is not supposed to exist. It was a pruned timeline, and the entire Fae Era was only a simulation created by the Tree of Fantasy. It was Morgan who turned this from a simulation to reality, but everything with an origin in the time of the Tree of Fantasy—including every single human being that isn’t a changeling—is ultimately just a simulation interacting with reality as though it was real, and would be unable to survive outside of a Lostbelt or Lost World without a massive overturn to the very nature of Proper Human History.

You defy this paradigm. It doesn’t matter if you’re just a simulation or an imitation of reality; even if you left your simulation, you’d be able to survive just fine on the outside. Even if you were a fantasy, you could exist in the real world. Being a member of a Lostbelt is in no way harmful or risky for you; even if the Lostbelt were to collapse, you’d be left alive where it once stood none the worse for wear.

With an act of will, you can gift a copy of this perk to other people to ensure that they too would be able to live in an environment where they would otherwise be dismissed as a fantasy."
19,,Free,Paladin,Final Fantasy XI,Benevolence,"Paladins specialize in close-range combat, just like Warriors. However, through long hours of spiritual training, paladins have acquired the ability to cast White Magic spells, making them even more valuable on the battlefield. Through the use of Shield Mastery and the ability to wear heavy armor, Paladin fills the role of protector of those around them."
20,,Free,Whitemage,Final Fantasy XI,Benevolence,"Armed with the most efficient recovery spells, White Mages can ensure a party's survival in the most dire of situations casting their magic to heal wounds, recover from disabilities and debuffs and allow those who fight on the front lines to continue fighting."
21,,Free,Remorseless,Final Fantasy IX,Benevolence,"You are the star and for whom the spotlight shines. Your confidence in your role is absolute, and your resolution to put yourself forward is an undeniable force. Concepts of morality are for those who have to consider the feelings and stance of others, insignificant to you. Concepts of morale, even more laughable when nothing can faze you save for your own choices.

Those insignificant masses should pray they do not attempt to subject you to silly mind control spells as they are want to do – or they’ll see the attempt bounce right back at them, mentally wounding them."
22,,Free,Percentage System,Super Smash Bros. Brawl,Benevolence,"You have gained access to the percentage system featured in the Super Smash Bros. series. You begin at 0%. Each time you would take damage, your percentage instead increases by an amount proportional to the amount of damage you would have taken. The higher the percentage you currently possess, the more you are knocked back by enemy attacks. At higher percentages, you can easily be sent flying by an attack. At 999.9% damage, you are at risk of ‘Sudden Death’. A clean hit that would cause your percentage to increase further will instead kill you. You always know what percentage you are currently at, and if you are involved in combat with others who possess this perk (or, during this jump only, those who would normally have a percentage), be they friend or foe, you are aware of what percentage they are at as well.

Outside of combat, your percentage will slowly tick down. Any sort of regeneration or healing you possess can also be used to lower the number, both in and out of combat.

You are by no means immortal below 999.9% with just this perk. Drowning, suffocation, starvation, transmogrification, and more are all ways by which you could die below this percentage.

You may toggle this perk on and off as you like. However, should you have a percentage above 0%, you will incur equivalent injuries on your body when turning this perk off, and turning this perk on whilst possessing injuries will automatically raise your percentage to an equivalent number.

Cannot be Taken With Giant Hand or Subspace Being"
23,,Free,Mana as Lifeblood,The Voynich Hotel,Benevolence,"With mana drawn into the body and the mind kept clear of corrupting influences, the third lesson all Witches learn is to keep their bodies alive and well. For while mana itself is enough to keep age at bay, wounds are another matter entirely. By seeming that mana into muscles, into the blood, and even into bones a Witch can grant themselves a body that can live through even the most heinous of wounds. Mind you, continuing to live is not the same thing as being proof against injury. There are certain, unknown and buried, ways of killing even a trained Witch. And grevious wounds, such as the loss of an eye, will not be healed by mana alone. Do not allow your gift to become a curse through carelessness."
24,,Free,Immortal Body,The Voynich Hotel,Benevolence,"Witches are not born with a full talent for manipulating a primal force of this world that most are completely ignorant of. They are taught over years, sometimes even decades, by a Mother Witch to cultivate the sensitivity to magic that makes them what they are. One of the first lessons is learning how to draw magic inside of the body to keep it close at hand. A side effect of infusing oneself in this manner is a slowing of the aging process to practically a standstill. Witches have been known to be millenia old without appearing any older than when they first learned the craft. Unless they desire a little more mature beauty."
25,,Free,Demigod,God of War,Benevolence,"You are a child of the gods, half mortal and half divine. Your godly parent is up to you, as are the abilities you gain from them. In general, you will be far stronger, faster, and much more durable than any other mortal could ever become, especially if you were to train in earnest, potentially allowing you to reach the heights of Hercules before he became the God of Strength."
26,,Free,Synchronicity        ,Hellblazer,Benevolence,"You gain the talent of Synchronicity, meaning you have a tendency to show up at the right place, make it in the nick of time, or to have just the item you need. This can be enhanced with practice or with mana."
27,,Free,Golden Age ,Records of Ragnarok Gauntlet (Humans),Benevolence,"You were one of many human souls, pulled from the afterlife to fight for your species fate. As such, to not have you fight as a weak and frail elder, you will be restored to the prime of your life, where you were at your peak. After this Jump you can keep this Perk to always remain in the prime of your life. This wont make you immortal or even ageless (you could still be forced to age) but you wont age naturally past your peak."
28,,Free,Pure of Heart,Out of Context: Disney Princess Supplement,Benevolence,"You are able to Toggle and project an aura of good and light that will cause those who touch it to feel a hope and love as wide as your power. This can also be set so that any type of scan done on you to determine any crimes, taboos or immoral acts including dark magic come up negative."
29,,Free,Halo ,Blue Archive,Benevolence,"You have a halo floating over your head, an embodiment of the Mystic imbued in every student in Kivotos. This halo increases your physical durability, with bullets only causing some stinging, rather than penetrating the body. Even taking a tank shot to the face will only knock you unconscious for a short period of time. You and the halo are not immune to harm though, as dedicated effort or powerful enough equipment can overcome the halo’s durability. Every halo has a unique design, and they vanish whenever you are asleep or otherwise unconscious."
30,,Free,Required Secondary Powers ,Invincible,Benevolence,"You have the secondary powers inherent to a superhero, when you move extremely fast the air around you does not catch on fire, when you lift a building it does not crumble around the area where you picked it up. Essentially you can operate under ‘comic book physics’, although you are able to turn this perk off and on at will."
31,,Free,Witch of Fire,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Benevolence,"It was in Fire that you were all given souls, that which granted you clarity of mind and life, so it should come as no surprise that those connected to the Lord Soul of Life are deeply connected to fire itself. As one of the children of the Witch of Izalith you are naturally immune to the effects of heat, as well as possessing a resistance towards fire of all kinds."
32,,Free,Skeletal Being,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Benevolence,"The dead who do not rest, those who follow the Gravelord Nito into this new age of disparity are different from the rest of those touched by Flame in many ways, most prominently in their lacking need. Like them, you require only your bones to be intact in order for your continued survival, needing no sustenance or sleep to stay in peak condition. This can manifest as you appearing particularly gaunt, or fully removing your flesh in order to assume a skeletal appearance."
33,,Free,Percentage System,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Benevolence,"You have gained access to the percentage system featured in the Super Smash Bros. series. You begin at 0%. Each time you would take damage, your percentage instead increases by an amount proportional to the amount of damage you would have taken. The higher the percentage you currently possess, the more you are knocked back by enemy attacks. At higher percentages, you can easily be sent flying by an attack. At 999.9% damage, you are at risk of ‘Sudden Death’. A clean hit that would cause your percentage to increase further will instead kill you.

34,,Free,Just What Hits the Spot ,Super Dragon Sword,Benevolence,"Every morning, you can draw a hero’s feast from seemingly nowhere, which when partaken of, grants all who feast upon it the Vigorous, Courage, Hope, Determined, and Focused (increased attack accuracy) status effects for the rest of the day. In addition, they may once be auto-Revived from death while under the effects of this feast.

Requires Tasty(Super Dragon Sword), Monster Rustler (Super Dragon Sword), Better than New(Super Dragon Sword), Wrestler(Super Dragon Sword) and Blood and Bone(Super Dragon Sword) to Purchase"
35,,Free,The Darkest Hour,Super Dragon Sword,Benevolence,"They say you can rest when you’re dead, but that’s still a bit too early for you. When you are lethally wounded, you can choose to fight for an additional minute after dying, during which your Critical Blood and Blood Soaked Knuckles are active at maximum capacity. If you are to be given a Revival spell before the minute is up, you will collapse stabilized but unconscious once the Darkest Hour ends.

Requires Bloodlust(Super Dragon Sword), Blood-soaked Knuckles(Super Dragon Sword), My Soul is Armor(Super Dragon Sword), Critical Blood(Super Dragon Sword) and Two Graves(Super Dragon Sword) to Purchase"
36,,Free,Immortal Spirit,Super Dragon Sword,Benevolence,"As long as you have an ally still conscious during a battle, a weak version of Auto-Revive (leaving you at 5% vitality after use) will be active on you at all times. In addition, you have a strong natural health regeneration as long as you still have an ally conscious during a battle

37,,Free,“Estus Flasks” ,Dark Souls 1,Benevolence,"You receive five Estus Flasks. Estus Flasks are dull green grass bottles that fill up with a golden fluid, if it could be described as a fluid, when you rest next to bonfires. Undead who drink of these flasks will heal from grievous injuries, though especially large bodies or extra severe injuries might need several flasks worth to properly recover. It’s unknown where these bottles come from, but you should be able to find more around these lands, giving you healing potions on hand. You may use these potions regardless of origin."
38,,Free,Divine Breath ,Warbreaker,Benevolence,"You have a single animating Breath that raises you to the Fifth Heightening. Instead of animating things, this Breath can be given to a person to heal them. Full and complete, regenerate limbs, fix congenital issues, anything short of death. Without the Breath, however, you will die. In future Jumps, you can heal one person per Jump or decade without consequence."
39,,Free,Longevity ,Skulduggery Pleasant,Benevolence,"In this world, magic has a sort of rejuvenating effect, decreasing the speed at which a sorcerer/ress ages. Sorcerers can live for hundreds of years, with some exemplary individuals managing to live for even a thousand. However, barring vampires, this is not immortality; a magic-user will still age and eventually die, with their magic simply slowing the process down."
40,,Free,Barriers and Shields,Lyrical Nanoha,Benevolence,"But you can’t just keep slinging offensive spells left and right all day without any kind of defense, right? You can create barriers and shields to reinforce your own defenses, letting you block spells and attacks so long as you utilize them properly. This can be especially draining or fragile against powerful Bombardment spells or worse, though...you might want to consider dodging instead."
41,,Free,Spell Cards,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Benevolence,"The Spell Card system was invented to ensure that youkai and humans could fight each other in a non-lethal way and on relatively even ground. Under a spell card duel, all attacks are toned down to non-lethal levels, and the ability to fire an aesthetically pleasing barrage of bullets in all directions is prized over creating undodgeable attacks or invulnerability (which are banned anyway). Accordingly, you too can tone any of your abilities down as low as simply performing pretty light shows, and as your artistic skills improve so will the beauty of your spell card attacks.

42,,25,Scourge Submission ,Final Fantasy XV Kingsglaive,Benevolence,"Of course, Niflheim wouldn’t work with anything that could potentially destroy them from within, and while the intricacies are rather vague, the Starscourge used to make things like MTs and the Imperial Daemons does seem to be under control – for now. It’s probably for the best to have a means for control, should you decide to utilize the Starscourge or any other similar virus for that matter. That’s what this modification aims to do in any case.

For each time it is taken, this modification will reduce the negative consequences of things like parasites and viruses. This slows down the rate at which they spread without negatively affecting performance, and reduces the degree by which their potential side effects may hamper the target.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
43,,25,"Si Vis Pacem, Para Bellum",Final Fantasy XV Kingsglaive,Benevolence,"Though magic isn’t especially copious within Eos, the magic that exists is remarkably potent. Though many see it as a relic from a time that is quickly fading away, something like the Old Wall of Insomnia possesses a remarkable resilience, making it capable of fighting off an invading army if need be. Perhaps this is only to be expected though, considering the Old Wall is in fact, the last line of defence for Insomnia.

When you bring to life the legends of old, for each time this modification is taken, their resilience and durability increase by a fair bit. Though normally the animated constructs will continue to fight until you lay them back to rest or they’re completely annihilated, this will flat out reduce the likelihood that they’ll be scratched in the first place. Should they be completely destroyed, for every two times this modification is taken, they can instantly reform on their own accord.

Requires Rite of Establishment to Purchase"
44,,25,Sine Die,Final Fantasy XV Kingsglaive,Benevolence,"As you travel throughout Eos, you might notice a rather peculiar phenomenon in that the nights seem to be steadily growing longer, arriving earlier than expected with the sun rising later than expected. It’s a very odd phenomenon to be sure, and the people not seeming to notice also seems a bit strange, but it does trigger a rather peculiar consequence – people seem to benefit far more substantially from the effects of rest.

With this modification, each time you get a good night’s sleep, the pace at which you can work and learn afterwards increases by a fair bit. Each time this is taken, the effect lasts longer and the magnitude of the increase is further improved. One would hope that eventually the day and night cycle stabilizes somewhat...but on the other hand, you can also be thankful that you don’t have to sleep in a pricey hotel or anything to get the benefits of a good night’s sleep."
45,,25,The Outsider’s Resilience,Final Fantasy XV Kingsglaive,Benevolence,"In contrast to one who never leaves his roost, the traveller grows far more quickly, moulded by the trials that their journey imposes upon them. Whether they face vicious beasts or strange illnesses, the traveller must overcome these challenges if they are to continue. To undergo any journey of length, the traveller must be resilient – and this modification seeks to make them so. Each time it is taken, the traveller’s resistance to all forms of harm and hardship is increased, in preparation for what they must face going forward.

46,,25,Total Biscuit of Rejuvenation,League of Legends ,Benevolence,"Delicious and high in calories, these bread snacks were created and popularized by a scorned nobleman. These biscuits rejuvinate and invigorate the consumer, healing minor wounds and energizing the body and mind. By purchasing this, you receive a daily supply of them, with three appearing in your warehouse every sunrise. You can purchase this multiple times, to get more biscuits a day.

47,,50,Dis-Package,Shin Megami Tensei ,Benevolence,"A small sack with three beads inside. One cures any sort of poisoning, one cures any sort of paralysis, and one cures any sort of petrifaction. Demons use all three with surprising frequency, so these are pretty useful. When no one’s looking, the sack will produce another bead of the appropriate type whenever one is used."
48,,50,Eyes of Truth,Cereza and the Stray Demon,Benevolence,"In a world defined by perception, the difference between glamour and reality is not so great. Many explorers have come before you, but you have the piercing insight to see what many others would miss in the woods as well as the deductive reasoning and levelheaded logic to collate your observations and make reasonable conclusions. This offers a mild amount of resistance to fairy illusions. You can’t hope to simply nullify their haunting glamours, but at least you can keep your wits about you enough to try and find a way to escape."
49,,50,Particularly Exalted​,Generic Exalted,Benevolence,"Normally an individual that is Exalted tends to excel at one of the three attribute groups of physical, mental, or social. The second group is slightly above average, and the final category is merely average. You however are particularly multi-talented, and have the good fortune to excel at the physical, mental, and social aspects all at the same time, with no functional difference between them. The reason this is so cheap is because these things are nothing you couldn’t have just trained up yourself given some time and effort, however it does give you a fair advantage in the early run of things, especially since some charms require higher attributes before they can be learned."
50,,50,Purity of Spirit,Final Fantasy XV Kingsglaive,Benevolence,"The Astrals are wholly dedicated to the well being of the planet, and while this doesn’t mean that they require humans to be present and thriving, it would help if they slowed the spread of the Starscourge amongst the humans. To this end they had originally assigned an Oracle – a person who would not only commune with them, but also hold the darkness at bay until the Chosen King could arrive.

Unfortunately with the state of affairs as it is, the Astral’s Oracle isn’t exactly free to do whatever she wants. With this however, you can at least lighten her burden by purifying those you come across that are unfortunate enough to be afflicted by the Starscourge. Similarly this works for other infections as well,

51,,50,Sacred Charm against [Spirit],GrimGrimoire,Benevolence,"Behold, a talismanic charm, ornamented and adorned, a ward against the forces of the unknown. Whether vile or fair the spirit breed, a bane this talisman claims to heal. Fiendish devils, ghostly apparitions, and the fae the worst of all, this minor ward will shield thee against their casual beck and call. Remember though, created life is beyond the grasp of fate, and cannot be so easily banished to its designated gate.

If you wish, you may seek armor against many spirits. Merely purchase this again by type; fae, ghosts, or devils dark.

52,,50,Enchanted Gear ,The Elder Scrolls: Dovah,Benevolence,"Only fools go around without the very best equipment they can acquire, and you are no fool. Upon any item you own, you may add a single, powerful enchantment with each purchase of this option. This cannot be used to acquire unique enchantments, such as the effect of Mehrunes’ Razor. This option may be taken multiple times, at a discount after the first purchase.

53,,50,Viidost,The Elder Scrolls: Dovah,Benevolence,"Poison. Even for a dragon, there is always a possibility that a coated dagger will kill them just as surely as a warhammer to the skull. Yet you are different, and refuse to be brought low by such an underhanded and dishonorable threat. Through some means, be it magical or biological, you are now completely immune to all poisons that would attempt to infect you. Should they wish to fell you, then it will have to be on the field of battle."
54,,50,Bottomless Stomach,Elder Scrolls Online – The Vestige,Benevolence,"You want to go to fight a dragon but you cannot drink all the potions that would grant you the sweet, sweet buffs you need? Well, don’t worry, with this Perk, any food or drink you ingest will not fill your stomach, assuming that they grant buffs of any kind. Try to not wolf down too much normal food."
55,,50,Guardian Faerie(Additional),Fate/Faerie Britain,Benevolence,"Normally you could only be the guardian faerie of a single object, but by paying - 50 CP each, you can become the guardian of additional items.

56,,50,Apocalypse Insurance,Fate/Faerie Britain,Benevolence,"Most of the time, people want to prevent Armageddon. But some people just want to watch the world burn. If you’re one of those, it might be nice to have some guarantee that the end of the world won’t be the end of your chain.

If you help to bring about the apocalypse, the end of the world, or anything similar, but are yourself engulfed in the resulting destruction, you will not die; instead, you will transfer to the nearest alternative timeline to carry out the remainder of your jump. In this world, that means going to Proper Human History, but in other settings you may wind up in a radically different timeline, or even a near-identical timeline where your actions never happened.

But do take note that this only applies if you’re actively attempting to end the world."
57,,50,Curse Resistance,Fate/Faerie Britain,Benevolence,"Curses are an endemic problem in Faerie Britain, especially in the form of the Mors. The touch of a Mors spreads the Mors Curse, turning regular faeries into more Mors. Fortunately, you have this perk to protect you; it isn’t immunity to curses, but it gives you a resistance that allows you to ignore weak or casual curses, and you could withstand a dozen hits from Mors in a single battle before you risked succumbing to the Curse."
58,,50,FULL ELIXIR,Final Fantasy X,Benevolence,"It’s going to be a rough journey, and you’ll probably need some of these. They cure wounds and conditions to restore you to full health. One purchase nets you 10 of these. A rather handy travelling supply, if you come across merchants or guardians and summoners, you can also sell them for a good price.

59,,50,Freedom,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Benevolence,"Naturally evil? Destined to be a hero? Haven’t these people ever heard of a little thing called freedom? Under your guiding hand, even the most inherently malicious or saintly young stars can grow up to be whatever they want. Or whatever you teach them to be, if they’re not willful enough to pick their own way. The basic ability you have is to allow people to go against their integral natures, allowing even a Goddess whose very soul embodies the evil of their original self and nothing else to grow up into a unruly heroine. "
60,,50,Divine Physiology(Unnatural)        ,God Of War (2018),Benevolence,"Oh you are something different aren't you? Either through magic, training, or just good genes you are sturdier than most mortals and are highly resistant to normal diseases and poisons. A mundane weapon would injure you but it wouldn’t kill you unless you stood still and took a stab to the heart or some similarly vital point, additionally you are able to move faster than a normal human."
61,,50,Divine Physiology(Demi-God),God Of War (2018),Benevolence,"You are no longer a normal mortal, you find that once you reach your prime you age slowly enough to let you live hundreds, if not thousands, of years without changing too much. It would take a magical weapon in order to deal with you, though one could be used to finish you off if you were weak enough, and even then you would be able to last for a decent amount of time. You are able to fight longer than any normal mortal, being able to fight for hours if need be and you are not wounded. You are also faster than a normal human.

62,,50,Divine Physiology(Giant),God Of War (2018),Benevolence,"Truly you are beyond mortal kind, you have reached the point that once you have reached your prime you no longer age. It would require something on par with the Leviathan Axe to seriously wound you, and even then you would be able to fight for hours while wounded. You are able to move fast enough that mortals would claim you can teleport short distances.

Requires Divine Physiology(Demi-God) to Purchase"
63,,50,Divine Physiology(God) ,God Of War (2018),Benevolence,"At this level your physicality has reached the level of legendary Aesir warriors like Baldur. Your strength allows you to create fissures, lift great trees with minimal effort, break and throw stones the size of a house. Your vitality is such that you could survive being gored by the Blades of Chaos and still be able to fight on unimpeded, though multiple successive wounds at that level would leave you weak and vulnerable enough to be killed. You heal fast enough that a wound would close during a heated battle. And your speed is at the level of a blur even for divine beings while your reaction speed can have you defend against those with speeds far surpassing yours.

Requires Divine Physiology(Giant) to Purchase"
64,,50,Healing Kit,Final Fantasy V,Benevolence,"An endless number of basic potions, ethers, antidotes and so forth, everything an adventurer needs to stay healthy. The kit never runs out. "
65,,50,Golden Apple,Final Fantasy IV,Benevolence,An apple with a golden sheen. Increases your health and vitality by a small amount when eaten. You find a new one every month.

You will receive one flask for free, and you may purchase more for [50] each.

67,,50,Blood Vials,Bloodborne: Covenants,Benevolence,"A satchel filled with twenty vials of healing blood, which will heal you of your wounds and replenishes any used up daily. Once a patient has had their blood ministered, a unique but common treatment in Yharnam, successive infusions recall the first, and are all the more invigorating for it. No surprise that most Yharnamites are heavy users of blood."
68,,50,Antidote,Bloodborne: Covenants,Benevolence,"Ten small medicinal tablets that counteract poison, which will replenish nightly. It was used to treat ashen blood, the baffling sickness that ravaged Old Yharnam long ago. These tablets only provide short-term relief. The ashen blood ailment eventually triggered the spread of the beastly scourge."
69,,50,Refillable Potion,League of Legends ,Benevolence,"This bottomless flask produces a refreshing blue-green elixir that heals wounds when imbibed. It holds enough to hold two drinks, and slowly refills over the course of the day, enough for a drink every 12 hours. Tastes like Kiwi and blueberry."
70,,50,"""Estus Flasks/Ashen Estus Flasks"" ",Dark Souls 3,Benevolence,"""The Undead treasure these dull green flasks. The journey of an Undead has always traced the bonfires, and no journey of import has been made without an Estus Flask./Undead treasure these dull ashen flasks. Quite befitting of an Unkindled, an Ashen Estus Flask turns a bonfire's heat cold."" You receive five flasks total, how you divvy this number up between normal Estus Flasks and Ashen Estus Flasks is up to you. Estus Flasks work like healing potions, healing the wounds of the one who drinks from them. Ashen Estus Flasks meanwhile revitalize the soul, allowing one to cast more magic or use more special weapon abilities. Both types of flasks will refill when resting near a bonfire (or a normal campfire in other worlds). Normally they'd only work for undead, but flasks purchased in this manner work for any form of being. You may purchase additional flasks at 50CP each.

71,,50,"""Chillbite Ring"" ",Dark Souls 3,Benevolence,"""One of the bite rings native to Carim. This ring would never grace Friede’s hand, for the painting and its frost became her home."" Like the other rings produced by the Earl of Carim the Chillbite Ring increases one’s resistance to elemental frost when worn, making the biting chill of winter a bit easier to bear. A necessity, for those not used to the painted world’s frigid temperatures."
72,,50,"""Pyromancer's Clothes""",Dark Souls 3,Benevolence,"""Attire of pyromancers of the Great Swamp. Comprised of bronze ornamentation and animal pelt. In the Great Swamp, bronze was used ritualistically to ward off evil spirits and keep darkness at bay."" While it provides little physical protection, the wards are quite effective at defending the wearer from immaterial forces like fire, magic, lightning or abyssal darkness."
73,,50,“Drake Shell” ,Dark Souls 1,Benevolence,"Fragments of the egg shell you once hatched out. Due to the stone-like qualities of the shell, it is rich in different minerals that revitalize the health of a drake’s scales. Consuming pieces of it allow you to recover lost scales or repair scale damage inflicted by blade, lightning, darkness, whatever really. A new broken shell will be bestowed upon you in a day’s time when the old one is consumed."
74,,50,“Cursebite Ring” ,Dark Souls 1,Benevolence,"A gnarled ring depicting a gray skull in the center. One of the infamous bite rings commissioned by Sir Arstor of Carim. It simply wards the wearer against curses like those afflicted by basilisks, making it far less likely to be afflicted by them even after direct exposure."
75,,50,“Curative Mushroom”,Dark Souls 1,Benevolence,"A small bag containing a few slices of mushrooms, it refills slowly over time. When one of these mushrooms is consumed, it temporarily grants the consumer regeneration that can allow them to recover from great damage for a short time. Use them wisely."
76,,50,“Green Blossoms”,Dark Souls 1,Benevolence,"Several recovering bundles of dried green blossoms, as well as several seed packets for growing your own. Green Blossoms when prepared function as a stimulant that helps even the undead recover their stamina more quickly, making extended combat or journeys easier."
77,,50,“Blooming Purple Moss Clumps”,Dark Souls 1,Benevolence,"Clumps of purple moss with flowers, eating one of these clumps acts as a powerful antitoxin that purges deadly poisons from the body. You receive a small bag with individually packaged clumps that slowly refill over time. Be careful you don’t get yourself poisoned too often, or you just might run out."
78,,50,“Egg Vermifuge”,Dark Souls 1,Benevolence,"Resembling a hairy nut, specifically some kind of fuzzy acorn, an Egg Vermifuge contains potent chemicals that purges parasites lurking within one’s body. You receive a small, refilling bag. You can either eat them for the benefits above, or plant them to make this parasite cure more widely available."
79,,50,Flask Of Felix Felicis,Harry Potter,Benevolence,"A flask of ‘liquid luck’. Enough for 120 hours worth of use. Practically everything you attempt will be successful while in effect as you will become naturally drawn to the most expedient route to your goal. Toxic if you drink too much in a short space of time, overreliance leads to recklessness."
80,,50,Coin ,Warbreaker,Benevolence,"A single coin. One face holds a figure in hooded robes and the inscription “violence is the last option of a state that has failed.” The reverse side has the same face in armor and reads “but it beats having no options.” Let this serve as a reminder to you and your clients that violence is always an option if not necessarily the best one. Also boosts your luck some, at least making you less likely to die by accident or chance."
81,,50,Old Man Shoes,The Sorcerer's Apprentice,Benevolence,"Not just a pair of shoes, but also a well-tailored suit, optional arm warmers and a rawhide coat that looks like it came from before the industrial revolution. On top of being generally stylish, the coat is thick enough that it serves as portable protection against a variety of normal hazards and a limited amount of direct damage. The protection is mostly only useful against magical threats, which generally aren't designed to penetrate."
82,,50,Auto-Guard,Lyrical Nanoha,Benevolence,"Generally, while Devices may provide warnings, advice and analysis for their mages, it is unusual for them to cast spells on their own. One common modification is, however, a system that can be set to automatically cast an active protection spell, intended to supplement the existing passive defense of a Barrier Jacket. As the casting is handled entirely by the Device’s intelligence, without consulting it’s user, it can react far faster than a human, with the caveat that it can only be used for defensive spells. Since Devices are essentially ‘always on’, an Auto-Guard system can also respond to more mundane attacks, protecting its master from debris or other environmental hazards even outside of combat. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)"
83,,50,Brown Paper,Wonderland No More,Benevolence,"This high-quality brown paper is suitable for patching nobs and mending broken crowns of all sorts. It comes with a jar of ordinary vinegar for application. Use of this brown paper will let someone use healing or repair powers/skills on anyone – whether they’re Chessman, Human, or something else entirely. For instance, it would let someone use medical healing on a Chessman (despite Chessmen being made of wood and lacking true vitals), or using a repair skill meant for a Chessman/Card on a human or other organic being. However, the Brown Paper does not grant healing skills; the user will need to have healing/repair-related abilities to begin with.
"
84,,50,Heart Container,Hyrule Warriors,Benevolence,"An ornate piece that appears to be made by a gifted artisan, it looks like a heart made of red glass and golden filigree. Not just for show, the Heart Container is full of magic. 

On use, by resting it upon your chest, it permanently increases your health. This makes it harder for you to die from wounds that aren’t immediately lethal, or blood loss, basically. You may give these to others for use, or purchase more for 50CP each

85,,50,Sorcery - Chronomancy Rituals (Grant Time Sense),World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Benevolence,"The magical power to manipulate time. However, it cannot divine information about the past or future, instead altering the flow of time within the present.

Some, but not all, Paths also have rituals, which take an extra ten minutes to cast, but are easier to perform, more powerful, and often capable of producing effects that cannot be replicated with normal sorcery.

Grant Time Sense (1): Allows the chronomancer to grant their mystical perceptions of time to another person.

(CG Note: This perk requires Sorcery - Chronomancy (One Dot) - World of Darkness: Sorcerer first.)

86,,50,Sorcery - Chronomancy Rituals (Unaging) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Benevolence,"The magical power to manipulate time. However, it cannot divine information about the past or future, instead altering the flow of time within the present.

Some, but not all, Paths also have rituals, which take an extra ten minutes to cast, but are easier to perform, more powerful, and often capable of producing effects that cannot be replicated with normal sorcery.

Unaging (5) This potent ritual prevents the blight of aging from affecting the caster,
allowing for ancient Sorcerers, so long as no outside factors lead to their deaths. It
must be recast every several weeks. Multiple castings do not “stack.”

87,,50,Ice Goblin ,The Elder Scrolls,Benevolence ,"The isle of Solstheim is just as cold as Skyrim in parts, and as such the Rieklings needed to adapt. And adapt they did, as they are very resistant to cold environments, as well as frost magic. You could quite literally walk around the tundra in but a loincloth for a time and be fine."

89,,75,Breakwater ,Final Fantasy XV Kingsglaive,Benevolence ,"Do not ever forget what it is that the Astrals are after, especially if you choose to serve one. The Starscourge is, and always will be, the greatest threat to the planet, and for the most part everything that the Astrals have done was largely to fight off this scourge.

As their agent, your presence alone can force the Starscourge back. Daemons weaken in your presence, those born of the scourge’s influence will find themselves slowly unmade with you around, and provided you stay long enough, you can even reverse the damage that the Starscourge has inflicted upon a locale. But at the end of the day, you’re still only one person – and though you may be able to save some, the scourge will continue to spread elsewhere.

Still, any amount by which you slow down the Starscourge will help, even if it’s just to buy time for the Chosen King to ascend to his throne. The ability that you possess will also work on other viral forms similar to the Starscourge, though its effectiveness won’t be as substantial.

90,,100,Monk Fighter,Duel Monsters – The Shadow Realm,Benevolence ,"You are a hardened warrior, you learnt how to strike and not hurt yourself. From now on, you don’t take ‘backlash’ from your bare-handed strikes, i.e if you punch a rock, you don’t get the pain from the punch itself, though if the rock punches you back it won’t protect from that."
91,,100,Red-Eyes Burn,Duel Monsters – The Shadow Realm,Benevolence ,"The feature which gives the Red Eyes their name. You are now able to manifest Red Eyes, bright red lights in your eyes that the Black Dragons used as a young clan to come off as powerful and intimidating. Not only do they serve this purpose, but you also gain a strange attunement to the element of “Fire” while the red eyes are active, making you a bit resistant to it and letting you manipulate it with a greater ease."
92,,100,Remove Trap,Duel Monsters – The Shadow Realm,Benevolence ,"Spellcasters often become adventurers as a way of gaining experience, and while this spell isn’t quite used in day to day life...It’s invaluable for those who wish to seek their fortune in the ruins and dungeons of the Shadow Realm. At a tap of the finger, or an appropriate magical focus such as a staff or wand, you may disarm any mechanical trap! However, this isn’t as simple as that: If you’re unaware of a trap being present, the spell doesn’t function. It may take a bit of a keen eye, but that’s what you need to develop as a Spellcaster, isn’t it?"
93,,100,Doctor's Daughter,Castlevania - Rondo of Blood,Benevolence ,"Your father was a man of medicine, and some of these skills have rubbed off onto you. Or perhaps he was a priest? Well, the specifics of who you are don’t matter greatly - instead, be content to know that you have the beginnings of a medicinal talent. Perhaps your father really was a doctor, and so you know the basics of medicine and how to bandage wounds properly. Or maybe he was a priest, and so you know a number of prayers to heal the faithful and lift simple curses and hexes. It might also be possible that he kept doves as pets, and so you instead are competent at the care of animals, specifically avians. I’ll leave exactly who he was and what he taught you up to you, but I’m sure you get the idea."
94,,100,Indefatigable,Anima Beyond Fantasy,Benevolence ,"Psionics has a cost of it’s own however. It is not so easy to call upon as the flow of souls, or the strength of your body. A failed mental matrix will tire you... but not for long. You recover from exhaustion quickly, recovering from the strain without any concern for it."
95,,100,Chrysoberyl Chatoyance,Castlevania - Symphony of the Night,Benevolence ,"Deep in Dracula’s castle there lies a coven of witches known as Salome who place the vast majority of their efforts into summoning various things. A favorite of theirs is a black cat, a standard witches familiar, which some of them can even transform into. This circlet is an item of their own devising, embedded with a gemstone reminiscent of a cat's eye, and has the unique property of healing the wearer when they come into contact with a cat. Merely petting it or having it rub up against your leg is enough for the magic to trigger, and if one attempted to scratch you would find your wounds closing faster than they could make them. Sadly, cats are not a particularly common thing to find inside Castlevania, though there is one hunter that brought one with her."
96,,100,Symbol of Might,Castlevania - Symphony of the Night,Benevolence ,"Being a creature of darkness that chooses to dwell in the light, you will find that your allies are far more suited to exploiting your weakness than your foes are - and that your former allies know them far better. Luckily, your former foes have taken the time to provide you with a small trinket that will help you blunt one of the effects of your weaknesses. Perhaps a small cross that will shield you from their own holy light? Alucard himself has a holy symbol that allows him to surpass the classical weakness to running water that his vampiric heritage brings with it, allowing him to swim and explore beneath the waves without too much issue. Such an object is obviously highly reliant on precisely what kind of inhuman creature you are, but will no doubt be exceptionally useful to you."
97,,100,Crosses Do Not Ward Away Jumpers,Castlevania - Symphony of the Night,Benevolence ,"Vampires have a lot of weaknesses. Like, vampires have dozens of weaknesses that can potentially be used to screw them over, though most are only truly vulnerable to a small handful of them. And then you have paragons of dark and terrible might, who are capable of ignoring the same effects that would kill a lesser vampire outright. In fact, you have learned to twist and direct your power in direct opposition to your own supposed weaknesses. Of course, this does take a truly phenomenal amount of energy to do, but it’s well worth it to see the looks on peoples faces as the cross they meant to ward you off with simply crumples from being near you."
98,,100,No Virgin Sacrifice,Old Man Henderson,Benevolence ,"What is it with all these virgins being used for sacrifices? Well don’t worry about that anymore because, even if you are a virgin, you won’t be in the eyes of whatever ritual is going on. You simply can not be used as a valid sacrifice anymore no matter the procedure. At the very least a way to spit your captors in the face a final time."
99,,100,A Satisfying Ending ,Old Man Henderson,Benevolence ,"The creator of Henderson was fine with lots of things that can go wrong in a campaign as long as they made for a satisfying story. This Perk doesn’t do much... it simply crafts a satisfying narrative around you, as if a capable GM decided to make it a story worth telling. When the last curtain falls on a campaign... you will be satisfied. And really isn’t that what everyone wants?"
100,,100,Hard-Headed,The Silmarillion,Benevolence ,"It is said that the thoughts of the dwarves are difficult to bend or twist, and are strange to the other peoples of Arda. So it is with you. Others will find it much harder to understand your thoughts and desires save in broad terms, whether through normal understanding of others or more esoteric means such as telepathy, unless you choose to explain them clearly. More than this, though, you are extremely resistant to mental domination, charm or corruption; you can be deceived or persuaded into bad courses of action, but attempts to control you or turn you into another’s puppet are never wholly successful. Just as Sauron’s seven Rings only made their dwarven wearers more greedy, jealous and quarrelsome, rather than bringing them under the command of the Dark Lord - and even that only after many years - so you too shall have an unshakable core of self."
101,,100,Student of Ossë ,The Silmarillion,Benevolence ,"In the days of the journeys of the Elves to the West, the Maia Ossë taught those who would become the Teleri much of sea-lore. You have received such teachings, whether from Ossë himself or his students in turn, and are a sailor of superhuman ability, able to navigate near-effortlessly by the stars, the winds, the waves and the movements of birds, and to handle all manner of sailing vessels in even the roughest of seas. Your knowledge of the sea allows you to predict all but magical weather days in advance, such that mortal sailors would consider your proficiency with sea-lore nothing less than magical. Finally, you are beloved of the sea, such that even should disaster overtake you on rivers, lakes or oceans you can be assured that the waves will bear you to shore or at least some degree of safety. Only powers mightier than Ossë - who was a Maia of power equalling Sauron - can overcome this protection."
102,,100,Timeless Shadow Nature,Anima Ark Of Sinners,Benevolence ,"The shadows of this city are timeless, capable of living indefinitely unless killed by violence. This grants you the same ageless immortality as them as well as an alternate form of some kind of shadowy creature wearing a mask, it could be humanoid, skeletal or canine it matters little.

Thankfully, you are immune to the mental health deterioration you would normally experience as a result of your strange existence."
103,,100,Improbable outfit,Anima Ark Of Sinners,Benevolence ,"Celia’s outfit is shall we say quite odd considering what she used to be but doesn’t make her any less effective a warrior. This also allows you to make any armor including bikini armor a viable protection as blows will be redirected towards it. Furthermore, this also increases the durability of whatever you are wearing such that even clothes could become as strong as steel."
104,,100,Environmental Protection,Shin Megami Tensei ,Benevolence ,"You are naturally resistant to harmful environmental factors. Extreme heat, cold, radiation, or even magical curses have a lessened effect on you, to the point something which would kill a normal man in hours will need days to claim your life. Not only that, but by actively cycling your spiritual power, you can actually repel those conditions and even “clean” others of those harmful elements."
105,,100,“Nith ith Natt”,Kane Chronicles,Benevolence ,"You’re very articulate. Partially due to a magical tattoo of Ma’at on your tongue, unless you’re somehow addled or intentionally doing it, every word out of your mouth is exactly as you intend it to be, incantations included. Won’t prevent you from saying the wrong ​thing​, or something you shouldn’t have, but at least you won’t be saying it wrongly​."
106,,100,The Endless Cycle,Grant Morrison’s 18 Days,Benevolence ,"Death is not an ending. Should you ever fall, you will be reborn when all mortal memory of you has faded into history (i.e. when no mortal who knew you in life still lives). Upon being reborn, you will slowly regain the memories, prowess, and skills of your former life or lives as you mature, such that by the time you reach adulthood you will remember everything and be able to do all that you could have done before.

As such, death can no longer end your chain, for there are no true endings. Jump timers pause while you’re not fully incarnated (i.e. if you die at the start of year seven of a ten year jump, the jump will end three years after your reincarnation reaches adulthood.)"
107,,100,Vital Energies,Castlevania - Order of Ecclesia,Benevolence ,"Even for someone who specializes in magic, there are limits to how much force you can bring to bear at any given time. In all likelihood, your most powerful attacks are something you can use perhaps a half dozen times before running yourself dry. Luckily for you, what you lack in power you make up for in stamina - or rather, at the rather excessive rate that you can find your second, third, and seventeenth winds in battle. Given even a short moment to rest, you’ll find that your magical energy returns to you in what are surely record times. If you were to carefully alternate between book and blade, you might find yourself seeming to never run out of energy. ...Unless of course you use Glyphs and your book is also your blade? You might need to genuinely take a break in that case."
108,,100,Returning,Percy Jackson,Benevolence ,"The item if lost or stolen will return to you as soon as it would be useful. (This is much faster than the standard replacement of items and goes directly to you)

Note: Can Be Applied to Any Item You Wish.  Must be Purchased Again to Apply to a New Item

109,,100,Minor Blessing,Percy Jackson,Benevolence ,"For one reason or another you've got a god who cares slightly about you and has seen fit to grant you some minor boon within their domains. Choose one god from any pantheon and gain a minor boon from them. The god will care slightly about you but unless you go on to further distinguish yourself it will be more of a minor interest in your affairs than someone they feel the need to help (Effectively think a diminished version of one ability a demigod might have, think minor ones are stuff along the lines of breathing water, lucid dreaming, or appropriate vague extra senses, useful but nothing especially major). This can be taken multiple times.

110,,100,Reject the Impure,Warhammer 40K: The Warp ,Benevolence ,"The touch of Chaos is not to be welcomed. It should be resisted and repelled by all who lay their eyes on them. Unless you of your own free will choose to embrace such heresy you are incredibly resistant if not immune to corruption and taint of any kind, be it physical, mental, or spiritual."
111,,100,Bestow a Gift ,Disney Lorcana,Benevolence ,"You can bless your allies with temporary charms, great strength or speed, good fortune, that sort of thing."
112,,100,Loyal Heart ,Changeling The Dreaming,Benevolence ,"While all fae are conscious of the bonds of oaths, for you it is almost of a religious nature. Oaths are not something you take lightly, but are more than a matter of life and death. They are also a measure of your self worth, for they give your life a meaning beyond most. Whenever you are overwhelmed or dejected, the thought of your duties is enough to give you the strength to persevere. This will even give you a certain level of resistance to supernatural effects, but it will do nothing if you seek to break an oath willingly."
113,,100,Aquatic Lifestyle,Changeling The Dreaming,Benevolence ,"It is unthinkable that you would ever live without the ocean and all the beauty to be found beneath the waves, even while wearing the skin of a human. Never shall such a thing affect you, as no matter what form you possess, you are entirely capable of breathing under water, whether it be salt or fresh. In addition to this, you have been rendered effectively immune to the crushing pressure of the ocean, comfortable even in the deepest part of the Mariana Trench as you are in a coral reef."
114,,100,The Very Hungry Changeling ,Changeling The Dreaming,Benevolence ,"Some people may not know that the term fasting is used to describe when someone abstains from consuming any food or drinks. You can undergo a more supernatural version, in which you can go completely without any sustenance for multiple days, or perhaps even weeks. Be careful, though, as when you turn this effect off, all that hunger and thirst will hit you all at once, so make sure you're in a well stocked buffet beforehand."
115,,100,Luck of the Irish,Changeling The Dreaming,Benevolence ,"Some may call it cheating, but that implies that you’d ever get caught doing so. You’ve got that stereotypical luck attributed to the people of the Emerald Isle, and will find that games of chance are more often than not in your favor. Just in general, though, all the small things are likely going to go your way."
116,,100,Seeming’s Blessing,Changeling The Dreaming,Benevolence ,"Birthrights are inherent gifts that each of the fae have as part of who they are, with every kith or species having its own birthrights. These abilities are  often only effective while one has their fae mien active, but your fae soul is more potent than that. Indeed, these kith specific abilities can affect your mortal seeming as well, giving you a bit more versatility while within your human form. If that isn’t attractive enough, then it should be noted that this will affect all natural racial abilities, applying them to whatever form you adopt at the time."
117,,100,Chorus of Light,Princess The Hopeful,Benevolence ,"Through training and a close connection with your Nakama, your fellow Princesses who support you outside of your duties as well as during them, you’ve learned to reinforce each other’s magic as well as your vocals. All magical effects reliant on the spoken word gain a minor boost when others you share a close bond with add harmonise their efforts with your own, but those channelled by singing benefit the most. For the Light takes as much joy in music as men do."
118,,100,Blessed Are the Faithful,Hyperdimension Neptunia,Benevolence ,"As a CPU, your worshipers must be protected. Since you’re only one person, you can’t be everywhere at once. That’s what this is for. Just by being in a land, you can passively bring peace to it, discouraging monster attacks and natural disasters. This won’t protect against actively directed malevolence or natural conflict between citizens, but it does mean you’re less likely to randomly suffer a famine. Furthermore, you gain a minor boost to all your abilities, from your physical to your mental, to appearance, to your supernatural abilities."
119,,100,Lord’s Garb,Castlevania (Netflix) ,Benevolence ,"An elegant set of clothing or armor from whatever culture you desire- with the varying degrees of elegance that come from that, of course. Whatever you choose, the outfit is resistant to damage even if it appears to be simple clothing. It would take supernatural strength or a high-quality weapon to damage it. This also comes with high-quality makeup that goes with your outfit. "
120,,100,Fortunate Indeed ,Castlevania (Netflix) ,Benevolence ,"Some vampires are so driven by their own thirst that they can’t see beyond the next drop of blood, or the next raid on the ‘livestock’. But you have more compassion- or at least, a better control over your instincts- than they do. Whatever appetites or desires you have, even necessary ones, can be held off for longer than would normally be healthy. If you’re a vampire, you can go a month without feeding and still possess your full strength; if you’re a human, you can go without food for two weeks and a week without water before it starts to be a problem, and a few days without good rest. Mind you, your body might complain about this but it’s better than biting out the throats of your traveling companions to quench your thirst. "
121,,100,Breaking Free,Amphibia,Benevolence ,"So you’re a hivemind or attached to multiple others mentally. Maybe you’re being controlled or have restrictions placed on you by magic? Not anymore you’re an expert at breaking free from the control of others, you can break free of mental conditioning that’s been imbued into your very soul. This won’t cover physical restraints but if you’re ever brainwashed or have your emotions manipulated you’ll be able to break free at a moment's notice."
122,,100,Destined for Death,The Ghost and Molly McGee,Benevolence ,"Life is a series of twists and turns, where thousands of moments can line up in serendipitous ways. So while we have no fear of the ending, we might as well find as many ways to extend our story to its fullest. For every decade or jump, whichever is soonest, you can cheat Death of your life - from having one of your friends have a discerning, lucky eye and freeing you from a last-second escape from a wood chipper to having your phone take a bullet for you.

Carpe diem, nam mori potes."
123,,100,Unsympathetic,Vampire: The Masquerade,Benevolence ,"Clan Tremere keep a vial of each member’s blood, obtained through the Transubstantiation of the Seven ritual each member undergoes. Allowing a conspiracy of blood sorcerers access to your blood could have horrifying consequences, as could merely having a blood relationship such as between vampires of the same Clan. You can freely manage how you may be targeted through sympathetic magic. You may cut whatever mystical connection exists between you and your blood (or only certain samples of it), your possessions, or familial or supernatural relationships, preventing anyone from exploiting those sympathetic connections with their magic so long as you suppress them."
124,,100,Gehenna Survivor,Vampire: The Masquerade,Benevolence ,"Your mind is sacrosanct from any indirect attempt to control it. Long range mind control rays and attempts to target you through your bloodline fail. Only someone close enough to look you in the eye can control your mind. So, for example, if your Antediluvian died and set off an orgy of cannibalism among its offspring with its death cry, you’d be completely unaffected."
125,,100,Hard Bitten,Kill Six Billion Demons,Benevolence ,"One of the flaws of fighting with your own body is how fragile your form is, with the flesh ripping and bones breaking after a few strikes on the enemy. Not anymore. Now, you can no longer wound your own body, by striking something too hard, or too often. This isn’t to say you are gonna survive your body being overloaded with energy, nor is it gonna protect against external attacks, but you no longer have to worry about hitting something too hard."
126,,100,Toy Hammer ,Wild Arms 2,Benevolence ,"Despite looking like a toy, one hit from these can jolt your memories in place, curing amnesia and other memory related issues. You can also use them while healthy to prevent memory related issues for a while. Just hit yourself with the toy hammer to keep yourself protected for a day or so. The magic in the Toy doesn’t fade away after use unlike others found in this world."
127,,100,Tesla Vaccine Engineering,Mage: The Ascension,Benevolence ,"When the Virtual Adepts left the Technocracy, Iteration X infected the entire Tradition with a computer virus that erased all their memories of high dimensional physics and mathematics while preventing them from learning anything about those topics or noticing the existence of the virus itself. Luckily, you’re not only completely immune to having your memories modified without your consent, but you understand Virtual Adept reality hacking well enough to produce the Tesla Vaccine and similar modifications to others that can cure and protect against mnemonovirii. The Virtual Adepts won’t figure out any of this for several more years, so they’re really appreciate you sharing the cure with them."
128,,100,Dancing Skyclad,Mage: The Ascension,Benevolence ,"As the champions of nature, the Verbena are both at ease with the natural world and “unclean” substances like blood. For you, your natural surroundings will never harm you. You can dance skyclad (ie naked) under freezing rain, walk through deserts, even swim in lava without discomfort."
129,,100,Unconditional        ,Mage: The Ascension,Benevolence ,"As a Technocrat, you will be subjected to Social Conditioning to ensure your loyalty to the Union. That is to say, all Technocrats are brainwashed by the New World Order into being loyal to the Technocracy. Except the Void Engineers, who have their own brainwashing specialists who will secretly brainwash you into loyalty to DSEATC' instead. Or if you’re recruited in China, South Korea, or Japan then probably the Miao Guan will brainwash you into loyalty to the Dalou'laoshi. The point is, it’s not safe for your free will to be a member of the Technocracy. You however are undetectably immune to long term brainwashing like that. You’re no more resistant to a Reality Deviant’s mind control spell or a Progenitor’s psychoactive drugs, but long lasting attempts to control your mind, mundane or supernatural, fail while appearing to succeed to the instigator."
130,,100,Incorruptible,Mage: The Ascension,Benevolence ,"Every Nephandus, whether they admit it to themselves or not, seeks the annihilation of the universe. That’s rather incompatible with your chain, so with this you don’t have to worry about it. You are immune to all kinds of corruption. Even if your Avatar is inverted, you’ll maintain your personality and free will."
131,,100,Madness Immunity,Mage: The Ascension,Benevolence ,"While pretending to be a Marauder might be fun, you wouldn’t want to actually risk allowing your magick to corrupt you. You never need to fear mental illness, neither the mundane kind or ones inflicted my supernatural powers such as the state of Quiet."
132,,100,Deep Sleeper ,Bad End Theater ,Benevolence ,"You know people say sleeping is one of the best ways to heal yourself? Well, it’s true! For you, at least. Getting a quick nap will restore your health a good deal, and also give you a slight power boost for after you wake up. Just... make sure you sleep safely, okay?"
133,,100,Magic Resilience,The Owl House V1,Benevolence ,"The idea that someone can get inside your mind and mess it up, is kind of terrifying, to say the least. Even Belos with all his power and experience was vulnerable to a spell which had the purpose to transport people inside his mind. Now you won't suffer with this type of problem, maybe, depending on your magic knowledge and power. The more raw magic power and knowledge you have, the strongest this new passive magic resistance of yours will be. If you don't have magic power, your willpower will be used instead."
134,,100,Scarlet Sky,Elden Ring - Caelid Wilds,Benevolence ,"The danger of the Scarlet Rot is ever present in this land, as near every inch is corrupted by the divine plague. Should you wish for some manner of protection from it, then you can simply take this option. Not only are you highly resistant to the effects of the Scarlet Rot, but other diseases and plagues of divine origins have just as difficult a time attempting to infect you."
135,,100,I’m Here To Kill Chaos,Warhammer Fantasy: Dark Elves,Benevolence ,"Never let it be said the Dark Elves have lost any of their animosity for the powers that once wrecked their world. Though they may consort with them when an advantage is posed, though they have no scruples about throwing others to the dark gods’ nonexistent mercies, you have taken onto yourself a great oath against Chaos. It’s subtle, mind-warping powers have less purchase on you before, your steely determination keeping you focused on who your enemies are. And while your physical resistance is much lesser, it is still sufficient to walk safely where others risk contamination by foul energies."
136,,100,Sentinel/Defender,Destiny: The Guardians,Benevolence ,"The Sentinel Titan's super ability is called Sentinel Shield. When activated, the Titan summons a large, Void-infused shield that can be guarded with to create a wall of void energy that only allies can shoot through. The shield can also be thrown to ricochet off of enemies and deal moderate damage. Alternatively, they can channel Void Light into a Ward of Dawn, a void dome that protects allies from harm and lasts 30 seconds. Guardians who enter the shield receive a temporary boost to either defense or offense when they wander back outside of it."
137,,100,Titan Basic Skills,Destiny: The Guardians,Benevolence ,"You have all the basic abilities of a freshly risen Titan. You are capable of using the Light as a sort of jetpack, lifting you across short distances before needing to land. You have basic combat skills, any gun from the Destiny universe you find you will be able to wield with acceptable proficiency. You are able to dent metal with your fists even without the Light, and summon either a towering barricade to shield your allies, or a smaller barricade to rally behind for increased reload and weapon handling speed."
138,,100,This Feeling At Your Fingertips,Final Fantasy Tactics,Benevolence ,"You posses the innate ability to recover from mental and spiritual damage at an incredible rate to the point that you could go from being a complete amnesiac to a fully speaking and functioning adult, though one with few clear memories, in a matter of moments. This recovery doesn’t prevent someone from falsifying your past through illusion or mistakes on your own part."
139,,100,Shake it Off! ,Guild Wars 2,Benevolence ,"You can purge disease, poison, curses and most any other otherwise incapacitating condition affecting yourself or a close ally through the power of discipline and sheer bull-headness. Such things simply wear off after a few seconds whenever you focus really hard on it. Shouting and declaring that you must ""shake it off"" reduces the waiting time to near-instant."
140,,100,The Coward’s Path,Mummy: The Curse,Benevolence ,"This, like all Akhem-Urtu vessels, is a Seba, a packet of Sekhem created by artistic expression or the turning of the stars, which Akhem-Urtu view as a golden orrery of hieroglyphics. When bound to the soul, a Seba gives its owner a blessing and a curse. This Seba allows you to rewrite recent history to get you out of trouble, changing the timeline so that you took some other plausible course of action that stops you from experiencing the danger. You don’t remember anything about the previous timeline other than that you used The Coward’s Path. The Seba’s curse is that once in a while it will activate itself, rewriting history to undo great successes or joys the bearer experienced, leaving their memories of what they lost in-tact."
141,,100,Clear Headed Ditz,Bleach,Benevolence ,"Just look into this flashing light for a moment. Now, you’ve safely forgotten all about that hollow attack. It was just an out of control truck. Except you still remember. Attempts to alter your memory, such as through Shinigami chikan devices, are terribly prone to failure. While they might work initially, the memories quickly make their return. Perhaps this trait is also what makes you so easily adjust to shocking twists and reveals. Finding out about the afterlife won’t shatter your worldview, nor will the villains’ surprising relation to you cause some paralysing shock. "
142,,100,"Doctor, Doctor        ",Bleach,Benevolence ,"Every being fears death. Pain, too. It’s only natural to shrink back from the things that hurt us. And maybe it’s only natural to be drawn towards the ones that cleanse that pain. Every race has it’s own carers and while you’re not yet a master, you are still a Doctor. For your particular species, you’re fully trained as both doctor and surgeon to care for them. Inexperienced, sure, but still knowledgeable and able to help. You’ll have a good understanding of mundane methods of healing wounds with real world medicine as well as a decent training in several lesser Healing Kidou or your race’s equivalent abilities. A Hollow might instead rely on biological mutations or mixtures. You’ve also got a decent bedside manner, enough to at least get normally hostile patients to let you have a quick look and listen to your suggestions for a while. Sometimes it’s more helpful than actually knowing how to heal, with some of these warrior types."
143,,100,Armour Made from Wolf,Gloryhammer,Benevolence ,"This heavy leather and fur armour was stitched from the pelt of a dread black wolf. It renders you all but impervious to arrows and other subsonic ranged weapons, and is tough enough to turn aside all but the sharpest of blades."
144,,100,Tough Little Bastard,Gloryhammer,Benevolence ,"Skin made of iron, steel in our bones! Dwarves are a hardy lot, and you’re no exception. Your bones are denser than a human’s, capable of taking far more punishment before they break, and enemies will find your skin difficult to cut with ordinary weapons."
145,,100,Phoenix Down,Mobius Final Fantasy,Benevolence ,"A crate of 100 Phoenix Downs, automatically used once you are killed in battle, if you have other 1 Ups at your disposal or aren't truly killed(or if you are immortal/lack a concept of death) you will not automatically use a Phoenix Down when felled in battle. 10 Phoenix Downs are regenerated per year."
146,,100,Bloom Of Youth,A Mage Of Sorothustra,Benevolence ,"Something in you makes it hard for you to have a uniquely bad day. Going a step further, though, there is something powerfully contagious about this and around you, others also have fewer bad days in a range of ways. This is a minor luck booster, giving you the small sort of everyday luck that helps ward you against uniquely bad moments but also helps ensure every day shines just a touch brighter, an effect that spreads to others. Also, as a result of the Mystic Mother’s blessings, over both her people and the world they inhabited, you are capable of naturally having a positive attitude, and others around you tend to adopt this attitude as well, at least over time. This whole perk is a subtle thing that can easily be toggled on and off and can be selective in who it affects."
147,,100,Wall,Seven Deadly Sins,Benevolence ,"You can create magical walls and barriers, of almost any shape and size. These are powerful defensive shields and the amount and size that you can create will only increase as their defensive power does. They cannot be used in an offensive way such as creating the shields inside of another being. It can however be used to push and crush against others or the environment, as anything that does not break through the shield will treat it like a solid, moving wall."
148,,100,Survivability,Blazblue,Benevolence ,"Harsh training and physical struggles have conditioned your body to be resistant to harsh conditions. Not only are you more resistant to hot and cold climates, but you also gain a resistance to Seithr, allowing you to survive longer in areas of high Seithr concentration. This ability has its limits, though, and it'd be wise to spend as little time in such areas as possible."
149,,100,Blessing of Iron,Final Fantasy Type-0,Benevolence ,"The Genbu Crystal reinforces your body, solidifying your muscles and hardening your skin. You’ve proven to yourself that slow projectiles such as arrows or bolts don’t even leave a mark against your skin, and you could probably shrug off sustained light arms fire without worry now, but you probably shouldn't push it in terms of testing what you could go up against. You'll have plenty of time for that ahead."
150,,100,Ability Score Improvement,Generic D&D 5e,Benevolence ,"You can increase one ability score by two, or buy any feat with this.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
151,,100,Health items,Stranger Of Paradise - Final Fantasy Origins,Benevolence ,"A collection of a dozen or so each of potions,ethers, mega-ethers ,hi-potions, phoenix downs etc... They can easily bring you back to top health and remove status ailments so try to not waste them. You receive a new stock daily."
152,,100,Wyld Surviving Savant,Generic Exalted,Benevolence ,"You're tough. Really, unnaturally, ludicrously tough. You can shrug off hits that would even leave other Exalts reeling and quickly heal even from the wounds that do get through. Or maybe you’re just benefiting from blatant comic favoritism and stuff that should have hit solidly just glanced off instead. Either way you're also really good at surviving in the wild (and even The Wyld) for some reason, even places you've never been to before, and you gain a complete immunity to all mundane poisons and diseases. Magical poisons and diseases can still mess you up, but you've got a fair resistance to those as well.

Finally in places of extreme chaotic nature, such as The Wyld, you will find yourself oddly insulated from the normal consequences of being in such a place. This isn’t total resistance and it’s still advised you leave while you can, but if it’s just a relatively short visit you could conceivably survive just fine even in the very heart of The Wyld or other similarly chaotic areas."
153,,100,"One Weapon, Many Hands​",Generic Exalted,Benevolence ,"You are more than the sum of your parts. Any time you fight, or just cooperate in general, with your peers and allies you all receive a boost to your respective skills and abilities. Swordsmen become better with swords, able to twist and parry and strike with a fluidity they could never reach on their own, scientists work off of one another to make incredible insights and discovers, and craftsmen collaborate to make works of surpassing quality that they could never have even dreamed of making by themselves. This is a modest but noticeable boost for all individuals involved, but it particularly shines when in use with other Dragon-blooded. In such a case their respective abilities are doubled, and the sheer speed and efficiency of their collaborative works seem as if choreography."
154,,100,Forge Your Path ,Shin Megami Tensei V,Benevolence ,To choose is far better than to be chosen for. Filled with strife a World of infinite possibilities may be but it is one where all have the capability to do so with responsibility only falling to those who wish to bear it. And your right to choose can not be taken from you. You can still change your morality and World view but only by your own realizations. Altering your mind or deceiving you though? These believes are your own and no one elses.
155,,100,Potions ,Final Fantasy XVI,Benevolence ,A collection of a few dozen potions and hi-potions. Useful if you ever find yourself injured in battle. Refills daily.
156,,100,Volcano Dweller,Final Fantasy XVI,Benevolence ,The place where the mothercrystal of the Iron Kingdom is entombed is within an active volcano with lava flowing freely. It would be troublesome if you were to be inconvenienced by it and so with this perk you are now immune to damage from environmental heat hazard. Note that this doesn’t protect you from simply jumping into the lava.
157,,100,Baelborn Signet Ring,The Elder Scrolls - Online,Benevolence ,"Of all of the fallen bloodlines of High Rock, none is perhaps as contemptible as the Baelborns. Infamously cruel and fabulously wealthy, House Baelborn ultimately met it's end not at the hands of a present revolt or the headman's axe like so many of their ilk, but by the curse of a scorned maidservant-turned-lover that Maurice Baelborn left to be tortured and die rather than admit the illicit affair to his family. The last known descendent of the Baelborn line, the long-suffering Athel, managed to break the specter’s curse and reclaim the ruins of his family's estate with the help of the Vestige, and bestowed to the hero the last known Baelborn Signet Ring which has now passed into your hands. The enchantment on this ancient band is a simple Fortify Health charm, and particularly weak one at that, but the historical and spiritual significance is what makes it truly special."
158,,100,Meditation,The Elder Scrolls - Online,Benevolence ,"One of the first techniques taught to innates of the order, this is an advanced form of meditation that allows the body to temporarily to enter a fugue-like trance, conserving energy, slowing metabolic processes to the point that they nearly cease, and refocusing the practitioner’s biorhythms.. While in this state the body is able to dedicate unused resources of biological and magical functionality to rejuvenate itself, and to restore lost energy reserves. Mana, magicka, grain, stamina, fatigue, force points, ki, aether, or any other replenishable energy source that your body produces will rapidly accumulate to its cap while in this state, alongside your revitalized body. As an added benefit, a minute in this state translates to about five minutes of sleep."
159,,100,Divine Gifts,Fate/Grand Order Part 2,Benevolence ,"Blessings from the gods are one of the most famous rewards that champions can get. And with this perk, you’ll be able to give ‘blessings’ of your own, even without being divine. Meaning, you can share parts of your powers with others in part or in full, whether Authorities you possess, knowledge of some specific spell, raw power, luck, or whatever else you might have that you might want to give to someone. Of course, you lose access to whatever you’ve given away, given you don’t have it anymore, but you can just take it back if the receiver consents. Or if they die. As a side note, do watch out for the resilience of the soul of any recipients, as giving Servants or humans a few Authorities might be lethal to them. Also, this can be used to give away perks that you have, provided said perks don’t have a power sharing aspect themselves."
160,,100,10 Revival Beads,Shin Megami Tensei 3: Nocturne,Benevolence ,"Sometimes you die or get knocked out. Well, this will let you get back up!"
161,,100,20 Lifestones,Shin Megami Tensei 3: Nocturne,Benevolence ,"Ah, the ever classic item. They are potent healing items that restore 25% of one's health upon use, but they are also among the most requested items in Demon Negotiation. These fully replenish every week."
162,,100,Angelic Armor,Diablo 3,Benevolence ,"Something that could be mistaken for your actual body, in case you even had one. This armor fits you perfectly and weighs less to you than any armor you would be able to find at all. It also has the effect of allowing you to let your abilities flow through it more easily for defensive purposes. If you would be able to conjure flames, your armor can now be infused with these flames for some time and would even shoot at very close enemies to protect you for some time. This can prove very tiring if used incorrectly."
163,,100,"Do as you wish. Though, it is almost time for the Bell to Ring",GrimGrimoire,Benevolence ,"The Devil himself, in his unyielding desire to claim his wager, may yet turn his back on wickedness. Indeed, fate has conspired to offer you a momentary reprieve from your impending demise. Chance encounters may offer redemption, adversaries may be blinded by hubris, and even your foes may show mercy they cannot afford. It seems that the very laws of the universe conspire to spare you from the jaws of death.

But mark my words, this respite may reliably delay death, and often deflects it, but rarely stops it outright. Run the clock down, flee from your foes, or face your doom with dauntless courage. Should you fail to do so, know that death shall claim you in due time."
164,,100,Calmer of Gods,Final Fantasy XV Royal Edition,Benevolence ,"The Oracle would love to have a talent like yours or at least have you on her side. Honestly, it's something inexplicable, a talent that affects anyone, even godlike beings, the ability to appease both the mind and the soul, thoughts of anger and hatred disappear, the same goes for stress. Is it any wonder you make friends wherever you go?"
165,,100,Pure,Journey To The West,Benevolence ,"The metaphysics of this world has a way to separate the evil from the good, that being purity. Being pure is being good and kind, humble and beautiful, while being impure is being brash and rude, arrogant and ugly. There’s a lot more to it than that, of course, but if you’d rather not have to bother too much with it, you may have this perk. You are pure of spirit, and your soul shines with a special light that those with exceptional senses are able to notice (although it might be very dim if you’re not Immortal). Moreover, you’re quite stubborn when it comes to corruption, able to resist even great temptations for days on end. You’re not unbreakable, but it’ll take a long while for you to succumb to impurity, at which point you probably have some plan to escape or fight back, right?"
166,,100,The Battle For Your Soul,Heroes of the Storm,Benevolence ,"With a new world comes new temptations, but you won’t be having any of that. Your will is steeled against all sorts of deceits and promises that would result in the loss of your soul, turn you against your allies or otherwise corrupt you. To a much lesser extent your willpower can also resist supernatural forms of corruption, though it would be unwise to rely on it alone."
167,,100,A Father is a Hero,Fate/Legends - Voyage to Valhalla,Benevolence ,"There are many reasons and paths to being a Hero. But the ones who rise to the challenge may not be doing it for the good of a country but for the good of their family. You’re a great father, the kind who could imbue important life lessons into your son and be worthy of said son’s unquestioning trust and love. If you were ordered to shoot an apple of your child’s head, they will not even for a second doubt you could. When it is for your family, you have a feeling what to do to ensure they are safe and happy, even if it means taking down a Tyrant. 

Additionally you have one belief. One virtue. One simple thing so integral to your being you can not break it even if your mind and body were controlled by a Deity. William Tell for one does not hurt children. Never has and never will no matter what. What will you choose?"
168,,100,Epic Saga,Fate/Legends - Voyage to Valhalla,Benevolence ,"Many are the legends of Heroes on their Journeys, warriors seeking glorious battle and wandering vagabonds. The life of one such fighter is a colorful and eventful one. If you wish to experience it for yourself, you may do so. Opportunities for adventure fall into your lap all the time, be it by people coming to you for aid or fate just conspiring to lead you into a village under attack. Occasionally you may even get some life lessons out of it. Make sure your adventures are worth telling."
169,,100,Unchanging Soul,The Elder Scrolls: Dovah,Benevolence ,"You are a dragon, eternal, immortal, unchanging, and unyielding. Though your body might be susceptible to being broken and killed, your soul is different. It cannot be broken or changed, not by anything, even the Daedra. No, the only way your soul may be altered, is if you willingly consent, and even then all changes will be nothing but beneficial to you. There is no chance of you suffering the same, tragic fate of Durnehviir."
170,,100,Force Without Effort,The Elder Scrolls: Dovah,Benevolence ,"There is one unilateral way of understanding that is used by all within the Aurbis. Force, violence. Many use violence to get their way, even the gods, and now you are more proficient in continuing this cycle. You will find yourself three times stronger than before, while your body will see a similar increase in durability."
171,,100,Controlled Descent ,Final Fantasy XIV,Benevolence ,"The Dark Knight’s path is one fraught with peril, and as his name implies, quite a bit of darkness. Though their path is just, and their purposes often virtuous and true, the source of their power puts them at odds with their aims. Many believe that the Dark Knight’s focus is channeled into a seething hatred and anger at the injustice of the world around them, and as the Dark Knight draws on his power – he needs to confront this darkness and risk being consumed.

Thankfully, while you might not be wholly at peace with your inner darkness, you’re well aware of it, and you can control it better than another in your position. You won’t lose yourself to blind fury, and considering how much control you have over your inner turmoil, the attempts of others to cloud your judgment will yield little results."
172,,100,Weathering the Storm,Final Fantasy XIV,Benevolence ,"They expect you to hold the front lines, and that's exactly what you intend to do. Let them break themselves trying to move you aside; you won't yield a step. While they can still overwhelm you with sheer numbers, any attempts by the enemy to shift your position will inherently fail, be it magic or simply brute force. 

Save for those who are inherently far stronger than you, you simply aren't going to budge once you decide to hold the line. In the presence of like-minded comrades, your will is only bolstered by their presence and vice versa, leading all of your comrades nearby to raise themselves to your standard."
173,,100,Hellsguard,Final Fantasy XIV,Benevolence ,"Their Sea Wolf brothers may be at one with the sea, but no one can claim to be at one with the lava as the Hellsguard can. Their choice of locale to reside in has much to do with their ancestral beliefs, as they believe that they have an obligation to watch over the gates to the underworld – and its physical location happens to be at the volcano where they reside.

In Eorzea, many Hellsguard are found in Ul’Dah, and you can get them to teach you the same tricks they possess. Their resistance to heat and fire are phenomenal, and given their living conditions and their physical frame, they have a natural proficiency towards blacksmithing work."
174,,100,Sea Wolves,Final Fantasy XIV,Benevolence ,"Much more in touch with their naval ancestry than their Hellsguard brethren, the Sea Wolves spend most of their time involved with matters related to the sea. Be it as sailors or shipwrights, their expertise never takes them far away from the deep blue.

On top of their expertise with matters related to naval engineering and general navigation, those with the blessing of the Sea Wolves will maintain perfect balance regardless of the circumstance. Must be consequence of all that experience they get serving on the ships."
175,,100,Wildwood Wardens,Final Fantasy XIV,Benevolence ,"The Elezen of the woodlands possess senses far beyond what a Hyur living in the same region would have, both in terms of eyesight and hearing. In locales such as the forests near Gridania, the Wildwood Wardens have formed an unshakeable connection with the Black Shroud, and the Elezen there largely drive the flow of life.

In the presence of flora, the natural regenerative properties of individuals with this blessing increase, with slightly higher rates dependent on the density of flora. Thankfully, their ability to traverse through dense overgrowth is superb, and they can weave through even thick brambles without hindrance."
176,,100,Keepers of the Moon,Final Fantasy XIV,Benevolence ,"Setting a contrast to the Seekers of the Sun, the Keepers of the Moon seem laid back to the point that some would mistake their behavior for laziness. But to mistake their patience for laziness would be a foolish mistake. The Keepers are almost fanatically tenacious, capable of stalking prey until their prey collapses from fatigue.

Under the veil of the night, their abilities improve even further. Whereas the Seekers enjoy the thrill of pursuit, the Keepers take a methodical approach towards hunting. When hunting at night, their speed and strength greatly increase, only improving their capacity to perform crucial surgical strikes on their prey. Considering their night vision is far better than their day vision, it would not be wise to presume that darkness would save you from their predatory gaze."
177,,100,Seekers of the Sun,Final Fantasy XIV,Benevolence ,"As their name suggests, this Miqo’te sect is largely concerned with following the sun – so much so that their entire culture revolves around it. While it can be said that all Miqo’te are excellent hunters following centuries of adaptation and advancement, the Seekers of the Sun have adopted to a specialized form of this lifestyle.

In the presence of daylight, the Seekers are substantially more active – capable of entering phases when their body seems to far surpass normal expectations. Already fast, you would be hard pressed to chase a Seeker in broad daylight as their body improves both in terms of speed and control. Also, they have a high tolerance for heat – better expressed in terms that their bodies have a more sophisticated system for disposing unnecessary heat."
178,,100,No Slave to Darkness ,Horus Heresy: The Primarchs,Benevolence ,"You can be sure your mind will not be hollowed out, stripped of its own free will by the dark powers you serve. You will remain you even as the blessings of the Dark Gods pile up and lesser beings will be turned into nothing more than an appendage of their patron. Perhaps even joining Chaos to fatally undermine it..."
179,,100,Armor Training,Elder Scrolls Online – The Vestige,Benevolence ,"Armor is a useful tool, but sometimes it can be... limiting. Thanks to this perk, you won’t have to worry about that anymore. Want to protect yourself but also sneak around? Your heavy armor counts as a dress. You want to stay light but some of your Perks and skills work better with something more substantial? It qualifies! This Perk cannot make a leather armor as tough as a Daedric one, but aside from that every other limitation is removed."
180,,100,Nega-Summon,Fate/Tale Of The Beasts,Benevolence ,"This ability allows you to cancel all noble phantasms and in future jumps will allow you to cancel any special attacks or techniques that your enemies use against you. Though like Nega-Genesis it will not protect you from any basic attacks from your enemies.

Furthermore, you also have the ability to unsummon any summoned creatures with this ability."
181,,100,Brick(Magnitude 1),Marvel: Age of Krakoa,Benevolence ,"A pretty common power set, superhuman strength coupled with superhuman durability. For 200 points you can lift ten tons, shrug off small caliber gunfire at point-blank range, and withstand an explosion comparable to a frag grenade going off in your chest. You can pay an extra 100 CP to increase both your strength and toughness by a single order of magnitude.

182,,100,Brick(Magnitude 2),Marvel: Age of Krakoa,Benevolence ,"A pretty common power set, superhuman strength coupled with superhuman durability. For 200 points you can lift ten tons, shrug off small caliber gunfire at point-blank range, and withstand an explosion comparable to a frag grenade going off in your chest. You can pay an extra 100 CP to increase both your strength and toughness by a single order of magnitude, or an extra 200 to increase it by two orders of magnitude.

183,,100,Healing Factor(Tier 1),Marvel: Age of Krakoa,Benevolence ,"You heal faster and more efficiently than others do. For 100 CP it’s minor. Minor injuries heal three times faster while major injuries recover a level of scale faster, Ie something that would naturally heal in two months healing in two weeks, though particularly severe injuries may still require medical attention. 

Cannot be Taken With Feral Gene"
184,,100,Healing Factor(Tier 2),Marvel: Age of Krakoa,Benevolence ,"You heal faster and more efficiently than others do. For 100 CP it’s minor. Minor injuries heal three times faster while major injuries recover a level of scale faster, Ie something that would naturally heal in two months healing in two weeks, though particularly severe injuries may still require medical attention. For 200 CP you have proper regeneration, flesh wounds healing before your eyes, broken bones setting themselves, and so on though you may still need assistance to recover from severe nerve or organ damage. 

Requires Healing Factor(Tier 1) to Purchase

Cannot be Taken With Feral Gene"
185,,100,Lucky,Marvel: Age of Krakoa,Benevolence ,"You find that probability tends to bend in your favor when you’re in danger. This ability scales with how much danger you’re in, how fast your heart is beating, how much adrenaline is in your system, and the like. And how active you are: If someone is shooting at you, their gun is more likely to jam if you actively try to dodge their shot than if you just stand still and let them shoot. You also seem to have a mild form of precognitive reflexes, that is to say, you only dodge away from actual danger and never dodge into danger."
186,,100,Stability,Marvel: Age of Krakoa,Benevolence ,"Just as insurance, you’re a particularly stable Deviant. Your random mutations will never have a negative effect on you and, as a bonus, your body cannot be physically altered against your will and you will not suffer any negative effects from anything that changes your body or DNA."
187,,100,Universal Adaptor,Marvel: Age of Krakoa,Benevolence ,"Humans are highly mutable in this universe and are compatible on a genetic level with just about anything. Thus, you take very well to various forms of genetic enhancement. Splicing yourself with animal DNA to gain attributes or abilities of that creature will work out fine, mutagens will have the best possible result with minor or non-existent downsides, superhuman organ grafts will work out just fine with minimal risk of rejection, and in general, you take very well to any and all forms of bio-augmentation. Any such enhancements you receive become a permanent, Fiat-backed part of you."
188,,100,Yin and Yang,Chinese Mythology,Benevolence ,"The duality of the cosmos is expressed in the concepts of Yin and Yang, two forces that give rise to all that is through their interplay. The universe is balanced on a cycle of two opposites, just as your mind is. You possess this balance in both mind and body. You are healthy and fit in body and mind, not being subject to fragility in either."
189,,100,Pocket Watch ,Final Fantasy XIII-3,Benevolence ,"It’s an antiquated pocket watch to keep the time, but the hands have frozen since the internal battery has died. It prevents the bearer from being affected by any temporal slips, unless fate itself intervenes. It’ll protect the bearer from attempts made by weaker individuals to slow them down or change time around them."
190,,100,Release,Final Fantasy XIII-3,Benevolence ,"The prophecy states that the saviour bears the ability to drive back the darkness and lead others towards the light. You suppose that being able to emit a bright flash of light does indeed drive back the darkness, but you’re not quite sure about the second part.

From further notes regarding the saviour, apparently in the presence of the saviour, individuals exhibited signs of growing more cheerful and losing pessimistic tendencies. It seems at least that you could manipulate people’s mindsets somewhat – likely by exposing them to the light. After being exposed to it, the rabbits seemed more inclined to follow you about anyways.

You don’t know when exactly it happened, but somewhere along the line of blasting rabbits with light, you’ve also learned how to convert the light into energy to heal yourself with. Maybe with work, you could heal others too..."
191,,100,Longevity,Devil May Cry,Benevolence ,"You've got a long, exciting life ahead of you, buddy. Well, it probably won't be very long if you emphasize on the exciting part. Your life-span is pretty much infinite now. Once you reach your prime, you will no longer age or grow old. Keep in mind, though, that you can, and most likely will, die when you're killed. Hey, don't let it get you down. It happens to the best of us."
192,,100,Dexterity and Reflexes,Devil May Cry,Benevolence ,"You're able to perform sick acrobatic feats, balance yourself on precarious places such as the tippy-top of a skyscraper that's hurtling towards a Godzilla-sized monster. While on fire. In a zero gravity environment. And all other sorts of cat-like things. Your reflexes are also fast enough that you can dodge almost any attack that you see coming and can catch bullets."
193,,100,Sunsinger(Song of Flame),The Destiny Universe,Benevolence ,"There is, perhaps, no ‘purer’ light than that of a star - the radiance of its fusion reactions illuminating an otherwise dark universe. You have learned the lessons of the stars, using your Light to internalize the same reactions that provide them with their practically endless energy. Your energy reserves are enormous, your rate of recovery so vast that you could go beyond simple conjuring of Light constructs and instead cast Super after Super, annihilating armies as casually as you would turn a page in a book. Finally, purchasing this perk gives you the Radiance Super - allowing you to burn even brighter, filling you with limitless paracausal energy for as long as you can sustain yourself, and allowing you to do anything you are capable of, in as great a quantity as you would wish, until your Radiance fades away. For an extra 100 CP, you can push this ability even further with the Song of Flame Super, which applies the same effects to your allies as well as to yourself.

194,,100,Dawnblade(Well of Radiance),The Destiny Universe,Benevolence ,"Befitting of their unparalleled study and mastery of the Light, Warlocks often find themselves sliding naturally into support roles when fighting alongside other Guardians. While many schools have many means and methods through which they can heal or enhance themselves, none forget that it was the Warlocks who did it first, and mastered the art beyond anything the Titans and Hunters are capable of. This perk grants you a mastery of using the Light to heal others, everything from injury to illness and disease can be wiped away by your Light. Furthermore, when in combat, you can to a limited extent share with your allies any effects that heal or enhance yourself, though this pales in comparison to directly treating them. Finally, this perk grants you access to the Rift ability - both those of Healing and Empowerment, allowing you to either heal or enhance the abilities of anyone that steps within your Rifts. For an extra 100 CP, you can go further and purchase the Well of Radiance Super, a Super that combines the abilities of both Rifts and enhances them to the point where injuries are healed as quickly as they’re made, and the strength of your allies is augmented to twice that which they were capable of on their own.

Requires Dawnblade to Purchase"
195,,100,Woven Strands ,The Destiny Universe,Benevolence ,"By taking matter from the Weave and threading it into armor, you can encase yourself in a suit of psychic chain mail, fortifying any armor you are already wearing and severely reducing incoming damage. 

Requires Strand to Purchase"
196,,100,Amplifying Light(Upgrade),The Destiny Universe,Benevolence ,"Arc Light is the element of motion and conduction, often simplified as ‘electricity’ by outsiders looking in. By channeling it into themself, a Guardian is capable of pushing themselves past even their own prodigious limits, moving faster, thinking and processing information quicker, and striking harder. An extra 100 CP extends this effect to the Guardian’s physical strength and durability, allowing them to lift more, hit harder, and be hit harder in turn.

Requires Amplifying Light to Purchase"
197,,100,Mundane ,The Destiny Universe,Benevolence ,"Through the Light, Guardians are capable of physical feats far and above the absolute peak of their species, and as their mastery of the Light continues to grow, their more mundane powers do as well. Simply at base, you are above the peak example of your race in all respects, and through the Light, what would be called ‘required secondary powers’ are taken care of for you. Balance a building on your shoulders without it or the ground crumbling around you, flip a tank without bending or crushing its treads, possess more strength than your shape or mass should allow for, sprint for hours on end, your powers are paracausal, and even in the mundane world, you will exceed in all respects, and this is just the start of your journey. An extra 100 CP can grant a paracausal boost to the only thing that is left - your mind. The absolute peak of intelligence and learning ability of your race is merely how you will start your second life, a mastery and comprehension of mundane science is second nature to you, and learning the wildly varied ways through which paracausal abilities can interact with the world is the only thing that can even approach challenging for you. Regardless of which version of the perk you possess, this same paracausal boost is applied to other perks that perform similar functions, and as you continue to master and understand your paracausal abilities, you will only grow higher.

Requires The Light of Creation or Dark Purpose to Purchase"
198,,100,Defense ,The Destiny Universe,Benevolence ,"Guardians are able to channel their Light through their clothing and armor, as well as create a force-field like shield made of their Light. This allows them to protect themselves from the dangers of combat and allows whatever they garb themselves with to function as perfectly viable armor - from thick metal and ceramic plate to street clothes purchased from a vendor. You have the same ability: No matter what you wear, you can channel your power through it and its defensive strength will rise to your level, from the barest scraps of clothing scavenged out of a thousand year old mall to advanced power armor made by the greatest engineers. By spending an additional 100 CP, you can now have this protection scale - whereas before anything you wore would be rendered as durable as you are strong, now the more durable and protective something is at base scales with the power you provide it. A suit and tie bought off the street can absolutely be fought in thanks to your powers, but a suit of advanced power armor, with your Light channeled through it, would protect you far more.

Requires The Light of Creation or Dark Purpose to Purchase"
199,,100,Lordship Ring ,Epic of Leviathan,Benevolence ,"This ring is worn by the Lord or Lady of the house and passed down to the heir. The ring has two main purposes. First it is capable of protecting the wearer making them immune to legilimency (and similar abilities), potion effects, poisons, and even warning them of imminent danger. Second, it enhances the user’s growth and makes them more powerful. For example a child who grows up wearing this ring will have larger magical reserves than Dumbledore after they graduate Hogwarts."
200,,100,Pulse of Vitality ,Kult: Divinity Lost,Benevolence ,"Gaia’s first and foremost decree is to live. To breathe. Everything that strives must do so to its utmost. To that end you have an extraordinary regenerative factor, such that you could fulfil all your nutritional needs by devouring chunks of your own flesh or survive the void of space for entire minutes with no long term effect. Even broken bones can mend by themselves over the course of days without fear of dying from complications as long as you have good access to shelter, although often by contorting into shapes modern science would find inexplicable. And when you eat the flesh, bone and blood of others your regeneration spurs itself on even faster-even recuperating a small amount of your mystical energy reserves. "
201,,100,The Taste of Pain,Kult: Divinity Lost,Benevolence ,"Ah, but what’s the point of not being able to take what you dish out? Like the most depraved and perversely devout of Inferno’s religious orders you have something beyond resistance to pain-an affinity for it, somewhere between carnal ecstasy and genuine religious rapture. Each lash excites more than it punishes, each broken bone is a melody you can appreciate and perhaps for this reason you are very, very hard to kill with blood loss or internal injury alone. Furthermore you need no longer fear death by blood loss, for it is good in Astaroth’s eyes that blood flow from wounds as long as it may. This comes with a supernatural wisdom of how best to harm, to maim, to tear apart and excruciate any living thing you get your hands on."
202,,100,Fallen Splendour,Kult: Divinity Lost,Benevolence ,"To be an angel is to need something to believe in, which spelt disaster for those left broken and confused when the Demiurge’s burning presence disappeared from them. Yet you needn’t fear such ravages. There is a celestial beauty about you, one that speaks of radiant divinity. Your form, if human, has a striking, fierce beauty worthy of being a god’s attendant, and you have the bearing and dulcet tones of a saint. Even any inhuman features you have like wing-mounted eyes have a certain grace to them.

But more importantly, however many injuries you sustain from harm physical, mental and metaphysical your physical form will not fail on its own-only to sustained violence or environmental phenomena as long as it’s mostly intact. Even angels with bone-deep wounds, bullet holes riddling their chest, a hole punched through their head or gaping wounds left on their chest by removed armour can prove ferocious fighters; it may still hurt excruciatingly and you are merely heavily resistant to death by infection, not truly immune, but unlike many angels you can withstand the void left by the Demiurge without alcohol or intense nostalgia.

This also comes with an archaic, golden halo made of many tines of light radiating from behind your head within a pale golden disc around your head. You may make this halo appear and disappear as you please."
203,,100,Bloody Useful ,Scion ,Benevolence ,"This man-sized jar is engraved with the caduceus of Hermes, symbolically indicating the purpose of the Gorgon blood within it. For purified and enchanted, this blood is a wondrous curative to all manner of mundane poisons or toxins. Whether injected or imbibed, the plentiful jar refils by itself through some enchantment and also offers access to the Magic purview. Like Asclepius was renowned to, certain rituals the blood of Medusa was famed for may be possible with much study into the ways of magic and the properties of monstrous blood-most likely extending its healing powers to wounds and diseases, although rumours of resurrection are probably exaggerated."
204,,100,Fae-Forged Armor,Fate/Faerie Britain,Benevolence ,"What you have here is a beautiful suit of armor perfectly sculpted to fit your form. It is harder than steel, and serves as an excellent conductor for magical energy, allowing you to channel mana through it to increase its protective qualities. The precise details of your armor’s appearance are up to you."
205,,100,"Love Safely, if You Love at All ",Fate/Faerie Britain,Benevolence ,"Queen Mab, in her attempt at conquering the southern lands, failed because her lover succumbed to mortality. High Queen Morgan, when the faeries yet again turned on her, was halted from blasting them to oblivion only because they held Baobhan Sith hostage. Love is a dangerous thing... but all too often, it’s something you cannot do without.

You, however, have a guarantee of safety for those you care about. If you love someone, the lifespan of you and your lover are averaged, extending and shortening your life to match the one you care about. Of course, if one of you happens to be immortal, this makes your life unending, barring tragic accident.

Speaking of tragic deaths, you have a guarantee that those will never befall your beloved. Oh, they may die, but they will never be killed while they are helpless. If your daughter is sickly and unable to move, no one will take advantage of it; if your lover is asleep, no one will cut his throat. That sort of sad ending to the story isn’t one you and your beloved need to worry about."
206,,100,Shining Blue Star,Fate/Faerie Britain,Benevolence ,"When you’re at your lowest, when despair edges in from all corners and it seems there is nothing worthwhile in the world, you will see this brilliantly shining star. It is hope itself, all the good and beautiful things in this world that are worth living for, worth striving for—and even, should it be truly necessary, worth dying for.

The light of this star will always revitalize you, even when absolute exhaustion weighs down all your limbs; it will reinvigorate you, letting you put forth just a little bit more effort even if you’ve already used up all your special energies; it will refresh your hope, even when all hope seems lost."
207,,100,Guardian Faerie,Fate/Faerie Britain,Benevolence ,"There are many different types of faeries out there, and some of them are particularly attached to objects—metaphysically speaking, that is. Select a single object in your possession to become the guardian faerie of. This object gains fiat- backing, if it did not possess it before. You can always know the location and condition of your item with just a moment of concentration, and are able to render yourself incorporeal, although only for purposes of residing “inside” of your object. Your chosen device/tool/etc. becomes much more energy efficient, as well as more powerful; depending on what it is, the item might even develop new uses or variable settings.

It is impossible for the item you guard to hurt you, and you will not be harmed by any damage it sustains. If it is lost, destroyed, or stolen, your object will be returned to you within a week."
208,,100,Líf,Germanic/Norse Mythology,Benevolence ,"The first gift, life. You have been gifted a powerful soul and will. You are a skilled and well trained member or your race, fit enough to run, endure travel, and fight. You possess the reflexes and instincts to avoid freezing up and to hold your own against two or three normal warriors of your kind, though victory would prove difficult against more than one. You are competent at wielding bows, spears, knives, swords, axes and shields, and are comfortable wearing simple armor. Your body and appearance take on qualities of your choice, great enough to star in your own legendary saga. You could possess beauty enough to inspire poems, a heroic physique imposing enough to demand immediate respect in these lands, the roguish good looks to get away with a truly great deal of mischief, or a terrifying visage that could numb a mortal."
209,,100,Temporal Comprehension ,Final Fantasy XIII-2,Benevolence,"Ability to withstand negative effects of time travel is increased somewhat due to experience. Helps with things like disorientation, attempts to slow you down, attempts to freeze you in place and whatnot. Can also let you control your biological clock to a minor degree (shift sleep cycles and such)."
210,,100,No Kryptonite        ,South Park: The Fractured But Whole,Benevolence,"Much like the Coon, you are now allowed to choose not to have a kryptonite and in future jumps, you’ll find your weaknesses are less effective on you. "
211,,100,Corporal Colorado,South Park: The Stick of Truth,Benevolence,"You can do this all day! You regenerate roughly 10% of your HP a turn, twice as much when you’re in critical condition. Post gauntlet this is a steady form of regeneration."
212,,100,Lay On Hands        ,South Park: The Stick of Truth,Benevolence,"Much like the stalwart Paladin Butters, you have the holy ability to heal mild to moderate wounds with just a touch and some kind words. You can only do this once per turn. Post Gauntlet this is every 10 seconds or so."
213,,100,Protect Your Balls,South Park: The Stick of Truth,Benevolence,"When the going gets tough, you just get tougher. When you are critically injured, your body becomes much harder to damage, reducing any incoming damage by half as long as you are under 25% health."
214,,100,Virtual Sweets Deal No Damage To Your Waistline,Bofuri,Benevolence,"NWO players don’t need to eat, drink, or use the restroom while playing. They can still benefit from eating and drinking, though. (I will take this opportunity to remind you that eating has psychological and social benefits, so remember to eat.) Thus, the same is true for you all the time.

Though buying virtual sweets from a virtual shop will still deplete your virtual wallet. You have to grind to get that gold back.

You also maintain any physical, magical, or skill gains you’ve made. No backsliding into a couch potato for you!"
215,,100,Jumper Of The West,Egyptian Mythology,Benevolence,"It is not possible to destroy the body of a god. Devious Set boasted of committing this act upon Osiris, but in the end all he could do was part the pieces from each other. You can certainly still be killed, in that the vital processes of your body cease and your ba and ka leave it, but the nature of your physical remains themselves endures all manner of punishment. Your body does not decay or bloat or shrivel, even in death, being no different than if life had ceased not a heartbeat ago."
216,,100,The Horus Jumper,Egyptian Mythology,Benevolence,"The blood of gods flows through you, Divine One, and you possess the strength and hardiness of a dozen true soldiers. You are larger than life: a standing taller than almost any other living mortal, every townsperson will look up to you, literally, if not figuratively. Your divine bloodline is easily perceived by other gods, should you not wish to conceal it, and will find yourself treated worthy of their consideration at the lest."
217,,100,El Conquistador,Marvel Zombies,Benevolence,"Those legends of the Fountain of Youth had truth in them after all, and a group of Spanish explorers found it in Florida. And you must’ve found it, too, and bathed in it. Now you’re immortal. You will live forever in your physical prime, but can still be killed by violent action. As a side effect, your emotions have become somewhat dulled and all your blood has been replaced by water (which neither kills you nor grants the same immortality-granting effect). These become toggleable post-jump."
218,,100,Solidarity,Final Fantasy XII,Benevolence,"You come from a line of soldiers, and grew up dreaming of an opportunity to fight as your ancestors did. You weren’t looking to just be a soldier, you wanted to be a leader, and you recognize the benefit of having more people to lead. For each ally within a short distance from you, you all bolster each other’s fighting ability. This is limited to your trusted companions however."
219,,100,Withered Instincts,Black★Rock Shooter,Benevolence,"You don’t belong here, this land, it's far too peaceful compared to the other place, but despite that, you’re still an Otherself, just in the wrong body and those skills you were made with, those have never disappeared.

You will never lose skill or potency with any ability you have or have had in the past. Lose the power to shoot lightning at the strength of generating thunderstorms? If you get it back it will not be as a spark of lightning, but instantly being able to create the same strength of lightning when you were at your peak. This of course doesn’t have to be entirely combat skills and powers but isn’t that what you’re good at?

Hmm, well, over here, it seems like such non-combat skills will be of much more use."
220,,100,Heroic Constitution ,Slay the Princess,Benevolence,"No matter what damage is done to your body, it never seems to matter much so long as your heart still beats. You can keep going regardless of how badly broken you are so long as that remains the case and even having your guts falling free from your stomach only makes it somewhat harder to reliably move or hit back. Blood loss may still prove to be a problem however."
221,,100,Roll the Bones        ,Final Fantasy XI,Benevolence ,"The abilities of a corsair are often tied to luck, if they roll the dice and their luck does not hold they often lose a significant portion of their abilities usefulness. To mitigate that problem however you seem to have developed an uncanny string of luck, although it only works with dice you will find that more often than not your will roll what you want when you want. This is not foolproof however because without the chance of failure it wouldn't be a gamble, and sometimes your luck just can't hold out."
222,,100,Blue Blood,Final Fantasy XI,Benevolence ,"The blood of a Bluemage is not red like that of normal men, it shines blue denoting the infernal experiments they have undergone. While this may seem disconcerting it gives the Bluemage a certain fortitude protecting their soul against erosion. Your soul has become extremely resilient healing from damage that would be permanent in other people."
223,,100,True Love For All,Dies Irae,Benevolence ,"There are so many people in this world that don’t think of anyone but themselves. Those whose powers spread outwards from them without any sort of control, even to the point of harming their allies. You couldn’t stand the very thought and learnt the control to prevent yourself from doing such. You can prevent any of your powers or actions from harming those you care for, no matter how impossible it may seem for it to be so. Your fire won’t burn them, even as it scorches away the enemies right next to them and your Law will not affect them negatively if you wish it to not be so. You can exclude specific people from this if you wish."
224,,100,Worldly Monster,The God of High School,Benevolence ,"A demon you may be called but you are certainly nothing like the hellish things Humans dream up in their spare time. If anything, you are naturally far more in tune with the world around you and the many animals in it than any human. Whilst they will not seek you out to offer you aid with just this, you will never need fear being attacked by any wild animal without provoking it severely first. You may pass through their territory untroubled but threats or attacks will remove what goodwill your nature grants you."
225,,100,PYREFLY INJECTION,Final Fantasy X,Benevolence ,"Need to give your friends even more of a boost? Well that’s what pyreflies are for...there have been techniques using pyreflies to make fiends stronger...and there are those who believe that the presence of pyreflies is enough to attract fiends...which would make one think that there is indeed a connection between the two. For each 100 CP, you can give a companion 10 more units of MP."
226,,100,Eternal Calm,Final Fantasy X,Benevolence ,"There has always been Sin, and there has always been the Calm after Sin. But if there was no Sin...would the Calm not be Eternal? In the thick of battle, the Summoner will not waver. Nothing can break your concentration or interrupt your casting as long as your target is in sight."
227,,100,Cast Iron Stomach,Fate/Stay Night,Benevolence ,"You've been through Hell before. Felt it's very essence pour straight down your gullet and boil in the pits of your stomach. You found the whole ordeal rather scrumptious. Whether the food is ferociously spicy, eye wateringly sour or just plain dangerous to put in your mouth at all, you can gulp it all down without a care in the world. You can still enjoy every bit of it but you'll never find yourself gagging or choking on your food and you'll certainly avoid any of the dreaded after effects of certain foods like a spicy Mapou Tofu. It does need to have been intended as edible food for the general populous, so pouring poison or metal down your throat won't do anything but hurt, but even the nastiest or most dangerous of actual foods are now totally safe. "
228,,100,Grimm Truth,RWBY,Benevolence,"I assume you weren’t a Grimm when you came here. And yet you chose this option, to become Mans and Faunus Predator. But its still you under there. Grimm are not exactly Sentient most of the time, but you are the exception. Your mind is no longer influenced by any forms you might take. Yes even as a Grimm you could be every bit the upstanding Citizen you are... but than what makes you take such a form?"
229,,100,Good Devouring Abomination: Daeva,Avesta of Black and White,Benevolence,"The elite warriors of the Dagravant, extremely rare existences, of which only one or two are born in the same planet at a time. You are one of the warriors of evil. You start as a Class Two Daeva, with enough power to easily take on experienced Yazata or groups. Not only are you stronger than the average warrior of the opposing side, but you also boast the gift of regeneration, albeit on a moderate scale."
230,,100,Shaped Like a Fortress: Unreadable,Avesta of Black and White,Benevolence,"There is something about your thought pattern that makes it really hard for others to get a read on you, and even those who could peer into your thoughts cannot get a good grasp of you. It may be how well-ordered your mind is, not allowing any unwanted thought to pass through, or how used you are to lies that you can even lie in your own thoughts to conceal your true intentions deep within yourself."
231,,100,Put On Some Clothes        ,Fate/Grand Order,Benevolence,"That outfit definitely doesn’t look battle ready, are you sure you wouldn’t prefer some less...flamboyant clothes? No? It’s pretty cold out there, despite your lack of reaction. You don’t really seem to have much reaction at all to things like cold or heat, other than the real extremes. Neither are you ever tripped up in a fight by your own outfit, no matter how large and extravagant it may be. One could say you’re free to wear whatever you want without it negatively affecting you. But that’d be silly. "
232,,100,Gacha Bitch,Fate/Grand Order,Benevolence,"Another five star gold? Damn, you’re making me jealous here. You manage to get just obscene luck when it comes to gambling games. Be it casino gambling or rolling the gacha on a mobile game, you’ll get the result you want 9 times out of 10. If people start cheating against you, your luck might start to not be enough but long as things are fair, you can really rack up the goodies. As a minor side benefit, you also happen to have a quick understanding of how game rules work and a sense for when you are in a game yourself."
233,,100,Flexible Soul,Bibliomania,Benevolence,"Souls are both flexible and rigid and now your soul is fairly more flexible and as a result can endure and evade soul targeting effects much easier, it's not immunity though. This makes it so that soul damage will heal shockingly fast meaning that even if you were reduced to a shred of a soul barely clinging to life it would only take a year of rest to recover fully even without treatment which would be magnified for healing your soul now. Your soul can endure 3 times the damage and pressure as before and as a result soul effects are weaker on you, unless beneficial in which case benefits will be 3 times as potent while negatives 1/3rd as effective. And due to how your soul is now evasive, soul harming effects are 1/10th as effective as they should be to the point that even Avada Kedavra from the Harry Potter universe would only push you back and cause a lot of pain unless hit with multiple of them. Hell because of your soul you're also 10% resistant to magic and other supernatural effects in general."
234,,100,Natural Optimism,Bibliomania,Benevolence,"You are now a naturally optimistic and cheerful person drastically reducing the effect of negative emotion on you as well as meaning your default is now slightly happy at all times. Anything that would bring you even a little joy would be much more potent and anything that brings you a negative emotion would have slightly less direct impact and would fade quicker. Your emotions are also protected meaning it would be substantially harder to manipulate your emotions in any way, even supernatural effects would need to be 10 times more potent to have 1/10th the effect they normally would. Due to this optimism you have a now passive motivation to do anything meaning its not only harder to get board but easier to motivate yourself to do anything even things you don’t like."
235,,100,Mental Endurance,Bibliomania,Benevolence,"Your mind is strong and enduring capable of enduring 20 times the mental fatigue of a normal person and more importantly having a natural mind capable of fending of and resisting outside influence to the point it would take an incredibly powerful psychic trying to mess with you to actually affect you, even passive effects that erode the mind would have to be strong enough to lobotomized a normally strong minded woman within seconds to have any affect on you over days and even then your mental recovery is something surprising allowing you to go from seriously mental damaged to peak mentality within 24 hours. Just keep in mind that this is a powerful resistance not immunity."
236,,100,Byakko’s Earth Purification,Kurohime,Benevolence,"The spirits were on this world before the gods ever appeared, and it is their home. Like Byakko, you have the power to repel corruptive or transformative powers that would alter the environment; if a god were to summon the Sanzu no Kawa and you were present, you could keep it from forming and prevent the area from plunging into the afterlife."
237,,100,Unbreakable Will,Kurohime,Benevolence,"You are astonishingly resistant to outside forces that want to pervert your mind— or to twist your body. Your willpower is strong enough to resist transformation and mind-controlling magic. It won’t provide complete immunity, but if you keep your resolve strong, then you may be able to stop a transformation partway or keep your mind free even if your body changes."
238,,100,He’s Fast ,Jujutsu Kaisen,Benevolence,"It is a natural thing for a human’s physical abilities to degrade with age. With time, their reactions dull, their movements slow, their strength weakens. Yet with the use of cursed energy, it is entirely possible to mitigate this decline. None make this more apparent than Naobito Zenin who, despite being in his 70s, is regarded as the fastest living sorcerer.

It seems you’re of a similar make to him, as no matter how old you get, your physical abilities will not degrade in the slightest. Even in old age, you’ll be running and fighting with the spryness of someone decades younger than you. You won’t just be agile for your age, though – you’re surprisingly agile in general. It’s not to a superhuman level, but you’ll have no trouble leaping, freerunning, and dodging like a world-class acrobat."
239,,100,Passed Basic,Final Fantasy VII,Benevolence,"A successful SOLDIER candidate or an escaped lab rat? It doesn't really matter, the end result is the same. You have received a basic infusion of both Mako and Jenova cells, which has enhanced your physical abilities considerably. You are much stronger, faster, and tougher than the average human in this world. Cutting through reinforced steel, surviving anti-vehicle weapons with a few bruises, leaping and running several times better than an ordinary human...you can do it all. These enhancements will grow with you as you gain more experience through Still More Fighting. The cells will also keep your body in fit physical condition, as well as giving your eyes a soft green glow. As an added bonus, your sample is miraculously free of influence from Jenova or Sephiroth, and you may toggle the glow of your eyes on and off post-jump."
240,,100,Iceborn,Legends of Runeterra,Benevolence,"You cannot survive in the icy climate of the Frejlord without some kind of protection. Fortunately, you’re an Iceborn, and so you’re innately resistant to cold, to the point that you can go around in winter with just a shirt and require heavier clothes only in the most arctic situations. You’re also resistant to ice magic and can manipulate True Ice, even if even for you it’s painful to touch."
241,,100,Healing Kit,Fairy Fencer F,Benevolence,"Ah yes this is a classic. What sort of adventurer would you be without a ready supply of Potions on hand for healing? A dead one. This sturdy medical kit comes complete with 8 Potions, 4 Mid Potions, 2 High Potions, and 1 Ultra Potion. Fully restocks weekly but the lowest Potions restock daily. Try to stay alive out there, Jumper."
242,,100,I’ve Got No Strings,Fairy Fencer F,Benevolence,"Most of the time Fairies need a Fencer to manifest outside of their Fury. With this Perk you don’t need anyone but yourself. You are fully capable of wielding your Fury personally and can use it with impressive skill. In future Jumps this Perk makes it so that trying to control you fails. If you find yourself stuck in another relic you can somehow find a way to use it without help. However, if used by another Background besides Fairy it gives a large boost to willpower."
243,,100,Mental Shields,Inheritance Cycle,Benevolence,"You form mental shields over your mind, making it hard for magic to penetrate your thoughts and mind unless you allow it to do so. For an extra 100 CP, you also get the “Mental Swords"" i.e. countering attempts at intrusion by ""poking"" their minds using “useless” data/memory when it appears that your guard is down."
244,,100,Well Forged Saber (Tier 1),Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Benevolence,"Some Sabers are as weak as they look, lithe young ladies whose physical power comes from magic rather than muscle. Not you, though. You’ve got the guts and the brawn to go toe-to-toe with a Servant from the get go. A weak one, maybe, but it is a start. Your physical attributes are well into the superhuman range, tens of times beyond what a human could naturally achieve. This could be an even spread, equal to a lower level Servant who focused on combat, or it might be focused into a specific Statistic. An especially Agile Saber is common, putting the speed and agility to use against lumbering enemies."
245,,100,Survival Camper X,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Benevolence,"Wherever a Saber’s path takes them, they must go. Unfortunately, that usually means some really hostile places. But a Saber must persevere even in such a dire absence of hamburgers. Though rarely as comfortable, you’re more than capable of surviving on almost any biome found in the Servant Universe. A great hunter and superb camper, you’ll be able to eke out an uncomfortable but stable living even on a sun scorched hellhole or some hurricane swept icy death world. It even helps you make quick tracks across such inhospitable worlds, in case you need to get off world quick."
246,,100,Innocent Bystander,Honkai Impact 3rd,Benevolence,"You have a minor form of plot armor that allows you to avoid getting involved in stuff that you have no correlation to, perhaps beyond just being in the wrong place at the wrong time. You know just what words to say, what actions to take, and what body language to assume to get yourself out of any situation that you have not directly involved yourself into – regardless of whether you were involved with, or without, your knowledge."
247,,100,Potion Kit,Final Fantasy VI,Benevolence,"This leather satchel contains an assortment of healing potions native to this world, all packed carefully enough to survive even a raging river rapid ride. They come in regular strength, high strength, and extra strength varieties. The satchel can hold ten regular strength potions and five of the two other kinds. It will automatically refill any used bottles for you once every month."
248,,100,Youthful Energy,Final Fantasy VI,Benevolence,"Magic isn’t just a source of power to be drawn on for casting spells. It’s the essence of life, a building block of this world given an outlet. Surrounding yourself in it and learning to live with it instead of bending it to your will can have so many more possibilities. Like the Magi, you have a passive connection with magic that invigorates your body. You’ll feel the effects of fatigue and age less keenly than you otherwise would."
249,,100,Blessings of the Road,God Of War (2018),Benevolence,"You have traveled far and wide haven't you? And during that time your body has adapted to survive in many environments. You could walk across a country with no footwear and find that your feet would be in need of cleaning but otherwise uninjured unless something stabbed you in the foot. Stepping on branches, walking over gravel, walking through snow, none of it affects you beyond noticing how it feels on your skin. This also grants you a greater resistance to temperature requiring supernaturally created temperatures to harm you. Wanna walk out of water that is cold enough to have glaciers? Now you can, though you do have to worry about the whole breathing issue unless you have a solution to that."
250,,100,What’s Going on in that Empty Head?,God Of War (2018),Benevolence,"Ever had problems with mind-readers or those who are able to perceive your actions before you make them? With this perk, you find that your thoughts and intentions are a little trickier to read then most. Given enough time, this alone wouldn’t stop anyone, but will your opponent have the time to concentrate on that in the thick of combat? This is toggleable."
251,,100,This Is My Stick ,Thailand Mythology and Folklore,Benevolence,"Sometimes all you need is a sturdy stick to beat people up. So you have gotten your hands on this particular Bo staff. Hard and tough enough that it can match up with steel blades, amazingly balanced for combat, and strangely never becomes unusably slippery no matter what conditions it’s dragged through, this staff will serve you well should you ever get into a fight. And also, it has some magical use, as hitting a victim of a curse with it hard enough to bruise will do wonders to alleviate the curse’s effects, and if whatever malicious magic they’re under is weak enough you could dispel it entirely, such as bonking a charmed person back to clarity. Perhaps it was blessed by a priest before you got your hands on it?"
252,,100,My Parents Are Normal,DxD Universe,Benevolence,"Normal and safe! This grants plot armor to any normies you are family or friends with, this basically means your enemies won't target them, if they do learn about the supernatural this protection goes away."
253,,100,Elixir Pack,Final Fantasy V,Benevolence,"Twenty elixirs, capable of restoring its imbiber to full life and power. Elixirs return at one per week after use, to a max of 20."
254,,100,Regeneration,Final Fantasy V,Benevolence,"Unlike those mortals that deal with the normal elements, your connection with the Void supplies you with a virtually unlimited regeneration. As long as your head is not destroyed (and even then, as long as it is mostly intact) you can regenerate from your wounds, restoring yourself to whole. The more damaged you are, the longer it will take, but it will never take more than a day to restore yourself to full health."
255,,100,Courage,Final Fantasy V,Benevolence,"You are immune to all forms of fear, pure and simple. A heart of fire burns within your chest, making you willing and able to continue forward despite being aware of any potential fear. As a bonus, allies are also emboldened by your presence, and all fear effects are greatly lessened upon them."
256,,100,Noble Title and Demense,Asura’s Wrath,Benevolence,"As a citizen of Shinkoku Trastrium, you benefit from all the scientific advances in health and the like- You are at the peak of healthy and age at a rate of 1 physical year every 10 years, assuming go out of your way to engage in truly legendary bouts of sloth or hedonism. A balanced lifestyle keeps you at the prime of your life. You also have an opulent heavenly estate that follows you for the rest of your life."
257,,100,The Will to Stand up Straight,Library of Ruina,Benevolence,"As a battle continues onwards, emotions run high, people grow excited, bloodthirsty, and desperate. For you, this has a more pronounced effect, your reserves of power refilling in bursts as dramatic revelations or turns happen, and your speed ever so slightly increasing to keep up with the ever-excitable pace of battle."
258,,100,Elixir Pack ,Final Fantasy IV,Benevolence,"Ten elixirs, capable of restoring its imbiber to full life and power, as well as a megalixir, an aerosol form that can do this same massive recovery to a group. Elixirs return at one per month after use, to a max of 10, and Megalixir is returned once per year."
259,,100,Brace ,Final Fantasy IV,Benevolence,"Martial arts focuses around one’s body turned into both weapon and armor. Thickening skin, bone and internal organs through training leads you to this particular talent. Whenever you are prepared for an attack, you can use your training to strengthen your defenses against it. When prepared, the incoming power of the attack is reduced to a fourth, even before any other defensive abilities you have come into play."
260,,100,"Jumper, The Eternal ",HighSchool DxD,Benevolence,"As it says in the tin, immortality of the ageless variety, plus a hefty regeneration factor. You can still be killed or sealed, by someone powerful or skillful enough, but otherwise you can just sit down and wait for the end of times. Even if you get into a bad fight, with enough time you will regenerate from even the deadliest of wounds. Likewise, you have some natural resistance to curses and poisons, although it mostly applies to the mortal ones."
261,,100,Invisible Snow Mist ,HighSchool DxD,Benevolence ,"The attacks of lesser fighters, that come to challenge you, are like the bites of mosquitoes, mostly harmless and all-around annoying. Thus, just to save yourself some time, you have developed a passive ability to to just ignore any power, attack or effect that isn’t at least somewhat close to your tier of power. To put it simply, unlike David and Goliath, there won’t ever be someone weaker than you that manages to hurt you, much less defeat you. Their powers, curses, debuffs, poisons, and punches are straight up useless. They’re going to need to be around your level if they want to even be worthy of your attention."
262,,100,Mana Burst Brave D,Fate/Csjete Halloween Trilogy,Benevolence ,Cause small magical explosions inside your body by detonating your own energy. Mildly painful to use and somehow gives a decent boost to your durability.
263,,100,Regeneration,Lobotomy Corporation,Benevolence ,"You will find wounds quickly heal and limbs will regenerate at an inhuman pace. Given a few minutes, it is possible for you to shift from ""bleeding to death"" to ""stumbling on your own two feet again"". The pain doesn't stop, however, and it can be maddening as you feel your body unnaturally shift and warp as it pieces itself together."
264,,100,100 Gates ,Records of Ragnarok Gauntlet (Humans),Benevolence ,"Have you ever heard the story of the Sumo Wrestler Raiden Tameemon? His strength was so great he ended up harming himself, his muscles causing him agony even as he learned walking. Out of sheer will he build new muscles in his body to better control his inhuman strength. Such a skill is now yours and more. Abilities that harm you as a side effect may be lessened and be more controllable by this perk via developing countermeasures. Maybe you make new muscles or gain a way to cancel or lessen a spell. However keep in mind this will only work for powers that actively harm you. The full power that is contained with this Perk will still harm you."
265,,100,Formerly Divine,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Benevolence ,"With the break of their halo, the angels found their bodies weakened. Their strength, speed, reflexes, and their senses all lessened. While there were worries about how this would affect them, they simply began to practice to recover their lost strength. While the divinity was lost, their bodies remembered the strength it should have and adapted.

When you lose something that had granted you power passively until it had simply become part of you, you will find that not only can you bounce back from the loss, but you can bounce back faster than most if it is at all possible."
266,,100,20 Minutes of Nonstop Action,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Benevolence ,"Those that are forced past the barrier each day frequently fall to the hordes from exhaustion or running out of resources. The few who consistently survive surely have some wits, but stamina and preparation are the major factors. You seem to be one of those with the potential to live despite the harsh situations. Regardless if you are one that is forced into almost nightly fights for your life or not.

For 20 minutes every day you seem to have inexhaustible stamina. This doesn't improve your instantaneous capacity, simply how long you can go. Additionally, so long as you do some reasonable preparations, you'll find that whatever resources you'd use (such as ammo or first aid equipment) will last at least for the first 20 minutes. To be clear on the limits of this, you do need to bring a reasonable cache of those resources to use, if someone were to question how you still have some to spare this perk won't close that gap by itself.

This perk is granted for free for the duration of this jump, however you may purchase it for an additional 100 CP to keep the benefits for future jumps."
267,,100,Hunter,Fate/Legends - Baba Yaga,Benevolence ,"Food is necessary for all creatures with bone and skin. And in this cruel land it can be hard to come by. At least you may have an easier time than most, as you are a skilled hunter. Tracking your prey and shooting them dead, to later butcher and bleed them and even make bait out of what you don’t feel like eating is all an option to you. With this also comes knowledge of a handy spell that makes poisonous flesh edible. Situational but in the right circumstances the difference between a starving or full stomach."
268,,100,Weather the Aeons,Godbound,Benevolence ,"Relicts are all that remain of the truly lost empires, leftover life rendered strange and worn by the terrible compromises and horrific alterations they had to made in order to survive the collapse of their world. If yours ever ends though, with this you can be ready for it. You have a great adaptability for sustaining everything you need to live when the world does away with it. If the atmosphere vanishes, after several hours of desperate heaving your lungs will adapt to breathing without it. If the food runs out you’ll still be hungry and weaker, but your body won’t actually die on you. It’s not a comfortable existence, but with some pain you can avoid having to sell your soul for survival. And where those things are plentiful your ever-adaptable physiology truly excels, quickly just a little past the peak of other men in all bodily traits."
269,,100,Legendary Weapon Set(Shield),Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Benevolence ,"Lastly, for an additional 100cp, you can add a legendary shield to your set. Your shield may also be of any style you would like. As with your weapon(s), it will always feel light for you, be easy to use, and has been magically empowered to outperform mundane shields.

Requires Legendary Weapon Set to Purchase"
270,,100,Magic Shield,Disney Princess,Benevolence ,"A shield that will fend off elemental attacks, but only absorbs the force of a blow as a normal shield would."
271,,100,“I Am” Song ,Disney Princess,Benevolence ,"Establish your identity with a tune. Wards off up to mid-level mind control, the corrupting influence of various magics, and lower levels of demonic possession. More powerful and passionate performances increase this effect."
272,,100,Tiny Being's Ring,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Benevolence ,"A ring made from black iron and embedded with an ancient tiny red jewel. Though it may appear unassuming, it is highly useful for any combatant, granting them a bit of extra vitality. Even in the most heated of conflicts, all one needs is a small chance to grasp victory."
273,,100,Ring of the Sun Princess,Dark Souls: Covenants,Benevolence ,"This elegantly engraved ring is granted to those who enter a Covenant with Gwynevere, daughter of Lord Gwyn and the Princess of Sunlight. This slightly warm ring boosts the power of any defensive and supportive miracles you wish to cast, as well as any other similarly holy abilities."
274,,100,Cursebite Ring,Dark Souls: Covenants,Benevolence ,"One of the infamous bite rings commissioned by Sir Arstor of Carim, made of iron and with a gem carved into the shape of a skull. Despite the dreadful rumors surrounding its creation, this ring is an unmistakable asset, in its ability to help improve one’s resistance to curses."
275,,100,Bare Bones,Dark Souls: Covenants,Benevolence ,"The dead are many things, but needy has seldom been one. Your newfound state has been surprisingly kind to you, removing your need for many things, like food or water or sleep. All you need to survive is for all of your bones to be mostly intact. You can optionally cast aside your flesh, becoming a fully animated skeleton."
276,,100,Only a Man,Hellsing,Benevolence ,"Is humanity really so valuable as to warrant all this time spent worrying over it? Perhaps it’s something that can only be truly understood once you’ve lost it yourself or at least spent time with those who lament it’s sacrifice. The nature and value of man and mortality has rarely been unclear to you, what it means to be human in your mind is quite a clear concept. And reclaiming that humanity, however you see it taking form, is never impossible. 

Though the path may be long, you find that nothing can prevent you from reaching a point where you can consider yourself a human. Should it be the curse of vampirism that hinders your beliefs, a cure might be possible. Worries of losing your humanity if you give into your blood hunger might reveal a path as yet unrealised that lets you survive as both vampire and human. "
277,,100,Cats Always Land on Their Feet ,Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,Benevolence ,"One of Puss in Boots’ most stupid deaths is when he got drunk and jumped off a clock tower. He wanted to prove that he would land on his feet no matter what. Well actually are capable of pulling off this feat. You might not actually land on your feet, but you find that you are never injured from falls no matter how high. Even if you are wearing heavy armor and jump off a cliff you will not be hurt. Perhaps you land in the perfect spot cushioning yourself. This effect will also extend to anything and anyone you are carrying. For example, if you picked someone up and jumped off of a clock tower neither of you would be hurt by the impact. They might be terrified asking if you are crazy, but they will be unharmed by the fall."
278,,100,Immortality,Disney’s Hercules,Benevolence ,"Come on, you know how this works. You no longer age, no disease or poison can hurt you... unless they’re really, really powerful magic, on the level of ‘potion to make a god mortal’ powerful. Even they have proportionally reduced effects. You’re eternal."
279,,100,Choir Bell,Bloodborne: Covenants,Benevolence ,"A special hunter tool of the Choir, high-ranking members of the church. Fashioned after a bell that projects an arcane sound across planes of existence. The sound of this smaller, silver version of the bell does not cross planes, but grants vigor and healing to all nearby allies, as well as removing whatever inflictions they may be suffering from."
280,,100,Rune of the Hunter ,Bloodborne: Covenants,Benevolence ,"Within your mind, the Caryll Rune of the Hunter has been engraved, marking you as the newest Hunter of Hunters. In a battle of hunters, it is those who can last the longest who have the better chances of success, and with your newly improved stamina and the speed at which it replenishes, you’d be hard pressed to find an equal."
281,,100,Rune of Radiance,Bloodborne: Covenants,Benevolence ,"Within your mind, the Caryll Rune of Radiance has been engraved, marking you as a member of the Executioners, a branch of the Healing Church. The brilliant light of this rune makes it so then the effects of all healing items and regenerative abilities are twice as potent as before."
282,,100,Rune of Corruption,Bloodborne: Covenants,Benevolence ,"Within your mind, the Caryll Rune of Corruption has been engraved, marking you as one of, if not the last, loyal follower of Annalise, Queen of the Vilebloods. This rune not only grants you an immunity to all mundane diseases, but you will find your wounds slowly closing, turning a fatal wound into something more manageable in just ten minutes, provided you survive what gave you the wound."
283,,100,Healing,Avatar: The Legend Of Korra,Benevolence ,"The ability to heal wounds by redirecting chi throughout the body, using water as a catalyst. Healing is able to repair almost all cellular damage and can remove many known diseases, however it unable to reverse mortal injuries or conditions, unless water with special spiritual properties is used.

Requires Bender(Water) to Purchase"
284,,100,Satanic Strength,Ghost Rider,Benevolence ,"You possess strength far greater than that of a human, capable of sending mortals flying with one punch and shattering stone with effort. Most firearms won’t come close to piercing your skin, and you could easily survive getting hit by a truck- though that one might hurt a bit. This power comes from your true nature as a demon, or possibly from some sort of minor demonic heritage or other supernatural source. "
285,,100,Puissance,Marvel Primal,Benevolence ,You once consumed a mysterious heart-shaped herb and ever since have been stronger and swifter than other men.
286,,100,Diverging Timelines,Marvel Primal,Benevolence ,"All the time-travelers here made this an inevitability. You cannot be erased from history, or altered even as the timeline changes around you."
287,,100,Mental Shielding,X-Men the Claremont Years,Benevolence ,"Did you train under Xavier? I’d probe your memories to see, but that’s proving more difficult than usual. Maybe it was some other secret organization’s training. Regardless, like most of Xavier’s students your mind is shielded against mental intrusion. This is far from absolute, even the X-Men find their mental defenses penetrated (very often) but it’s a fair deal better than average. Like them you are able to shield your thoughts against mental influences and scans. While there are definitely passive benefits, this seems to work best when you are aware of the threat, and even then it can be overpowered; this might slow down Xavier or the Shadow King but it won’t stop them, and even lesser threats can overcome this defense. In theory you could receive such training in jump, but because you are paying CP for this it will apply to other mental threats regardless of their nature; it still won’t be absolute, but it will work on magic spells, eldritch knowledge, assaults on your soul, and what have you as well as it does against telepathic assault. If you want something closer to immunity look at Limbo Sorcery or Shielded Helmet."
288,,100,Medallion of Worship ,Thor: Love and Thunder,Benevolence ,A medallion depicting a god of your choice. Wearing it makes you just a little luckier and makes your prayers slightly likelier to be heeded by the gods. Tearing it off in their presence and telling them that you renounce them (or otherwise insulting them) is guaranteed to get at least a small rise out of them.
289,,100,Artist Forgot Your Protective Wear         ,Marvel 2099,Benevolence ,"Sometimes in comics they establish you need protective wear to go somewhere. And then in the next issue they draw you without it like it was never necessary in the first place. You carry something of this in a more intentional form. You receive the protection against environmental hazards of anything you have worn to protect you against them within the last 24 hours. This won’t help you against direct attacks against you, or anything but the most indiscriminate environmental attacks, but if reality forgets your gas mask, or you just forget to put it back on after taking it off to talk to someone, you’ll be fine even walking around Hellrock which is established to cause permanent mutation within moments of contact of its atmosphere with the skin."
290,,100,I’m Mortal,Amalgam Comics,Benevolence ,"Like Savage Shaw, you are ageless and immune to all disease."
291,,100,Fortune,Amalgam Comics,Benevolence ,"You are lucky enough for it to count as a superpower, your enemies tend to trip or miss you when most needed."
292,,100,Amazon ,Amalgam Comics,Benevolence ,"Technically human, but gifted by the goddesses with immortality and superhuman strength and grace. The Amazons live on a hidden island paradise the world only recently rediscovered thanks to the efforts of Wonder Woman and the renegade princess, Diana."
293,,100,Superhuman Stamina ,Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Benevolence ,"The fortitude and hardiness to keep going and resist less obvious sources of damage. This can be purchased three times; the first purchase makes it so you no longer need to breathe and grants a small amount of resistance to poison, disease, and (non-supernatural) radiation, the second causes your body to no longer need sleep and increases your resistances moderately, while the third purchase makes it so you no longer need food or water and grants immunity to poison, disease, and radiation.

May be Purchased Three Times"
294,,100,Superhuman Body,Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Benevolence ,"The strength to punch giant monsters and the durability to get punched right back. This can be purchased four times; the first purchase will let you lift around 5 tons and tank small arms fire, the second will allow you to lift around 20 tons and survive small explosions, while the third will allow you to lift 50 tons and survive large explosions. The last purchase costs 300 CP on top of the previous purchases, but makes you truly mighty- capable of feats of strength on par with Thor and requiring a similar amount of punishment to be taken out.

May be Purchased Four Times"
295,,100,Exorcism,Fate,Benevolence ,"The most basic skill any agent of the church learns is how to banish spirits and demons from the bodies of the faithful. You are a master of this art, and while a True Demon may be out of your reach, you can easily expel any spirit from the body of another with only a short ritual."
296,,100,That is Normal,Toaruverse,Benevolence ,"Dressing in skimpy outfits during a battle doesn’t bring any benefits and protection other than distraction for your opponents though it doesn’t work in most cases. The outfits that you now wear no matter how skimpy and don't protect the vital parts of your body would do now. It doesn’t matter if you’re wearing shorts or even a panty that is as durable as steel, it would provide protection throughout your body by making a thin layer of protective barrier that is as durable as steel. This applies to anything that can be classified as clothing or armor."
297,,100,Channelling,A Certain Magical Index,Benevolence ,"You’re knowledgeable in and great at channelling mana through objects. You can channel mana through weapons, armour, constructs, and the like to power them and empower them with great efficiency. A sword might glow with energy or become bathed in fire while a set of armour might become more resilient or even bathe the area in sunlight. A set of armour from the Knights of England will work much better than it would for another person. Given enough time, you might even learn how to take it one step further and empower yourself. The sky’s the limit. However, channelling isn’t very versatile, and it won’t really help you create electricity blasts, for example."
298,,100,Aegis Scale ,Darkest Dungeon,Benevolence ,"A mysterious scale from the distant wastes; when used, it offers fierce protection and nullifies all damage from a single strike. You get one scale a week. "
299,,100,Heaven’s Hairpin,Darkest Dungeon,Benevolence ,"A beautiful hairpin depicting an angelic being; when worn it helps ward against stress and steadies aim, so long as there is light present. "
300,,100,Martyr’s Seal,Darkest Dungeon,Benevolence ,"An award for near-suicidal bravery; pinning this to your chest increases your health moderately. But when on the cusp of death, it also greatly invigorates the body-increasing one’s strength massively and even helping to stave off death. "
301,,100,Recovery Charm ,Darkest Dungeon,Benevolence ,"A strange, circular blue stone resembling the shell of a deep sea creature. Holding it greatly increases the amount of healing done to you from any source."
302,,100,Moon Cloak,Darkest Dungeon,Benevolence ,"Unsurprisingly, the Moon Cloak is an equivalent to the Sun Cloak that works only in darker conditions; it is almost thrice as effective in comparison when in the dark. "
303,,100,Solar Crown,Darkest Dungeon,Benevolence ,"A crown that depicts an image of the sun on its front. When worn, it helps ward against stress and insanity so long as there is adequate light nearby. "
304,,100,Sun Cloak ,Darkest Dungeon,Benevolence ,"A defensive counterpart to the Sun Ring, this cloak enables its wearer to evade blows more easily- and softens those that land- when worn in dim or brighter light. "
305,,100,Luck of the Draw,Darkest Dungeon,Benevolence ,"“Good fortune and hard work may yet arrest this plague.” Luck; that most ephemeral of qualities that all seem to claim, for good or for bad. Just as the roll of a dice determines the winner at the gambling hall, so to does chance play a part in combat. Fortunately the fates seem to smile upon you; a roll of the dice and the flip of a coin landing in your favor more often than not. Although this won’t save you from certain peril or truly unfortunate circumstances your good luck can make the difference between narrowly avoiding harm or death- and what’s more, your own strikes seem to be far more likely to both hit their mark and deal grievous harm. Needless to say, but you could easily win a good stake at the gambling tables."
306,,100,Welcoming Feast,Trinity Wonder,Benevolence ,"When visiting new places, and being welcomed by guests, it is often customary to have a welcoming meal. If you happen to be rich, this can be something more of a welcoming feast. This is a massive table filled with food. Whole cooked chicken, turkey, roasted potatoes, sprouts, gravy and so much more. It’s more than enough to feed a large party, let alone a few guests. This table can be reused once a week."
307,,100,Alkahestry(300),Generic Alchemist ,Benevolence ,"You are familiar with the fundamental processes of life and living, as well as the flows of metabolic energy throughout the body and how this links to alchemy itself. For 100cp, this allows you to sense your own metabolic energies, as well as how it interacts with anything you ingest or any supernatural effects applied to you. This also gives you surprising bodily control.

For an additional 100cp, you gain the ability to sense the flows of metabolic energy in everything within several meters around you, which can expand over time given training and focus on the practice. You can also use this to sense the lingering energies in alchemical ingredients to determine their properties and how potent they are, as well as aiding in the monitoring of alchemical processes.

For a final 100cp, you have learned to manipulate the metabolic energy you can sense to allow you some measure of enhanced physical ability and healing, the latter of which you can apply to others. This also allows you to speed up, slow down, or outright halt alchemical processes for a time. Finally, this can be used, alongside precision strikes, to block up the metabolic energies to cause temporary, usually harmless, paralysis in your foes.

Requires Alkahestry(100) and Alkahestry(200) to Purchase"
308,,100,Proper Storage ,Generic Alchemist ,Benevolence ,"Most potions are stored in glassware of some kind, which can be quite fragile at the best and worst of times, making carrying them with you a risk. Not anymore. Anything you have stored on your person will be much harder to break or degrade in any fashion unless you actively want it to break in some fashion. You also know several methods to store fragile objects in such a way that they are much harder to break in general, as well as how to keep them from direct strikes that would break them deliberately."
309,,100,Iron Stomach,Generic Alchemist ,Benevolence ,"You are inured to the foul smells, disturbing sounds, disgusting tastes, unsettling sights, and strange sensations that can come from the pursuits of alchemy. Your senses cannot be overwhelmed by extraneous stimuli in any form and your ability to feel disgust from these sensations can be suppressed as will. This ensures that you will not feel sick from anything your senses perceive."
310,,100,A Learning Experience ,Generic Alchemist ,Benevolence ,"You are not discouraged by failure, your failures instead acting as a motivator to do better and helping you to learn a bit faster, roughly twice as fast. Additionally, any failures you make while learning or training will rarely result in significant injury and will never result in permanent injuries."
311,,100,Doran's Shield,League of Legends,Benevolence ,"This simple wooden buckler was created by a young artificer, and was imbued with a small measure of resolve. Wearing this shield will very slowly heal wounds and slightly bolter your innate toughness against physical attacks."
312,,100,Guardian,League of Legends,Benevolence ,"You're good at protecting your friends. As your role is to dive into the enemy team and be a big target, you've gotten good at taking punishment. Your toughness reduces incoming damage by a small amount, and whenever you're in the line of fire for the sake of a friend, your damage reduction increases- It'll never be anything more than marginal, but every little bit helps."
313,,100,Iron Jaw,Arcane,Benevolence ,"You don’t last long in Zaun without being able to take a hit and get back up again. Your body is tough and resilient; you can take more punishment than most, and you’re more resilient to poisons, diseases and any negative side-effects from other substances, though you can still enjoy any positive effects they may have."
314,,100,Magical Freedom,A Throne of Glass,Benevolence ,"This perk gives you immunity to widespread magic restrictions that have been artificially put into place. A spell has been cast which turns off magic across a continent? You’re able to use your magic without any effects, a blight has been spread across the land that weakens all magic? You are unaffected. This does not make you immune to deliberate traps set for you, and should someone make a trap that targets you in particular, this perk will not help you. This perk does not prevent Iron from blocking your magic from this world."
315,,100,Keep your Focus,Super Dragon Sword,Benevolence ,"By utilizing a moderate portion of your mana, you are capable of giving each of your allies the Focused and Motivated effects, allowing them to gain a notable increase in their accuracy and allowing them to resist negative mental statuses."
316,,100,Protection Order,Super Dragon Sword,Benevolence ,"It would be embarrassing if you somehow got caught out in the middle of combat, or worse, failed your subjects. You can give your allies a standing Guard or Protect order. If ordered to Guard, they will be much more responsive about parrying, deflecting, or dodging any attacks aimed their way. If ordered to Protect, they will prioritize intercepting any attacks aimed your way, taking much less damage in the process."
317,,100,Guardian Soul,Super Dragon Sword,Benevolence ,"You are capable of acting as a guardian angel to your allies. You are able to enter a state of protective instincts, during which you will automatically intercept any strikes meant for your allies. Your defenses are heightened during this state, causing you to take reduced damage - but you are unable to defend yourself if you are the target of any attacks, taking increased damage if directly targeted in exchange."
318,,100,Holy Chorus,Super Dragon Sword,Benevolence ,"Angels are known to enjoy music, and you have the skills to capitalize that. You have a good singing voice, and while you are singing a certain song, your angelic summons become amplified in motivation and power. As long as you are able to perform uninterrupted, the magic of your Angel summons is enhanced to its next stage - the Warrior Angel performing Holy 2, as an example. In addition, your singing grants your angelic summons health regeneration."
319,,100,Hardened Constitution,Super Dragon Sword,Benevolence ,"For those not in the thrall of the gods, it’s hard living. Years of living in these conditions have made it that simply the act of getting a good night’s sleep or eating a filling feast has the same effect on you as being healed with magic, and particularly satisfying feasts actively grant you greater strength and vitality. In addition, you are able to get a full night’s sleep in less time and are a light sleeper."
320,,100,Fast healing,Generic Dungeon Crawler,Benevolence ,"You heal at an accelerated rate, and you need not worry about common diseases or infections unless you’re in a truly filthy environment. You cannot regenerate lost limbs and organs. "

323,,100,Natural Disease Immunity,King Arthur ,Benevolence ,"This give you complete immunity to natural diseases, but while it gives increased resistance you're still liable to get magical and man made diseases, so while it probably won't kill you try not to piss off some wizard or mad scientist. Also protects from poisons of all kind."
324,,100,Pure Stupid Obstinacy,Dresden Files,Benevolence ,"There are a lot of beings in this world who would bend your mind and make you their puppet, one way or another. Some might do it with magical effects, others just by knowing what to say. And for the vast majority of people, there is little and less they can do about it. Not you, though. While this isn’t an immunity to mind control and influence, it’s a guarantee that no such thing will last on you. No matter how badly you get twisted, no matter if someone manages to tempt or charm you, sooner or later, and probably sooner, you’ll find your way back into sanity and complete freedom of will. The honey-laden words of a Denarian, the charm of a White Court vampire nor the glamor of the Sidhe can hold you for overlong, though they might just hold you for long enough."
325,,100,Diplomatic Immunity,Dresden Files,Benevolence ,"You’re from another world, and just like Diplomats in foreign nations, you have immunity to certain laws. The Laws of Magic, that is. You suffer no consequence for breaking any of the laws of magic in this world, or any of the innate negative effects of magic like the Hex. That is, you suffer no magical consequences, like the insanity, soul taint or obsession that come to Warlocks under normal circumstances. If you’re seen doing it, or word gets out, the Wardens will try to take your head off just like they do with all Warlocks."
326,,100,Enchanted Duster,The Dresden Files,Benevolence ,"It might belong on the set of El Dorado, but this long leather coat (available in black, dark gray, or dark brown) might save your life someday. Defensive spells weaved into its material make it tougher than a suit of armor, but much lighter and way more stylish. You're still going to be feeling anything you get hit by, but it can make the difference between walking home feeling like one giant bruise, and getting scraped off the side of a building. May or may not come with a wide-brimmed hat, there's been some disagreement on that."
327,,100,"""Desert Pyromancer Garb""",Dark Souls 3,Benevolence ,"""Garb of the desert pyromancers, who once walked the halls of the Earthen Peak. It is said that the thin, burgundy cloth breathes with magic. Desert pyromancers, most of them female, were known for their great fans of flame, and enchanting looks. But what is enchanting can also be deadly, especially when clothed in such alluring garb. "" Typical of outfits worn by spellcasters, this set has low physical defense while providing great protection against elemental damage and status effects. In particular the curse resistance and- oddly enough- bleeding resistance is high for this revealing outfit, while frost and poisons defense is much lower. Although, Desert Pyromancers were well above average in terms of appearance compared to most dusty old scholars."
328,,100,"“Fleshbite Ring""",Dark Souls 3,Benevolence ,"""One of the bite rings native to Carim. The crafting of these rings is forbidden, perhaps owing to a fear of malleable stone. Clerics, however, dabble freely in the art."" A ghastly looking ring, it hardens the wearer against all manner of curses and ailments."
329,,100,"""Ring of Steel Protection""",Dark Souls 3,Benevolence ,"""Ring of the Knight King of ancient legend. The Knight King was said to be lined with steel on the inside, such that even the talons of mighty dragons did him little harm."" Strengthens the body, causing the wearer to receive less damage from purely physical attacks."
330,,100,"""Ancient Dragon Greatshield""",Dark Souls 3,Benevolence ,"""A wooden shield bearing the image of an ancient dragon. The painting is the result of an exquisite but painstaking technique. Lingering, undying traces of the ancient dragons can still be seen in their descendants, the man-serpents, though they have fallen far from grace."" While large, the greatshield only applies passable protection due to being made of wood. While on your person however, grants slow yet steady regeneration."
331,,100,"""Ring of the Evil Eye""",Dark Souls 3,Benevolence ,"""This ring captured the foul spirit of an evil eye, a creature that ravaged Astora. The horrid spirit nearly destroyed Astora, but was eventually defeated by ""the sword of one most noble."" Grants the wearer a burst of minor healing for every life the wearer takes."
332,,100,"""Wolf Knight's Greatshield""",Dark Souls 3,Benevolence ,"""Greatshield of a knight tainted by the dark of the Abyss, and master of the wolf's blood of Farron."" A heavy shield of good craftsmanship in most regards, it grants divine protection to the one holding it, strongly warding against various ailments, magical and mundane."
333,,100,"""Speckled Stoneplate Ring"" ",Dark Souls 3,Benevolence ,"""Stoneplates are symbols of true knights, and speckled stoneplates are granted to those who face an endless journey."" The ornate ring focuses on a rectangular gem featuring various colors warped around each other. When worn, mildly dulls the harmful effects of magic, lightning, fire and dark energies impacting against the wearer's form."
334,,100,"""Firekeeper's Clothes"" ",Dark Souls 3,Benevolence ,"""Robe, Gloves and Skirt worn by the guardian of the shrine. The Fire Keepers were robbed of light, to better serve as vessels for souls. Only those who cherish the writhing, searing darkness were given the keeper's black attire. Beautiful black clothing that obscures all but the head from sight. Offers very little in the way of physical protection, but comfortable and warded against fire, curses and the dark."
335,,100,Third Dragon Ring,Dark Souls 2,Benevolence ,"“A blue ring bearing the symbol of a dragon. The thing offers the protection of dragons, bestowing some measure of heightened vitality on the wearer. This invigoration allows the wearer to push their body and soul further in all regards than they once could. More resistant to repeated injury, more physical activity before rest is needed, greater burdens may be carried and so on.”"
336,,100,Fragrant Branches of Yore,Dark Souls 2,Benevolence ,"“A rejuvenating bundle of small twigs, sticks and branches with sap that produces a sweet smell. While this sweet smell can cause coughing and nausea if inhaled too much, poison or debilitation is not the purpose, quite the opposite in fact. When one of these branches is grinded against the surface of one afflicted with petrification, the sap and wood dispersed across a small area, the stoned individual will regain animation. As if by magic, the petrified individual will return to life. Disorientation normally follows, but it’s potent no?”"
337,,100,Common Fruit,Dark Souls 2,Benevolence ,"“A spotted fruit covered in green, glowing nodes. The fruit has no actual taste, but a disgusting texture, ordinarily meaning few would dare to consume it. However, the fruit contains strong, medicinal properties. If someone braves the texture, they will find most poisons and toxins cleansed from their body, and others having a difficult time affecting them, for a time. You are bestowed a pouch filled with the disgusting little things, a never-ending amount.”"
338,,100,Covetous Gold Serpent Ring,Dark Souls 2,Benevolence ,"“A gold ring depicting a snake, the very picture of sinful greed. It’s said only a coward fears every opportunity presented to them however. Looking for straight forward magic? Look no further. Putting this ring on brings you good luck, a great deal of it in fact. Resources, workable equipment and situations where you’re in the right place at the right time all seem to be found more easily. You’ll need more than luck in these lands however. . .”"
339,,100,Silvercat Ring,Dark Souls 2,Benevolence ,"“A silver ring crafted to appear like a leaping feline, with blue stones slotted where the eyes would be for extra pizzazz. Not just for decoration however, this kitty ring is an invaluable tool for exploration. When worn, this magical ring dulls the shock from long falls, allowing one to fall a more significant distance without injury.”"
340,,100,Momentum Killer,Dark Souls 2,Benevolence ,"“Wandering undead seeking to pillage and plunder these now ruined lands must be careful, agile, cunning. Any adversary with a shield is not one easily dealt with. To protect the resting places of fallen allies, you have become that adversary. You have been bestowed remarkable prowess with shields of all sizes. The small ones used for parrying, the large ones for halting aggression in its tracks, and the medium ones in the middle all counted amongst implements you can wield no problem. In addition to being able to just use one well, shields you employ won’t deform over time from repeated beating unless struck by something overwhelmingly powerful.”"
341,,100,“Effigy Shield”,Dark Souls 1,Benevolence ,"A frightfully occult shield with strange, alien appearance. It was created by occultists as part of an ill-fated plot to destroy the gods. The Effigy Shield is the most proficient shield in all the lands at protecting the wielder from divine weapons and lightning. This was of course in preparation for facing Gwyn’s men."
342,,100,“Rare Ring of Sacrifice” ,Dark Souls 1,Benevolence ,"This mystical ring was created in a sacrificial rite of Velka, the Goddess of Sin. The ring absorbs a single lethal curse that has started to circulate through your body before breaking, saving your life. You’ll receive a new one in a couple weeks after it breaks."
343,,100,“Dragon Crest Shield” ,Dark Souls 1,Benevolence ,"One of the enchanted blue shields, this shield has been warded against fire. Emblazoned with a dragon, this is a highly durable shield and greatly protects the user against both physical attacks and swaths of fire, the most capable flame protection among shields found here."
344,,100,“Ring of Favor and Protection”,Dark Souls 1,Benevolence ,"A special golden ring that vastly improves constitution when worn, allowing you to take a greater beating, trudge on long treks, carrying heavy equipment, easier. Makes long journeys or extended combat much easier, but like a woman scorned, it snaps in half if you remove it, requiring you to mend it each time."
345,,100,“Calcium” ,Dark Souls 1,Benevolence ,"Muscles can be trained through exercise, minds developed with rigorous study, but it all matters little if the frame that hosts them is broken down. On purchase, your bones become especially strong, resilient and repair far faster than normal. Unlike normal bones which need to be set just right and become weaker when broken, yours heal perfectly Even if you were slain, your skeleton would persist far longer than any others, continuing to repair and maintain itself as long as it stays mostly intact."
346,,100,Loch Shield,Bloodborne,Benevolence ,"“A shield finely crafted out of blue glass, fashioned after a lake in its appearance. Originally used to safeguard the leader presiding over a sacred Healing Church ceremony, it was later supplied to tomb prospectors, in particular those exploring the labyrinth of Isz. 

Although made of glass, the symbolism that went into its form greatly reduces the strength any non- physical force, such as flame, electricity, and even the arcane. Although it won’t break easy, the amount of force that makes it through when used to block the physical makes it near worthless for such things.”"
347,,100,Bag of Blood Vials,Bloodborne,Benevolence ,"“Special blood used in ministration. When injected, the recipient will rapidly recover from minor and middling injuries, from gashes to bone fractures. A single vial's worth of this special blood is unable to heal severe injuries like limb loss, but more blood means more healing. 

The bag is given to you full, somehow containing 20 Blood Vials despite its small size. For an additional 100BE however, the bag will refill as time goes on, one vial an hour. Works for anyone, but the nature of a hunter allows it to work simply by breaking it in hand.”"
348,,100,Steel Yourself,Bloodborne,Benevolence ,"“This is not a happy world. There's corpses and blood everywhere, people are turning into undead beasts, cults are boiling people alive, and that's just the start of it. Lesser people would most likely get distracted with their broken, decaying surroundings. 

Lesser people might even lose their minds, especially if they bore witness to the things most can't perceive. 

You aren't lesser people though, and you have the ability to forcefully harden your mind and resolve, making it much harder to shake you up. This doesn't make you immune to mental degradation or getting distracted, but it will help you keep your cool and push forward, at least for a little while. . .”"
349,,100,Discovery,Bloodborne,Benevolence ,"“Those in the know prize knowledge, insight in a manner of speaking. There’s a mutual desire among all those seeking truth behind the scenes in this city to see more than their eyes allow. Perhaps as a result of sharing that desire, you also find yourself seeing more than you once did. 

How is it that simply by looking for equipment, for resources, for supplies, it seems as if it turns up for you more often? It isn’t as if it appears just for you, but it’s as if your luck and intense search for such things allows them to manifest all the same. 

Spare ammo, a stock of blood vials, a precious blood gem or two, and many other useful objects will find their way into your hands providing you look. It’s not like all finds become great bounties, but it’s noticeably more than what existed before.”"
350,,100,Good Blood ,Bloodborne,Benevolence ,"“In Yharnam, blood flows like water, though it was once in a different context than now rivers of the stuff seep out of stacked corpses. Once upon a time, it was such a source of pleasure that it pushed out other drugs and temptations, and everyone would look for the best stuff. 

Hidden in your veins is the real good stuff, potent blood that carries intoxicating power. This allows your blood to more easily fight off conventional diseases which abound in a place like this, and produce more powerful blood bullets. 

Where once it might take a dozen shots with that special ammo to put down an enemy, it should only take three for the same one. This will also empower Quicksilver Bullets, and let you be more conservative. That’s a good thing, since even if blood soaks the ground, it’s best if that’s not yours.”"
351,,100,Violent Past,Bloodborne,Benevolence ,"“Even before stepping foot into this terror, your hands were never truly that far from brutality. Bar fights, muggings, disagreements with the local constables, and perhaps certain disagreements at home have tempered your knuckles. Now, as a hunter, that will be put to use. 

Those fists of yours are hardened, endlessly enduring as you stay on the attack. No matter how hard and how much you punch, you won’t suffer the backlash of your actions. Your wiry muscles are also able to generate more strength, which helps with swinging much more effective weapons around. 

This protection from self-harm is less effective against blade and spike, or fang and claw, but against a beast’s skull you can afford to pound and crush until they draw last breath.”"
352,,100,Bag of Grass,Demon's Souls,Benevolence ,You have a bag of crescent moon grass that refills every third day. When consumed it will restore some health. Has enough grass for 10 uses. For an extra 50CP ​it becomes full moon grass which heals much more and refills every second day.
353,,100,Simple Belief,Demon's Souls,Benevolence ,There is some thing you believe in whether it is a belief or a deity. Once a goal is set it becomes hard for others to sway you from your cause. As a result your will power and determination is also improved. You also understand to use the miracle Heal.
354,,100,Duty Beyond Death ,Elden Ring,Benevolence ,"Though wracked in mind and body by the Scarlet Rot, Malenia never gave up her faith in her brother-nor did her forces forsake their devotion to her. You share a similar determination that can see you through the worst of ravages on your body. A knight could carry a slumbering comrade far away from the site where the Scarlet Rot touched the world, fending off all manner of foes while crossing much of the Lands Between. Enough blood loss and other traumatic damage may bring you down, but your endurance is that of a champion and should you receive proper treatment you could come out of a coma immediately fit to fight. And should you lose a limb, you’ll find acclimatising and accepting prosthetics of all kinds far easier than most."
355,,100,Shield of the Erdtree,Elden Ring,Benevolence ,"Even pitted against Radahn himself, Morgott refused to yield the defence of his beloved capital. Your mettle is no lesser, for in sieges and defence manoeuvres of all kinds your fighting prowess is that of a veteran. Shield walls hold fast, whether by your stern command or the strong arm behind your shield. Managing resources and logistics while the wolf is at your door is old hat to you, and civilian unrest calmed by your stalwart presence. And by the standards of whatever you are, your poise is a cut above most. Let all know that none shall pass the castle gate, so long as you stand."
356,,100,Spirit Tuner,Elden Ring,Benevolence ,"Spirit tuning goes beyond simply imbuing strength, but as an art lies somewhere between tuning an instrument and conducting a conversation-leaving both parties enriched. Even tormented souls can find respite from their damnation through spirit tuning, and more usefully on the battlefield summoned spirits of all kinds are made more powerful overall by it. You’re one of the few with the innate talent for this art as well as a fair amount of experience. By buying this perk here, this also grants you a large field of graven glovewort-the flowers used in spirit tuning-which can optionally become a Warehouse attachment."
357,,100,A True Companion,Elden Ring,Benevolence ,"Ah, this is bitter. It seems that whatever else you were in this world, you were also a Deathbed Companion: One of those who practiced the art of holding champions in order to receive a measure of their warmth and vigour. Not some foul life-draining vampiric grasp, no matter what those of the Golden Order who abhor such practices might insinuate-you simply warmly embrace the tired hero in order to bestow what is known as a Baldachin’s Blessing. In exchange for a temporary depletion of vitality that is returned once the blessing is used, it confers a blessing of resilience and allows one to forget their aches and pains for a while. And while typically such blessings must be renewed by further embraces once expended it is said that once in her life, a Deathbed Companion can produce a truly radiant blessing that can be used indefinitely. Your powers have also given you a spiritual affinity for death and all associated with it, such that it might be possible for you gestate a Mending Rune capable of embedding the principle of life within death into Order. You may also apply it as a gift for ritual magics concerning death of all Kinds.

All known Deathbed Companions are female. As a result of your investment here however, you may have the powers of one while being male for whatever reason. Perhaps you’ve simply had a strong spiritual connection to Those Who Live In Death that has given you a similar affinity for such arts?

You also have a natural talent for giving wonderful hugs."
358,,100,Clean Blooded,Harry Potter,Benevolence ,"You simply, magically, do not get sick. You are always free from illnesses and diseases."
359,,100,Occlumency,Harry Potter,Benevolence ,"Mental defences that make it difficult to possess or penetrate your mind. You have no tells, it is impossible for others to know if you are lying to them without evidence."
360,,100,Primal Amulet ,MtG - Ixalan,Benevolence ,"A jade amulet, this amulet gives the benefits of the Jade used by the Merfolk, intensifying your strength and magical prowess by a measure that grows greater when in the untouched wilderness beyond a town, or city - the farther from the nearest settlement you are, the more efficient and effective this Jade is, though small as it is, it has limits - as a normal Merfolk, you would not be able to grow beyond the might of five of your kind, even in a completely pristine valley of Ixalan. "
361,,100,Vanquisher's Banner ,MtG - Ixalan,Benevolence ,"A flag bearing your faction’s symbol (or a standard and customized jolly roger design for Drop In), the flag is magically enchanted to cause allies around you to act in concert, allowing for an unconscious and natural cooperation and the maximizing of teamwork, making you and your forces much more fearsome as a group."
362,,100,Fae Offering,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Benevolence ,"Faerie gifts are a well known phenomenon of those wandering the wilds - often some sweets, gold, and cryptic poetry that gives some hint to the environs. You now can find these gifts anywhere you go, occasionally showing up when you most need them."
363,,100,Lucky Clover,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Benevolence ,"The superstition in Eldraine is rarely unfounded - so when you discovered this little trinket, it was clear that there was something special at work. It’s nothing that could be fully attributed to magic, but while having this charm on hand, you’ll notice that you tend to have a better change of getting out of dangerous situations and living to tell the tale - not quite enough that going up against the fae-cursed king singlehandedly will end well, but encounters with badgers, bears, and redcaps will usually end with nary a scratch, rather than lost limbs or eyes."
364,,100,Once Upon A Time,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Benevolence ,"Many in the realms strive to become figures of legend, Knights who mark the storybooks with their names. However, many either do not have the courage or the sheer luck to be capable of having the adventures that allow them to show their prowess. Not a problem for you. You have a bit of luck (or perhaps enchantment?) that makes you a ‘magnet’ for scenarios to demonstrate your skill, events that would already occur simply shifting to be within convenient proximity to your dashing self. As for the COMPETENCE to save the day, well...that’s what the rest of the options here are for."
365,,100,Swamp Dragonfly ,MtG - Shandalar,Benevolence ,"Black mages are often found in the foul, dark bogs and fens of Shandalar, but such an environment is often unsuited to research and travel. This elegant pendant, shaped like a dragonfly, grants the wielder a number of protective effects to make their time in swamps and other such terrains more bearable. It guarantees firm footing even in half-flooded marshlands, wards away any mosquitos, leeches and other such pests, and it even makes the bearer completely immune to diseases as well as nausea or other problems caused by the scent of their surroundings."
366,,100,Dwarven Pick ,MtG - Shandalar,Benevolence ,"Rough but highly effective, this pick serves as far more than merely a mountaineering tool. Whoever holds this pick will find themselves with a sixth sense for traversing rough or difficult terrain, finding the easiest paths and safest routes available with little difficulty. Furthermore, the Dwarven Pick protects the bearer from many environmental hazards, such as avalanches, snowstorms or even the scorching heat of a half-cooled lava flow. "
367,,100,Ring Of The Guardian,MtG - Shandalar,Benevolence ,"A simple silver band adorned with a precious gem of unknown origins, the Ring Of The Guardian is a powerful magical artifact. Built in ages past to harness and stabilize vast amounts of magic, the ring has proven exceedingly capable of fortifying wards, barriers, and other such defensive magics, be they spells woven in Shandalar’s magical traditions or similar kinds of power found elsewhere. Though the ring can only be attuned to a single such effect at a time, the potential impact is vast. If attuned to Shandalar’s Great Barrier itself, the ring would strengthen this mighty ward until it is half again as resilient as before, and weaker effects might find even greater comparative advantages.

Each enchantment or barrier can only be supported by one ring, and each ring can only attune to one such effect at a time."
368,,100,One With The Wild ,MtG - Shandalar,Benevolence ,"To be a master of Green magic is to be a part of the natural world... but though you stand among them, that does not mean you are nothing but an animal. The wild recognizes your power and your connection with nature, and you’ll find that wild animals, dangerous plants and even the terrain itself is far less likely to harm you. Though they can still be turned against you by hostile mages, and supernatural and intelligent beasts might still oppose you for their own reasons, the natural wilderness will ever be your friend... or at least indifferent."
369,,100,SELESNYA GUILDMAGE,MtG - Ravnica,Benevolence ,"The Selesnya Conclave is like one great family, spreading the joys of nature through Ravnica for all to see. You’re better at magic involving growth and nature, and you also have more vitality and positivity, able to see the good side in anything. People find it easier to get along with you as well, due to your peaceful disposition."
370,,100,RAKDOS GUILDMAGE ,MtG - Ravnica,Benevolence ,"Being in the cult of Rakdos is all about enjoying yourself! Ignore all those other uptight, stuck up, serious guilds. They just don’t understand the joke. You find yourself able to see the funny side in literally anything! Even things like mindless slaughter... no, especially things like mindless slaughter! Being in Rakdos also almost guarantees you won’t get through your ten year stay without a little bit of “fun” yourself, so you have a magically higher pain threshold, to make those times more “enjoyable”."
371,,100,Will to Survive,MtG - New Phyrexia,Benevolence ,"In a Plane like New Phyrexia, the future looks bleak. The war was lost, the enemy holds all the plane, and the resistance only survives through the uneasy grace of the Red Praetor Urabrask- but even in these dire situations, there’s a flame in you that never goes out. No matter how bad the outlook seems, you don’t lose hope, and seem to be resistant to things like the Progress Engine’s Thoughtfields sapping your will to fight."
372,,100,The imperfections of the flesh,MtG - New Phyrexia,Benevolence ,"The flesh of the Mirrans was weak, their bodies flawed- You find that, after the improvements made to yours (or despite them, perhaps), you are resilient to the drawbacks your appearance would imply- Flayed skin showing muscle won't get infected, extra limbs seem to not get in the way, and flesh doesn't seem to rot."
373,,100,Bark And Bite Are Far Worse ,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Benevolence ,"Boseiju, the great tree that towers over all of Towashi, is the single greatest source of green mana on all of Kamigawa, even beating out the entirety of the Jukai Forests despite the utter lack of nature that surrounds the city. When the monks, druids, and other members of the Order require armor, they look first and foremost to the natural world to see what can be used. A Samurai’s armor used to be made from lacquered wood, before technology and metallurgy advanced to its current state. A Jukian set of armor still is, made from scraps of bark from Boseiju and bound together with rope and twine made from fallen leaves. Actually, this is Jukai’s answer to the mechanized suits of armor that the Empire and the Futurists - biological power armor born from the greatest source of green mana on the entire continent. The armor by itself isn’t very great, but as one's affinity for nature rises, so does the power and durability it can offer to its bearer. "
374,,100,Nature Provides For Her Children ,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Benevolence ,"The sad truth of the modern age is that many, the Empire included, no longer possess the same connection to the lands they once did. Instead they wander about with their head in the clouds, engrossed in acquiring ever more dependency on their technology. But not you, oh no. You are of Jukai, of the forests, and you know that the world is alive and can form its own opinions of things. Years of study have taught you to live in tune with the world - passing through the forest without crushing insects, without snapping twigs, barely setting a leaf out of place for your passage. How to take the least painful parts of the tree or the vine to secure your meal, or to locate a surprising amount of wood that had already fallen off the tree instead of needing to cut or break it off should you wish for a fire. Best of all, as the Kami witness you living in harmony, you will find small blessings being given to you - the fruits you pluck are juicier and more filling, the forest actively hiding your trail when you attempt to sneak, so on and so forth. The longer you keep this lifestyle up, the easier it becomes."
375,,100,The Rising,MtG - Lorwyn,Benevolence ,"Treefolk are born from seeds like any other tree of their species, growing into mundane trees like any other sapling, until at a certain stage in their development the trees gain sentience and motility through an event known as the Rising. Before a treefolk undergoes the Rising, it is indistinguishable from any other sapling, and thus gets no more attention than any other sapling. A treefolk’s seeds might generate hundreds or even thousands of saplings during their long lives, and most never go through the Rising.

Should you wish for a particular tree to become a treefolk though, perhaps one you’re bringing in from beyond Lorwyn’s most distant mountain ranges, you can import them here. Depending on how old this tree is, they might either make the decision to Rise immediately and open their eyes to greet you. Or they might take months or years longer before they decide to go through the Rising. A treefolk’s life cycle is long, slow, and deliberate after all, even if they are guaranteed to Rise from their sessile state with this purchase."
376,,100,Burning Enthusiasm ,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Benevolence ,"Life is more enjoyable when you just let yourself loose and do what you want to do. Being infused with Red Mana, your passions burn brightly, love feels more intense, your view of the world is more vivid and happiness feels more meaningful and satisfying. Your enjoyment of life reaffirms your willpower as you choose the life you want to live, knowing all the more that your life is worth living the way you choose and the warmth of past experiences will keep you going through hard times."
377,,100,Calm on the Water’s Surface ,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Benevolence ,"A scientific mind does not lash out recklessly, they do not make hasty judgements and they do not go in without preparation. To go in without calm and calculated thought risks both self and secrets that one might find. Keeping this in mind has stilled your passions to let what lies beneath become apparent. You can remain calm in any situation, and have the presence of mind to think with clarity even in a chaotic setting. This instills a protection against fear, panic and rage in your actions. Though this does not protect you from unnatural effects that stir your emotions, it is easier for you to counter such effects with magic."
378,,100,Father of the Year,Magi: The Adventure of Sinbad,Benevolence ,"A good number of the parents in this world aren’t the best, committing acts ranging from being merely incompetent and distant to outright murdering their children. It’s a good thing, then, that you won’t join the ranks of these people. On the contrary, you’re a genuinely great parent with a good amount of skill in all areas of raising children. Even if you and your children grew up in the harshest of conditions, your warmth is enough that they’d grow up with fond memories of their childhood, and especially you.

As an added bonus, your abilities are slightly boosted whenever you’re defending a loved one or family member. This boost won’t be enough to overcome a foe that’s beyond your power level, but might give you the edge you need to overcome someone you’re otherwise equally matched against."
379,,100,Atop the Mountain,Magi: Alma Torran,Benevolence ,"Despite one day coming to rule a kingdom that spanned an entire world, Solomon never wanted to be king, much less seen as any kind of deific figure. It was the opposite, in fact: He desired a world without kings where all would be equal, and only reluctantly accepted his role when convinced that everything he had worked for would fall apart if did not become king. Upon taking the throne, though, the isolation he had always felt grew, as fewer and fewer people treated him as an equal, but as a godly figure far above them.

Unlike Solomon, however, you will never suffer any of the mental drawbacks having too much power could bring. No matter how powerful you become, you’ll always remain able to relate with others as if you were just an ordinary person, and you’ll never feel alienated from them. No matter how great your status may grow, if you wish it, your friends and family will never change the way they behave around you, treating you as an equal instead of bowing and scraping before the unapproachable god-king you may become."
380,,100,Loved By God,BlazBlue: Phase Zero,Benevolence ,"As unlucky as you are to be an Anomaly at all, it seems the universe isn’t a particularly harsh place to you. Simply put, you’re quite lucky, though possibly in a roundabout way. Collapse on the side of the road and wake up with no memory? The young woman who finds you is in fact related to a scientist that can explain what the hell just happened. Or perhaps you’re rescued by a kindly old man who offers you the opportunity to do… nothing at all?"
381,,100,More Than a Myth,Campione,Benevolence ,"All Heretic Gods are cursed to cause mayhem and chaos as they walk among the living once again. It’s part of their nature to cause them, albeit in different ways, a sun god would spread wildfire, war would cause armed conflict, etc. Not even the King of the End is completely immune to this. Your nature is different, however, more tempered and calmer, able to travel with freedom. Thus, you aren’t restricted by this anymore, being able to completely contain yourself until you choose to awe the lowly mortals. Should you deign to do so, you can still let your nature leak like your contemporaries, but even then, you will be able to select the scope and nature of your divine radiance."
382,,100,Medical Mage,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Benevolence ,"Those who use powerful magic often focus on power, personal or in their minions, and rarely do the
greats of the magical world look to the ailments of the little folk. Perhaps you can fix it, given your
great talent in both mundane medicine of this time, making use of herbs and natural remedies along
with the beginnings of more modernised medicine, as well as healing magic. You have a decent
amount of magical power, similar to the witch in training above, but your skill is all focused on
supporting magic. Healing wounds and sicknesses is quite easy for you and you’ve got experience
with all kinds of curses, poisons and supernatural ailments. You’re far from a legend right now but
you’ve got a lot of talent for the subject, making improvements easy, and your healing spells are
somewhat stronger than normal for the energy you spend. To add to your skill, you also possess a
very calming, peaceful demeanour to others that lets others remain calm and destress with just your
presence, while easing the passing of those in pain. It also makes you terribly cute, though that itself
may be the reason others find you so nice to be around."
383,,100,Sacred Gem,Fate/Legends - Nirvana Yuga,Benevolence ,"A brilliant gemstone of perfect cut, laid into your body as if to become a natural part of you. While a
gorgeous ornament by itself, it has significant powers of protection enchanted into it. When fighting
against demons or humans, you’ll find that their blows are dulled and left with only half their normal
power. The presence of the gem in battle can even cause such opponents to become nervous, seeing your battle presence as much larger than it would normally be. Outside of battle, the power
that circulates into your body from the stone prevents you from requiring food, drink or rest as
normal men do. The gem provides for these needs, helping to craft your body into a perfect form
that produces no waste and requires no sustenance."
384,,100,Holy Book,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Benevolence ,"The book of scriptures for your religion of choice, lovingly bound and scribed for you. It’s presence
increases the strength of your faith and bolsters your spirit but when actively reciting from the
lessons within, it can increase magic resistance. With enough passion and volume, it can outright
shut down lesser spells and magi that can hear you, compelled to stop their foul arts by the purity of
your belief. "
385,,100,Uisce Beatha,Fate/Legends - Land of Shadows,Benevolence ,"Your hands have a special property, one of quite a great value to a warrior culture. Any liquid that
you scoop up in your hands is granted great healing properties, able to heal any wound of the body
or spirit in just seconds of contact, save for the greatest of cursed wounds. Your healing waters can
be spread even on spiritual bodies to heal them and the liquids will cleanse away any poison or
disease in the area it touches. The closer to pure water the liquid you hold is, the better the effect
will be. Trying to use polluted river muck might only clean a few nasty scratches. You can also, should you have the need, prevent liquids you hold from gaining these properties. "
386,,100,Sorcery - Healing Ritual (Healing Sleep) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Benevolence,"Exactly what it sounds like, the path of Healing allows the sorcerer to ease and heal the injuries and diseases of themselves and others. However, this magic can only be applied to a given person once every several hours.

Some, but not all, Paths also have rituals, which take an extra ten minutes to cast, but are easier to perform, more powerful, and often capable of producing effects that cannot be replicated with normal sorcery. A sorcerer must have the appropriate dots in the appropriate path to learn a given ritual.

Healing Sleep (1): The healer may place a willing target to sleep instantly. When the target awakens, they will be revitalized and alert, with a clarity of mind and purpose, even if it was only a few hours rest.

(CG Note: Requires Sorcery - Healing (One Dot) - World of Darkness: Sorcery first.)"
387,,100,Sorcery - Healing Ritual (Mike’s Cure-All) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Benevolence,"Exactly what it sounds like, the path of Healing allows the sorcerer to ease and heal the injuries and diseases of themselves and others. However, this magic can only be applied to a given person once every several hours.

Some, but not all, Paths also have rituals, which take an extra ten minutes to cast, but are easier to perform, more powerful, and often capable of producing effects that cannot be replicated with normal sorcery. A sorcerer must have the appropriate dots in the appropriate path to learn a given ritual.

Mike's Cure-All (2): This ritual causes the target’s body to quickly begin flushing
itself clean of any and all toxins and poisons, even alchemical ones. This may
involve sweating, vomiting, crying, or defecation. The more powerful the toxin is,
the more difficulty the sorcerer faces in purging it.

(CG Note: Requires Sorcery - Healing (Two Dots) - World of Darkness: Sorcery first.)"
388,,100,Sorcery - Healing Ritual (Wakey-Wakey) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Benevolence,"Exactly what it sounds like, the path of Healing allows the sorcerer to ease and heal the injuries and diseases of themselves and others. However, this magic can only be applied to a given person once every several hours.

Some, but not all, Paths also have rituals, which take an extra ten minutes to cast, but are easier to perform, more powerful, and often capable of producing effects that cannot be replicated with normal sorcery. A sorcerer must have the appropriate dots in the appropriate path to learn a given ritual.

Wakey-Wakey (2): The sorcerer may cause their target to awaken from even
magically induced sleep. Comas, medically or mechanically induced, are ended.

(CG Note: Requires Sorcery - Healing (Two Dots) - World of Darkness: Sorcery first.)"
389,,100,Basic Magecraft - Reinforcement,Tsukihime,Benevolence,"The standard four practices of Magecraft: Reinforcement,Gradation Air, Hypnosis and Formalcraft. This is the foundation of the modern systems used byMagi in this day and age. You do not start with any of these - The Mage’s Association is largely uninvolved with events in Misaki, and Atlas is more concerned with Alchemy and Mystic Codes than the modernMagecraft systems. You must purchase each one for 100 points, which makes you adept in thatparticular field - not total mastery, but enough to be a threat against something unprepared for it. Reinforcement is strengthening a living being or an object, letting a human reinforce their physical strength or senses to even greater performance. "
390,,100,Mystic Eye Killers,Tsukihime,Benevolence,"A set of glasses that prevent the wearer from using Mystic or Pure Eyes accidentally or otherwise. This particular version is able to suppress ocular powers of both the wearer and protect them from similar powers requiring eye contact, though they're otherwise just a pair of glasses. Comes in a frame or design of your choosing. Your eyes will function normally once they are removed. They also can’t be broken or destroyed by physical force.
"
391,,100,Beloved of Gaia,Tsukihime,Benevolence,"A True Ancestor is a spirit of the world givenform, designed for a purpose. Gaia itself recognizes you for what you are, and as such, the world's laws do not count you among humanity or other threats to its being. Spirits and beings born of planet Earth and all its iterations will count you as a friend and ally, and nature itself will act in small ways that favor you - weather becomes clear during a long journey, animals are pacified in your presence so long as they are left alone, and any sentience tied to the planet itself will defer to you with respect or at least respect your presence.
"
392,,100,Blessing of the Wood,Cultist Simulator,Benevolence,"Being an intermediary to spirits is no easy task, jumper, and there’s always the possibility that your enemies may strike when you are the most vulnerable. Whenever you find yourself asleep, in a trance, or otherwise incapacitated, you’ll be guaranteed that your physical body will come to no harm until you wake up. This doesn’t mean that trouble will not find you, in fact, it’s entirely possible you’ll be locked away and be prepared for butchering, but at the very least your aggressors will have the decency to wait until you wake up.
"
393,,100,Lucky Charm,Generic Magical Girl,Benevolence,"Most people have some kind of lucky charm like a rabbit foot, or a lucky coin that they think gives them good luck. Yours actually works, because it's real magic – you can use this even when not transformed, and since it's so lucky, it won't accidentally be lost or stolen, even if you live in the slums."
394,,100,Abracadabra​,Sailor Moon,Benevolence,"Sometimes all one needs is magic from the mind. Self confidence. Hope. Or maybe just to feel a little better. Every time you say the word “abracadabra” to yourself, you find that your mood, self confidence, and hope will temporarily lift. It doesn’t assure you victory and neither is the effect itself actually magical, but it’ll help you if you’re a little down on yourself or at least alleviate your unhappiness. A little reassurance goes a long way."
395,,100,Twisted Sister,DC Occult,Benevolence,"Your mind is ever so slightly warped, allowing you to resist effects that would normally disorient you. Compulsions to not notice something themselves go unnoticed and a weak attempt at hypnotism would fail utterly. This will do little against more powerful effects, but it’ll stop smaller stuff from being a nuisance.
"
396,,100,Meditation ,Justice League Dark,Benevolence,"You know three dozen different ways to meditate, focus, or otherwise quiet the mind. Useful not only for magic, but for long-term mental health. Good to occasionally take time and decompress, y’know?"
397,,100,Untouched By Time,Justice League Dark,Benevolence,"Given enough time, all injuries you experience will heal perfectly, refusing to leave behind scars. This doesn’t give you any ability to heal anything you couldn’t before, it just makes sure any healed injuries do not mar your appearance. This also means that -- if you age -- you’ll damn well age gracefully.
"
398,,100,Shield of Faith,The Gods Are Bastards,Benevolence,"The followers of Avei are, in the end, warriors, and each are clad as appropriate for their craft. You gain a set of light or heavy armor, along with a shield and an enchanted sword.
"
399,,100,Heraldry Armour,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Benevolence,"A gift from your master, a splendid set of armour fit for his right hand. Formed from the strongest and rarest metals in Nehekhara, the armour offers excellent protection across your entire body and looks quite good too, though it is in the colours of your King. It has no magical enchantments on it, save for a minor one that allows it to slowly repair and clean itself when not worn."
400,,100,Totemic Armour,Warhammer Fantasy: Amazons,Benevolence,"Most Amazons eschew the use of heavy armour, preferring agility and speed in the dense jungles, particularly against large monsters or clumsy outsiders. The Totem Guards that protect the temples are different. You’ve been granted a set of armour and a shield crafted from the strongest wood to be found in the Lustrian jungles. Enchanted lightly with magic, the wooden shield and armour you have can easily hold up against even a blow from an Ogre wielding a great metal blade.
"
401,,100,Cartridge Endurance,Lyrical Nanoha,Benevolence,"The cartridge system, while a powerful legacy of what Belka left behind, is extremely stressful on your physical body and can lead to fatigue in battle at best or significant internal damage at worst. But as the legacy of Belka is part of you, your body can physically handle the punishment needed to make regular use of said system. In addition, this endurance applies to other types of dangerous magic that harms the user - it won’t eliminate the strain or internal damage, but you’ll find you can use it much more often than you could before the downsides actually kick in."
402,,100,Anti-AMF,Lyrical Nanoha,Benevolence,"Let’s be serious, here. Having your magic taken away in this world, even temporarily, sucks. It especially sucks when your enemy has gotten their hands on an Anti-Magilink Field and promptly does that to you, rendering you helpless. But you’re not like those TSAB goons - you know how to preserve when someone takes your trump card away. Or rather, it just doesn’t take - AMF fields completely fail to disable or drain your magic, and you’re just as effective as you were before. Post-jump, attempts to nullify or take away your abilities have a higher failure rate, or don’t take as much as they otherwise would."
403,,100,Tank Form,Lyrical Nanoha,Benevolence,"Opposite of the theory behind Sonic Form, this instead significantly reduces the energy spent on flight, and instead uses it to significantly up the energy of protective fields. The upside to which is essentially benefiting from two permanent active defense spells, at the cost of most likely having to take hits to those defensive spells more often. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)
"
404,,100,Overdrive Form,Lyrical Nanoha,Benevolence,"Normally, differing Jacket designs hinge on the redistribution of power between systems, making the reasonable assumption that the Mage does not wish to allocate any more power to the Jacket as a whole. However, it is possible to do so. Simply by increasing the power available to the Jacket, it can become more mobile and armored, provided the Mage has designed the Jacket to handle the increased power. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)"
405,,100,Raiment - Boosted,Generic MG,Benevolence,"For 100 CP (even for Mahou Shoujo) the raiment will become actual armor, increasing your toughness while you are transformed. (CG Note: Requires Raiment - Generic MG first.)
"
406,,100,Hachikou Statue,Golden Sky Stories,Benevolence,"A statue dedicated to a dog which displayed legendary dedication to its deceased owner, this statue once bought, seems to appear in inconspicuous locations everywhere you go. Though its legend seems to bend slightly from locale to locale, one fact holds true – should you ever be in a tight pinch, the statue will animate and come to your aid.
"
407,,100,Spell Card Pact ,Touhou Project: Parasol Paradise,Benevolence,"After your time here, you may impose spell card rules in any Jumpchain of choice before a fight if given consent. This does not reuire the use of actual spell cards, though it may if you wish, but instead an agreement to suppress and eualize raw power for both parties, creating an environment where pure skill is valued above all. The outcomes of these fights will not result in the death of either party, no matter how powerful the attacks. However, it will hurt, and will render most unconscious after getting hit with powerful enough attacks."
408,,100,Keseran-Paseran ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Benevolence,"You have a Keseran-Paseran, a fluffball that can fly and bring happiness to anyone who holds it. Just having it around seems to improve your mood and ward off depression. If someone else were to touch it without your permission, it will give them a mild shock. This is not a ball of mould that grew in the back of your warehouse. I would not trick you into buying a ball of mould."
409,,100,Art Come to Life ,Ib,Benevolence,"Every piece of art in Guertena’s Fabricated World has a spark of life within, and is not limited to an immobile life. You can now give yourself a degree of mobility, depending on your form. Works with humanoid bodies such as mannequins and dolls can now move about freely, the body ignoring the normal limitations of physics and physical composition as the entire artwork is filled with your life energy. Paintings are a little more limited, but with simple effort you can move to a degree within your painting, waving at a curious onlooker or grabbing something from close by. You might even be able to make your frame shake about if you get used to the dynamics of your inhuman form. With enough willpower, you can project up to half of your upper body outside of your artwork, though you must still remain connected to your piece. In this manner, a painting can use his or her hands to drag the painting around, giving you a fair degree of mobility. Give yourself enough time, and you might be able to find even more ways to move around. If you are in a different form that’s not your art self, this perk generally only applies if you are in a petrified, inanimate, or otherwise immovable state; even so, under those circumstances it can be very useful. Essentially, the perk also ensures that as long as you have a body, conscious thoughts, and the necessary will, you can move your body to some degree; this means that even if your body was paralyzed or frozen rigid with ice, as long as your mind is okay you can still make your body move.
"
410,,100,Warpaint ,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Benevolence,"For when you don't want to wear armour but you want to look flash, this magical paint can help you not die, since it provides the equivalent protection of a full coat of good quality steel chainmail.

Warpaint cannot be worn under other full body armour, as something like chain or platemail would warp the warpaints magic and leave it worthless.
"
411,,100,Status Healing ,Danmachi,Benevolence,"Unlike the original Spirit Healing this version grants you the ability to regenerate your mind at small rate after using magic and heal any of your physical wounds and recover your stamina at accelerated rate. At max rank your mind can regenerate enough that you can spam low to mid level magic all day without exhausting yourself and heal all of your wounds from small cuts to lost limbs except decapitation within seconds along with a never exhausting stamina.

417,,100,Orange Marmalade Jar ,Wonderland No More,Benevolence,"This is a well-known Wonderland remedy for the unpleasantness associated with falling large distances. If you gulp down the marmalade while falling, your fall will slow enough so that you will take no damage from the fall. After consumed (there’s enough for one use), the jar refills after your unbirthday.

418,,100,CRYSTAL CLOAK ,Warhammer Fantasy: Kislev,Benevolence,"A swirling mist of dancing, enchanted ice crystals that make up a garment of surpassing beauty. When the wearer is attacked these shards harden and shift to provide excellent protection against physical strikes and make the wearer more difficult to hit.
"
419,,100,Stone Age Superstition ,Warhammer Fantasy: Orcs & Goblins,Benevolence,"The world has evolved. Grown beyond the stone and simple lives of hunters and gatherers, but you have held onto the things that made that world different. Unlike others who drape themselves in armor you can adorn yourself with mystical markings which work as well as a coat of light chainmail and in general you tend to hit harder than the average Greenskin on account of getting yourself into a nice killing frenzy before every battle with a few minutes of prep time. This frenzy is able to allow you clarity in battle, making your perceptions of time double as you move through the killing field, though it doesn't make you any faster the efficiency you get out of your movement for just taking a few moments to chant and get the blood flowing is worth it.
"
420,,100,Armour of Tarnus ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Benevolence,"Normally, heavy armor like this set of steel plate would interfere with one’s ability to draw on the Winds of Magic by restricting one’s motions (explaining why exactly it would hinder a user of the Lore of Metal), but this armor is so heavily enchanted that it negates the effect your restricted movement would have upon the casting of spells. Even without that improvement, it would make for excellent armor - strong and protective against everything from pistol bullets to a Norscan axe. By no means is it invincible, but it is certainly better than nothing.
"
421,,100,Arcana Of Renewal ,Endless Legend,Benevolence,"May be taken up to 4 times, each one providing you with a different array of magical powers. Pain Through Power is not required to cast magic, but it does increase the overall power of your spells.

How do you think the Ardent's survive being strapped to pillars and burned? Because the same power they call upon to destroy can be used to heal. As an Arcana, you can heal injuries quickly.
"
422,,100,Tier One Insignia ,Endless Legend,Benevolence,"Reserved only for legendary heroes (Like you) these expensive and hard to acquire inisignia provide a minor buff to anyone under your command within a mile of you. All buffs are the same as the Ring+Talisman, only provide a quarter the bonus.

Iron: Keen eyes and quick feet make your force more adapt as scouts, or just more likely to notice things you may miss.

Titanium: Your men are noticably stronger and more stoic than normal.

Dust: Your men's health is always good, and they heal minor injuries quickly.

Glassteel: You men are a little more nimble footed, and all have better aim.
"
423,,100,Healing Potions ,Warhammer Fantasy: High Elves,Benevolence,"For all his great power, the mage Teclis is still a very, very sick elf. So sick, and so weak because of his sickness is he that the archmage requires multiple potions like these just to function day to day. You might not be afflicted like him, but a bit of on-the-spot healing should never be turned away. This small case contains 6 ‘healing potions,’ which will each deal with one ‘mortal wound’ apiece. The potions restock daily, but do not stockpile.
"
424,,100,Blue Bracelet ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventure,Benevolence,"Well, this little contraption takes the form of a bracelet made by the sealwork mastery of the Maidens. Usually squirrelled away in odd places with a limited power supply it projects a magic barrier that helps soften the blows of enemies against its bearer for a short time. While this would normally only last for an hour before it’s protection is lost, you’ve actually gotten a prototype that can recharge itself every twenty four hours and lasts for half an hour. It’s not as strong as the one shot models but even it’s half hour capacity can be useful. It can deflect arrow fire, soften hits from fireballs, or even turn a perfectly aimed killshot into merely a debilitating blow. It activates the first time you are hit by something and won’t turn itself off until the thirty minutes are over... so it’s still better to dodge. Right?
"
425,,100,Sword and board ,Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening,Benevolence,"Just a regular old sword and shield, worthy of a warrior, but not much else.They both have your name engraved on them, and are quite durable. The sword is capable of deflecting magic projectiles, interestingly enough.
"
426,,100,Sheath ,Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword,Benevolence,"You are a living sword, of course your free item would be a sheath. Well, it doesn’t actually have to be a sheath, it could be a stone pedestal hidden deep in the woods, or maybe a statue pointing you into the sky dramatically. Or, yes, it could be an actual sheath. What’s more important is what this ‘sheath’ of yours actually does. Specifically, so long as you are in your sheath, you heal, repair, regenerate your magical reserves, or otherwise regain power far faster than you normally would, a little over three times as fast. Also of note is that a less mobile sheath would pair well with your ability to decide who can and cannot wield you, creating a decent excalibur impersonation. Lastly, the ‘sheath’ can create an illusion of you being rusted over or covered in vines if you wish for it to do so."
427,,100,Family Tradition ,Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks,Benevolence,"The tradition for princesses of the royal family is to be rescued of course. Just sit back and relax as the Hero does his thing. Well, no actually, I’m lying. Sort of. See, that used to be a tradition, but the Tetra happened and now the family tradition is to pass useful things down from parent to child. A simple ring, a song, a magical flute... Well, the point is that when you pass something along, maybe give someone a gift, that gift will have a very weak magical effect that does it’s best to ensure that they stay together. Nothing major, but let’s say that if they were to drop a coin, it would bounce towards them instead of off a cliff or into a river.
"
428,,100,Red Potion ,Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks,Benevolence,"For once, the empty bottles that Hyrule has used seem to be gone. Nowadays they just have normal bottles with potions inside them. Specifically, this red potion will restore a small chunk of your life energy - for a normal person, about twice what your maximum ought to be. For hard numbers, six hearts. Since this isn't refillable, you get one potion per week.
"
429,,100,"My Power, Not Yours ",Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker,Benevolence,"It’s never fun to have your own powers or techniques turned around on you, is it? Having a fireball whacked back at you after throwing it is both irritating and nonsensical - how does one hit a fireball with a sword anyways? Counter magic perhaps? Or just ludicrous skill? Regardless of the fact such deflection shouldn’t be possible, your own magic will do only about half as much damage to you as it normally would. It won’t stop them from hitting it, but it will make the rebound hurt less.
"
430,,100,Potion Package,Legend of Zelda: Hero of Worlds,Benevolence,"Health, Magic and Stamina potions, which replenish weekly.

431,,100,Sorcery - Healing (One Dot) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Benevolence,"Exactly what it sounds like, the path of Healing allows the sorcerer to ease and heal the injuries and diseases of themselves and others.

436,,100,Psychic Abilities - Biokinesis (Self-Control) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Benevolence,"In the World of Darkness, psychic abilities and mythic sorcery are, at first glance, completely different. However, both manipulate the same powers, albeit in very different ways, and are both considered forms of linear magic. While a sorcerer utilizes numerous tools and ceremonies to harness supernatural powers, a psychic makes do with lots, and lots, of willpower. Furthermore, the majority of psychic powers are innate, and can be improved, but not gained, without outside interference, in stark contrast to sorcery.

The psychic ability to manipulate their own biology. While this ability cannot replicate the powers of the Paths of Shapeshifting and Healing, its flexibility is more akin to that of the Life Sphere known to true mages.

[1] Self-Control - the biokinetic can manipulate their own body on a low level. Minor cuts stop bleeding, small amounts of pain are ignored, and breath can be held for several extra minutes. To do any of this, the biokinetic must enter a trance."

The psychic ability to manipulate their own biology. While this ability cannot replicate the powers of the Paths of Shapeshifting and Healing, its flexibility is more akin to that of the Life Sphere known to true mages.

[3] Hysterical Strength - the psychic gains control over their adrenal glands( or so some psychics believe, regardless of glandular response or lack thereof, the result is the same), allowing them to pump their body with the chemicals necessary to turn even a normal person into an Olympian athlete - for a short time, anyway. This lasts up to an hour, at which point the crash hits. The crash’s intensity depends upon the length and strength of the boost, as well as the excess pain and stress the biokinetic endured, and will likely incapacitate the unprepared, knocking them unconscious. Of course, having the strength of an Olympian doesn’t mean that they can handle the strength of an Olympian, so it’s common for a biokinetic to injure themselves and, as adrenaline dulls pain, not realize it. There’s a reason the adrenal gland doesn’t pump constantly.

[4] Ignore Pain Response - the biokinetic may freely activate and deactivate their pain response. This won’t actually heal them, but it will certainly make being injured less annoying. Even with no pain response, the psychic can still sense an injury, but the lack of pain will probably cause them to underestimate its severity. Pain exists for a reason.

[5] Mind Over Matter - At will, the psychic can stop their own heart, suspend their need for oxygen, regulate digestive functions, control the immune system, and accelerate or suppress cell growth, regeneration or processing. They may consciously direct their body to perform feats of biology as if their cells were responding to their mind individually. They can nullify most toxins, fight off most mundane diseases, allergens or irritants, though the most severe may pose a challenge. With pain control, the biokinetic may flex and contort their body into unnatural positions and slip out of bonds or into tight spaces. They can hold their breath for minutes at a time while remaining active and, if necessary, actively redirect toxins to other parts of the body.

Mind Shield - The ability to passively shield one’s mind from intrusion and assault,
regardless of source. It is especially effective against other psychic powers. Can be
toggled off at will. At three dots or above, the shields can tell the difference between
friendly and hostile contact, and can allow select individuals to penetrate them, or
select powers to go through. Note, I’m not listing individual dots for this one, because
there aren’t individual dots. Each dot makes this power stronger, but short of explaining

[1] Rush - A psychic vampire may feed upon anyone within 10 yards of them that is feeling strong emotions. The vampire gains no benefit from this except a rush of power and euphoria. The victim, in turn, feels their emotions suddenly muted, but not removed."

Additionally, wearing them will lessen the negative effects of sunlight, but never get rid of them entirely."

You may not be able to prevent all harm from befalling yourself and those you care for, but you can help fix the harm after it happens.

Instead of some irrevocable change in your condition, death simply transport you to your own Underworld.

You start with basic forcefields that you and your allies can move and attack through, while those you don’t want to have free lines of fire and movement have to break them first. Put in time and practice, get out new forcefields and tricks.

If you want to create defensive barriers to protect an environment, then this is a good start.

By closing your mind to all but whatever dogma you follow, the words and influences of others on your mind turn into little more than a soft breeze against a stone fortress. Their honey-tongued arguments and temptations become irritating noise, their enchantments find your mind much harder to influence, and your resolve to follow your chosen Law blazes forth like holy fire. While some particularly strong enchantments or mind-affecting spells might still gain purchase on you, they will find you ten times harder to influence.

464,,200,Spell Purification,Duel Monsters – The Shadow Realm,Benevolence ,"Spellcasters are crafty, and more than that, they are incredibly prone to making warriors and other targets explode in several colorful ways. While you can work to dispel or counter individual spells, you can risk being overwhelmed against a group of spellcasters or a large amount of spells. This spell acts as a counter, forming an anti-magic field around yourself that greatly weakens or outright negates spells targeting you depending on the arcane power of the original users. This field can also be ‘spread’ to cover an area the size of a small building, disrupting spells similarly to De-Spell, though this will remove the protective field and require you to re-cast it."

You have a monstrous strength now, able to tear stone homes to pieces with your bear hands and crush horses in your grasp.

For that purpose you have been given a ritual of sorts, a spell to cast upon both the willing and the unwilling that will draw out latent powers and talents. With this, the child of a family famous for its strength could lift more than a grown man - or perhaps a dozen. The ritual may only be used once per person, but assuming you have the magical energy to pour into them then they will find themselves awakening with perhaps a year or two of training with their no longer latent talent - and on occasion, with certain tools of the trade having mysteriously appeared."
469,,200,Moonlantern,Baldur's Gate 3,Benevolence ,"You have in your possession a lantern that emits a pure white light in bright intensity that almost seems like the same as those of moon own light. Normally these lanterns are made by enslaving pixies and torturing them to harvest their inner light. Yours though isn’t one of those out of moral concerns. Your lantern simply has a magical power source inside that achieves the same effect without violating the rights of small fey folk.

Within the aura of moonlantern’s light no supernatural curse or magical darkness may take hold, while already existing ones will be dispelled. This light also wards off any hostile lesser undead, like shadows or zombies. Although it can’t keep away undead big leagues like vampires and liches, it will slightly weaken them and prevent them from using some of their abilities (mostly form changing and mental powers)."

On those occasions, you’ll gain a something called an inspiration point. You can hold a maximum of four inspiration points at any given time. By spending these points in times of need, you can turn the tides in your favor. Stuck with a problem that is nagging you for days? Spend an inspiration and have that final push to solve it. Having trouble penetrating an enemy’s strong defense? Spend a point to gain chance for breakthrough. You get the idea."
471,,200,Opposite Magic,Anima Beyond Fantasy,Benevolence ,"Magic, you have found, flows smoothly through you, no matter what kind you wield. Though for others, learning spells of flame inhibit their learning of spells of water, for you, their natures never conflict. Even necromancy, anathema to the Flow of Souls as it is, inflicts no difficulty upon you in further learning. As you leave this world, you will find that this skill remains with you, no power will be barred for as small a reason as being capable of it’s opposite."
472,,200,Saint,Anima Beyond Fantasy,Benevolence ,"The Supernatural is a dark thing. One cursed by god, a gift of demons. You know that, don’t you? But fear not. Your powers are different. Yours are granted by god. We the Church, have so decreed it. Though we ask that you not use it without great need, none will consider you cursed simply for possessing such power, no matter where you may go, or in what world you find yourself. Your holiness is such that they will not even need your explanations, they will simply know that you are a being blessed by god."
473,,200,Force Rejection Field,MORTAL KOMBAT 9-10,Benevolence ,"A peculiar magical trait developed by Jade, friend to Princess Kitana. You are capable of shrouding your body in magical energy that, for a few seconds, will cause any and all projectile attacks to pass harmlessly through your body like air. This doesn’t work at all on melee attacks, which will hit you just fine, but anything else can be dodged if you time it right. "
474,,200,Sword of Valor        ,Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous,Benevolence ,"A powerful artefact that once belonged to Iomedae. You have a version of your own, dyed in your colours and power. This banner is a symbol of hope for all those that follow you, inspiring them to fight harder and onwards despite terrible wounds and opposition. It heals lesser wounds of those who fight under its’ aegis, even your own wounds slowly close automatically when it is not far from you. Additionally, the banner can project a field across an entire fortresss and beyond that suppresses any and all teleportation effects from those hostile to you. Even the mightiest demon will be unable to escape with a blink."
475,,200,Divine Aid,Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous,Benevolence ,"The Gods are real and for you, they are closer than most. For better or worse, you have been marked as someone of importance by the Divine. You’ll catch their eye or ear more often, particularly any you personally devote yourself to. Such beings are much more likely to intercede and grant favour than with other mortals, sometimes giving a temporary boon in return for suitable deeds. 

These can be useful, a powerful spell on your party to increase their strength from Gorum or a number of undead allies raised by Urgathoa in time of need, but may come with a punishment if you dissatisfy the God. Gorum may expect you use that power for a worthy feat of strength, for instance."
476,,200,Take The Mile,Castlevania - Symphony of the Night,Benevolence ,"It is a well known phrase that if you should give someone an inch, they will take a mile from you. Given the nature of your quest to see Dracula slain, this is advice I think you can benefit from. While this armor isn’t the greatest, and the enchantments upon it will actually dull the use of magic to an extent, you will find that its actual value as armor is constantly rising. With every little success against the forces of darkness, with every room, dungeon, or area of the castle you conquer, you will find the armor hardening. The more they let you succeed, the more powerful the armor will grow. There is a limit to this, for the castle is only so large, and using it outside the magic is somewhat unfeasible due to the exact mechanism it runs on and the lack of ambient mana, but if you intend to explore every corner of the castle or travel around the world, this is a very powerful suit of armor."
477,,200,I Am The Knuckle,Castlevania - Symphony of the Night,Benevolence ,"The strength of the Renard family has always lain in their familiars, the animals they make empower and are empowered by in turn. Their scion, Maria, takes this a step further by having hers echo the Four Symbols, a set of Chinese guardian deities. However, such a reliance on having animal allies leaves a critical weakness should you ever be separated from them. To that end, you’ve learned to use a similar technique as the Renard family used on their animals and the Belmont clan on their weapons - though you’ll be using it on yourself to temporarily enhance your own body to ridiculous heights. The technique is horrendously inefficient compared to amplifying a familiar, but if you really need to be able to punch someone seven times in three seconds with the strength of ten men, this will let you do that."
478,,200,Circles of Protection ,The Free Universe,Benevolence ,"Another component of Circle Magic, these circles allow you to ward specific supernatural phenomena and creatures (such as undead, demons, holy entities or elemental magics) in addition to granting you the circles of force (a force field/shield ritual) and the circle of invisibility, which hides what is lain within the circle from the senses of mortal men."
479,,200,I am Not a Gun,The Free Universe,Benevolence ,"You are yourself - even if you were created for some end or as a tool of some agenda, you can overcome the urges and designs of your creation and show that you are not an object to be used, you are a living being! This generally makes you more willful and harder to corrupt or forcibly order around, especially when they’re trying to use some biological or supernatural component."
480,,200,Perfect Sidekick,Old Man Henderson,Benevolence ,"A friend of Henderson’s Player, after one death too many, had his own moment of ‘Plot Killer Creation’. Simon, someone meant to be the perfect ally and sidekick in Henderson’s rampage. You are just born to be at someone’s side, always knowing how to support someone in the best way and always being able to do so. In fact their own plots and powers seem to work just that bit better when you are around to aid them."
481,,200,Invincible Evasion,Anima Ark Of Sinners,Benevolence ,To get past powerful attacks unscathed you need to learn how to dodge. You learn to quickly dodge out of the way of blows and even hazards such as pillars of flames or green flames. You are invincible while dodging/evading.
482,,200,Valkyrie Shoes,Valkyrie Crusade ,Benevolence ,"Similar to the valkyrie sword, this is a magical token in the shape of hermes shoes which when crushed will restore the vitality and stamina of the user. A new one will appear each week within your warehouse."
483,,200,Valkyrie Swords,Valkyrie Crusade ,Benevolence ,"A magical token in the shape of a sword, when crushed outside of battle it will restore the user’s health and mana to full. A new one will appear each week within your warehouse."
484,,200,Rare Medals,Valkyrie Crusade ,Benevolence ,"These can be used to upgrade special abilities up to a maximum of triple their previous strength. An attack would hit three times as hard, a healing spell would restore three times as much health and so forth. Each upgrade costs 150% of the previous. The more powerful the ability, the more it costs to upgrade. You will receive 1000 of them each month"
485,,200,Fantasy Archwitch,Valkyrie Crusade ,Benevolence ,"It can be very annoying to lose again and again, without ever seeming to gain any ground. Now each time you face the same enemy and lose, you will do slightly more damage to them, last slightly longer against them the next time you meet. If they flee or lose a battle, you will do slightly less damage and last a shorter time next time you battle, this repeating until you are back at baseline level."
486,,200,Nullification,Valkyrie Crusade ,Benevolence ,"Using this, one can nullify any one ‘special’ attack. This can be used up to three times in any one battle, but the ability to activate it will occur at random during the battle and is not controlled. After it activates, it can then be used to nullify an attack of your choice. This can even be used to nullify a buff cast by the enemy team. This will not affect things that are already in effect."
487,,200,Soma,Shin Megami Tensei ,Benevolence ,"Drink made from the juices of a long-forgotten plant. It is like liquid divinity, and those who drink a dose have their body and spirit fully restored. Even a single drop can bring a man back from the brink. You have a ten mL bottle of it which refills every other day. The liquid you get is pure enough to, with centuries of work, discover what plant this is made from and recreate it with genetic engineering, unlike the Soma that you could find in this world yourself."
488,,200,Golden Apple ,Shin Megami Tensei ,Benevolence ,"A mysterious apple with yellow skin that shines like the sun. The light coming from it has a sort of mental healing power, such that those afflicted by any madness, be it borne from isolation and time, neural decay, or a simple curse, will find their mind put back together and their senses returned to normal after being bathed in its radiance."
489,,200,Wisdom Ring,Shin Megami Tensei ,Benevolence ,"A magical steel band worn upon the brow. Enhances the mind of its user, boosting their intellect enough to make an everyday person the equal of a respected Nobel prize winner. Also increases their defenses: attacks seeking to alter one’s mind psionically or physically are half as effective, and attempts at preventing one from acting merely by shielding the body from its owner’s thoughts falter similarly."
490,,200,Lifespan Extending Spells,Kane Chronicles,Benevolence ,"Somehow, the long-lost, ancient spells the House of Life once used to expand its membership’s lives for millennia have been applied to you. Living for two millennia isn’t beyond reason."
491,,200,Celestial Armor ,Grant Morrison’s 18 Days,Benevolence ,"Armor forged in the fires of six exploding suns and blessed by the lost gods, this is some of the best protection anyone could ever ask for. While it may not stand against the God-Forged Weaponry of the luminaries of this age for long, it remains undaunted against anything less, and one magical feature of this armor is that so long as even one shred of it remains intact, not one hair on your head can be harmed directly."
492,,200,The Greater Cycle,Grant Morrison’s 18 Days,Benevolence ,"For those who have gained a greater understanding of the cycle, two additional options exist. Should you fall, you may choose to trigger your rebirth without waiting for mortal memory to fade. This means that, three months to the day you fell, you will be reborn, and will subsequently mature back to full adulthood within the following nine months. 

Alternatively, you may choose to restart your previous life at its beginning and try again. This will, effectively, restart the jump you are in. 

Past the end of your stay here, this will only work once per jump.

Requires The Endless Cycle to Purchase"
493,,200,Bleed For Your Art,Castlevania - Order of Ecclesia,Benevolence ,"In Wygol Village there is one particular man with strange tastes, a composer who wishes to craft music from the screams of a banshee. You know, the ones that are supposed to kill anyone who listens to them. I’m uncertain if he doesn’t know about the risks inherent to his plan or just doesn’t care, but he actually stands a good chance of succeeding. Much like him, your passion for your work can defend you from the dangers it possesses. If you had chosen to become a blacksmith with Ordinary Artisan, you might find yourself able to handle the heat of the forge far better than others, perhaps even handling the molten metal with your bare hands for a moment without injury. Or, like our composer friend, you could have a level of resistance to the banshee’s scream and other offensive sounds."
494,,200,Ambrosia,Percy Jackson,Benevolence ,"An unlimited supply of the food of the gods. Eating it will speed your healing considerably but too much and you’ll burn to death as you’re not a full god. Tastes like your favorite food, and stores fairly well. Also may be useful for bargaining with others. Be careful not to let mortals eat it as they get the flaming death immediately."
495,,200,Pull of Fate ,Percy Jackson,Benevolence ,"You gain an ability to vaguely sense what prophecies are at work on people and get an idea of what general role they play within those prophecies. Also you tend to have slightly improved luck. In addition you can minorly affect Fate, while you can’t change anything already determined by a prophecy or similar you may shift minor roles or when something is going to happen slightly."
496,,200,Denied Hijack,Warhammer 40K: The Warp ,Benevolence ,"You see, some of the more malign beings of the Warp like to hijack and corrupt what isn’t theirs. From lesser Daemons looking for a small snack to Greater Daemons and Chaos Gods reaping a bounty of souls, many tend to twist the tools of another to achieve their ends. You will deny that to them. Objects and areas under your influence are extraordinarily resistant to efforts by others to change and manipulate them."
497,,200,Unique in Standing,Warhammer 40K: The Warp ,Benevolence ,"With so many in the Warp willing to take advantage of, and falsifying other’s identities, it can be hard to make sure that whoever one is dealing with is the real deal. Not you. No being can impersonate you nor falsify your identity, and should you introduce yourself others will know that it’s truly you."
498,,200,Just in Time!,Disney Lorcana,Benevolence ,"The best heroes always arrive at the perfect moment, whether they know it or not. Chance or fate seems to arrange that you are always in time to intervene in a crisis or ease (or complicate!) a situation. At least your life is unlikely to be boring."
499,,200,Some Useful Things And Some Silly,Castlevania - Lament of Innocence,Benevolence ,"Here we are, some actual armor. This set of glowing plate mail radiates natural sunlight, banishing fog, warding away weaker monsters, and drastically reducing the amount of damage you take from such dark creatures. ...Well, it’s more like it’s negating the effect of the Ebony Stone on this place, but the difference is academic. In addition to the armor, there are also a number of minor alchemical items that grant you small boosts to strength and other aspects through a variety of methods. And some of them do basically nothing, just causing you to make silly noises whenever you walk or swing your whip."
500,,200,Herbal Remedies,Castlevania - Lament of Innocence,Benevolence ,"Oh? How strange. It turns out that someone in your family, your father perhaps, was an alchemist and gave you some lessons on some of the simpler things. While you will likely never create a weapon worthy of legend or an elixir of immortality, you do know how to create a number of simple medicines. At first glance these probably look like herbal teas and their ilk, but a good dose of what you can whip up from flowers, spices, and a drop or two of blood can take a sick man and see him hearty and hale by the end of the day. Though, you may wish to be a bit subtler than that. The church may have all but banned the hunting of monsters and devil worshippers in order to take Jerusalem, but all it takes is the village fool running their mouth at the wrong time to ruin everything."
501,,200,Waters of life,Grimms’ Fairy Tales,Benevolence ,"Cures all illness and disease, even terminal ones. Will replenish daily."
502,,200,Oathbreaker,Princess The Hopeful,Benevolence ,"Why should the Radiant fight with their hands tied? What gives the Twilight Courts so much leeway with the Light’s gifts? Your extradimensional nature rebels and bucks against the oaths imposed by your Calling and the strictures placed on your Queen-given (or self-created) Invocation, allowing yourself to use them without fear of diminishing your Belief in yourself. You may stumble and compromise your innermost beliefs, or selfishly stop trying to achieve them, without fear of straining the Light within to the point of forcing an internal crisis risking your spiritual wellbeing.

A Queen may still manually restrict your access if made aware and finding fault in your actions, and given great tragedy your mood may still diminish your powers in the Light but at the very least even as they slip away you can be assured you won’t risk becoming a Dethroned without some truly dark ritual performed on you by the Darkness’ servants. Henceforth, you will have a similar moral flexibility with regards to powers dependent on moral rectitude, having more wriggle room to operate in before taking on karmic consequences and having greater resistance to any build-in frameworks that hold you accountable through your powers to a certain code. You’re not truly untouchable with this, but at the bare minimum rest assured your own faith in higher powers won’t be your own downfall."
503,,200,Due to the Dead,Princess The Hopeful,Benevolence ,"Princess or mortal alike, the dead are greatly revered in Alhambra for their wisdom, guidance and most of all how they represent better times for the kingdom. You have a bond with the dead, permitting any healing powers you have to work on any form of sentient undead with equal potency as the living- potentially even cleansing unfamiliar ailments. Your dedication has not gone unnoticed, and you find yourself getting along splendidly with ghosts and other sentient undead beings famously. Even if you aren’t a close relative, something about you makes the dead trust you and enjoy your company. Just be careful, not all undead in this world are as dutiful as Alhambra’s loyal dead. That mad Tremere Lich might find you charming enough not to slay on the spot, but it might be best to give him a wide berth before he gets too curious about your soul.

Should you wish, you may also gain a pallid, gothic beauty seen on some Princesses of Tears. Though your skin may seem as if it had not seen the sun for months and your eyes somehow cast darker shadows, your beauty is as breathtaking as it is haunting."
504,,200,Burning Passion,Princess The Hopeful,Benevolence ,"Formality is a crutch. Specialisation is for insects. The Queen of Swords dislikes abstract debates on morality as much as she disdains the idea of keeping your horizons constrained, and prefers a simpler approach: If it hurts people it’s wrong, and to truly be yourself you must constantly learn new things to be independent from others. That’s why when you’re passionate about trying something new or improving yourself, when you pour your determination and SOUL into pushing yourself beyond your limits you advance by leaps and bounds beyond your peers. Even without expert guidance (and admittedly, this WOULD be quite dangerous), you could teach yourself to paraglide with the right equipment and a truly daredevil attitude. And when you act for the sake of other people who matter to you, your competence and skill skyrockets. Even magical abilities such as Charms are subject to the furious heat of your enthusiasm, striking harder to protect your family or being mastered should you be truly consumed with childlike wonder about what they mean to you."
505,,200,Support Magic,Hyperdimension Neptunia,Benevolence ,"You’ve learned the basics of support magic. At first, you can only use minor skills like increasing a single target’s strength for a bit, but as you grow more experienced, you can learn how to heal, or even affect small groups with your support magic."
506,,200,Idol of Innovation,Hyperdimension Neptunia,Benevolence ,"As a CPU, you are literally born from the imagination and faith of human beings. Because of this, you fulfil that faith for those who believe in you. While near you, people will find inspiration coming more easily, allowing them to progress technology, create art, or otherwise engage in inventive acts at a significantly accelerated rate."
507,,200,A Monsters Faith,Hyperdimension Neptunia,Benevolence ,"Just because you’re a monster doesn’t mean your faith doesn’t count. So far as a deity is concerned, your faith counts just as much as any other, even if it normally wouldn’t. Similarly, you’ve found that you can draw upon powers that would normally be unavailable to you due to your race."
508,,200,Your Only Salvation Is Death,Castlevania - Judgment,Benevolence ,"Causing pain is something that many monsters take a great deal of pleasure in - both in having spent the time to become skillful, and the hours wasted away on making those lesser than them waste away. You on the other hand, are a sick and twisted mockery of a healer who knows how to undo the work of others. Curses of every kind can be undone by your hand, wounds healed, the horrors of the night forgotten if you spare the time to ease their pain. After all, humans do so love those who tell them they are special and trick them into using their newfound strength to lay low their - pardon me, your - enemies. Demands of loyalty in exchange for an end to their ails would be almost kind compared to the subtlety you are capable of."
509,,200,Scaleguard Plate,MTG - Tarkir                                ,Benevolence ,"Forged from the cast-off scales of Dromoka dragons, this armor is both light and strong, providing a powerful defense - but is also filled with magic which enhances the strength of its wearer by a significant degree."
510,,200,Dragonscale Armor,MTG - Tarkir                                ,Benevolence ,"A shield and suit of scalemail forged from enchanted metals, this armor protects against magic as much as physical blows, and is practically unbreakable by normal means - though that doesn’t make you untouchable."
511,,200,Recovery Items,Touhou Luna Nights,Benevolence ,"You have three each of three kinds of magic capsules that take on a vague, telephone-esque shape. The first instantly fully refreshes your health. The second instantly fully refreshes your “mana” or similar magical power, and the third instantly fully refreshes your other special abilities. Naturally, you can hand these out, trade them with other people, or just stockpile them for yourself."
512,,200,Non-Lethal Combat,Touhou Luna Nights,Benevolence ,"You have ability to, when you want to avoid killing someone, somehow avoid seriously injuring them even when you’re turning them into knife swiss cheese, hitting them with a chainsaw, attacking them with a magic sword, or making them explode. In fact, you can use any of your dangerous weapons or attacks, and all you’ll ever give someone is a bunch of bruises. Additionally, as long as you aren’t trying to kill someone in battle, they will reciprocate and try to avoid killing you too. Captured, humiliated, yes, but not killed in direct combat."
513,,200,The Fumigator        ,Amphibia,Benevolence ,"The humans present in amphibia all seem to have a single miraculous power. They can fix anything in a matter of a few moments, Marcy rebuilds a town in minutes, Anne does all her chores in a few seconds, and Sasha, well she founded a rebellion in a few hours. Now like the other humans, you’re capable of fixing things supernaturally fast. You can clean any mess, fix anything that breaks, it only takes time and even then very little of it."
514,,200,Medicine Palm,Kill Six Billion Demons,Benevolence ,"You are able to balance the Atum in others by touching them, allowing you to heal their physical, mental, spiritual, and emotional wounds. You are also good at finding out how to help people heal, be it stopping a curse from killing them, to simply healing a broken bone."
515,,200,Het Transforms into a Pillar of Basalt,Kill Six Billion Demons,Benevolence ,"Maybe someone threatens you, or thought they could get away with what they were doing, or maybe they looked at you the wrong way. Regardless, by focusing on someone, they seem to do less damage toward you. While simple, it can be useful in some circumstances."
516,,200,Swat at Flies,Kill Six Billion Demons,Benevolence ,"Guns, in the world of today, are rare. Not extremely rare, but rare enough that you only occasionally see one. Regardless, they are potent, able to pierce most armor, especially the more advanced ones. You, however, can change. When attacked with a bullet, or other physical projectile the equal to or smaller than your hand, you can “swat” the bullet from the sky, stopping it from hitting you. You can do this 5 times a day"
517,,200,Brightest Star,Kill Six Billion Demons,Benevolence ,"Get enough power, and people will look up to you. Doesn’t matter who, or why, but you can use this to your advantage. You, at will, may start glowing a bright white light, and allies within the light are motivated and moralized, while enemies in it are demoralized."
518,,200,Ankh Cross,Wild Arms 2,Benevolence ,"This talisman is blessed by the Guardian of Love Raftina, and constantly rejuvenates the body, granting regeneration. Heals wounds and defects according to the user’s will."
519,,200,Energy Conversion,Wild Arms 2,Benevolence ,"Even though your body heals at fast rates, you can further focus your vitality in order to manually heal certain parts or speed up healing in some parts over others. Every time that you come out of combat or situations of great stress, you recover a small amount of health and stamina, as if the relief or the release of tension squeezed out a small reserve of energy. This small amount is enough to bring you from almost dead to only half dead."
520,,200,Energy Transfer,Wild Arms 2,Benevolence ,"With this ability you can reduce the burden of your allies, you can manipulate force power in order to share your physical and mental stamina with your allies. The recovery is equal to the degree of power used, but the degree of recovery doesn’t change even if you target one or more people. No matter how many allies you heal, the amount transferred is the same."
521,,200,Fastest Gunner,Wild Arms 2,Benevolence ,"A very useful trick, by manipulating the force power, you can accelerate your thoughts and reflexes for a short duration of time, enough to surprise those who expected you to be a sitting duck or shoot first in a duel. Very useful in short bursts, but could be very exhausting if overused. Practice can help with improving this."
522,,200,Ethersnaut,Mage: The Ascension,Benevolence ,"Look at those silly Void Engineers with their bulky protective equipment. A true Son of Ether knows you can breathe in space just fine thanks to the continuous nature of a universe without voids. In fact, you in particular are never in danger from the natural environment in other realms of existence. Go on, get out on deck of your Ethership and really feel the solar winds in your hair, you’ll be fine!"
523,,200,Hug Mode,Cereza and the Stray Demon,Benevolence ,"Oh no, kitty’s hurt! He might be a bit of a grouch sometimes, but right now he needs your love and support! Whenever an ally near you is low on magic energy just clamp your arms around them and you can rapidly rejuvenate them with your own. Your hugs are extra warm and snuggly, granting magic much faster than more formal methods for a young witch. In fact, they’re so good they’re noticeably good for the soul and psyche as well as for your friends’ mana reserves. Even a bloodthirsty inhuman monster would be hard- pressed to keep pretending to hate you after consecutive, constant, rapid fire hugs over the course of an adventure together."
524,,200,Fireproofing,Bad End Theater ,Benevolence ,"You know, after all this, I figure that you’ll probably want some way to avoid fire, right? This’ll help. It’s an overall fire resistance for you, and yes it makes it easier to breathe in smoke. It also gives a way to apply it to anyone else you care about. It’s not going to be quite as effective for them, mind. Just to put non-representative numbers up, they’d have maybe 20% fire resistance while you have 40%. You won’t be immune to fire with just this though. You can apply it to items, but that’ll give even less resistance than what you can give to other people.

Uh... if you do get this, I can’t really give this to you until after the Jump is over. Nothing against you, but Tragedy will notice if fire doesn’t do anything to you."
525,,200,Adaptable Biology,The Owl House V1,Benevolence ,"Man, surviving in an entirely new dimension is truly something, since the food that the natives eat could poison you. Or maybe the rain could be so hot, that by being exposed to it you would literally be melted, until you died a painful, slow and agonizing death. Just like Philip. Hey, I told you this Jump had spoilers for Season 3, no crying now. Luckily this won't be a problem you need to deal with, since your body will adapt to whatever place you are, being capable of surviving anything your surroundings throw at you. You could even swim in a volcano and be ok, though, a magic attack which mixed rocks and fire to make lava would still damage you (since it's an attack not an environment). And you could eat any natural resource without being affected negatively, unless it had a poisoning spell put on it."
526,,200,Proper Handling,Elden Ring - Caelid Wilds,Benevolence ,"Despite the tales of horror that come from those who interact with the blighted rot, there is no shortage of fools who would use it for some hair brained scheme, inevitably being consumed by it. You might be one of the few that can actually get away with it, as you will find yourself unable to be influenced or corrupted by any substance you utilize. As always, there may be accidents, but a drop of the Scarlet Rot falling from your arrow tip onto your flesh won't affect you, though the same can't be said for your target."
527,,200,Amulet of Dark Fire ,Warhammer Fantasy: Dark Elves,Benevolence ,"Hellebron is no fool. Morathi’s magics are terrible and...more immediate than the blessings of the gods, and like her you have somehow come upon a rather blunt countermeasure. This amulet’s mystical fires burn sorcery instead of flesh, functionally a ward of great power even by this world’s standards that sunders all but the most powerful magics arrayed against it. Bolts of energy burn up mid-flight, enchanted blades may be disrupted by crackling bursts mid-swing and even the fetters of a daemon may fray in its presence. Just be warned: Enough raw power can and will punch through even its protection, and it certainly offers none to harm of an even indirectly physical nature-such as shrapnel from detonating the nearby landscape with magic."
528,,200,Benevolent Dawn,Destiny: The Guardians,Benevolence ,"The Light is connected to cooperation, and it seems your Light embodies this more than any seen before you. Whenever you use the Light an to either heal or buff an ally, you seem to get twice the effect that any other would. Your Lights affinity for helping others allows you to heal any conventional wound or disease short of death, regrowing even lost limbs. Your healing and empowering abilities from other jumps are enhanced just as much."
529,,200,Martyr's Blood,Final Fantasy Tactics,Benevolence ,"You bear, through either heritage true or through some other means, the potent skill that few had ever hoped to touch. Holy Magicks, the magic said to have been handed down from the great Saint Ajora Glabados, which allows one to act as a channel for light from the heavens into the mortal realms to cast a protective Aegis upon those chosen to hasten their personal time, place an automatic spell which will save the chosen from death once, and shield from both magical and physical harm or call down great ruination upon one's foes sticking both mind, soul, and body as one. This is a potent skill in and of itself, however it also grants you an innate spiritual purity that is so potent that if one were to try they could cancel many lesser magicks with it."
530,,200,Adoption,Beast: The Primordial,Benevolence ,"You've found a means to send a mortal on a traumatic dream-quest, allowing them to awaken to supernatural power. This not only makes them eligible for Family Ties or undergoing the Devouring if they weren’t already, it also grants them minor psychic powers, such as psychometry, biokinesis, or telepathy."
531,,200,Professional First Aid Kit,World of Final Fantasy: Mirage Keeper,Benevolence ,"10 Hi-Potions, 5 X-Potions, 3 Mega-Potions, 10 Hi- Ethers, 5 Turbo Ethers, 3 Mega-Ether, 5 Phoenix Pinion, 1 Mega Phoenix, 3 Elixir, 1 Megalixir, 15 Wobblestoppers, 10 Remedies, and 5 Remedies+.

532,,200,Stalwart,Mummy: The Curse,Benevolence ,"The Bull-headed are tireless and unflinching in their dedication to the cause for which they defined themselves before the Judges. You have great stamina and ability to remain true to your ideas, even in the face of deadly environments and magical mind control."
533,,200,Quincy Greed,Bleach,Benevolence ,"The Quincy stand alone, abandoned by their allies, against the storm that is the Hollow menace. The sole willing protectors of this world, compared to the greedy Shinigami. With a mindset like that and the way their powers work, it’s no wonder that Quincy are often quite greedy. They take from others, even the energy they use is what is found in the world around them, and then claim it all as their own property. But what they take, they are loathe to give up, and the Quincy have designed methods to keep their powers to themselves. Others struggle to interfere with your powers, from specific abilities to overall Reiryoku, and you possess several techniques that prevent them being stolen or forcibly return which is lost. 

While these means improve with experience, his Majesty able to return the powers the filthy monk of the Shinigami stole in just seconds with a small sacrifice, you are currently more limited. Through sacrifices of flesh, blood and other vital parts, you can unseal sealed powers and regain part of what was stolen. Even if the thief has long since left or the loss was intended to be permanent, it is not so. It may take time to fully regain and sometimes truly dangerous rituals if you threw them away yourself as a cost like the fools that use Letz Stil, but if it was yours, it’s never truly gone. "
534,,200,Doble Attack,Bleach,Benevolence ,"The cero may be the traditional special technique of Hollow choice but it’s an exceptionally poor decision against you, as are almost all other energy based attacks. You’re able to catch and reflect Cero and similar energy projections back at the enemy, even being able to add similar techniques of your own to it mid reflection. This might manifest as eating and spitting back out an attack or a more ordinary catch and throw with your hands. Attacks that could normally harm you quite badly will be harmlessly caught if you can react in time with your chosen method of defence, though a vastly overpowering attack can overwhelm you. This is not only limited to spiritual energy, as almost any kind of supernatural energy or non-kinetic mundane energy can be reflected this way."
535,,200,Bringer Buff,Bleach,Benevolence ,"The training regimes that Xcution puts themselves through must be intense, considering those are their living bodies operating on a level to threaten a Captain of Soul Society. For all the talk of physical bodies learning to handle stress, they’ve clearly gone far beyond what a living human should be capable of. Like them, your physical body is fairly easily able to keep up with your spiritual or magical power. So long as you put in constant, fairly intense training to raise your physical limits, you’ll find they quickly rise to the level needed to contain your natural power. No more worries about tearing off your legs with a Bringer Light accelerating too quickly, as you can easily go well beyond the limits of the human body. "
536,,200,Take It Head On,Bleach,Benevolence ,"What matters most in battle? It’s sure as shit not fancy footwork, puffed up sword waving or whiny magic. It’s being a hard enough fucker to take the hits and give them back just as good. Too many of your fellows fall short at the first stage, dropping like flies the moment someone has a good shot. Not you though. You’ve always been naturally tougher than everyone around you, gifted in all things defensive. The primary initial way this appears is in a greatly increased defensive property. For most races, this is in inordinately tough bodies. A normal human would have skin like tough bark while a Menos or seated Shinigami’s skin seems like steel, much more potent than peers of the same level. A Hollow might instead empower their regeneration to be much faster or a Quincy their Blut Vene. 

You’ve got a natural affinity for anything else that falls under the umbrella of just tanking and surviving everything that comes at you. These things will grow quicker and smoother in you, the rate of increasing these gains increasing with your power to help you stand out as a bulwark among your level. "
537,,200,Death Resistant Bodies,Bleach,Benevolence ,"Cut in half, twisted apart, impaled many times or practically turned into a puddle of minced meat. Shinigami can be surprising tough, given their lack of regenerative powers. Some of them chalk it up to sheer will and others to the love of battle but the end result is the same you experience now, just being that fucking hard to put down. You can battle on despite some truly horrendous wounds, stuff that’d kill normal people outright or at least disable them from pain and limited mobility. Your body’s stamina is usually up to the task too, helping you push yourself through days of hard exertion when you call on it to do so. You might cause yourself even more damage in the long run by pushing so hard but when it’s necessary, it’s necessary. This won’t help you heal up any faster than normal, just make you take a whole lot more before that healing really becomes critically needed."
538,,200,Shattered Shaft,Bleach,Benevolence ,"Nothing can keep a hero down for long, not even losing what makes him a hero in the first place. As long as you hold your convictions strongly in your heart, you’ll find it possible to regain power that has been lost. Partially and in full, for both supernatural powers and more mundane sources of influencing the world. Even having had your spiritual powers cut out of you, a path will unveil itself to you in order to regain them. 

But these paths are dangerous and risky, offering a quick regain of what you lost at the price of putting your life on the line, or perhaps something nearly as valuable. Lost spiritual powers could be forcibly reawakened, or new equivalents gained, by subjecting yourself to near-hollowfication and emerging victorious against your partially corrupted self. Another comparison might be the training the Quincies undergo to recover their powers once they use Letz Stil, training to exhaustion and then requiring an arrow fired to an exact spot on their hearts."
539,,200,Dwarven Constitution,Gloryhammer,Benevolence ,"You have nearly limitless stamina, able to travel at top speed all day and still be ready and eager for battle when you arrive (and to swing your sword all night, if need be). You’re also unusually resistant to magical effects—spellcasters will find you a slippery target, able to power through effects that would stop an ordinary man in their tracks."
540,,200,Elixirs,Mobius Final Fantasy,Benevolence ,"A crate of 200 Elixirs, fully restores stamina, health, and cures you of all negative status ailments. 20 Elixirs are regenerated per year."
541,,200,Solo Forbidden Area,Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Benevolence ,"Activating Solo Forbidden Area creates a zone around the user that enhances their cursed energy capacity and outputs well as any other sorcerer within range. The technique can be elevated into a ritual using incantations, hand signs, dance, and music. By including all of these steps, the technique's effectiveness can be raised to 120 percent."
542,,200,Miracles,Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Benevolence ,"Small miracles the user experiences throughout everyday life are erased from their memory and stored. Something as simple as seeing all the same digits on a clock would count as one of these little miracles. The markings under their eyes show how many miracles the user has. When a miracle has been released, the markings lose their color. These miracles are released when the user's life is in danger, altering their luck to allow them to survive what would otherwise be a fatal injury."
543,,200,Reversed Curse Technique Potential ,Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Benevolence ,"Cursed energy stems from negative emotions and human bodies can't be regenerated by it. In order to generate positive energy, negative energy must be multiplied together. This can be achieved through a reverse cursed technique. Doing so is simple enough in theory but it requires extremely sophisticated cursed energy manipulation that most sorcerers can't pull off. But now you can. With a simple purchase of this you can now easily pull off Reverse Cursed Techniques with little to no effort. You could make Gojo who uses reverse cursed technique every second look like a noob just starting out as you can also heal other people."
544,,200,SUPA STRONG,Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Benevolence ,You are way way stronger than the normal human. Easily breaking records and running a 50 meter dash in 3 seconds and destroying walls. This has its limits and there are those with strength beyond that especially when enhanced with cursed energy but even then. You are beyond normal humans.
545,,200,Kin of the Faith,Seven Deadly Sins,Benevolence ,"The problem with having teams of incredibly powerful people, is that they often seem to never actually work as a team. Now, sometimes this really just seems to have no explanation. But there are indeed those beings whose powers would affect all around them, indiscriminate towards friend or foe. You and any of your allies no longer suffer this particular barrier to fighting together. You’ll be able to freely use any of your abilities, as will your allies, without risking harm to any ally. These powers simply wash over the others, leaving them unharmed and unaffected unless you want them to be. Sure, your enemies may call it out as being horribly unfair of you to force them to obey magical rules whilst you fight unopposed but they’ll be dead soon. "
546,,200,We’ve Slept For How Long?,Seven Deadly Sins,Benevolence ,"Just because you don’t physically age, that doesn’t mean the ravages of time won’t affect you in some way. Everyone changes over time, for better or worse, but that’s another matter. What’s important right now is that, especially after a good few thousands of snoozing in a coffin, your power isn’t just a static trait. You can grow weaker over time, from not practicing those hard worked for muscles to just seeing your magic drain away over time. Your power really is static, at least in this fashion. No matter how much time passes, you’ll never find yourself weakening because of it. Your muscles never atrophy, your magic will not empty over time, and your mind will not rot as you age. You’ll still physically age and die once your lifespan reaches its end but until that time you’ll be as healthy as you were in your prime. "
547,,200,Darkness Fears Not Light,Seven Deadly Sins,Benevolence ,"Not all Vampires are the same, even within the Vampire Clan. Certainly, most fear fire and sunlight as death itself but there are those to whom it takes stronger stuff to really hurt. You are one of these higher breeds of Vampire as unlike the common sorts below you, you don’t need to fear sunlight or fire as the deadly factors that they usually are. Sunlight burns you, but as a particularly harsh sunburn instead of the incineration it delivers on other Vampires. Fire hurts you worse than any human but nowhere near the death-in-seconds that your kindred receive from it. If you possess any other such weaknesses, flaws linked to your species or race, they will be similarly reduced. They will still be present and weakening but the severity will be greatly reduced. "
548,,200,The Next Generation,Seven Deadly Sins,Benevolence ,"All Demons may empower others by allowing them to drink the blood running through their bodies, turning them into partial demons named Reactors, though without a strong will or with the command of certain dark spells, they will just twist into terrible demonic wretches that attack all life blindly. You have gained an enhanced form of this blood-linked ability. You may pass on any biological powers, even supernatural biology, to those who drink your blood without the risk of madness or corruption or death. The more they drink, the closer their new powers will be to your own level with them. This even extends to other blood based sharing, removing the risk of sickness, incompatibility or other forms of degradation. "
549,,200,Elephantine Memory,Seven Deadly Sins,Benevolence ,"As one of the long lived races of the world, you’ll live to see a great many things change, be created and be destroyed. Even your own Giant brethren are slowly disappearing from the world as their mercenary lifestyles take their tolls. You may come to find, as the years pass by, that only your memory feels constant anymore. At least you’ll always be able to trust in that. Nothing can interfere with your memories anymore, unless you willingly and without influence allow them to. No adding, no removing, no alteration and no hiding from you. They cannot even be read or peeked at without permission from you. A true Giant never forgets their history or the precious friends that have been lost to all but them. "
550,,200,Senzu Bag,Dragon Ball Super,Benevolence ,"What wonderful things Senzu Beans are. Who could have thought that the idle work of a humble cat would one day have a hand in saving the multiverse? You’ve got a small bag of Senzu Beans at your side now, just a single bite enabling you to fully heal and restore yourself from almost any injury or battle. Where others might expend all they have in one fight, you can go for several with these. But don’t eat too many too quickly or else you’ll face some nasty backlash. The bag contains a dozen senzu beans and each one eaten will be replaced a week later."
551,,200,Ars Magus: Carbuncle,Blazblue,Benevolence ,"A purely defensive Ars Magus taking the form of a bracelet. Carbuncle temporarily projects an impenetreble shield of force in front of you - emphasis on temporarily. The energy drains very quickly and recharges slowly, so you have to be very careful with how you use it."
552,,200,Inheritance,Honkai: Star Rail,Benevolence ,"You gain access to a secret ritual that will allow you to either resurrect a recently deceased individual or simply cause a living and willing individual to undergo rebirth. They are then reborn as a member of your race (either from this jump or from another jump). Whenever you do this, you may choose up to three perks from this jump or others. You lose access to these perks until your next jump, but your “successor” gains access to the chosen perks permanently."
553,,200,But The Battle Isn’t Over ,Honkai: Star Rail,Benevolence ,"You can now fight until your last breath. This perk guarantees that until you are dead you will be able to continue combat, even if you lose limbs, your body is addled with poison, and you can hardly see through your own blood, you will have both the ability and the determination to fight until you succumb to the reaper."
554,,200,The Luck of the Devil... ,Generic D&D 5e,Benevolence ,"More often than not, you’re just lucky as all hell. Maybe literally. Playing games of chance seems rigged in your favor, where you win 7/10 games without trying. If you cheat, you could easily make this you winning any game of chance you ever opt to play.

Your patrons are also extra-benevolent to you, being super nice about the agreements you have for your powers, if you have a patron, that is."
555,,200,Empowerment,Generic D&D 5e,Benevolence ,"You’re a cut above the norm, when it comes down to the wire. When you’re getting close and it’s really tight, and you need just a little more, this is that touch, that push.

This empowers you to go beyond your limits for a brief time. When empowered in such a way, all near you gain a minor benefit, as you are able to compensate for their shortcomings, while you yourself become hypercompetent in what the task before you requires, be that the ability to block the strike going for your neck, or the skill to sneak up on a hyper-alert drow Guard.

This ability lasts only a few minutes, and afterwards, you’re exhausted, and must take a few seconds to catch your breath."
556,,200,Mind Protection,DMC: Devil May Cry,Benevolence ,"No one can wipe your mind or make you lose any memories, unless you want them to. Any influence that can affect your mind won’t be able to do so without your consent."
557,,200,Lucky Meetings,Stranger Of Paradise - Final Fantasy Origins,Benevolence ,"Impressive as the technology of the Lufenians is,they didn’t achieve their ability to set up loops on their own. Indeed it was another entity that taught them how to do that. Now you too possess such luck as this guarantees meetings with powerful entities who will give you some pretty fair bargains for power and knowledge much as the one between the Lufenians and their collaborator."
558,,200,All Terrain Adaptation,Stranger Of Paradise - Final Fantasy Origins,Benevolence ,"During the course of the game, Jack and his companions will fight in multiple environments from fiery volcanoes to snowy mountains. This makes it so you can’t be affected by environmental hazards as well as allowing you to fight equally well regardless of the type of terrain you end up in."
559,,200,Guardian Demon,Demon: The Descent,Benevolence ,"Some demons play with chance and coincidence, others see them as ever-present dangers. You’ve learned to mark a certain person or object imperceptibly, causally entangling them with your intent to protect them. They end up being lucky-like an important character in a movie, with bullets and fists having a good chance to miss them. This isn’t totally infallible, but in turn you’re also pretty lucky when it comes to taking action to protect them-and you can always find them, at least in mundane reality. So even if this won’t save them from an 18-wheeler barrelling towards them, you’ve a tendency to be in just the right place to show up and pull them to safety."
560,,200,Unchanging,The Seven Deadly Sins,Benevolence ,You do not change with the passing of time. Not necessarily immortal but you will be as physically well as you were in your twenties when you are eighty. Starving won’t even stop you from using your full strength.
561,,200,Self Mending Meditation​ ,Generic Exalted,Benevolence ,"Maybe you actually have regeneration. Maybe you’ve internalized the cosmic fact that pain and injury are simply a state of mind, ephemeral and temporary. Either way however you heal at a phenomenally quick pace, significantly superior to even other exalts. Lesser injuries might fade within minutes, severe injury with hours, and even the most critical and life threatening injuries in no more than a day or two. Additionally you never scar, and if you’ve got time to actually sit down and rest your recovery rate actually gets appreciably faster.

But it’s not just physical injuries that this helps. Even damage to your mind can be recovered, if you have suffered from such, and you can recover from any injury up to and including amputation so long as you have some time. Naturally, however, missing limbs do take longer to recover from. A final boon, and perhaps the most important some would argue, you recover your expended reserves of essence at twice the regular speed even when you are exerting yourself, and three times as quickly when you are completely at rest. ‘Even when you are exerting yourself’ does not mean it affects mote recovery from stunts."
562,,200,Megami,Shin Megami Tensei V,Benevolence ,"Even a normal human has some interesting capabilities in this World. One of them is the young Maiden meant to become the GODDESS. It seems within you is some power inherent to this fate but not required to fulfill it. As a result, you have small Healing powers. Demon and Human alike may be Healed by your hands, as you tend their wounds with a touch."
563,,200,Kindess Pays Dividents,Final Fantasy XVI,Benevolence ,"When the people of Mysidia arrived on the island that would become their home,they met a mysterious woman known as the witch of the north. They did their best to provide for her while she was ailing and before her passing, she repaid their kindness by offering them a powerful spell capable of freezing time itself. Now you can gain a similar luck, this guarantees that if you show generosity to someone that you will find that they are more than willing to repay you and reveal a surprising past as someone of quite a higher standing than they would appear at first glance. Perhaps they are royalty in hiding or even a Dominant that was banished from their homeland."
564,,200,Perfect Vessel        ,Final Fantasy XVI,Benevolence ,"The reason Ultima did everything he did was to find a vessel which he found in Clive. It seems however that there is another. This allows you to act as a perfect vessel for any being regardless of their strength or nature. Since you are paying this with CP, this also includes an immunity to being possessed if you don’t want to, you can easily inject any being possessing you nor can they force you to act against your will. Finally, this also protects you from the disadvantages you would suffer from it such as petrification from power overload,corruption etc..."
565,,200,Blight Proof ,Final Fantasy XVI,Benevolence ,"Something that is important to know about areas consumed by the blight is that not only are they so lifeless that no plants grow in the soil, magick is also impossible to use there. Indeed, even people as magically powerful as Dominants would be forced to rely simply on their steel and physical abilities to make it out of any fights they may have in Blighted lands. This guarantees that all your various powers,perks,magics etc... will always work regardless of the environment you find yourself in as they can’t be negated,weakened or manipulated in any way without your consent."
566,,200,"Parry, Dodge, Counter",Final Fantasy XVI,Benevolence ,"Parrying, blocking, dodging and countering are most basic yet also the most vitals aspect of compact if you intend to survive for long. This perk allows you to dodge, parry, block and counter any attack, power, ability etc... as long as your dodges/parries/blocks are timed correctly."
567,,200,Tempestshield,The Elder Scrolls - Online,Benevolence ,"One of the eight Jolting Arms, this beautify carved ancient elven shield, once in the hands of Maormer raiders attacking the Western coasts of Tamriel, has somehow made its way to your armory. Boasting impressive defense and durability despite its age, it's also able to boost the strength of the armor of whoever wields it by a small amount, letting it's bearer mitigate harm even from blows they have no chance of blocking. Also makes a good display piece if you're looking for something tasteful to fill an empty space on a wall that also just happens to be able to survive a direct hit from a small ballista."
568,,200,Oblivion's Foe,The Elder Scrolls - Online,Benevolence ,"Forged from the iron hide of a daedroth within the Font of Schemes by rebel holdouts escaped from the endless prisons of the Molag Bal, this armor is imbued with their righteous fury and unbreakable will. Stamina and magicka reserves and even the body of the wearer regenerate at near double the speed of a normal human, allowing a single man to fight for a day when he could've only fought for hours before. Additionally, it turns the weapons of the Coldharbor against her master, greatly strengthening the Soul Magic of its wearer. You may import any armor you own to gain these traits."
569,,200,Healers Without Borders,The Elder Scrolls - Online,Benevolence ,"Congratulations, you've just become significantly more valuable. Now boasting formal training in battlefield medicine, both magical and mundane, you're one of the rare few that's capable of saving lives as well as ending them. Of course, scrubbing wounds, tossing out a weak healing charm, and stitching whatever gashes are left only does so much. Your greatest talent is in generating magical barriers, making you an invaluable asset in siege and defense. In time, you may even be able to combine your talents to augment these barriers, creating force shields that mend wounds until they're broken or mystical links that let you redistribute damage between an ally and yourself, or given your otherworldly abilities, even more impressive constructs!"
570,,200,Soul Survivor,The Elder Scrolls - Online,Benevolence ,"Your otherworldly nature means that your soul doesn't quite fit into the Black/White spectrum that every creature in Nirn and beyond ascribes to. You're more of a... grey-ish? Viridian maybe? At any rate, soul-based magic has a significantly less pronounced effect on you. Soul trapping, spiritual corruption, and attempts to strike at your soul or similar core concept simply seem to fail outright around at least a third of the time. Even when they do succeed, it's with noticeably diminished potency."
571,,200,What’s In A Name?,Fate/Grand Order Part 2,Benevolence ,"True Names are important, as they declare the identity of their owner. However, to those with the right knowledge, names can hold even greater power. As you’ve managed to learn, there is a certain trick to what is called True Name Redesignation, and its consequences are varied. Even without much skill in magecraft, you’ve mastered this art, able to change the True Name of a consenting target. This will suppress their original identity and instincts to some degree, such as a mindless blob of flesh or a bloodthirsty monstrous wolf, and allow the target to take on a new identity and live a new life, including a new form, perhaps even a human one. This does nothing to the memories of the target themselves, they will remember their previous life just fine, but perhaps they’ll come to despite their former identity and wish to remain as whatever identity you gifted them.

This isn’t all, of course. If you gift someone with the True Name of someone who already exists, such as a Heroic Spirit for example, the target of this True Name Redesignation will obtain abilities mimicking them, which is how the Fairy Knights of the sixth Lostbelt came to be, taking on the identities of Gawain, Lancelot, and Tristan. You’re not required to make them 1:1 copies, such as how the Fairy Knights did have their own unique personality traits and appearances (even being of a different gender), but for the most part their power will be similar to that of the person they were named after. Unfortunately this cannot grant greater power, but it can seal it for the most part, bringing calamities down to a more manageable scale. And of course, if their previous name is revealed and stated outright to them, the True Name Redesignation will weaken, perhaps even unraveling if kept up for too long."
572,,200,3 Beads of Life,Shin Megami Tensei 3: Nocturne,Benevolence ,"Ah the Bead of Life. This item will fully restore the health and magical reserves of everyone fighting with you. Use them wisely, cause these things are valuable! They refill weekly for you."
573,,200,Unbound by Form ,Shin Megami Tensei 3: Nocturne,Benevolence ,"As a Demon, you would normally be bound and influenced by the nature of your form. A certain Demon would act a certain way, and nothing would change that. Now, no matter that nature of any form you may have, you will never be bound by their rules or influenced by their natural habits and nature."
574,,200,Picaresque Crown,Persona 5 Royal,Benevolence ,"This Crimson red Crown is the symbol of a Thief of Class. Within it is the essence of an infamous Phantom Thief who was a man of many friends, lovers and treasured allies. It has a rejuvenating effect on your body, healing you nigh instantly of any ailments or affliction you may have. It is also bonded to your Soul and can’t be lost or stolen."
575,,200,The Time Has Come,Persona 5 Royal,Benevolence ,Isn’t it incredible how a few actions and well-meaning words can affect the World? They can cause ripples that ever continue to travel with unexpected consequences. From now on you are a candidate for gaining new powers. When there is a void to fill or an artifact in need of a new master you are a likely person to receive such a gift. This will not give you a new power on the daily nor will it give you godlike powers out of nowhere but some new abilities will appear for you and come to you if you might not expect it.
576,,200,Fate can be changed,Persona 5 Royal,Benevolence ,"The whims of fate may seem absolute for some. Not for you. A Trickster is one who can turn the tides of fate and now this strange effect is yours. You may not notice it at first but just ‘one’ outcome is no longer what you are restricted to. By your presence alone and with the right words you may change someone’s fate, bringing them on a path to avoid their own ruin. Your actions could break schemes and things that should be predestined. Not even a false god could accurately predict what you will do."
577,,200,Unshakeable Humanity,Generic Angels and Demons,Benevolence ,"No spiritual being shall taint your humanity. You’re specially resistant against possession by the actions of any spiritual beings regardless of their nature, allowing even a normal human like you to fully control lesser demons and angels that enter in your body and to expel mid-ranking beings from your body. Only higher spiritual beings, at least on par with Archangels, would be able to actually possess you, but even in these cases you’ll still be able to influence them in some ways and recover control over you bit by bit."
578,,200,Physical Fortitude,Generic Angels and Demons,Benevolence ,"With the clashes between the holy energy and demonic energy within you, your own body grew stronger to the point of reaching a legendary level, but not on physical strength or durability, but in sheer endurance instead. Your endurance on par with legends makes you extremely hard to put down and even harder to actually kill. A Nephalem like you with this degree of endurance can even resist and keep fighting for a few minutes with a spear piercing their head, while still having the chance to survive and fully recover if you’re treated with some sort of healing ability as soon as possible after the battle."
579,,200,Percussive Recruitment Protocol,Heroes of the Storm,Benevolence ,"A rather curious phenomena has been reported near Braxis Holdout, where mercenaries consisting of infested Terrans have been repeatedly cured of the Zerg will controlling their mind and bodies by getting the everliving stuffing pummelled out of them by other factions. It’s...not quite clear what’s going on, but whatever it is there’s no reason you shouldn’t be part of it. Henceforth a severe beating, a gallant rain of gunfire or an otherwise intense delivery of physical damage can cleanse those corrupted by malign forces and restore them back into their pristine, healthy selves. Do bear in mind that the more overall powerful the targets are and the more extensive and elaborate their infestation or corruption is the more severe a beating you’ll have to deliver. Someone with as great potential and as thorough as transformation as the Queen of Blades herself would probably take damage tantamount to killing her outright anyway to purify.

On the other hand, this works equally well on currying favour with neutral mercenaries. Grudges may still be held over sadism, brutality and gratuitous dark magic-but if you give someone only shooting you because they were paid money a good thumping then let them live, you’ll find them surprisingly open minded to joining forces with you instead."
580,,200,Shield of the Wyrm,The Elder Scrolls: Dovah,Benevolence ,"This is an akaviri style shield, crafted from the scales of a slain dragon. Though it is enchanted to grant a strong resistance to magic, its real strength is shown when used against dragons. It will render its user completely immune to dragonfire. Though, the creators may have forgotten that fire is not all of a dragon's tricks."
581,,200,Relics of Ahzidal,The Elder Scrolls: Dovah,Benevolence ,"Ahzidal was the first great Nord enchanter, and possibly the first human to master the Elven methods of enchanting, with this set of ancient armor as one of his crowning achievements. In addition to its many perks, this armor will empower any enchantments you make, becoming twice as powerful."
582,,200,Armored Robes,The Elder Scrolls: Dovah,Benevolence ,"Not all members of the Dragon Priests were content with the ceremonial robes, instead desiring something with more protection. This set of armored robes is as protective as steel armor, and offers a decent amount of magic resistance, reducing its effects by a quarter. Additionally, wearing it allows you to levitate a foot off the ground."
583,,200,Dragonhide,The Elder Scrolls: Dovah,Benevolence ,"It is a blessing to be one of the Children of AKA, although your power makes the mortals fearful of what you might do with it. In order to alleviate the threat of some mortals jumping and killing you, you now have the advantage of Dragonskin. This ability will cut all damage you receive in half. Unfortunately, this will not affect the attacks of other dragons or Dovahkiin."
584,,200,Stranger In Time,D.Y.N. Freaks,Benevolence ,"Despite all the messes you’re about to find yourself getting into, you’ll never get too caught up in the fucking up of both time and space. You seem curiously immune to such things, unable to be directly affected by abilities that manipulate space and/or time. Whilst some evil god could certainly rewind the time of the entire universe to send you back, you’d retain both your mind and body as they were before that rewind. Supernatural powers that do not work by warping space and time specifically will still affect you as normal, even if they are altering or warping specific aspects of space or time. You are able to drop this protection if you would find it more beneficial for a time."
585,,200,Deceptive Strength,Final Fantasy XIV,Benevolence ,"You don’t look like much, but put a skillet in your hand and you can send even a denizen of the Void flying. Thankfully, even though the skillet wasn’t enchanted, the improvements to the level of control you have over your strength has allowed you to ensure that the skillet wasn’t destroyed in the blow. 

Good thing too, that was a good skillet. It isn’t absolutely necessary to use a skillet, but your strength has increased dramatically despite your appearance otherwise remaining unchanged."
586,,200,Blessing of the Sylph ,Final Fantasy XIV,Benevolence ,"Well, this wasn’t a formal blessing, but being acknowledged by the Sylph means that your job as a Botanist will get a whole lot easier. The hardiness of the Sylph as a beast race is not to be underestimated and as you’ll see in your plants as well, they can last for quite some time despite being deprived of water, sunlight, and other necessary nutrients.

Your plants boast a substantial resilience and a reduced need with regards to standard growth necessities. Conversely, they’ll grow substantially faster as well when exposed to adequate amounts of each."
587,,200,Innovator ,Final Fantasy XIV,Benevolence ,"You'll never make a name for yourself if you can't innovate - and sometimes, innovation requires you to take risks and make mistakes, even ones which might be catastrophic. It takes effort to gain experience, and it takes courage to put in effort - but you've also got a bit of beginner's luck whenever you start trying to produce something new.

You're far more likely to succeed - and consequently far less likely to fail if you go in completely blind, but more importantly than that, you're not likely to come up with a completely useless product in the end."
588,,200,Rapid Growth,Final Fantasy XIV,Benevolence ,"You can't afford to wait years for a forest to regrow! By the time that forest grows to a state where it's ready for harvest, you won't even need the lumber to build your house anymore! No, in order to make it in time for harvest this season, you're going to need to draw on some more potent forces.

It might be a little bit dangerous to use Aether in such a fashion, but by imbuing the saplings with concentrated Aether, you've successfully sped up the growth rate of the trees - to a point where you can harvest them again. Well, unfortunately, the trees did grow a bit bigger than normal, but you expect that's just a normal side effect from using concentrated Aether to grow things."
589,,200,Green Death,Final Fantasy XIV,Benevolence ,"Following the effect of the Green Death, the Tonberries have developed a strong immunity to toxins and poisons alike. Perhaps due to the Void nature of the disease which gripped them, their bodies are extremely adaptive – or perhaps it would be better to say that their cells consume invaders with a terrifying tenacity. Soon after being exposed to a poison, you’ll develop a strong resistance to it, and even toxins normally lethal will only make you slightly sick on initial exposure."
590,,200,Moogle Repair,Final Fantasy XIV,Benevolence ,"It isn’t just delivery that the Moogle are limited to however! In a more extreme display of their power, a Moogle can repair an item by actively rewinding it to a past state. In order to complete this perfectly however, the object must be small, and the Moogle needs to be aware of the item’s original physical state.

While magical properties can’t be rewinded once there are expended, in the process of learning such a boon, the Moogle’s inherent magical strength grows, and the effects of their spells all grow a little bit stronger.

(Small objects can be ""rewinded"" in terms of physical state, though the state had to have been known beforehand - and it fails to recharge any magical properties which may have been expended. A slight boost to magic effect strength.)"
591,,200,Arcane Portents,Horus Heresy: The Primarchs,Benevolence ,"The Arcane Portents are used by the Thousand Sons to minimise the risk of touching the Warp, as the legacy of the Flesh-Change looms heavily over each and every one of them. This one-use item will immediately stop you suffering a single bit of backlash or otherwise negative consequences from drawing on the Warp. You have five of them. "
592,,200,Combat Reflexes,Horus Heresy: The Primarchs,Benevolence ,"Your defensive reflexes are unnaturally sharp, fast enough that a normal Primarch would be completely incapable of following you which is already a feat among transhuman demigods. As if you have a natural instinct for danger and reacting to it before anyone else could. This would grant you an inherent ability to be exceptionally skilled at parrying attacks and defending yourself in general. "
593,,200,Incorruptible,Horus Heresy: The Primarchs,Benevolence ,"Fear not the temptations and threats of the Ruinous Powers. You are simply completely incorruptible. The Ruinous Powers could turn their entire attention on you, and you would never fall. To be raised on a borderline Daemon world would not affect you in any way either, as the taint of Chaos will simply fail to latch on to you. There is no price that could buy you out, no hidden secrets that would turn you away from the light. You are simply too pure for the power of Chaos to find any purchase upon your soul. No matter how much the Dark Gods rage, the only way they could possibly bring you over to their side is of your own free will, for neither trickery nor force will make you turn. "
594,,200,Vestige Body,Elder Scrolls Online – The Vestige,Benevolence ,"Maybe it’s because your body is not mortal anymore, but you don’t react to injuries like a normal person should. While you can still feel pain, it will not hamper you anymore, and your body cannot be broken or cut in any way. This doesn’t mean you’re invincible, just that your body will maintain integrity until you reach a certain threshold, at which point you’ll just collapse. You’ll always have a clear idea about how close you’re to the limit you’re. This also helps shorten your recovery time drastically. A night of sleep is sufficient to recover to complete health."
595,,200,Vestige Mind,Elder Scrolls Online – The Vestige,Benevolence ,"Your mind is unshakable. You are never hampered by extreme emotions, and you’re always able to make decisions with a clear mind. This also covers pretty much all kinds of mental illnesses you could be affected by, like PTSD and similar, clear you from any pre-existing condition you want to eliminate, and greatly increase the recovery from mental damage. This will also block any attempt to corrupt, possess or alter your mind without your consent."
596,,200,Unbound ,Elder Scrolls Online – The Vestige,Benevolence ,"All that immortality is not going to help you if you get soul-trapped. Sure, it’s a rare spell in this time and age, but it doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist (and Mannimarco and his cronies are still around). But thanks to this, you’re now immune to all kinds of soul related bullshit. Your soul is untouchable, and it cannot be trapped or manipulated in any way, shape or form, not even by godlike entities. You’re welcome."
597,,200,Crushing King*,Akame ga Kill!,Benevolence ,"This arm-brace/gauntlet Shingu have the property of granting superhuman strength to its user, making even an average human capable of crushing boulders and bending metal with ease, but, in addition to the immense strain it puts on its users due to being a Shingu, it can also damage its own user if used improperly, so caution is advised when wielding such a weapon."
598,,200,Brick,Marvel: Age of Krakoa,Benevolence ,"A pretty common power set, superhuman strength coupled with superhuman durability. For 200 points you can lift ten tons, shrug off small caliber gunfire at point-blank range, and withstand an explosion comparable to a frag grenade going off in your chest. "
599,,200,Healing Factor(Tier 3),Marvel: Age of Krakoa,Benevolence ,"You heal faster and more efficiently than others do. For 100 CP it’s minor. Minor injuries heal three times faster while major injuries recover a level of scale faster, Ie something that would naturally heal in two months healing in two weeks, though particularly severe injuries may still require medical attention. For 200 CP you have proper regeneration, flesh wounds healing before your eyes, broken bones setting themselves, and so on though you may still need assistance to recover from severe nerve or organ damage. For 400 CP, you’re closer to Wolverine or Deadpool. Not only could you regrow a severed limb or an organ within a day tops, but you can even live through injuries that should kill you before even you can heal. In extreme cases, you might even be able to live through being liquified and pull yourself back together or recover from a single cell. Unlike Deadpool, you don’t have to worry about a bunch of your cast-off limbs and organs pulling together to make a new you. You no longer need medical attention to make a full recovery from any injury, and will always heal to the best possible physical condition you can be in.

602,,200,Hero Insurance,Marvel: Age of Krakoa,Benevolence ,"When dealing with a super-powered malefactor, high-stakes violence could inevitably occur. The experienced superhero, however, can control the flow of battle to minimize unnecessary harm. With this perk, not only can you control the lethality of any of your attacks and powers, even making otherwise overwhelming destructive force completely harmless, but find that you rarely, if ever, cause unintended collateral damage or injury to innocent bystanders or property. Additionally, you possess the ability to subconsciously choreograph any battle you're a dominant factor in to limit the collateral damage caused by other parties, and unless it’s a chaotic melee of hundreds of combatants it’ll be rare for any collateral damage that does happen to include fatal casualties or property damage that isn’t fixed within a few weeks tops."
603,,200,Programmed Into Reality Itself ,Marvel: Age of Krakoa,Benevolence ,"That’s how deeply ingrained an Eternal’s purpose is. You’re not as rigid as some of them, being a Jumper and all, but that doesn’t mean you can’t reap the benefits of such. First, no matter what happens, you will always be you. No amount of experience will change you into a different person, and no influx of memories and information can alter your personality, you are who you are. Second, your soul is inviolable. It cannot be corrupted, destroyed, damaged, erased, stolen, or lessened by any means. Finally, since Eternals typically neither age nor mature, you may optionally use this perk to override Age in future Jumps and start at the apparent age you were in this jump instead, unless you took a drawback or otherwise gained CP for starting at a certain age. You may decide this after rolling for age."
604,,200,Mental Fortress,Marvel: Age of Krakoa,Benevolence ,"There are a lot of nosey telepaths in this world, and this is a bad point in time to have certain bits of metaknowledge get loose. This perk gives blanket immunity to mind reading and hostile telepathy. Not only are your psychic shields numerous, all-encompassing, and impenetrable, but if something did manage to get through them they would find that your mindscape is a vast and twisting labyrinth filled with deadly traps and countless dead ends, with miles to go before even reaching your surface thoughts, which are themselves protected by even more shields, let alone your memories or secrets and so on and so forth. You can, of course, allow others to read your mind if you want, and a set of innocuous but context-appropriate fake surface thoughts will keep any casual mind-readers from getting suspicious. You are immediately aware of any attempts to invade your mind. For an extra 200 CP, this extends to similar protection against any and all forms of mental or spiritual control, influence, corruption, alteration, or so on, natural or supernatural, as well as supernatural social influences."
605,,200,Golden Coin,Chinese Mythology,Benevolence ,"The Treasure Defeating Golden Coin is a small flying object able to deflect and block projectiles. This one is bound to you, and can block dozens of magical weapons of middling potency. Should it break, it will be restored in your Warehouse after five days."
606,,200,Celestial Bureaucracy,Chinese Mythology,Benevolence ,"If there’s one thing Heaven and Hell are known for, is that they both have large, churning bureaucracies. With every bureaucracy comes red tape and delays. Not for you, however. Whatever organisation you are part of, you’ll receive priority queueing for your requests and complaints, superseding everyone except those in the highest positions. Likewise, you can have any actions you plan to take authorised immediately and without delay by the group or organisation in question."
607,,200,Royal Guard,Devil May Cry,Benevolence ,"Okay, listen up. For this Style you're gonna need three very important things: Speed, precision, and huge balls.

Royal Guard Style is all about defence, defence, and counter-attacks. With the proper timing, you can block almost any form of damage that comes your way. Some schmuck coming at ya with a sword? Block. Getting shot? Block. Explosion? You can block that too. However, you can't block things like falling into a pool of acid or something like that.

By blocking, you store up the energy that was sent into the attack coming towards you, which allows you to redirect that energy into a counter-attack. You can also perform this by counter-attacking your enemy at the exact second that they launch their attack. Man, I sure said attack a lot back there, huh?

You can also create a shield in front of yourself to absorb some weaker attacks and convert them into life energy for yourself. Shhhhh. No questioning it, just accept that it works. Though, the attacks you can absorb are limited mostly to just projectiles, so don't try and catch a Stinger that's coming straight at you, that's just stupid.

And finally, you can use the Dreadnaught ability, a mysterious technique that transforms the body into a seemingly metallic shell impervious to enemy assault. That's right, boys and girls, you can become completely invincible... for all of five seconds. The duration of Dreadnaught depends on how much energy you have stored from blocking attacks, and you move slower than a tank on ice while it is active."
608,,200,Dawnblade,The Destiny Universe,Benevolence ,"Befitting of their unparalleled study and mastery of the Light, Warlocks often find themselves sliding naturally into support roles when fighting alongside other Guardians. While many schools have many means and methods through which they can heal or enhance themselves, none forget that it was the Warlocks who did it first, and mastered the art beyond anything the Titans and Hunters are capable of. This perk grants you a mastery of using the Light to heal others, everything from injury to illness and disease can be wiped away by your Light. Furthermore, when in combat, you can to a limited extent share with your allies any effects that heal or enhance yourself, though this pales in comparison to directly treating them. Finally, this perk grants you access to the Rift ability - both those of Healing and Empowerment, allowing you to either heal or enhance the abilities of anyone that steps within your Rifts. "
609,,200,Defender ,The Destiny Universe,Benevolence ,"A statement of fact as well as one of pride: Before the Last City had its walls, Titans were the wall. Whenever the enemies of Mankind assaulted the developing City, they broke against a bulwark of fieldplate in a wash of Light and lead. For all your martial strength and aptitude in attack, your greatest strength lies in defense - it is why you’re called Guardian. When you’re defending something, you find your aim is truer, your strikes harder, your powers stronger, and your skills sharper - you are at home on a wall with your enemies to your front and your beloved City to your back. Purchasing this perk grants you immediate access to the Barricade ability - create a physical barrier with your Light, and bring the wall with you."
610,,200,The Wall Against Which the Darkness Breaks,The Destiny Universe,Benevolence ,"By spending an extra 200 CP, you take what you defend with you, always carrying the memory of your precious home and your loved ones in your heart. This fills you with such strength as to ensure, no matter what, if you die, it will be on your feet atop a pile of your enemies. Your will and determination grow to match this new resolve, and you find the strength within you to fight thrice as hard when you’re charged with defending something. Finally, purchasing this perk grants you the Ward of Dawn Super - an indestructible sphere of Void Light whose size scales to your strength, and that protects everything inside of it, without exception.

611,,200,Devouring Light(Squad) ,The Destiny Universe,Benevolence ,"By harnessing Void Light, you are capable of consuming the energy released by killing your enemies to heal yourself and restore your stamina and energy. Theoretically, so long as you kept killing, you would never tire, and your wounds would continuously wash away - allowing for a combat strategy of one hundred percent offense, so long as you could end just one more life before yours. An extra 200 CP would allow you to spread this ability to any who may be fighting alongside you - creating an entire fighting force of warriors who draw strength and health from the act of fighting.

Requires Devouring Light to Purchase"
612,,200,Overshield ,The Destiny Universe,Benevolence ,"While all Guardians have an inherent force field made of their Light, masters of Void Light are able to take the gravitational forces that bind all things to shape a second defensive layer over the first, allowing them to fight harder and take even more damage than they normally would. You are capable of shaping your Void Light into an overshield, reinforcing your natural barriers.

613,,200,Restoration (Resurrection),The Destiny Universe,Benevolence ,"Stars are responsible for life as we know it, and your understanding of this idea leads into a mastery of the traditionally Solar healing abilities. With your Solar Light, you can literally burn away injuries, from the minor to the most life threateningly major, and you can even extend this beyond simple injuries - disease, poison, congenital conditions, radiation, your Solar Light can restore health to anyone. This is not limited to biological life either - your Light can restore function to sapient machines, repair damage, even cleanse malicious code from their circuits. With an extra 200 CP, provided it occured within a few minutes, you can even go so far as to reversing death, though at great cost to your own stamina and energy reserves.

Requires Restoration to Purchase"
614,,200,Resurrection(Upgrade),The Destiny Universe,Benevolence ,"Although they are more well known for their resurrection abilities, Ghosts are in fact capable of healing their Guardians of any wound ro abnormality, until they reach complete physical health. As long as the Guardian is still alive, they can lose limbs, perforate organs, be poisoned, take on radiation, all that and more - and their Ghost can heal them of these afflictions. There appear to be no true limits to this ability, although Ghosts are noted as experiencing ‘difficulty’ healing their Exo Guardians, with some finding it easier just to allow the Guardian to die and start from scratch. As previously mentioned, this even extends to outright death, as Ghosts are capable of resurrecting their Guardians without issue. The only major limitation of their resurrection is that, unless the body is completely disintegrated, they require a corpse to work with - it was this understanding that led to many Iron Lords hiding the corpses of Warlords from their Ghosts, until such a time as they believed they could trust these Ghosts to operate in the best interests of Mankind. As a Ghost, you acquire these abilities for free, but by purchasing this perk for 200 CP, be it through a special ability, or a unique trick of the Light, you’ve figured out how to resurrect your Risen anywhere, regardless of the state or location of their corpse. Will you use this to pull your Risen out of trouble, launch ambushes, break the law, or something else? It’s your call, Little Light. Finally, by purchasing this perk with CP, you will also find your healing abilities boosted - should your Guardian be mechanical, like the Exo, or possessed of the many myriad ‘unique’ biologies you may come across in future worlds, you will face no difficulties in healing them.

615,,200,Willpower,The Destiny Universe,Benevolence ,"The Darkness is alive - that is the first and most important lesson for any Servant of the Darkness to understand. It is alive, it knows you, it sees you, and if it finds you wanting, you would regret your entire genetic line ever existing. Anyone that uses the Darkness must, by necessity, be able to master themselves and resist its influence, or else find themselves dominated and lose all sense of who they used to be. You find this particular skill easier than most - no matter the source, no matter how corruptive it may be, you possess the will to resist, you can keep ahold of yourself and draw the line between what you are, and what you are not. The Darkness will not have you, you will have it. The stronger you grow, the stronger your will grows, and if you’re smart, with time you may very well be able to stand in the presence of the Witness itself and keep your mind."
616,,200,The Terror that Follows Behind,Miracleman,Benevolence ,"Heritage is important, but you need to remember that you aren’t the people you’re descended from. You’re your own person, and you won’t be defined as a reflection of those who came before. Stereotypes, gnawing fears of regression, or even lineage-based curses, none of these apply to you. You can’t be brought low through your ancestral line."
617,,200,Armament Haki ,Epic of Leviathan,Benevolence ,"Armament haki allows the user to manifest their spirit as a weapon. This is mainly used to harden the user's skin making them incredibly resilient to damage. The amount of their body that can be covered increases as their skill level does. Purchasing this will also unlock each level of the Armament haki including Invisible Armor, Hardening, Byogou, Ryuuou, Advanced Ryuuou, and Tribal haki."
618,,200,My Mind is My Own,Epic of Leviathan,Benevolence ,"When you really think about mind control is an incredibly common ability especially in worlds like Marvel and other superpowered settings. This doesn’t mean that others should have the ability to enter your mind though. This perk safeguards your mind not only by making it impossible for others to break in, but by actively attacking anyone that does. For example if someone intrudes into your mind they could be forced into a coma due to the backlash once they are thrown out. You may choose the severity of this attack in case you don’t want to actually hurt someone."
619,,200,The Dark Times ,Epic of Leviathan,Benevolence ,"While the emergence of powers is an amazing event it brings great chaos with it as well. For example when Quirks first appeared in My Hero Academia society basically collapsed as governments desperately tried to deal with this new variable and some super powered individuals declared themselves warlords. The solution was to embrace the powers with the emergence of heroes.

This perk has two effects: First you gain the ability to set up and establish a new status quo. You could set everything up like a standard superhero society or you could design a system of your own creation. You may design how businesses work, how people with powers are treated, and everything else that falls under society's influence. Second, since this only occurs in worlds with superpowers you gain the ability to introduce superpowers into a setting. You may choose exactly how this occurs before the jump begins. For example how much of the population has superpowers and how strong they can become."
620,,200,Teumessian Fox,Greek Mythology,Benevolence ,Like the giant fox that preyed upon the children of Thebes you have been blessed by fate to never be caught without your permission you could escape the most skilled of hunters managing to escape any trap they set fate itself will work to prevent your capture blowing winds to cover your track or remove your scent tripping pursuers to allow you to escape their sight.
621,,200,Armor ,Magnagothica: Maleghast,Benevolence ,"Worked with black magic and weird metallurgy, you’ve gotten yourself some kind of armour - whether it looks like plate, bulletproof vests, or cascades of evil talismans. Choose either physical or magical harm. Your armour offers significant protection against that form of damage.

For 20 IP, it instead protects against both."
622,,200,Indestructible,Magnagothica: Maleghast,Benevolence ,"Well, not quite - but the fascinating cocktail of toxins, diseases and drugs swirling throughout your body seems to have rendered you immune to all forms of poison and disease. You can still experience any positive effects from drugs or other substances, and can still catch any disease, but you won’t suffer any negative symptoms. You can also restrict any such hazardous materials within your own body from spreading to others; e.g. if you want to take a blood sample, you can keep them out of the sample."
623,,200,Trials and Tribulations,Scion ,Benevolence ,"It’s the belief of many gods that power shouldn’t be merely conferred, but earned through challenges. The Olympians hold to this so strictly they demand mortal and lesser Scion supplicants scale the steep cliffs of their Godrealm to hold audience with them-but they won’t find you daunted by these demands. When you are set tasks, limitations or tests of worth by higher forces like the gods you find yourself excelling to perform them. In a game of riddles you’d make startling leaps of deduction, and while you’d be no better a fighter most of the time when asked to showcase your skill with a sword to an audience you’d fence like you’ve spent months practicing."
624,,200,Cleansed of Sin,Fate/Faerie Britain,Benevolence ,"Even if you’ve incarnated into the body of a faerie in this jump, you aren’t truly an inheritor of the original sin of the faeries. That may be why you have the power to cleanse your body of curses, debuffs, and status ailment-like effects, as well as removing the weight of committed sins. This takes a couple moments of focus to pull off, but as long as you haven’t fully succumbed to a poison or curse, this will allow you to remove the effect safely. You can even apply this benefit to other people, letting you heal them of whatever curses they may have accumulated.

This doesn’t do anything to affect anyone’s opinions, however, so if there’s an entity out there judging people for their sins, this won’t stop that being from remembering what happened and judging them for their actions anyways, even if the “sin” was cleansed from them. But metaphysically speaking, they’d be sparkling clean."
625,,200,“I will overcome Britain’s curse!”,Fate/Faerie Britain,Benevolence ,"If Barghest had found this resolution earlier, perhaps the fate of this Lost World could have been different... it’s fortunate for you, then, that you have this power of focus and willpower. Your mind is yours, and your thoughts cannot be affected by outside forces, interfacing with yourself from another timeline, or being subject to a transformation that would otherwise devolve your consciousness.

For another -100 CP, you gain a remarkable power to come back from any transformation you have been subjected to. Even if you were turned into a harmless caterpillar, by straining with all your might you could break the transformation... although as you might surmise from “all your might”, you’ll be quite exhausted once the deed is done."
626,,200,Hamingja,Germanic/Norse Mythology,Benevolence ,"Luck and power. Both in the conventional sense but also in a form of identity, the fame and power to which one holds claim, that which separates heroes and kings from commoners; it is an intrinsic aspect of one's own self. The higher you are in the cosmological order the greater your Hamingja is by virtue of birthright, but also the more rigid and unchanging. Greater beings are trapped by their Hamingja within the bonds of urd, often gaining little power if any at all by their own acts or deeds, simply changing the nature or focus of their power, while the lesser mortals with great effort and risk can grow beyond their station to put their names amongst the stars and stones. Your luck is so great as to elevate you from that of a nameless lesser deity or demigod to being counted among the lesser known Vanir, a mortal to being a hero as marvelous as Sigurd, a dwarf to being counted among the four pillars and kings, or from a powerful being of the pantheon to being on par with the likes of Baldr, Freyr, Frigg, or the All-Father himself. I can not fathom what a primordial like Ymir would become. No matter your nature however, you will retain the mortal gift of being able to grow, not simply change. Hamingja can be borrowed, split, gifted, and even traded temporarily and permanently; it can pass from dead ancestors to newborns, through either bloodline or spiritual succession. This perk can merge with your other luck perks expanding the power and luck you express through these worlds’ gifts while also removing and or allowing you to toggle their negative aspects."
627,,200,Taker’s Cameo,Elden Ring - Altus Plateau,Benevolence ,"A talisman engraved with a stern likeness of Praetor Rykard, master of Volcano Manor. It will restore one’s wounds upon defeating enemies. When Rykard turned to heresy, taking by force became the rule. The gods themselves were no different, after all."
628,,200,Defender of Leyndell,Elden Ring - Altus Plateau,Benevolence ,"The soldiers of Leyndell fight their battles defensively. During the Shattering, they were the ramparts that fortified the royal capital. You too carry on this honored tradition, and have become a bulwark against all the Lands Between has to offer. When it comes to fighting defensively, be it safeguarding a certain area or figure, or just utilizing a shield, there are none who could get past your protections. Even the champions of old and the demigods would find some measure of difficulty in attempting to harm you, though it is questionable if the reverse is true."
629,,200,Metashield Deployment,Final Fantasy XIII-2,Benevolence ,"The metashield is a device used to project an invisible cushion of force in a single direction. After thorough testing, you figure that with a sufficient energy source, you could replicate the same effect even without the device. The inherent quality of the field can be changed such that it can act as a sort of launch pad to send you flying. Though you still have to designate an area for the effect, and it fades after a short time, at least you no longer need the original hardware. Naturally, it can still be used for a shield as originally intended."
630,,200,Cereal Mascot        ,South Park: The Fractured But Whole,Benevolence ,"You now have the ability to blast your enemies with breakfast cereal attacks. By default, this is mint and berry, but feel free to decide for yourself what breakfast cereal gives you power. Whatever the case, this allows you to both heal your allies of negative ailments and bring harm to your foes. Shablagoo!"
631,,200,Corporal Colorado,South Park: The Stick of Truth,Benevolence,"You can do this all day! You regenerate roughly 10% of your HP a turn, twice as much when you’re in critical condition. Post gauntlet this is a steady form of regeneration."
632,,200,Armored Up ,South Park: The Stick of Truth,Benevolence,"Armor is life, armor is love and brother do you have a lot of love. Armor is twice as effective on you. You can also share this ability with someone else, though it only works on one person at a time, and while your ally is strengthened, your armor is reduced to normal."
633,,200,Lay On Hands        ,South Park: The Stick of Truth,Benevolence,"Much like the stalwart Paladin Butters, you have the holy ability to heal mild to moderate wounds with just a touch and some kind words. You can only do this once per turn. Post Gauntlet this is every 10 seconds or so."
634,,200,Protect Your Balls,South Park: The Stick of Truth,Benevolence,"When the going gets tough, you just get tougher. When you are critically injured, your body becomes much harder to damage, reducing any incoming damage by half as long as you are under 25% health."
635,,200,Inherited Karma,Cultivation Chat Group,Benevolence ,"It’s important to pay back karma, and it can be worthwhile to look after those who owe you karma so that they might one day pay it back. While you aren’t necessarily any better at this than anyone else of your own generation in day-to-day life, it seems you benefit from this principle surprisingly often.

If you have a positive karmic connection to a distant or absent senior, that figure’s influences and legacies have a strong tendency to help you. Traps, dooms, and curses they left behind might fall upon your enemies, and you gain opportunities that you otherwise would not have.

You may not be judged as truly worthy of a senior’s full inheritance, but karma might judge you worthy-adjacent and give you something anyways."
636,,200,Tank,A Wild Last Boss Appeared!,Benevolence ,"A class for those who use their bodies to protect their comrades, and maybe the masochists. Your durability is out of the charts for what it should be, allowing you to take incredible amounts of punishment without giving any ground, even from enemies that should be in a league above your own. But in this world where the strongest magic users can fly or jump high enough while moving so fast that gravity isn’t able to get a hold on them, your chances of shining may be limited once you hit the highest levels, as you seem to exceed in the melee action.

This doesn’t mean you are a complete dead weight in a high-level combat, for not only are you the ideal shield with your increased defense, but you can also increase the damage of your own allies! However, this class only grants a single attack method, the skill [Acubens], a guaranteed counter attack that adds half of the damage that they have been dealt back into the attacker. While it’s a powerful skill since the damage returned is proportional to the one received, the user still needs to suffer said damage, turning their battle into one of pure endurance when fighting alone. But surely you are sturdy enough for that.

Lastly, your other main skill [Asellus Australis], also allows you to redirect any attack towards your direction. Sadly, it doesn’t guarantee that it will hit you, as anything that stands between you and the one who launched the attack will take the attack first if they aren’t careful."
637,,200,Status(Granting),A Wild Last Boss Appeared!,Benevolence ,"In the world of Midgard, everyone is subjected to the System created by the Goddess. Through it, anyone can benefit from the power of Goddess, also known as mana, and grow immensely on power through their own efforts.

The system also serves to measure everyone’s power through a detailed ‘status’ screen. Everyone has access to their own ‘status’, which details their level, the amount of levels in job classes that they have, which is always equivalent to their level, as well as their stats. The observation of the status of others requires the usage of a special skill, and usually only those subordinated to oneself can have their full status be observed.

The parts of your status that are usually visible without subordination are your Name, which displays only the name that the observer recognizes you with, your HP, which details how much damage you can take until you die, and your SP, which indicates your mana reserves and serves to activate both spells and many skills.

Your other stat values are usually hidden are the following: Strength/Attack Power, Dexterity, Vitality, Intelligence, Agility/Speed, Mindpower and Luck. These, as well as the previous two values, increase along with your level, but consumable items, skills, spells and equipment may also increase or decrease them either temporarily or permanently.

Your stats not only reflect what you can do, but also denote how much others can affect you, as those with greater stats are much harder to be affected by spells and skills, requiring way more power to notice the efforts of others. Those at the top of this world are incredibly hard to affect even with most magical abilities, and they will simply shrug off even the most extreme environmental effects of the planet.

On how leveling works, the simplest explanation is that it functions uniquely via killing. Each time you kill something, an amount of mana relative to the strength of the being killed will get released and absorbed by you. If multiple people work together to get a kill, only the one who gives the killing blow will receive the mana from the target. It should also be noted that usually the efficiency of the mana absorption via killing is not terribly great, as only around a ten percent of the mana that is freed from a kill gets absorbed by the killer. It wouldn’t do to get walking disasters just for slaying some goblins, would it?

Normally, if people were to use this method, they would require centuries to reach the highest level, even for the most talented of individuals. Up to the point that non-natural Level 1000s were extremely rare until the generation of the Seven Heroes and Ruphas.

Additionally, those under the System of the Goddess Alovenus can only deal a certain amount of damage per attack, regardless of their actual stats. That is, they cannot deal more than 99,999 HP per attack, which means that no Level 1000 should be able to destroy the world in a single attack. You will be subjected to this limitation during your time in Midgard unless you can somehow transcend the limits of the system and ascend to the realm that what lies beyond the Level 1000, but after this jump you are freed from this limitation.

You and every companion that you bring to Midgard with you gets this for free. If you decide to pay 200 CP, you may extend the potential of Midgard’s power system to anyone of your choosing in future universes. You may also decide whether or not they are affected by the damage limitation, but in that case they must either be weaker than output of damage or consent to limit themselves in such a way.

638,,200,Mental Fortitude,The Lord of the Rings,Benevolence ,"You have a hardy soul and a powerful will. Even the darkest of mind magics take far longer to take their grip on you, and you can often surprise people by your fierce heart, even if unaccustomed to battle."
639,,200,​​...So I’ll Max Out My Defense ,Bofuri,Benevolence ,"Do you know what’s good for you? Defense.

So why not train defense along with everything else?

Any improvement to your non-defensive capabilities comes with a similar increase to your defensive capabilities. Shields, armor, or just straight-up durability will all increase.

If you want, half the gains will go into a category related to whatever else you were training. Acrobatics or strength training will give you physical resistance. Practice fire magic and get fire resistance. Practice cooking and get poison immunity.

The other half goes into straight-up durability to soak any sort of attack, though I do recommend getting a broad set of resistances so it will last a while against more exotic types of damage."
640,,200,Passionate​,Demon:​ ​The​ ​Fallen,Benevolence ,"Emotions are at the core of what a Defiler is, perhaps you more so than others. Your emotional state has a direct effect on your physical form. Your physical body reacts to the strength of your emotion, making you significantly faster, stronger and tougher the deeper you let yourself fall into your passions."
641,,200,The Depths-Forged Iron Body ,Cradle V1,Benevolence ,"Sacred artists seeking to achieve this iron body must subject themselves to increasing amounts of pressure as they channel force madra to every inch of their body to counteract it. Alone this is typically achieved by diving into the depths of the ocean. It is otherwise difficult, but not impossible to replicate this with a well- coordinated team of force madra artists. The main benefits are that their body is incredibly resistant to physical attacks, and also acts to absorb / reflect force-based techniques."
642,,200,Blood-forged Iron,Cradle V1,Benevolence ,"This Iron body has had additional madra channels carved into the body with sandviper poison. This has caused your body’s natural regeneration to increase significantly. For another 100 CP, you can have a body just like Wei Shi Lindon. This will rocket your regeneration speed even further, putting you just below Wolverine or Deadpool provided you can provide enough madra to feed this ability."
643,,200,Life In The Afterlife,Egyptian Mythology,Benevolence ,"Life does not end with death. Once in any of your given lives, your physical body may by killed, but this only serves to release your ka and ba, allowing you to continue your existence - as long as they do not die along the way to the afterlife and there is a plane or afterlife to receive and reunite them into an akh, a spiritual body.

Your jump continues from that point as though you had simply ‘travelled’ to the realm of the afterlife instead of dying a mortal death to reach it. However, your akh is just as fragile as your mortal body; if you are then killed again in the same jump, or your ba, ka or akh are destroyed in the afterlife, this counts as a mortal death.

644,,200,Lunar,Marvel Zombies,Benevolence ,"Khonshu, Egyptian God of the Moon, has seen fit to choose another avatar. While he will not vest all his power in you, you will still receive a not-insubstantial amount. You have physical abilities well beyond the ken of normal people, though their potency is controlled by the phases of the moon - a new moon will see you lifting 1,000 pounds while you could quadruple that during a full moon. Your mind is extremely resistant to telepathic intrusion, and you seem to have occasional visions and prophetic dreams. Finally, if you die, your patron will resurrect you once per jump."
645,,200,Tireless,Irish Mythology,Benevolence ,"There is great strength in you, physical and mental, such that you can work or fight for seven years before taking a rest break. Then one day off and you’re good for another seven years."
646,,200,Blessing of Vesunna ,Irish Mythology,Benevolence ,"Good fortune, abundant fields and general prosperity will attend your lands and people, and any group you may lead."
647,,200,Iron Shirts,Irish Mythology,Benevolence ,"There is a certain progression among the tribes of men. The first to master Bronze have a commanding advantage, impenetrable armor and irresistible weapons. And the first men to master iron have the same advantage over them in turn, and again with steel. Your personal arms and armor always seem to be at least one “tier” above others in this fashion."
648,,200,Determination Of The Prisoner,Slay the Princess,Benevolence ,"Chains cut at your wrists and ankles, weights too strong even for you to break. Your body is heavy and sore with the weight of all the time spent longing for freedom from your bindings. And yet you refuse to yield. You move and press on with a focused precision, a desire to see a task through to its very definitive conclusion, so long as it leads to your liberation. Your flesh could be cut apart, broken and cleaved in twain, and yet your determination to persist would motivate you to keep living. You will not stop until you are free of your chains. Once and for all."
649,,200,Heart Lungs Liver Nerves,Slay the Princess,Benevolence ,"Heart. Lungs. Liver. Nerves. Heart. Lungs. Liver. Nerv-oh, uh. Sorry, got distracted there for a moment. Now, where were we? Ah, right - it seems that through channeling the right focus, you have managed to develop a means to force your body (or rather, your host's body) to keep functioning even when faced with something that would have otherwise killed you instantly. It's not a perfect lifesaver - you only remain ‘alive’ through manual recitation of the chant and only for as long as your concentration is maintained - the simplest distraction will break the spell and return you to the quiet nothingness of death. But, it can buy you valuable time to come up with a more lasting solution."
650,,200,Elemental Shield,Final Fantasy XI,Benevolence ,"By the power of runes the runefencer protects himself and others, by inscribing a rune in the air you can erect a shield blocking elemental magic. You can only hold up to three elemental shields at a time but each element can block its opposite, fire blocks ice, ice blocks wind, wind blocks earth, earth blocks water, water blocks fire. Light and darkness block one another. Shields can be overwhelmed with enough power.

Requires Runefencer or The first 8 to Purchase"
651,,200,Weight of Souls,Final Fantasy XI,Benevolence ,"A Dark Knights power comes from pain, loss, bloodlust, all the darker emotions channeled to achieve a greater goal. Taking the lives of others can deepen the darkness of the soul making the dark knight more powerful, walking the edge between madness and hell to come out the other side. You can channel the corruption of your soul and safely use it so that you are unaffected both mentally and physically so that although you may be darkened you shall never fall to the madness within. Basically this allows you to profit from the use of techniques which would normally corrupt you without the downsides normally caused by such a technique."
652,,200,Unnatural Durability,Final Fantasy XI,Benevolence ,"Monks are often known for having an abundance of life force, able to shrug off punches and cuts that would often fell another man. This is because of the way their bodies naturally strengthen themselves using the chakra or life energy within them. Thanks to this energy you find that your skin is unnaturally tough and resistant to strikes or cuts. Eaily equal to a good set of leather armor."
653,,200,Haven’t Aged A Day,Dies Irae,Benevolence ,"The family is always surprised to see you when you come back around to the homeland, especially after a few decades have past and you haven’t aged a day. In fact, you don’t seem to change much at all over time. Even if centuries pass, you won’t change in body, mind or spirit if you don’t want to. Your body does not age, your personality will not change over time and your spirit will not mature nor weaken. You are effectively able to lock yourself at a certain point in time. You can still be wounded or negatively affected by outsiders, though not by time-based effects that would forcibly age or de-age you."
654,,200,The New Life,Dies Irae,Benevolence ,"Back in the good old days, you did a few years working with the Lebensborn group, helping out with their attempts to create those with special abilities. While obviously nothing here would come close to what the magician Mercurius had created, you did find out some quite impressive things that could be done to the minds and bodies of humans to make them more special. You’re able to awaken psychic abilities or minor superhuman talents in people, more effective and likely to work the younger they are at the time, as well as being very well versed in the most effective and efficient eugenics methods. "
655,,200,Last Stop,Dies Irae,Benevolence ,"You’re well aware of the dangers of going out to fight beings that can live forever. Fail and they might seek to take out their grudges on those you left behind, through killing or worse fates. You can be assured and feel safe that that will no longer occur. The buck stops with you, as it were, as no problem that you have brought on yourself will pass on from you. Enemies you have made will not care for those you care about or who have descended from you, curses that target entire family lines will never pass on from you, diseases that might be inherited by children simply are not and so on. You are the last line of defence and you work without fail to protect those you care for. "
656,,200,Best Friends Forever,Dies Irae,Benevolence ,"Once you make a friend, you have them for life. So long as you retain the bonds between you and your friends or loved ones, you’ll always meet them again no matter what happens and no matter how far they go from you. Eventually, you’ll always be re-united with those you care for. Even if one is killed and eaten by a demon witch, you’ll just find that you get a chance to steal back their imprisoned soul later on. Your loved ones can still die but...well, death"
657,,200,Holy Cloak,The God of High School,Benevolence ,"An official Nox vestment. All Priests gain one upon obtaining their ranks and if you’re a part of Nox already, this’ll make you a Priest rank follower too. The Cloaks are quite powerful defensive garments and unless they’re bringing in the artillery or an actual fighter, nothing from the mortal is gonna be able to hurt you with one on."
658,,200,Holy Cloak(Bishop),The God of High School,Benevolence ,"If you spend 400CP instead, you can have a Bishop Class vestment instead. Not only will this make you the second highest rank in Nox, with the resulting influence and administrative power, it’s also an even stronger armour. Nothing short of a Priest class foe will even scratch you with this and the sort of mundane weaponry that can get through your holy protections are the bombs that would never be unleashed within a city.

Requires Holy Cloak to Purchase"
659,,200,Divine Form,The God of High School,Benevolence ,"A strange ability to possess as a Divine Power. Rather than a new supernatural ability, your Divine Power is simply the immense strength, speed and toughness that your form possesses. Where you might normally only be the equal of a common Angel in those aspects, at least at first, with this power you come closer to the level of a Nephilim, and the skyscraper sized divine warriors that make up most of Heaven’s army, even with your as yet young age. As your life energy increases, so too will your physical attributes, allowing you to train both at once."
660,,200,Not So Unlucky Life,The God of High School,Benevolence ,"Being a Judge does have its own salary but unless you’re careful, you’re liable to cause a more then small amount of property damage in the course of your work. And with colleagues as miserly as yours are, it’s not likely that you’d receive any help. Just as well you’ve got a whole lot of luck in financial matters like these eh? When it comes to debts of money, whether from gambling, promises, fines or just threats, you’ve got the uncanny ability to slip out of nearly anything. Blow up a building? Someone else will pay the fine and reconstruction fees. Lose a few hundred on the Horse Races? Glitch in the system gives you it back. Owe a bad man some cash? Always seems to be another guy who owes him more, so as long as you don’t meet him in person, he’ll let you go. Anything short of blowing up a whole city or personally stealing from a man as powerful as Kim Doo-Shik, one of The Six, will just cease to be much of a worry to you."
661,,200,God Point Granter,The God of High School,Benevolence ,"Whilst as a God, you possess the ability to form contracts, this would normally apply only to those abilities and energies that you have gained from this land, being otherwise incompatible for what powers may hail from other worlds. By taking this ability, you become able to form contracts that grant measures of your power that originates from other lands. You are able to imbue amounts of power or energy into those willing to take it in return for them giving you some of their energy or performing favours in exchange. However, by granting them this power, you will be unable to access whatever you chose to grant them whilst they make use of it. See notes for more details."
662,,200,Holy Lineage,The God of High School,Benevolence ,"Your bloodline, the children you have produced and their children’s children and so on, are very precious. The desire to protect one’s children is embedded into most life forms and you are no different. But you cannot protect them at all times...at least not without this. You are able to appear, in a weakened form, as a spiritual entity at the side of any of your descendants that are in danger. Whilst you do not have full access to your powers, you are able to fight to defend them or guide them to defend themselves as you please. As a result of this, you also count as being at the side of all of your descendants at all times, for whatever effects might care for such things."
663,,200,RIBBON,Final Fantasy X,Benevolence ,"A woman’s accessory, popularized by a very strange merchant who wandered all over Spira advertising his wares – if nothing, it’s a very pretty, very eye-catching ribbon. Beyond how pretty it is, it also happens to negate the effects of harmful conditions and nasty hexes that Spira’s fiends will try to inflict upon you, so a traveller might want to consider purchasing this. Just be forewarned – if you wear this where anyone can see it, don’t be offended if they mistake you for a woman."
664,,200,Iron Duke,Final Fantasy X,Benevolence ,"At the most desperate moments, humans always seem capable of bringing out the greatest strength – perhaps you could say that this strength is born from desperation. The time frame for this is limited to a span of seconds, but for this period of time, you’ll be invulnerable to whatever strikes you – so long as it would not have killed you outright.

Even if something should kill you outright, you’ll still defy the odds and cling to life with an inch to spare – but the effect of this desperate strength will pass. Be wary that your speed is cut dramatically during this period of invulnerability – great strength doesn’t come without a cost."
665,,200,A Legacy of Fear,Final Fantasy X,Benevolence ,"The denizens of Spira have maintained a long tradition of living in fear. From fear of war, to fear of Machina, to fear of Sin, to fear of the church – everything in Spira revolves around fear...the consequences of fear. Some people thrive in this environment; some people are controlled because of it, but you can recognize fear for what it is and fight against it. Whether it is overthrowing the control that others try to place on you with fear, or inspiring others to do the same – let it be known that you won’t tolerate the continuation of this cycle. Naturally, fear has no effect on you either. You may feel it, but it won’t weaken you or make you hesitate."
666,,200,Dragonman,Gods of Blood and Powder,Benevolence ,"While not sorcerers themselves the Dragonmen are a product of sorcery. They are a creation of the Dynize bone eyes and the elite fighters of the Dynize army and emperor. You’re now one of them. You have enhanced senses, are very fast, strong and most importantly though. You can take serious punishment and heal faster than a normal person. With medical attention you could survive three crossbow bolts to the torso and be up and running in a month. You can still be brought down with much force, but you can expect to take a squad of 40 well trained soldiers before going down."
667,,200,Holy Vestments,Fate/Stay Night,Benevolence ,"A notably powerful holy artefact, this enchanted priest's cassock is one of the better protections the modern magical world has to offer. Covering everything from the neck down, its holy protections are enough to fend off anything short of a high powered sniper rifle in terms of mundane weapons, with anything lesser being lucky to deal bruises. It also has strong protections against unholy weapons, significantly reducing the power of any evil or unholy attack or spell used on you whilst wearing this. If you have a particular outfit of clothing in mind already, you can instead transfer these magical protections to it. "
668,,200,Big Damn Lolis,Fate/Stay Night,Benevolence ,"The way you just happen to always arrive right on time to stop the villain getting away or foil the hero's dastardly plot to ruin your evil plans, some people think you're really just waiting in the wings for something to happen. You're not quite that good of a planner though. Really, you're just lucky beyond belief when it comes to arriving at the most dramatic time. As long as it's not straining belief more than a little for you have gotten to some place quick enough, you'll always arrive to any heroically or villainously appropriate situation at the most dramatic time possible. You'll get to your captured friends just in time to block the executioner's blade or arrive just as the hero thinks they've finished one foe off for good and has let his guard down. Just remember, stretch reasonable timeframes too far and you'll just get there late. "
669,,200,Madain’s Ring,Final Fantasy IX,Benevolence ,"This ring doesn’t seem to be anything special, but it’s existed for so long that it has collected magic residually. The ring makes healing items and effects have much greater effect when used on anyone."
670,,200,White Mage,Final Fantasy IX,Benevolence ,"A must have for those looking to fill the role of support! Our instructors will teach you everything to do with being a White Mage, enough so that you’ll make your grand entrance knowing the skills one would expect of an intermediate White Mage, healing others, curing abnormalities, cheering folk on and so forth.

And if you go around wearing distinctive white robes you can expect people to flock to you asking for help and boons I’m sure."
671,,200,Memory Retainer,Inscryption,Benevolence ,"Some challengers can get indecisive. Halfway through their bid to become a Scrybe, they start to wonder if they should have picked a different deck to mark their ambitions. And then it’s all back at the beginning, like nothing ever happened. But you remember. Whether the new game button or another trick is used to turn back the clock, your memories will always persist."
672,,200,Elixir,Solo Leveling,Benevolence ,"You gain a box that contains four bottles worth of the substance known as the Holy Water of Life. This miraculous liquid can be crafted by using several items dropped by killing the Demon Monarch and two of his trusted lieutenants. It’s ability resides in curing any illness, no matter the origin, of those who drink a full bottle worth of the substance, as well as restoring the vitality of the person who drinks it to their prime. Currently, it is the only substance that is capable of curing the Eternal Sleep illness. The only downside is that it cannot cure any wounds, only things that can be defined as an ‘illnesses. You will get a new bottle for each one that you spent after a month of their usage."
673,,200,Against Time: Ageless,Avesta of Black and White,Benevolence ,"Another trait commonly found in the stronger Dagravant. While the Ashavan bow before the natural order of things and see old age and natural death as something that should be respected, the more powerful Daeva instead trend to use their own powers to keep their life going forever. However, only the mightiest of them can keep going for centuries or more. Whatever methods you have used, your lifespan is now basically endless, unless violence ends your life. Not only that, but you are also especially suited for the trials of immortality, as your mind and ego are well suited to your long existence, maintaining themselves fresh regardless of how much time passes, instead of degrading before the ravages of time."
674,,200,Seethe of a Warrior,Fate/Grand Order,Benevolence ,"A goblet containing a brilliant red drink, almost like liquid fire. It’s a magical drink originating from the Knights of the Red Branch, one that can grant a full restore to any who have even a sip of it. Just one gulp will restore the drinker to full health, curing all their ills and allowing them to be as if they were fully, completely rested. Drinking more may even boost the user’s vitality beyond its normal limit but this is dangerous and may result in harm for those not lucky enough to avoid the chance at receiving damage this way. Your drink will not harm you or any others so long as you take no more than a sip a day. Once the goblet is empty, it will refill a day later."
675,,200,Musashi Malfunctions        ,Fate/Grand Order,Benevolence ,"It’d be awfully anti-climactic if a hero in the making like yourself just got winked out of existence with no chance to defend yourself. Wouldn’t it be better to live to fight another day, even if that day was taking place in a different world? Attempts to kill you by erasing the world or time that you are in fail to work. If the universe is destroyed with you in it, you’ll find yourself rather roughly flung into a new universe or timeline that is similar but different from the first. People can still blow you up, they just can’t erase you by destroying the space-time construct that you exist in. If they want you dead, they’ll need to do it directly. Or just blow you up from afar even still. Maybe invest in some good shields?"
676,,200,Beyond Faker,Fate/Grand Order,Benevolence ,"You’re a legend among legends, everyone knows that. You’re undeniably you in your very own place. That’s why it’s so very easy to tell when you aren’t you. People who try to copy you, no matter their normal level of proficiency with that art, just fall flat. Disguises are shoddily made, voices are horribly off, attempts to pretend to be you see the imitator forget vital information you should know. Even trying to copy your techniques or abilities will at best result in these same pale imitations they get elsewhere, with weakened abilities or entirely missing ones. Anyone who had actually met you could spot these fakes in a moment and even those who have never met you can tell that something’s up. "
677,,200,Stand Behind Me,Fate/Grand Order,Benevolence ,"Friends are a rare luxury for an anti-hero like yourself, one you really ought to treasure for how particularly vital they are to you. When you’re delving into the darkest depths and fighting the worst evils of mankind, just having a friend in your life will make it all that much easier to deal with. Having bonds to friends and loved ones, bonds that are actively maintained by you or them, will allow you to become more and more resistant to any sort of corruption, fear or influence that might negatively affect you. With people to fight for, you’ll be able to ignore the terror of the greatest monsters, maintain your sanity even in the depths of hell and tell the most insidious of mind mages to fuck right off. The more people you have like this that you care for and actively maintain relationships with, the stronger your defences against influence will be. "
678,,200,Patents Never Pending,Library of Ruina: HamHamPangPang,Benevolence ,"Patents are extremely important in the City, A Corp is in charge of them and they are what can make or break Wings due to the patent wars that break out whenever a Wing falls, and new Wings need to patent their Singularity to be considered one in the first place. Smaller businesses like workshops also need to constantly keep an eye on their patents else they get taken and outcompeted by a larger company. Thankfully due to dealing with the regular corporate skullduggery on a daily basis or perhaps having aspirations of Nest life you’ve managed to find a legal loophole that patents anything you create, not just according to the City’s laws but a conceptual level as well. So any attempt to reverse engineer or copy your creations will either fail and destroy whatever it is, or end with the item being lost to whoever is trying to steal your intellectual property. You can freely disable patent protection on anything that has it or transfer the patent to someone else via a notarized contract."
679,,200,Persistence,Library of Ruina: HamHamPangPang,Benevolence ,"Sweepers aren’t very powerful, though they practically have free reign over the Backstreets at night and any normal person who they find is pretty much guaranteed to die, Fixers can fight them off easily and any rats or weak syndicate members know where to hide. What makes the Sweepers omnipresent in the minds of Backstreet residents is how hard they are to fully kill with their extremely durable suits which repair easily and lose fuel much slower than they can get from even one person. You might or might not be a Sweeper yourself but your enemies would definitely find you as hard to kill as one thanks to blood loss happening much slower than normal, natural healing processes being accelerated, and your skin or whatever armor you are wearing being much more durable."
680,,200,Rot Adaption,Bibliomania,Benevolence ,Rot is the condition in this world where your body and soul starts to mutate and unravel the closer you get to the exit from your room and simply going from 100 to 099 will be enough to instantly kill a normal human. You on the other hand are now shockingly able to adapt to such conditions now allowing you to revert any changes and survive that which would kill you normally. Effectively you are 2 times more resistant to the Rot and other supernatural maladies and conditions but that's not all. You adapt to any exposure to anything and while this won’t make you stronger it will steadily cure you while making your resistance to whatever affected you stronger. Once exposed to something like the Rot you’d only have to wait an hour for a mutated limb to fully return to normal as long as you're not further exposed to the same level of affect. Once treated you will be resistant to what affected you enough that a level of Rot that would mutate your full arm would instead only be enough to mutate your hand. You can eventually become fully immune but it would take 666 times the lethal dose for a normal member of your species.
681,,200,Emotion Control,Bibliomania,Benevolence ,"You are now an emotional master, having full conscious control over your own emotional state and a well of emotions you can switch between at will. You never lose control even if you're experiencing so much anger that Asura from Asura’s Wrath would enter his berserker form, you’d still be able to sit calmly with a smile and drink tea with the source of your anger. Your control of your emotions is so powerful that you could quite literally be both perfectly calm and experience any emotion. Hell your emotion control is so powerful you could cause actual physical effect on yourself relevant to the emotion. If you somehow got your hands on an emotion ring From DC you wouldn’t need a lantern since you could flood yourself with an absurd amount of the needed emotion at will. Emotion based power obviously becomes very powerful with this but without them you're just a perfectly rational person that's the worst nightmare for empaths."
682,,200,Protective,Miraculous Ladybug,Benevolence ,"There’s a reason they were called the Order of the Guardians. You are now an expert in hiding and protecting important objects or people. You even get a small power boost when acting to protect them, such that a normal human could fend off a Miraculous user for a little while. You also have a number of more modern practical skills, such as creating new identities for yourself and staying under the radar."
683,,200,Spin to Win ,Miraculous Ladybug,Benevolence ,"Everyone here seems to be able to spin their weapons really quickly. As in, fast enough to act as a barrier against energy beams or a bootleg helicopter turbine to lift yourself into the air. Now, you too have mastered the art of spinning things really fast to cartoonish ends. Your maximum spinning speed depends on how strong you are at the time."
684,,200,Mirror Alice,High School DxD,Benevolence ,"Right back at ya! When activated, this Gear takes the form of a glowing, transparent mirror in front of the user or an ally. An attack that strikes this mirror is immediately reflected back onto the attacker, with twice the destructive power. Why is this being offered so cheaply? Well, it has a cool-down period that prevents it from being summoned twice in a row, which means it is best reserved for baiting a finishing move or protecting a weaker ally. Eventually, the user can learn to summon multiple mirrors, lessening this weakness slightly."
685,,200,Technically True ,High School DxD,Benevolence ,"Angels and those who follow God’s teachings tend to have to follow strict rules, especially things regarding purity and not consorting with devils. Thing is, this is incredibly impractical in this day and age, and nobody REALLY wants a second Great War for no good reason. And some Devils can be really nice, it turns out. You will find that strict moral requirements, metaphysical or social, are much less punishing towards you than it would be towards others. A holy knight who has to strike down an Angel for the greater good, or someone in a star-crossed relationship with a Devil would face a slap on the wrist as opposed to retribution, and a trivial scolding as opposed to losing any granted powers. You can still ‘fall’ as an Angel or receive great punishment from doing something truly unforgivable, but if your act was ultimately harmless or for the good of your Faction (or even the world), your actions are tolerated. It might not make you too popular, though."
686,,200,Inverse,Jujutsu Kaisen,Benevolence ,"By activating this cursed technique, attacks that hit you have their damage inverted: strong blows become weak enough that they won’t even harm you, and while weak ones become powerful enough to cause severe injuries. It’s worth noting, however, that there is a minimum amount of power behind an attack required for this technique to invert it – otherwise, you’d likely die from something like air resistance or stubbing your toe. Similarly there’s also a maximum amount of damage it can invert, above which any attack will affect you as normal. You’re more than capable of activating and deactivating at a moment’s notice, keeping it active to protect yourself against a powerful attack and deactivating it to prevent weaker ones from harming you."
687,,200,New Shadow Style,Jujutsu Kaisen,Benevolence ,"There’s a reason Domain Expansion is considered the crown jewel of any sorcerer’s jujutsu arsenal. Its guaranteed hit effects can bypass the defences of even those considered the strongest, and can have effects ranging from temporarily sealing a target’s cursed technique to simultaneously attacking every cell of an opponent’s body. As such, it is no surprise that a number of specialised techniques have been created to counter the power of domains, especially their “can’t miss” effects, though these are often only taught within closed circles.

Now, you have mastered one of these two techniques. The first technique on offer is New Shadow Style: Simple Domain, in which the user creates a small, circular barrier around themselves. This not only prevents the user from being targeted by the guaranteed hit effect of a domain and protects from soul-affecting techniques, but also has offensive benefits, too – specifically, Simple Domain pairs incredibly well with iaijutsu swordsmanship techniques, allowing for instantaneous reactions to anyone crossing its border and vastly increasing the speed of the blade as it leaves its sheath. A master of Simple Domain could become a grade 1 sorcerer even without possessing a cursed technique. Unfortunately, however, Simple Domain can be destroyed by sufficiently powerful Domains, often within a matter of seconds , though this is better than nothing.

Alternatively, you may instead choose to master Falling Blossom Emotion, a far more obscure technique known only by the Big Three sorcerer families. Instead of the user erecting their own domain, it instead coats them in a shroud of cursed energy that automatically counterattacks any guaranteed hit attack that comes into contact, nullifying them. Given that it only responds to incoming attacks, it’s a lot more cost efficient than Simple Domain, as well as being far more difficult for a Domain to simply destroy, at the expense of having fewer associated offensive options.

If you wish, you may purchase whichever option you did not choose for an extra 200 CP. In other settings, both of these techniques will continue functioning against other, similar effects, and may be able to be expanded to have broader functions, too.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
688,,200,Potions Bundle,Final Fantasy VII,Benevolence ,"When traveling on the open road or even trying to survive in the shadier parts of Midgar, someone is eventually going to get hurt. In that case, these make a good substitute for bandages. You have seven bottles of Potions, all of which heal injuries and restore some measure of health upon being consumed. Actually, just pouring the contents on someone or smashing the bottle over them works just as well too. Any used Potions restock at a rate of one bottle per day until you're back up to seven. For 100 more undiscounted points, you may upgrade these to Hi-Potions, which heal a greater amount of injuries."
689,,200,Strong Souls,Legends of Runeterra,Benevolence ,"For a lot of undead, death is not something permanent but just a long wait until your spectral body is reformed and you can move again. This Perk will not help you with that, but it will guarantee that, until your soul still linger in the living world, you don’t count as ‘dead’ for the purpose of chain-failing. How you manage to make your soul linger depends on you. Maybe you just have it stored in another place, or maybe you are one of the Isles restless dead and you simply cannot die while the Black Mist still exists."
690,,200,Chemical Tolerance,Legends of Runeterra,Benevolence ,"While Piltover is the shiny city of progress, Zaun is the underground born from those above discarded. The situation has gotten better with the years, but some places are still quite toxic to those not accustomed with the various polluting agents. So, you’ve built an extreme tolerance for toxins and poisons of all type, to the point to be immune to all but the most powerful (or mystical) of them."
691,,200,Tough,Legends of Runeterra,Benevolence ,"There is not much to say. You have a particularly sturdy body or magical defense, able to absorb a lot of damage, making it especially useful against multiple weak attacks. Death from a thousand cuts is not something you have to worry about anymore."
692,,200,Spell Shield,Legends of Runeterra,Benevolence ,You have innate resistance to magic… once per fight. The first spell or supernatural power that would hit you is immediately neutralized. Be careful against several magic users.
693,,200,Regeneration,Legends of Runeterra,Benevolence ,"Either by natural or magical ability, your body just fixes itself at speeds that beggar belief. This makes you very, very hard to kill. Basically, given enough time (depending on the severity of the wound, but usually a few seconds) you’re able to heal any kind of damage. There is a little delay between the time you’re wounded and the regeneration kicking in, so be careful to not get double tapped or take a hit that would instantaneously kill you."
694,,200,Fated ,Legends of Runeterra,Benevolence ,"This is a rare one. Every time magic is woven into your body to heal or help you in any way, a part of that power is infused into your flesh and makes you just a little more powerful. The amount is a tiny percentage of the overall power of the spell, but assuming you have a semi-stable source of magic, you can continually improve yourself."
695,,200,Barrier,Legends of Runeterra,Benevolence ,You’re protected by a magical barrier that can block any form of damage... once. The barrier recharges in a minute assuming you’re not in combat.
696,,200,Status Recovery Kit ,Fairy Fencer F,Benevolence ,A full kit capable of treating a whole host of different maladies. There is enough recovery medicine for 8 people. Fully restocks daily. Merges with the Healing Kit if the prior item was purchased.
697,,200,Toughness,Fairy Fencer F,Benevolence ,"It’s a known fact that Fencers are generally tougher than normal people. They tend to find themselves in some hair raising situations far from medical treatment. With this Perk you gain a general 50% boost to all Stats. This doesn’t exactly let you take a bullet point blank, but it would certainly let you survive long enough to get treatment. All injuries heal at a fraction of the time. Most requiring a night’s rest unless the injury is especially traumatic."
698,,200,A Set of Armor,Inheritance Cycle,Benevolence ,"This set of armor (your choice of what kind) is said to have been worn by the old dragon riders of Alagaësia. It has been mystically enchanted to withstand force beyond what mere steel could bare and allows the user to move freely as if unencumbered by the weight without decreasing it. It grants several other minor benefits such as never chaffing or rusting, and never being a burden on any beast the wearer rides."
699,,200,Protected Name​ ,Inheritance Cycle,Benevolence ,"The magic of this world is powerful and can be used to do many things, many terrible things in the case of someone knowing your ‘True Name’. You are, however, somehow immune to this fate. Your True Name cannot be used by others, either positively or negatively, nor can you be bound by it. This extends similar such protections in future worlds against any similar techniques, abilities, or magics that would seek to use your name(s) against you."
700,,200,Fortunate Saber,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Benevolence ,"Those who rely on tricks and little cheats to win against their betters will quail away at your approach. The luck of a Saber protects you against the dirty tricks of Irishmen and those like them, allowing you to avert or dodge things that shouldn’t be. Your luck provides you a decent chance of negating ‘certain’ dangers, such as dodging a spear that cannot be dodged or not dying to a weapon fated to kill you. This can be seen as a propensity to change your fate, letting you rewrite small things that should have happened, if you can keep up with the dangers involved. You also tend to be quite lucky in general, having little moments of good fortune throughout your day. Though both of these work on the small scale, they apply constantly enough to ensure a steady advantage against most foes. 

Sabers with this trait can be a little more reckless than others. They’ve gotten used to taking risks and betting on themselves against the odds. It’s a charming sort of confidence but quite dangerous for any allies that come to believe they’re the same way."
701,,200,Heroine’s Will,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Benevolence ,"Unrelenting, some say. Stubborn or even foolish, to others. But though your will can make it hard to avert your course, you’ll never back down from a fight again. Determination that even the King would be proud of, you’ll never waver against fear, despair or worry again. Even the dark magics that might manipulate the mind couldn’t force these feelings on you and while control is not impossible, you can slowly tear free of even such magical chains on your will. Such a force of will also aids in fighting on despite horrendous wounds, to some extent allowing your will to support your body beyond where it should have failed already. 

A Saber with this can be difficult to convince of being mistaken or change their decided on path. But as an ally, they’d never abandon you no matter how tough things got. You just have to live with the stubbornness."
702,,200,Magic Resistance,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Benevolence ,"It’s so common that you could hardly even imagine a Saber without it. Even the ones that aren’t actually Sabers get it. What is it? The ability to ignore all the spells and tricks of the Magi, making it easy to ram a sword down their mocking throats. As Sabers almost always do, you inherit powerful Magic Resistance that renders you almost completely immune to magic. Only the most powerful and complex spells will affect you, even when cast by ancient magicians or mighty gods. Any effect on you is simply negated. It doesn’t protect those around you, unfortunately, and it doesn’t really help dispel magic offensively. But some Sabers have found ways around those problems."
703,,200,Employee of the Month,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Benevolence ,"You embody the company virtues to the greatest extent as a delivery worker, able to deliver anything to anywhere and anywhen. As long as you’re making a delivery that someone else has asked of you or your company, nothing can hold you back for long. From one side of the galaxy to the other? You’ll crash through a wormhole soon after starting that cuts that journey to mere days of progress. A customer wants a new Nentendos Switch from inside a Singularity? You’ll crash through time-space to deliver it. Nothing can keep you from the client for more than a few days, as long as they directly hire you or your group for a delivery. Spreading your company name so broadly is a nice little side benefit. Somehow, people from across the galaxy and even other timelines will get the contact information necessary to hire you for deliveries, resulting in a steady stream of offers from all sorts of strange places. "
704,,200,Ribbon,Final Fantasy VI,Benevolence ,"The best gamblers know how to stack the deck in their favor. This small pin made of a twist of red ribbon is blessed with a powerful enchantment that makes one immune to a wide range of debilitating effects. Specifically Blind, Zombie, Poison, Imp, Petrify, Silence, Berserk, Confuse, Sap, and Sleep."
705,,200,The Guardian Shield,God Of War (2018),Benevolence ,"A shield that is compacted within a gauntlet, this shield could take blows even from greater Aesir and not break, though whether or not the force of the blow sends you flying is up to your own ability to withstand."
706,,200,A Strong Heart,God Of War (2018),Benevolence ,"The realms are filled with fools who glorify in hollow victories, never learning what it means to stomach true hardship. You are not so weak, you can endure. 

You may not be physically tougher than you were before, but your entire being rejects any outside attempt to forcibly change or break you; toxins, diseases, and corruptions that would be devastating to the hardiest creatures can be suffered through and eventually fought back by your constitution. Grievous injuries that would normally place you on the verge of death can be endured far longer than what should normally be possible. You can endure suffering and horrors that would shatter the resolve of so-called gods without so much as a twitch and even in the face of pleasure, comfort, or compulsion your autonomy will not be diminished so easily. Even with your sanity and soul frayed to pieces and your body tattered and threadbare you may still function, perhaps not enough to fight, but you will cling to life with a tenacity bordering on insanity so long as the effect is not immediately fatal.

This resilience is not immunity, nor does this lessen your suffering; you will feel every pain, violation, or temptation without filter and with sufficient time and effort you can still be broken. However, no matter how ‘irreversible’ the perversions or changes to your mind and soul or how crippling the injuries or deformities to your body, should you survive your struggles, you will recover. This does not hasten your recovery, and the further a change is from your accepted state, the longer it will take, but you will never remain broken."
707,,200,Phra Physique,Thailand Mythology and Folklore,Benevolence ,"Trying to bed spirits is all well and good, a time honored tradition and all, but some Phi can be quite a lot stronger than humans. You won’t need to worry about this anymore. To begin with, you’re really tough, able to endure things that would turn normal humans into paste with little more than some bruising. It won’t help you fight back against, say, an ogress who is a little too passionate, but you’ll definitely survive such a scenario. On top of this, when it comes to matters of romance, particularly in the bedroom, you somehow seem even tougher, and you’d survive unharmed from even the most violent lovers. The only question is of how much use this will be for you."
708,,200,Red-Ringed ,Fate/Apocrypha V1.4,Benevolence ,"It would be unfortunate if you ended up drugged or poisoned after getting mixed up in someone else’s schemes. Might be even worse if they realise you aren’t drugged or poisoned like you’re supposed to be. Now, that isn’t a problem for you. You’re immune to basically all drugs and poisons as long as you want to be, you can identify them and their properties on site, and can exhibit any effects of them at will so convincingly a master poisoner would think you’re in a harmless stupor or even a cold corpse while you’re still conscious and alive. Of course, this won’t help if they slit your throat to make sure, but now you’ll be able to see that coming when they don’t think you can."
709,,200,Disregarded ,Fate/Apocrypha V1.4,Benevolence ,"For some reason, getting around in a country where a war between 14 different Servants is going on is surprisingly safe for you. Even if you happen to end up in the same battlefield, as long as you aren’t part of the fight you won’t get hurt by collateral damage and you’ll be disregarded as a target. Maybe they think you’re a civilian, maybe they just don’t think you could be a threat. Of course, if you do decide to get involved, or you’ve already significantly interacted with one or more of the combatants, this direct protection fades. If you stab someone in the back, you better have someone to bail you out if you can’t handle an angry Servant."
710,,200,-White Mage-,Final Fantasy V,Benevolence ,"As casters who focus on healing allies, a white mage is necessary on the field. Purchasing the job will allow you to learn White Magic, while Mastery will allow you to use your healing magic on mental damage as well.

Note: Can be Shared with Others at Normal or Mastery Level"
711,,200,-Monk-        ,Final Fantasy V,Benevolence ,"Skilled in hand-to-hand combat, the monk needs no weapon or armor. Purchasing the job will give you the Monk abilities, while Mastery grants incredible resilience, able to take punishment far beyond your current limit.

Note: Can be Shared with Others at Normal or Mastery Level"
712,,200,-Knight-,Final Fantasy V,Benevolence ,"Masters of Arms and Armor, Knights are frontline fighters. Purchasing the job will give you access to the Knight abilities, while Mastery will vastly increase your Strength and allow you to treat armor as if it were weightless.

Note: Can be Shared with Others at Normal or Mastery Level"
713,,200,A healing herb ,The Song of the Nibelungs,Benevolence ,"The herb that Sigmund used to heal his wounded son Sinfjotli. Press it on any wound no matter how severe and as long as the person isn’t dead yet, they will be healed in an instant. You get a new herb each month."
714,,200,Might of the valkyrie,The Song of the Nibelungs,Benevolence ,"You’ve been blessed by Wotan/Odin to be strong enough to toss stones,which 12 strong warriors could barely lift, twelfe fathoms far and jump even farther in full valkyrie armor. You can throw a heavy spear, three men can scarcely carry, so hard that even the mighty invulnerable Siegfried under his magic cap could barely stop it with his heavy shield and cough up blood as a result of the terrifying impact. This power has a price however, which is your virginity. Should you lose your virginity, whether out of free will or by force, you will lose your power. Every new jump or every 10 years your virginity will “reset” giving you another chance at purity and purities might."
715,,200,Moonstone,Library of Ruina,Benevolence ,"All of the panic and trauma of City life can wear on the psyche, so it’s important to take solace in the little things, like this box of moonlight stones! They’re pretty aren’t they? That’s not all though, as the moonlight stone is a product of M Corp’s singularity, emitting a golden glint that can be used as ornamentation or to gild one’s clothes. Anyone with the moonstone on their person is incredibly resistant or sometimes fully immune to mental damage through amplifying a single thought or purpose, thus fortifying the mind. You have a I Baker’s dozen here, allowing both you and those who choose to follow in your footsteps to be truly implacable in the face of everything from psychic assaults, to the feeling of an abomination bearing down on you from above. They can also be used for encryption."
716,,200,The Rationality to Maintain Discretion,Library of Ruina,Benevolence ,"Having been a member of Lobotomy Corporation back in the day, you’re somewhat used to assaults on your mind, managing to get through them with minimal long term damage. What’s more, should you completely and utterly lose it, get controlled, or otherwise take leave of your senses, any who consider you their ally can assault you, forcing you back to your senses with brute force which miraculously doesn’t actually harm you physically. This generally takes enough force to send you reeling or otherwise briefly knock you out of the fight."
717,,200,Paladin (Dark Knight+White Mage) ,Final Fantasy IV,Benevolence ,"The stark opposite of the Dark Knight is the Paladin. You stand for the power of the light, as well as the defense of the weak, no matter the odds against you. As a Paladin, your defense and vitality increase roughly twice as fast as they would otherwise, and you gain the ability of Cover. If an ally would be killed by an attack, no matter how impossible it is for you to be there, you are able to interpose yourself between, taking the blow yourself."
718,,200,Vitality and Vigor,Final Fantasy IV,Benevolence ,"You’re built tough, and tougher than most. Brimming with natural physical fitness, you’re able to move about in that heavy armor with no problem, wield oversized swords and shields nearly as big as yourself, and take a direct hit from a dragon with little more than a bruise. World-ending magics and behemoth-like entities will still rattle your brain in your skull, but you’ll likely still survive."
719,,200,Mirror Alice,HighSchool DxD,Benevolence ,"Right back at ya! When activated, this Gear takes the form of a glowing, transparent mirror in front of the user or an ally. An attack that strikes this mirror is immediately reflected back onto the attacker, with twice the destructive power. Why is this being offered so cheaply? Well, it has a cool-down period that prevents it from being summoned twice in a row, which means it is best reserved for baiting a finishing move or protecting a weaker ally. Eventually, the user can learn to summon multiple mirrors, lessening this weakness slightly."
720,,200,Childhood Friends Betray,HighSchool DxD,Benevolence ,"Alongside Sacred Gears, Holy Swords are the strongest weapons humanity received from God to shield themselves from Devils and other supernatural creatures that would prey on them. However, to find a suitable user of a Holy Sword is like finding a needle in a haystack, to the point that many projects lacking on moral fiber started to make one. You’re a rare find, an individual naturally attuned to Holy Swords and capable to use any without drawback. Furthermore, it seems that the rules of the divine are a bit more lenient with you, something that you seem able to share with others at will. This is a great advantage to have as a human, but perhaps even more as an Angel."
721,,200,Lizard King,HighSchool DxD,Benevolence ,"A reptile determined to survive, that’s what you are at your core. An escape artist, a warrior that lives to fight another day. Deadly situations where one is between the sword and the wall just don’t seem to exist for you. Lethal attacks fail to strike your vitals, huge explosions only knock you back, large battles always have a way out for you, and a gigantic clash between supernatural forces just hurts instead of evaporating you whole. You’re incredibly difficult to kill, as contrivances, fate, and luck are on your side, always giving you a way out of the fight – even if at the cost of some limb in the process. Just have in mind that against an enemy hellbent on killing you the power to have a way out will only buy you time."
722,,200,Legend Of The Crimson Heroine EX,Fate/Csjete Halloween Trilogy,Benevolence ,"1/Year Deus Ex Machina type effect ranges from short term Invincibility, massive power boost, and raising the recently dead (yourself included if necessary) and other similarly bullshit abilities. Recharges every year on Halloween."
723,,200,Cloak of Orkos,God of War,Benevolence ,"A beautifully crafted cloak that was worn by Orkos while he was tortured and imprisoned for going against his mother with the Oracle Aletheia. Those who wear it will find their wounds healing and stamina replenishing much faster than before. Even a mortal wearing this would be able to have deadly wounds close before their very eyes, to say nothing of what happens if a god were to wear it."
724,,200,Cyclops Tears,Adventure Time,Benevolence ,A small bottle of Cyclops tears. When applied to the body it heals all wounds and illnesses.
725,,200,Gil-Man,Final Fantasy III,Benevolence ,"Beyond the bottomless bog lies a manor, in which everything is made of gold. Much like the warrior Goldor you have great luck in acquiring money, especially gold. Jobs pay more and found treasures contain as much as double. For some reason any equipment or objects made from gold work exactly like a normal version in your possession."
726,,200,In the blood,Xena - Hercules,Benevolence ,"Your divine blood is strong, freeing you from mortal frailties. You could run for days without sleep, or endure privation and injuries that would kill a mortal many times over. Age will not weaken you until you are in sight of your deathbed, and your life-force resists attempts to assault the core of your being. This durability extends to your mind as well, giving you a reserve of courage and willpower to see you through times of trouble."
727,,200,Divine Trickster,Hades,Benevolence ,"While the duties Hermes undertakes are quite varied and numerous,few of the stories attribute him to anything beyond his absolute speed.Not that this troubles the God. After all, if people only expect one thing from you, it makes it all the easier to catch them off guard with a little mischief. Taking a little of this mischievous nature for yourself and applying it to battle, it is easy enough to subtly add some unpredictability to your movements. You will find yourself sometimes dodging blows automatically, even those you might not have seen coming."
728,,200,Shieldbearer,Hades,Benevolence ,"Any warrior can drive their sword into another. Only the truly clever ones can cause their foe’s blade to end another’s life. You are granted not greater strength, but a subtle form of magic that allows you to deflect the attacks of your enemies. Timing is critical, growing more so as the strength of the incoming blow increases.

Defense can also be an offensive tactic if used properly. Striking the moment after deflecting an attack will cause your weapon to bite more deeply."
729,,200,Bargain with the Ferryman ,Hades,Benevolence ,"While you’re here, death won’t have a permanent hold on you. Through a unique deal with Charon you will be returned to life should you meet any kind of unfortunate end during your time in this world. For an additional fee, Charon can be bribed a little further. Once every ten years he will be able to save you from a similar fate in other worlds. When you are killed, you will instead wake up in Greece (or the nearest equivalent for your world) on the side of a river near a mountain."
730,,200,Self-Domination ,Fate/Strange Fake,Benevolence ,"For magi, hypnosis is one of the most common techniques that they learn. Not only to use against non-magic users to conceal their mysteries, but also in order to reign over themselves in the painful practices of magecraft. Yet while this is common, your technique is anything but ordinary. Much like the Cordelion’s family magecraft, you are a master of the Domination magecraft. This technique is not meant to control others, but instead gives the user a perfect control over oneself. First, your physical needs become almost non-existent, allowing you to survive for months without any ingest of food, and your daily sleep needs are reduced to a few seconds of closing your eyes. Both any of your emotions, as well as any other receptions of pain or discomfort, can be completely muted at will, also allowing you to increase your willpower off the charts. And not only that, but your grasp over yourself is so powerful, that almost no other external influence is able to control or corrupt you, regardless of their potency. From mind control, to curses at the level of the Age of the Gods, taking over your mind or body is almost impossible as long as you don’t let it."
731,,200,Safety Net,Records of Ragnarok Gauntlet (Humans),Benevolence ,"Usually a Volund will die with their partner. However when did you ever need to abide by usual rules? If your partner dies or any other being you are ‘bonded’ to suffers you need not feel any repercussions on yourself. Their death doesn’t affect you in any way. In fact even the pain you feel from your partners injuries will be as if it wasn’t present. There are no downsides to you bonding with someone anymore.

Requires Common Destiny to Purchase"
732,,200,Combat Acumen,Katana Zero,Benevolence ,"Not many can go charging with a sword in the age of the gun; you’re one of those rare few, and certainly not in a ‘conventional’ way. You can just...evade. Bullets, melee swings, fucking lasers.

There’s not a whole lot you can’t dodge with the right timing, the few outliers being things you...simply can’t avoid; no matter how hard you roll you aren’t escaping a nuke if you’re in range, and if someone simply disintegrates you without even touching you that’s just gonna leave your ashes spinning in the air."
733,,200,Strong Soul(Defence),20 Minutes Till Dawn,Benevolence ,"While it is the most essential part of you, making it a weakpoint should it be targeted, your soul seems to be uniquely strong. In fact it is strong enough that it confers a protective aura that can absorb physical blows. With each blow this aura takes, it weakens until it is completely broken. Over time this aura does regenerate, but there is a limit to how often this aura regenerates before one's soul becomes exhausted and must rest and recover."
734,,200,Staying Power ,Final Fantasy I,Benevolence ,"You’re the muscle of this party, and that means you need to be able to take hits while the spellcasters do their job - unlocking the secrets of the arcane doesn’t leave the much time for jogging, after all. Lazy wizards. Your stamina is much more plentiful, able to run for miles in heavy armor and only breaking a bit of a sweat, and your ability to take physical damage is likewise increased, your pain tolerance being something to be envied. This won’t let you survive being vaporized by the strongest magic in this world or being reduced to paste under a giant’s foot, but against blade, bow, and even destructive spells, you can keep fighting even under some of the worst of wounds just as effectively as you could before."
735,,200,Party Composition,Out of Context: Gamer System Supplement,Benevolence ,You are able to bestow up to 8 people temporary access to the generic and TableTop RPG system perks making them Party Members. When disconnected from the system the Party Members will retain any of the benefits they gained through the system.
736,,200,Iron Warrior,Elden Ring - Liurnia of the Lakes,Benevolence ,"It takes a certain kind of person to travel the Lands Between, especially if they are as vulnerable as the living jars. Yet you are no craven, hiding away until your problems get bored and leave! You are a warrior, the unbreakable willpower allowing you to push beyond your limits. Of course, it helps that you are so much more durable than before, your flesh better than many forms of armor, but it’s still quite impressive how far you could go with just a push."
737,,200,Roll With It ,Elden Ring - Liurnia of the Lakes,Benevolence ,"Combat can be tricky, especially when facing those more powerful than yourself. In such circumstances, your only hope will be to run and dodge, and this aims to make that just a bit easier. Whenever you roll, there will be an instant where you are impervious to harm, allowing attacks to go right through you. It lasts for only a moment, so you must time your rolls correctly in order to make the most out of it."
738,,200,Eternal Young Warrior,Fate/Legends - Baba Yaga,Benevolence ,"Did you ride atop a particular beast perhaps? In any case you benefit from a certain blessing, like what would become one of Dobrynya’s own skills once he was recorded upon the Throne. You are forever youthful and shan’t grow old. As an additional boon you are also rather fair to look at, perhaps even having a few charming inhuman traits like cat ears. Dobrynya’s wife was spawned from a giant apparently and don’t couples rub off on each other? Finally this eternal youth does not have to be just for yourself. It was rumored that the steed of the Bogatyr possessed the blessing before it was shared by him, so at your digression those you interact with, fight alongside with for extended periods of time, may eventually share this gift."
739,,200,Adaptive Legacy,Godbound,Benevolence ,"The Former Empires conducted many experiments of transhumanism, and some still linger to this day. Somehow, you have a power no man can obtain without the assistance of sorcery designed for a very specific purpose- at which it performs admirably. If you were adapted to the desert, you would not have to drink more than once a month and ordinary non-dehydrated foods could slake your thirst. You would be impervious to environmental cold or eat, and non-magical flames smaller than a bonfire. It’s possible your adaptations are even more extreme than this, but usually at some cost; those adapted to the void need only an hour of sunlight a day to slake the need to breathe, eat or drink and are impervious to hard vacuum and radiation. But while they can ignore the thermal conditions of deep space, the cold of a blizzard and fire disrupts your adaptive measures and affects you normally. Alterations specifically geared to enhance yourself like telepathic communication, a touch body akin to steel armor or agility that defends you just as ably, or retractable natural weapons generally constitute a single such adaptation. This can be taken multiple times if you wish to be truly well-adapted to the harsh land of Arcem.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
740,,200,Shield Hat,Wizarding World,Benevolence ,"It may or may not surprise you to hear so but magic is far from an easy subject. To become even a step close to the greats is to devote years of your life into learning the magical arts and delving deep into all of their aspects. Needless to say, not a lot of people do this. In fact, more than a few are content to live in peace, safe and sound in the lives they have chosen. But what happens when disaster strikes, and they’re forced to defend themselves with skills that have atrophied over time?

Enter the Shield Hat. Or cloak, whichever one you prefer. Created by a pair of redheaded twins as a joke, these items have been enchanted with a surprisingly effective Shield Charm. So long as the hat sits atop your head or the cloak upon your shoulders, you shall be protected. While the Shield Charm may not be able to protect you from a dedicated and lethal assault, it shall more than suffice when it comes to jinxes and glancing blows. And if you do have the skill, your Shield Charms shall be bolstered as the shield you conjure combines with that of the hat or the cloak’s.

Just be careful, alright? The Shield Charm is not the ultimate defense against everything, especially not one borne from a simple enchanted item."
741,,200,Felix Felicis,Wizarding World,Benevolence ,"Small enough to be held with only two fingers, this transparent vial contains a liquid that resembles molten gold, moving and soaring within the vial like tiny goldfish. This liquid is none other Liquid Luck, a special potion meant for one thing alone. To make its drinker lucky. With this by your side, luck shall always be by yours.

By imbibing the liquid within, you will be granted an instinctive knowledge on what to do, a path that’ll allow you to achieve whatever your desires may be. But be warned. Luck is far from being all-powerful and there may come a time wherein luck will not be enough to save you, especially when this potion in its entirety is only enough for twelve hours of luck at most.

Fortunately, by purchasing it here, this vial will be refilled with that precious liquid luck every two weeks. Try not to take too much advantage of it. There are consequences to abusing luck in this way."
742,,200,A Dark Body,Wizarding World,Benevolence ,"The Dark Arts holds great potential for power should one be willing to... experiment. From rituals to potions to curses and more, both your body and mind can be transformed and made greater, far greater. But as always, there are consequences to such things and not all transformations are compatible with one another. Fortunately, it seems your being is quite receptive to such things.

From now on, your body and mind shall mitigate the negative effects of any transformation you choose to undergo. More specifically, it means that you any modification you choose to undergo will, at bare minimum, not kill you. More often than not, such alterations to your form shall succeed. But be careful. You may live and your body may remain, but it would do well to remember that there will always be changes. This only mitigates such things. It will not rid you of them entirely."
743,,200,Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman,Elden Ring - Limgrave,Benevolence ,"A legendary talisman of wrought iron depicting a massive ancient dragon, it will enormously boost physical damage negation. The ancient dragons, who ruled in the prehistoric era before the Erdtree, would protect their lord as a wall of living rock. And so it is that the shape of the dragon has become symbolic of all manner of protections."
744,,200,Shield of the Guilty,Elden Ring - Limgrave,Benevolence ,"Shield made to venerate a maiden whose eyes were crushed by Briars of Sin before being reborn in these lands. Venerating the repose of the soul, this shield boosts one’s resistance to sleep and maddening effects. The briars can be used to attack foes, leaving terrible wounds that are difficult to heal."
745,,200,Untamed Spirit ,Elden Ring - Limgrave,Benevolence ,"In time, the chaotic nature of the Crucible was trimmed and forgotten, leaving behind only the perfect Golden Order. Yet that primordial chaos never truly disappeared, its wild nature housed within you. Despite their best efforts, you cannot be controlled or contained, and will eventually regain your freedom no matter how long it takes or what trials you must overcome."
746,,200,Roll With It ,Elden Ring - Limgrave,Benevolence ,"Combat can be tricky, especially when facing those more powerful than yourself. In such circumstances, your only hope will be to run and dodge, and this aims to make that just a bit easier. Whenever you roll, there will be an instant where you are impervious to harm, allowing attacks to go right through you. It lasts for only a moment, so you must time your rolls correctly in order to make the most out of it."
747,,200,Disney Death,Gummi Bears,Benevolence ,"First, things like falls and being crushed under rocks/cave-ins/falling castle bits won’t ever kill you even if they really should, instead you’ll bounce off things just enough to prevent a fatal fall or you’ll land in a little water/slime/mud/tree/bush/loose dirt that’ll just be deep and soft enough to break your fall. Or the cave-in/falling castle will just leave enough space for you to wriggle through and escape largely unhurt.

Second, effects that might count as death don’t so long as you're “fixed” by the end of the jump. So things like being turned to stone/crystal and being shattered doesn’t matter so long as your friends can put you back together and revert the spell.

Third, in the event of your actual death, or some sort of death-like event that would end your jumpchain, you’ll be resurrected or saved by some means. This effect works only once every jump, or once every ten years, whichever comes first."
748,,200,Touched by All        ,Wizard 101,Benevolence ,"As the great sages of Krokotopia before you, your study of vast arrays of varied magics has led to great insights into the workings of magic. As such, you have devised and enacted a ritual upon yourself, calling out to every power to have ever touched you, balancing one against the other in a dizzying spiral, all working to further your goals. The end result is both subtle and impressive, granting you a one-third resistance to the hostile effects of any magics or elements you understand well enough, or you are empowered by, enough, in order to balance it against its counterparts that you also understand. At base this includes all of the primary schools of this realm, but this perk greatly expands with greater knowledge."
749,,200,Witch Wool,The Owl House,Benevolence ,"You’ve got yourself some threads! This enchanted fabric is soft, warm, and warded to repel harmful magics. Only the strongest of witches can overcome this defense. You receive one garment made of Witch’s Wool, formed in a style of your choice. Whether it be a cape, a coat, or something else entirely, this article of clothing is both fashionable and fortified. You may also choose to imbue an already-owned garment with this enchanted fabric."
750,,200,Grit your teeth,Disney Princess,Benevolence ,"When it comes time to push through your problems, you push through them. Train longer, run farther, fight off that magic spell, swim through the waters of hell if you have to. You can be slowed down, but not stopped."
751,,200,Duet,Disney Princess,Benevolence ,"By finding someone with the same type of problem as you, you can transfer the powers of your songs to others. Works with as many people as you can get and sufficiently large amounts of people will increase the effectiveness of the song."
752,,200,Ring of Steel Protection,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Benevolence ,"A steel ring that would belong to a knight king, who would go down in legends as standing down a giant drake and slashing it to pieces. Those who wear this will be better protected than most, as it will reduce all incoming physical damage, an invaluable ability on the field of battle."
753,,200,Orange Charred Ring,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Benevolence ,"A ring that was enchanted by a witch, meant for the only son of the Witch of Izalith. Since his birth, he was afflicted with sores that were inflamed by lava, leading to his sisters giving him this ring. While wearing it, you will find yourself more resistant to fire and lava, handling their heat as well as any stone in a campfire naturally would."
754,,200,Gold-Hemmed Black Set,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Benevolence ,"The clothing of the Daughters of Izalith, the direct offspring of the Lord of Life. This gold-hemmed black set was designed to better withstand the heat of their home. While wearing these clothes, you will find all of your fire-based abilities improved in potency, as well as offering you a resistance to both fire and poison."
755,,200,Silver Knight Set,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Benevolence ,"The eponymous armor of the Silver Knights, those warriors dedicated to Lord Gwyn and his Age of Fire. Though the knights would be reduced to guarding an abandoned city and the goddess housed within, these were made for those participating in war and function like it, being made from titanite. The armor offers great protection to all who wear it, offering resistance to fire."
756,,200,Calming Darkness,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Benevolence ,"Before the Dark Soul itself was bound to the First Flame through divine means, Darkness was a quiet, subtle thing that was content to wait for its time. This calmness is especially pronounced within you, as not only will the Dark within you never go wild, but any other powers and abilities you possess will never harm you, regardless of what the typical cost for their use would be."
757,,200,Gross Incandescence,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Benevolence ,"Your presence is like that of Fire itself, filling those around you with a comfortable warmth that soothes the soul, making you popular to keep around indeed. You give off a holy aura that not only illuminates you like golden fire in a cave, but will fill any nearby allies with extra vigor and stamina, allowing them to last much longer than they could have before."
758,,200,Dodge Roll,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Benevolence ,"Combat can be tricky, especially when facing those more powerful than yourself. In such circumstances your only hope will be to run and dodge, and this aims to make that just a bit easier. Whenever you roll, there will be an instant where you are impervious to harm, allowing attacks to go right through you. It lasts for only a moment, so you must time your rolls correctly in order to make the most out of it."
759,,200,Undying Undead,Hellsing,Benevolence ,"Nazis are famously hard to stamp out. Millennium itself is quite the representative of this, the great Major having cheated death more than just once or twice. More than a matter of just sheer force of will, he and now you both possess quite the luck when it comes to surviving things you shouldn’t. A beating that leaves you on the edge of death, bleeding out and alone on a battlefield, would see your capable doctor arrive and allow you to survive with the addition of cybernetic parts. A stray shot might only take your eye, instead of your head. A ambush that should spell certain death instead allows you to escape wounded, though most of your men die in the process. A great enough force, repeated attempts in succession or a dramatic end might all bring an end to this streak of luck. But as long as you keep trying, you’ll find much more success than normal at escaping with your life intact from deadly situations, even if you come out quite wounded. "
760,,200,Heart of a Child,Marry Poppins Returns,Benevolence ,"You’ve always been young at heart. No matter how much you age, or how much the world seems to try to keep you down, you’ve always managed to find joy in the smallest things imaginable. You have a sense of wonder that can never be dulled, and while you may grow older and wiser with age, jaded ennui and cynicism will never catch up with you. Of course, that doesn’t mean that you’ll never get bored, or that you won’t ever doubt the things around you - it’s merely that your skepticism and world-weariness will be less likely to negatively impact you in a psychological sense. Supernatural effects are also more likely to see you as innocent or pure, though such an obfuscating effect is, of course, entirely togglable."
761,,200,We’re Invincible!,Star vs the Forces of Evil,Benevolence ,"Congrats, you’re now nearly unkillable. And, should you expect annihilation, or worse, in the near future, know that you can throw a piece of yourself (say, a hand) elsewhere and, should it survive while the rest of you doesn’t, you will regrow from it, memories and all. Which could be helpful if the trapezoid Rhombulus manages to capture your greater portion, or someone’s planning to blow up a wand near you. On the other hand, instant death spells and regeneration-negating weapons still work like they should on you."
762,,200,Unique Mind,Wizards of Waverly Place,Benevolence ,"Your mind is different from everybody else. This makes it so you are immune to mind control of any kind. A spell that would erase your memories would wash over you, mummy trying to control you would be just looking at red eyes, and even alcohol that affects your inhibition would not inhibit your judgment, unless you deem it so."
763,,200,Time Paradox,Wizards of Waverly Place,Benevolence ,"In this world it is quite common for Wizards to go back in time and mess things up. Luckily for you, since you are an outsider you appear to be unaffected by changes to the timeline, so don’t worry if a Wizard goes back in time"
764,,200,Divine Blessing,Dark Souls: Covenants,Benevolence ,"The Goddess of Sunlight Gwynevere, daughter of the great Lord of Sunlight Gwyn, is cherished by all as the symbol of bounty and fertility. As such, this flask of holy liquid, blessed by her, can be imbibed in order to restore one to full health as well as purge the body of any unnatural irregularities. The divine liquid within will replenish each day after it has been used."
765,,200,Miraculous Resonance ,Dark Souls: Covenants,Benevolence ,"In such trying times, those of the faith must stick together, lest the dark forces of the world pull them off the path of righteousness. Whenever you find yourself in the presence of those you would consider friends or allies, you will find that your miracles, and similar holy abilities, are much more potent than before."
766,,200,Gross Incandescence,Dark Souls: Covenants,Benevolence ,"It is the Great Lord Gwyn’s light that has defined this Age of Fire, a light so magnificent as to change the natural order of the world, something you seek to emulate. At will, you may emit a golden light from your person, one that eases the mind and soothes the body of all stresses. Not only is it useful in dimly lit areas, but it is quite effective at warding away the Dark."
767,,200,Soothing Sunlight,Dark Souls: Covenants,Benevolence ,"To stand before the Princess of Sunlight is a wondrous thing, for her very presence a soothing balm in these uncertain times. In a physical manifestation of this metaphorical quality, you can unleash a wave of divine energy that shall heal yourself and those near you."
768,,200,Blighted Existence,Dark Souls: Covenants,Benevolence ,"You appear to share the same merciful and selfless countenance as the Fair Lady whom your covenant serves. You can take within yourself all manner of diseases, illnesses, parasites, and curses, taking them from those less fortunate. Fret not, for you shall not end up like the Fair Lady, as what you take within you will eventually fade away into nothingness, though the stronger it is the longer it will take before it dissipates."
769,,200,Chosen Undead ,Dark Souls: Covenants,Benevolence ,"There is a prophecy amongst the people of Astora, one that speaks of a Chosen Undead who learns their true purpose within the Land of Ancient Lords, and you may be the one who best fits such a mantle. During your time here, you will continue resurrecting from death without end, until you lose your will and go Hollow, in which case you will have failed your Jumpchain. In future worlds, you will only be able to cheat death once per year, but it's better than what you would have been working with."
770,,200,Roll With It ,Dark Souls: Covenants,Benevolence ,"Combat can be tricky, especially when facing those more powerful than yourself. In such circumstances, your only hope will be to run and dodge, and this aims to make that just a bit easier. Whenever you roll, there will be an instant where you are impervious to harm, allowing attacks to go right through you. It lasts for only a moment, so you must time your rolls correctly in order to make the most out of it."
771,,200,I Found Myself In That Boom        ,Atlantis - The Lost Empire,Benevolence ,"So you’ve picked out your specialty, and it turns out it’s pretty dangerous- I mean, who knew that playing with matches (and sticks of dynamite) all day could be dangerous? Weird. Anyways, even if you have a laissez-faire attitude when it comes to things like “safety” and “making sure that your vast collection of bombs and incendiary devices doesn’t blow us all to kingdom come”, that doesn’t seem to be much of an actual problem- your tools and equipment never blow up in your face (literally or figuratively) as a result of an accident or misstep on your part, and even if they’re sabotaged or damaged the worst that’ll happen is getting covered in soot, and maybe having your mustache get a cute little ember on the end of it or something. "
772,,200,Sundrops,Moana,Benevolence ,"The mystical healing flowers of Tangled grow here in the south pacific, and if you take this option, you get a small garden patch of them. They can cure any sickness or injury if dissolved into a tea, and if a special prayer is said, they can reverse aging"
773,,200,Magic Heater Energy Shield ,Marvel Britain,Benevolence ,"A magical energy shield that appears at will from a wristband you can wear. It is very powerful, able to deflect blasts from skrullian military blasters without worry. A powerful enough attack can cause this shield to break but it will be recreated whenever you wish."
774,,200,Eternity’s Tragedy,Bloodborne: Covenants,Benevolence ,"The blood used in ministration can offer one many benefits, but as always, it can so easily turn into a curse. Like a certain yellow-clad Hunter, you will find yourself with ageless immortality, as well as finding that your body and skills will never deteriorate, no matter how long it has been since you’ve made use of them. But what use are those skills when those you care about lie dead or beastly?"
775,,200,Blood Consumption,Bloodborne: Covenants,Benevolence ,"Blood is undoubtedly the most important liquid to be found in the body, filled with unrivaled vitality. Yet, when a foe lies slain, does their blood not get wasted, splattered all across the ground. You are not so foolish as to waste such a good opportunity, now capable of draining the blood of others in order to quickly restore your own health and vitality, with the more of it you consume the more you heal."
776,,200,Timed Dodge,Bloodborne: Covenants,Benevolence ,"The fighting style typically employed by Hunters is all about constant movement and relentless offense, a style that can get disrupted when you’re struck by an enemy and left vulnerable. Now, though, whenever you dodge or roll in the middle of combat, you will find that there is a small window of time where you are rendered invulnerable, attacks passing through you like they weren’t even there. Should you master the timing, there’s few that could ever lay a scratch on you."
777,,200,A Very Different Thing        ,Marvel Magic,Benevolence ,"There are those who would turn your very being against you, replicating your powers or even using your genetic code to create clones of you for their own purposes. Well you in particular don’t have to worry about it quite so much as others would. There’s something chaotic about your being, twisting and changing, warped and eldritch to those who would turn it against you. Now any attempts to replicate your powers or utilize your DNA without your permission are distorted, making it nearly impossible. It could still happen, but it would take an extraordinary sorcerer or a madman; no normal scientist could do it, no matter how advanced or intelligent."
778,,200,Emancipation Invocation,Marvel Magic,Benevolence ,"Truly advanced or powerful magic often requires invoking the power of great mystical beings to channel into your spells. The problem with doing so is that universal truth: there's no such thing as a free lunch. Magic always has a price, see, and many beings will feel that price is owed to them. In many cases it is best to simply pay your debts, avoiding the wrath of a godlike being and leaving open the possibility of calling on them once again in the future. However, there are times when you cannot or will not do as they ask. In those times, you may invoke the Emancipation Invocation, cleansing you of mystical debts of your choosing but also of power from and bonds to the one you owe the debts to. Be wary however, as most beings will likely be gravely offended by this and are unlikely to be willing to treat with you in the future."
779,,200,Asgardian Armor,Marvel Cinematic Universe - Volume 1,Benevolence ,"This exquisite set of ornate armor is as beautiful as it is protective, and comes in the colors and style that you wish. Along with looking amazing and being deceptively lightweight, this armor can withstand a great deal of punishment and even self-repair itself slowly given time. When you want to be protected without sacrificing appearance? This is the armor for you."
780,,200,Beyond The End Of Time,Loki,Benevolence ,"Being outside of the conventional flow of time has had some interesting effects, whether it’s due to coming from an entirely different time-space continuum or living after the ‘end’ of time. Specifically, you and your possessions are completely immune to any sort of temporal effects that you don’t want to be affected by. While others might be trapped in loops, shunted through time or have their age altered, such efforts are entirely ineffective against you or your possessions."
781,,200,Branded ,Marvel Primal,Benevolence ,"You have the base powers of the Starbrand. Flight, energy blasts, tremendous strength and resilience to match the likes of Captain Marvel or Nova in another age. Speaking of age, the bearer of the Starbrand doesn’t and their lives can stretch for eons."
782,,200,Comic Book Death,X-Men the Claremont Years,Benevolence ,"It was a saying during the later years of this run that only 3 people stay dead in comic books: Barry Allen, Bucky, and Uncle Ben. In the decades since 2 of them have returned to life. The real rule seems to be that you only stay dead if your character existed only to die and provide motivation to the hero. You are not the dead mentor of another hero’s backstory, so once per jump (or 10 years whichever is sooner) when you die circumstances will align to resurrect you through some means. Each time you are revived this will likely be through a somewhat different method."
783,,200,Lightforce Conduit,Ultimate Marvel,Benevolence ,"You can generate light-based energy that can be formed into dagger-like shapes and perhaps other shapes with training and skill. This energy can also be used to purify mind control effects, heal, and remove physiological conditions like drug addiction or insanity."
784,,200,My Reality,Ultimate Marvel,Benevolence ,"There are too many reality manipulators in any Marvel-verse, this one is no exception. Thanks to this perk you don’t have to fear them as much, they can’t personally affect you. However, they can still create effects around you, such as delete the planet so you can’t breathe or they can still create a golem to pummel you to the ground or create a black hole to suck you in."
785,,200,My Mind,Ultimate Marvel,Benevolence ,"Now, telepaths cannot peek into your mind at all. This perk gives protection against even the more powerful Omega Level Telepaths. Although those with a power source similar to the Phoenix can still bypass your defenses."
786,,200,Loyalty        ,Thor: Love and Thunder,Benevolence ,Some of the greatest figures in the history of the universe ironically fell to their own weapons they used to forge their legends. Who would’ve thought that Zeus would’ve gotten impaled by his own bolt? This won’t affect you. Any weapon you’ve wielded can never harm you or anything you own. Feel free to laugh at your enemies while they try and repeatedly fail to hijack your death star.
787,,200,The Power of Jumper,Thor: Love and Thunder,Benevolence ,"Sometimes, you can’t protect those you love. They must protect themselves. But getting stronger is a long, arduous road and inconvenient when they need the strength immediately. Worry not. You can bestow any of your powers to any person or object you choose and take it back just as easily. Now everybody can be the god of thunder! Or whatever domain you chose. If you chose one. The amount of power comes from you, directly, so the more you give out, the weaker you get. It can be spread among any number of hosts, and if the host is destroyed in some way, the power will return to you. If you get merked, you may choose if the power leaves you for a successor, or multiple, (who doesn’t get this perk) or if it dies with you."
788,,200,Breakdown(400),Marvel 2099,Benevolence ,"For an additional 200 CP only one (half) of your hands has that power of destruction. Instead the other hand(s) have the power to heal with a touch. This healing cannot recreate what is no longer there - it cannot revive the dead or restore lost limbs and organs - but it can cure diseases, wounds, or even fix genetic disorders. This healing isdraining to you, however, and curing supernatural diseases, or repeated use, can push you to the edge of exhaustion and collapse forcing you to rest and recover.

Requires Breakdown(200) to Purchase"
789,,200,TOO BUSY GETTING BITCHES TO CARE ABOUT PHYSICS ,Helltaker,Benevolence ,"No longer, will the rules of the universe stop you from having GLORIOUS SUCCESS. Everytime you encounter a non-combat situation, no matter how physically taxing it is to solve, you always have enough strength, speed, (etc) to solve it. Giant chains fall from the sky in repeating patterns at the SPEED OF SOUND? Not a problem. You find yourself surrounded by giant cubes of stone? Bone Demons from Hell? No worries, just kick the damn things; Hercules would be shook at the sight of your might. You get the gist. You also get a flat bonus to strength; about XXI% more."
790,,200,Alteration Immunity ,Dr Strange Multiverse of Madness,Benevolence ,When dealing with beings such as the Scarlet Witch who are capable of easily alternating reality you must be cautious. This perk protects you from any reality or temporal warping effects. For example if Scarlet Witch attempted to remove one of your body parts she would be unable to affect you. Granted this won’t stop her from using a saw or simply tearing your limb off.
791,,200,In Defense of Innocence,Marvel Cosmic,Benevolence ,"You know the protection of the innocent is the most important task of a hero. Everything else is secondary and done as part of fulfilling this first and most noble of goals. With this park, you’ll find all your abilities double when you are protecting innocent people. This also makes you luckier and gives you a limited form of plot armor as long as you are protecting the innocent of some sort, whether that means unarmed civilians or wrongfully accused individuals."
792,,200,Healing Factor        ,Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Benevolence ,"What you do isn’t very nice; luckily for you, you can heal very quickly. This can be purchased three times; the first will make it so that small wounds, such as cuts or bruises, heal in about a minute, while bigger wounds such as missing limbs heal in a few hours. The second makes it so that small wounds and injuries like bullet holes heal instantly, while larger injuries such as missing limbs or organs (aside from the brain) heal in about an hour. The third makes missing limbs and organs heal in a matter of minutes, and even allows the regeneration of the brain with no memory loss so long as at least some of it remains. Your regeneration will ensure that you’ll survive long enough to heal a missing organ, though you’ll probably be in incredible amounts of pain until it’s fully healed.

May be Purchased Three Times"
793,,200,Ice Queen,Fate/Zero,Benevolence ,"The Supernatural being of this world are often more than human in ways beyond just physical strength, speed or magical might. Many beings, including the Heroic Spirits a Master might summon, have inhuman beauty, able to charm mortals with just a single glance. You won’t fall to these unnatural wiles though, or even the charms of normal humans. You’ll never be effected by any attempt to supernaturally charm or seduce you and you’ll always be able to tell whenever someone is trying to charm you with only their looks or charisma. You can still choose to let yourself be effected if you like, no reason you can’t enjoy that beauty in a safer situation. "
794,,200,Subject #40 Notes,Darkest Dungeon,Benevolence ,"A book of notes detailing a victim of the plague, written by a skilled and possibly demented doctor. Merely holding onto it substantially increases the vitality of its bearer, and grants a huge boost to the humors that makes it much easier to fend off disease. "
795,,200,Immunity Mask,Darkest Dungeon,Benevolence ,"A blessed mask that grants tremendous resistance to bleed, blight, and stunning effects. Somehow, you can see out of it even though there aren’t any eye-holes. "
796,,200,Holy Orders,Darkest Dungeon,Benevolence ,"A scroll bearing the commandments of a holy leader. Merely bearing it grants unflinching mental resolve even in the face of death, and in fact makes deathblows less likely. "
797,,200,Solemnity,Darkest Dungeon,Benevolence ,"“Strength, purpose, and peace- all can be found in the focused mind.” Although typically used to support others, the power of the Light can also be channeled inwards. By taking a moment to focus in battle you can heal body and mind, closing wounds and soothing fears and other stresses. If rejuvenation is not what you desire, than you can instead hone your body and mind- increasing your resistances to various ailments for the duration of battle, or doing the same for the strength and accuracy of your arm. Doing this may leave you open to attack, however; so be sure you can afford to do so and that your efforts wouldn’t be better spent doing something else."
798,,200,Star of Dinèta,Bayonetta,Benevolence ,"Sometimes, being an asshole CAN work in your favor. These bracers have a unique effect in that by taunting an enemy, you can actually heal yourself by a small amount. It only works four times in rapid succession before it needs to recharge for a bit, but the ability to throw someone off their game AND restore yourself is arguably worth it... if only to see the looks on their faces. Just be warned, this doesn't guarantee you can heal faster than they can damage you."
799,,200,Stone Armor,Ragna Crimson,Benevolence ,"An ability best suited for those who lack any talent in magic, yet still incredibly deadly in the hands of the proper warrior. This power manifests in two subskills. The first one grants the user the ability to cover themselves into a hard armor made from stone-like scales that makes them almost all kinds of physical and magical damage. Even enhanced swords fail to leave anything but scratches, and that’s only for the good ones.

The second, allows the user to increase the power behind their strikes, gaining strength and speed by consuming their magical power, allowing them to punch in a league way above what their body should. As the trump card of this power, the user may concentrate all their magical energy into a single strike. Your average hunter may be able to destroy a building with this, but a Seija may obliterate a large fortress with this strike even if their magical capabilities were low. This will however leave the user unable to use magic for a short time afterwards."
800,,200,The Hunt Isn’t Over Yet ,Ragna Crimson,Benevolence ,"Stopping? Why would you stop now? You have a strong something that drives you out to act, whether it be the love for those dear to you, or the burning hatred to take revenge of your enemies. Whatever it is, it has given you an iron will comparable to that of Ragna’s. You won’t stop fighting even if your body is a broken mess. You will surpass your fears and crush them under your heel if they stop you from reaching your objective. You could even temporally resist the physical and mental domination of the dragon transformation process by sheer force of will alone. There is probably nothing in this world that can make you give you up and surrender."
801,,200,Youthful Virtue,Trinity Wonder,Benevolence ,Now this is a rare sight. This bottle would probably sell for millions if you were to auction it in many words. It’s a bottle of Youthful Virtue; an elixir of the murim world. Those that take it have their aging reversed in proportion to the amount of it that they consume. Take enough and an old man can return to his prime with no side effects. The elixir can be refilled by pouring in large amounts of energy into the bottle.
802,,200,Impervious Blade Body ,Trinity Wonder,Benevolence ,"The impervious blade body was a special physique obtained by Wujin after one of his many fights with the Demon Lord. It greatly increases the durability of the person’s body, without requiring any kind of upkeep from ki. This durability increase is nothing to scoff at. Someone with this kind of body would only be left with a faint red mark on their skin if they were to be slashed by a blade powerful enough to slice metal like butter. Do not grow cocky though. There are still many things that can deal enough damage to render the protection moot. Not just powerful murim warriors, even the laser turrets of the technological world are capable of easily tearing holes in such a body."
803,,200,Face of the Mountain ,League of Legends ,Benevolence ,"This ornate bracer fits neatly onto any bearer's arm, and acts as a sturdy shield. By shouting the name of Targon and pointing at an ally, once a minute the bearer can surround their ally in a powerful shield that will absorb incoming damage before exploding, damaging enemies and slowing their movements."
804,,200,Tenacity,League of Legends ,Benevolence ,"A lot of Champions in the League of Legends have abilities focused around disabling their opponents so they can't fight back while they get torn to shreds. Stuns, slows, abilities that knock you around or charm you... You, however, are difficult to stop once you get moving. Disabling effects have less of a hold on you, and you're able to shake off things like stun grenades or blinding poison much faster than you would otherwise."
805,,200,Shield of Orynth,A Throne of Glass,Benevolence ,"A perfect copy of the Shield of Orynth, a potent shield that has been enchanted to be able to block magic. If you are able to interpose this shield between the magic attack and yourself you can block it. However be aware this shield is the size of a normal round shield, and can therefore only block so much magic at a time. It might be more accurate to say that this shield is able to cancel out magic it is attacked with."
806,,200,Will of Stone,A Throne of Glass,Benevolence ,"You have immense willpower, able to push yourself through pain, trauma, and even possession beyond any normal person. Where others would crumble you endure, not always with grace, but endure nonetheless. You have the willpower to resist possession from beings far stronger than you are, with a bit of effort you may even use some of this willpower to start crushing your possessor out of your body. You would be able to resist mental manipulations, and torture from centuries old masters of the arts, to the point of never giving in despite the pain. You could be mutilated to the edge of death, and healed back to full health only to have the cycle repeated again and again for months without giving in. This willpower gives you a resistance to trauma’s long-term effects, you would be far more resistant to ptsd and similar ailments than almost all other people."
807,,200,Bonds that Tie,Super Dragon Sword,Benevolence ,"Your allies not only are loyal to you, but would fight and die for each-other…and often will fight harder for it. You are capable of manifesting the relationships between yourself and your allies as a tangible motivational force, close friendships, loves, and rivalries allowing them to break the limits of what they’re capable of by going all out - as well as making them luckier and more likely to succeed in surviving whatever measures they take in the name of their loved ones."
808,,200,Living Death Stance,Super Dragon Sword,Benevolence ,"When you are down to low health, you are able to take on a Stance that that causes your body to move quicker, gaining the Effects of the Haste and Regen status effects. This extends even when you’ve returned to full health, for the rest of the combat."
809,,200,Deflective Stance,Super Dragon Sword,Benevolence ,"You can enter a Stance in which you have a high chance chance whenever struck to instantly return the damage back with a powerful strike, even capable of redirecting projectiles back to sender. This stance requires mana to enter, and only lasts a minute. This stance cannot be combined with any other Stances."
810,,200,My Soul is Armor,Super Dragon Sword,Benevolence ,"Your soul’s light shines brightest in battle. Whenever you take damage in battle, you are able to take half of it as damage your mana supply instead, reducing it by that much."
811,,200,Order to Charge,Super Dragon Sword,Benevolence ,"All fighters, move out! Your zealous commands to attack empower your allies! You can use the Charge order to grant your allies the Courage, Hope, and Determination status effects. In order, these increase damage done with physical attacks, damage done with spells, and resistance to harmful mental status effects such as Fear and Charm."
812,,200,On Angel’s Wings,Super Dragon Sword,Benevolence ,"I If you are targeted by an attack while an Angel is currently summoned, you may use a moment’s focus to redirect half of the damage you would have taken to an allied summoned angel."
813,,200,Restraining Order ,Ben 10,Benevolence ,"Did you know the individual known as Professor Paradox isn’t allowed to be within a certain distance of Celestialsapiens? As it turns out when you hop up and down the timestream, you tend to attract a lot of unwanted attention in those who aren’t too happy with your actions. The good news is that the common desire not to bother with your shenanigans goes both ways, because things like cosmic reality warpers and time travelers do their best to ignore you. Even if one of them makes a sweeping change to reality, you will remain completely unaffected by it and able to keep on as if nothing has happened. In short, so long as you don’t mess with them, celestial and cosmic entities won’t mess with you. Of course, this truce goes out the window if you approach or meddle with their affairs directly...or show up to their front door."
814,,200,Prototype Process ,Ben 10,Benevolence ,"Science is a learning process and sometimes that learning process involves explosions, malfunctions, or idiots messing with things they shouldn’t. Well, they used to, anyways. When technology you’ve built or used would normally suffer a malfunction or an experiment would become a disaster, it will instead create a harmless inconvenience instead of blowing up in your face. A device’s sensitive power core being struck would see it shut down immediately, a DNA serum you inject into yourself gives you mild indigestion instead of mutating you into a horrible monster, and so on. If a result would be entirely negative for you, the impact is dulled to a comical accident instead of something that could endanger your life and those of others. How lucky for you."
815,,200,Esoteric resistance,Generic Dungeon Crawler,Benevolence ,"You can resist unusual forces like hellfire, the negative forces that power the undead, or insanity inducing mental assaults. 25% resistance per purchase. This trait can be purchased multiple times, but only one purchase may apply per source of damage. 

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
816,,200,Elemental resistance,Generic Dungeon Crawler,Benevolence ,"You are 50% resistant to a common source of damage like fire, acid or electricity. This only mitigates damage, not environmental effects, so having resistance to gravity does not allow you to jump higher. This trait can be purchased multiple times, but only one purchase may apply per source of damage. 

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
817,,200,Janissary Training,Dracula Untold,Benevolence ,"You can share your strength, speed, endurance and other physical abilities with others, letting them be faster and tougher and stronger. How much a person is boosted depends on how much power you invest and how many people it’s split in, but no matter how much it is no one suffers any negative effects. Also, the amount attenuates over distance, so don’t go trying to boost someone in Istanbul from Transylvania."
818,,200,Unbound,Dresden Files,Benevolence ,"Oh... wow. This is kinda a big deal here. So the way things work for magical beings in this world is, Power has Purpose. The more power you have, the more bindings that come with it.

Except for you, evidently. While this perk doesn’t give you so much as a smidgen of magical power, what it does do is something many of the mightiest forces in this world would do anything for. It allows you to retain a mortal’s free will no matter how powerful you become.

You could be a Fae, god, dragon, spirit... anything, and be entirely unrestricted by any bindings you haven’t agreed to yourself. Hell, you can even pick up Iron and lie your ass off without a carein the world as a fae.

Mind you, this doesn’t do anything to protect you from any contracts or bindings you enter into yourself, but anything that would be imposed on you as a simple fact of your nature or as part of this world just slides off you.

Keep in mind, something like this is also provided by the main antagonist, a creature known only as Nemesis and if you’re suspected as being infected by it it would put you on just about every shitlist that exists. So just... don’t flash it around, kay?"
819,,200,Always Use Protection,Dresden Files,Benevolence ,"Didn’t think I’d send you in without this, did you? 100% immunity to Nemesis and all supernatural forms of information detection including Precogs, the Archive and Intellectus. Free for this jump, 200 CP to retain it. Oh, and I suppose that if you want you can choose people to be visible to instead. But why would you want that?"
820,,200,Sisterhood,Frozen,Benevolence ,"It’s a special power, love, one not limited to being between those with romantic feelings for each other. A friend or family member can hold just as powerful a love for you as your lover could. It makes it all the more painful when you hurt each other, purposefully or not. But now, the love that exists between you will protect you from each other. As long as there exists a mutual, true and genuine love between you and another being, you won’t be able to hurt each other without the desires of both parties. Even the vilest insults will be easily laughed off, attacks accidental or not slide off each other and your actions cannot even cause the other harm through reckless collateral damage. The only way you can harm each other is by permanently, irrevocably breaking that bond of love."
821,,200,"""Pale Shade Mask & Armor""",Dark Souls 3,Benevolence ,"""Gold mask worn by those who kill in the name of the Sable Church of Londor. A faint, kindly smile is bound to its surface, giving them the moniker Harlots of Death. What lies beneath that expression, however, is nothing more than the face of a darkly shriveled Hollow."" ""Attire worn by those who kill in the name of the Sable Church of Londor. The Pale Shades of the Sable Church are all undying Hollows, giving rise to much fear and contempt. Their fight is one of neither honor nor exaltation, yielding nothing but withered moans."" Offers piddling protection to physical blows, but less than solid dangers have a very hard time getting through. No Pale Shade will fear curses or magic as long as they have nimble feet and these robes."
822,,200,"""Rusted Gold Coins""",Dark Souls 3,Benevolence ,"""A rusty old coin that surely has no currency. A rich man lost his fortune, but it returned to him twofold. He was quick to squander his retrieved fortune, smugly confidant that it was bound to double once again."" A set of seven rusted gold coins, each depicting the image of an angel; whether this angel is meant to represent one of the ones worshiped by the Ringed Knights or perhaps some other angelic creature found in the land this coin was minted in is unknown. Gold cannot normally rust, which perhaps explains why the coin lacks value, but as a talisman they are quite effective. When one crushes a coin, their luck increases in leaps and bounds for a time, increasing the likely-hood that they will stumble into wealth and treasure of some sort- particularly the kind carried by other people. A blessing to be sure, but avarice is often the downfall of men. A new coin is received daily until they number seven in total."
823,,200,"""Curse Ward Greatshield""",Dark Souls 3,Benevolence ,"""Greatshield given to those who resisted the curse long ago. Far too heavy for an ordinary person, perhaps it signifies the foolishness of resisting the curse. And yet, those who bear the weight of this shield will not find its protections against curses wanting."" A heavy shield requiring superhuman strength to wield one-handed, and a relic from a hunter who pursued the Undead long ago. When carried it increases one’s resistance to curses of all types, including the stone breath of Basilisks and even the curse of the Undead, to an extent."
824,,200,"""Golden Wing Crest Shield""",Dark Souls 3,Benevolence ,"""A blue knight’s shield engraved with a golden wing crest. This shield is exceptional amongst the enchanted blue shields; not only does it boast high magic absorption, but also enables its wielder to parry spells."" A rare artifact from a land where spell-parrying shields were more common, carried by the Lion Knight Albert in his defense of Lothric Castle. Like many crested shields it protects against an element quite well; in this case, sorceries. Making a parrying motion with the shield causes a short-lived magical barrier to appear for a moment, which has the power to reflect projectile spells away from the wielder if timed right."
825,,200,"""Robes of Prayer""",Dark Souls 3,Benevolence ,"""Prince Lothric’s hood, robe and skirt. The prince, destined to be a Lord of Cinder, was cherished by the royal family, despite being born into illness, a frail and shriveled child. His swaddling clothes were made of aged, coarse cloth used in ancient prayer, and are all that he has ever worn."" A set of simple, black robes trimmed with golden material, the prince’s clothes are lightweight, though clearly not fit for real combat. The miracles spoken of in prayer have soaked into the fabric, increasing the wearer’s ability to endure the elements, and the robes provide unmatched defense against curses of all types- though this is not absolute, as even now the Twin Princes’ suffer from their shared burden."
826,,200,"""Dragonscale Ring"" ",Dark Souls 3,Benevolence ,"""Ring of Oceiros, former king of Lothric. In his later years, Oceiros became fascinated with dragons. After going mad, he was more commonly known as the Consumed King. Many assassins were dispatched to his domain, but none returned. The Consumed King ascribed his resilience to the divine protection of the dragon scales."" An intricately designed stone ring, set with a pale blue dragon scale rather than a gem, the protection granted by the ring reduces the effectiveness of sneak attacks, protecting the wearer’s back from those who lurk in the shadows. Makes such cowardly tactics nearly half as effective as they would normally be, making it an invaluable asset for those that fear an assassin’s blade."
827,,200,"""Divine Blessing""",Dark Souls 3,Benevolence ,"""Holy water blessed by the Queen of Lothric. The Queen of Lothric, married to the former King Oceiros, was initially revered as a goddess of fertility and bounty. After giving birth to Ocelotte, her youngest, she quietly disappeared."" The holy water in this glass vial will fully recover the one who drinks it from all physical injuries and any mundane ailments plaguing them from disease to poison to burns or frostbite, but only if one drinks it all. The vial will refill one week after the holy water has been imbibed."
828,,200,"""Ringed Knight Armor""",Dark Souls 3,Benevolence ,"""Malformed black armor of the Ringed Knights. The armor of early men was forged in the Abyss, and betrays a smidgen of life. For this reason, the gods cast a seal of fire upon such armor, and those who possessed them."" A suit of armor that is suspiciously similar to the armor worn by the ancient Darkwraiths, the Ringed Knight Set is an effective set of medium-weight armor, with decent all-around defenses. The seal of fire on the chest, reminiscent to the Darksign, appears as a massive black hole on the chest- though it doesn’t render the armor any less protective. The hood is made of cloth, tainted by the Abyss, and is typically worn by the Ringed Knights in layers that hide their eyes. This was nothing less than an attempt to reveal what the seal of fire has occluded, and a subtle defiance of the gods’ wishes."
829,,200,"""Ethereal Oak Shield"" ",Dark Souls 3,Benevolence ,"""Charbronze shield used by Millwood Knights. This shield appears to be blessed by a great, if faded, image of the Ethereal Oak. "" A shield with overall average defenses, being slightly better at guarding against lightning and magic while having a vulnerability to fire. The blessing mentioned is a literal one; those who wield the shield will find their wounds slowly closing over time, much like weapons or shields infused with blessed gems. The healing it provides is unlikely to be of use in battle; rather, it can be used to heal them during prolonged rests if a bonfire isn’t available."
830,,200,"""Great Thunder Stoneplate Ring"" ",Dark Souls 3,Benevolence ,"""Stoneplates are symbols of true knights, and yellow stoneplates are granted to those who would become dragons."" Those who wear this ring are warded  against lightning, taking a great deal less damage from the glaring weakness of dragons."
831,,200,"""Dragonscale Armor""",Dark Souls 3,Benevolence ,"""Armor of a nameless king who was ally to the ancient dragons. Dragon scales are razor-sharp and cannot be burned. The golden crown, buried amidst long strands of bristling ash, is said to closely resemble that of the First Lord."" Average weight, rounded protection for the most part with notable strength against fire, and notable  weakness against lightning. This armor is aesthetically unique in these lands, harkening to the old royalty  of the gods."
832,,200,"""Sun Princess Ring"" ",Dark Souls 3,Benevolence ,"""Ring associated with Gwynevere, princess of sunlight and eldest daughter of Gwyn, the First Lord. Gwynevere left her home with a great many other deities, and became a wife and mother, raising several heavenly children."" A ring ""scavenged"" from the ""abandoned"" city of Anor Londo where Aldritch now resides. Those who wear this ring feel subtle warmth, and acquire moderate yet noticeable regeneration that repairs their body over time."
833,,200,"""Great Ring of Favor""",Dark Souls 3,Benevolence ,"“A ring symbolizing the favor of the Goddess Fina, whose ‘fateful beauty’ is mentioned in legend.” The fickle blessing of Fina lifts a bit of the burden placed on the wearer while increasing their vitality. To summarize the effects, the wearer becomes a bit harder to kill, doesn’t get tired as easily and will feel lighter on their feet."
834,,200,"""Vilhelm's Armor"" ",Dark Souls 3,Benevolence ,"""The black armor of Vilhelm, Knight of Londor, and a nice fit for any lean Hollow. This hollow knight, who served the three sisters who founded the Sable Church, was particularly loyal to the eldest, and was known as a cold-blooded hangman."" Very form fitting and lean despite its weight and thickness, making it difficult to use for any being other than a shriveled hollow. Offers considerable protection without getting in the way much, especially against blades, points and fire. That being said, the divine force of lightning punches through with relative ease, to the profane existence that rests underneath."
835,,200,"""Greater Life Ring""",Dark Souls 3,Benevolence ,"A simple ring set with a small red jewel. Normally left in graves as a memento for the dearly departed, this special Life Ring noticeably improves the vitality, the physical health, of the one who wears it no matter how full of life they might already be."
836,,200,"""Firelink Armor"" ",Dark Souls 3,Benevolence ,"""Armor of the Soul of Cinder, a deific manifestation of the Lords of Cinder, who linked the First Flame. It exists as a symbol of the great Lords and the noble act of linking the fire, though it is no more than an empty husk."" It resembles a knight's armor, but bears hideous burns and contortions. Tattered ornamental cloth still hangs from it. A misshapen crown can be seen on the rear of the helmet, and the chest takes the shape of a deathly ribcage. Offers great protection against blades, magic and flame."
837,,200,"""Stoking Flames""",Dark Souls 3,Benevolence ,"Purchasing this perk allows you to spawn bonfires into existence in future Jumps using a bit of focus and energy. Bonfires will greatly increase the natural healing of those who rest near one, and can even rejuvenate undead. These also work with Bonfire Teleportation, allowing you to set up a personal grid of checkpoints. You can't however place more than one within a few kilometers of each other, or place more than one a day. They will fade if left alone for a long period of time, ranging from several weeks to several months, but can be snuffed out sooner or stoked to prolong their lifetime."
838,,200,Persistence Predator ,Dark Souls 2,Benevolence ,"“There are some things only animals and those who approach the ways of them understand. Sometimes strategy, preparation and equipment mean nothing in the face of wild, unrelenting, ruthless fury. You have incredible stamina, and fairly decent pain tolerance. Where others would feel weakness in their limbs from a longer battle, you feel invigoration. Keep swinging until even the mightiest blocks crumble, then swing some more until your enemy is nothing but tenderized meat. Likewise, incredible stamina and pain tolerance is surprisingly good on defense. Weather assaults with shield in hand even when your defending arm starts to ache and sting. Wait, and when your prey has tired themselves, slaughter them!”"
839,,200,Environment Defiance,Dark Souls 2,Benevolence ,"“Perilous territories are no stranger to a seasoned knight. That said, these lands are really something else. If you wish to continue your quest unimpeded, take this. Volcanic heat, toxic miasma and accursed darkness may as well be rain, sleet or snow. Environmental extremes will no longer dissuade you as much as they might have once. Minor toxins in the air find no purchase, temperatures will need to be much higher or lower to slow you down and the dark is just a bit more soothing. Actually swimming in pools of caustic acid or lava would still prove idiotic, but stick to the roads and you’ll be whistling in comfort.”"
840,,200,Everything I Want ,Dark Souls 2,Benevolence ,"“Strange merchants populate these lands, carrying vast inventories for sale if only those interested pass them a few souls. Somewhere in your travels, you picked up a similar trick. You possess the ability to keep numerous items on your person, but only find burden from those you’re actively using. Armor counts as being used while worn, as it’s serving its purpose. You’re also quite good at managing such an inventory from years on the road. You seem to be able to stow away twice or even three times as much in storage containers as the next person.”"
841,,200,“Bloodshield”,Dark Souls 1,Benevolence ,"An enchanted shield spoken of in legend, marred by bright red blood and marked with a metal design resembling the face of a demon. The Bloodshield’s name is not just symbolic, but promotes strong blood, making the holder less likely to bleed out, fending off deadly toxins and even wards them against curses. Otherwise, just a really well- made shield."
842,,200,“Sanctum” ,Dark Souls 1,Benevolence ,"Legendary shield of the Way of White, one of the treasures taken by Lloyd before his holy mission to the land of gods. Still pristine gold and white even after all this time. Although much of its divine power has faded, it still increases the user’s healing while on their person, causing them to slowly regenerate."
843,,200,“Knight of the Lord”,Dark Souls 1,Benevolence ,"A knight’s will is in their blade, changing the course of battle with each swing. Their armor is their body, standing firm and protecting the fragile soul that lies within. Like the scorched black knights of Gwyn, your fate is forever tied with your equipment. With this perk your weaponry and armor is essentially an extension of your body and soul. It can become stronger, more resilient, more dangerous or gain new abilities entirely based on the special properties your body and soul possess. Equipping yourself will always be worth it with your weapons soaring to new dangerous heights as dangerous qualities are focused in them, and armor always able to protect in some manner. The downside is diseases, severe damage or corruption of what’s inside may also transfer. . . Those with Amazing Chest Ahead will find their equipment transforming into pristine, miraculously beautiful versions of what it once was. Make it as dazzling as tools of a god are expected to be."
844,,200,“Cling to Sanity” ,Dark Souls 1,Benevolence ,"While others fall into madness and despair around you, it is only befitting of someone bestowed with such a lofty title to live up to the expectations they and others have for themselves. Your mental defenses are truly commendable, able to withstand great trauma, pain and hardships inflicted upon you with nary a fear or doubt that wasn’t already there creeping upon you. Additionally, alternative means of madness inflicted upon you such as curses, diseases and brain damage are slowed down. Your resistance to such things isn’t as strong as the more common kinds. If taken with Sprawling Reach, you will never grow board or complacent while traveling. New sights and sounds will continue to be wonders, or an early warning depending on circumstances."
845,,200,Ungo’s Sugar,Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,Benevolence ,"A blue candy produced by the Senpo monks provided to you in packs of 10 once a week. When taken, your stamina and durability are increased for 10 minutes. Attacks that would normally leave deep gashes would instead only leave behind small cuts. When sprinting for 1 km would leave you winded instead running 3 km would only just begin to tire you."
846,,200,Samurai Die More Than Once,Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,Benevolence ,"Your determination has seen you through the worst of the Sengoku Era. During times where your death was assured, yet somehow you survived when lesser men would have died. It seems no matter how much you’re cut, stabbed, shot, or burned, you’ll survive again. Once per day, you can survive an otherwise fatal strike. Even if it was a clear stab through the heart, you will somehow miraculously live and even in situations where the enemy should have done nothing else but decapitate you, they instead opt for stabbing you through the chest. 

You can purchase this perk multiple times, up to three. The first and subsequent purchases are all discounted for the related origin.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
847,,200,Warding Incense ,Bloodborne,Benevolence ,"“Have you seen the incense burning all around Yharnam? People think it will keep them safe, and they're right to a degree. Purchasing this grants you an endless supply of special incense sticks that when burned ward off Beasts and other evil creatures of the night. 

This merely helps with evading their notice however, tricking them through their nose to leave you alone. More intelligent Beasts that notice something keeping them away may be able to push through the smell, and the incense can't do much against strange creatures of a ‘different’ sort. 

All things said and done though, being able to ward off areas using incense can be a powerful tool with rampaging beasts and turned mobs littering the streets.”"
848,,200,Guardian’s Covenant,Elden Ring,Benevolence ,"There are those who in accordance to an ancient pact with the Erdtree, receive renewed life when falling in battle. And though far slower than the revival of a Tarnished yet capable of witnessing Grace- perhaps taking months if not years-you are party to one such pact. Apart from this gift of resurrection, the Grace of old yet lingers on your arms and armour- making them significantly more resilient than they should be, and empowering them with holy energy. Symbolically affirming your vows right before battle bolsters the attack power and defence of yourself and your allies too. Finally your might and endurance are bolstered above and beyond the baseline of your kind-such that a human could wield a halberd of pure gold too heavy for most to wield with sublime skill, even clad in heavy plate."
849,,200,Finger Maiden,Elden Ring,Benevolence ,"How blessed you are, to walk in Grace. A bonafide Finger Maiden, a rare sight indeed in these lands now the Guidance of Grace no longer brings them together with the Tarnished as promised long before. Yours is the power to draw out the strength of Runes, converting them into strength in all aspects. From intellect to arcane insight, to resilience, swiftness, stamina and faith, any and all traits can be strengthened by your restorative touch. In addition you are highly gifted in healing incantations of all kinds, and with a mere touch can lay all manner of enchantments such as sanctifying water to purge Those Who Live In Death or enchanted weapons to blaze with golden light that repels all whose existence defies sacred Order.

...are you truly a Maiden? At least, you have the abilities of one. But just as Melina is not quite the same thing, if you wish you may be disqualified for various reasons (such as, say, being male) yet still somehow have the spiritual gifts needed to function as a Maiden. What a strange turn of events."
850,,200,DO YOU THINK YOU CAN HOLD ME?,Fantastic Beasts & Where to Find Them,Benevolence ,It is remarkably difficult to keep you contained as your magic seems to surge whenever you are bound or imprisoned causing ropes to loosen or locks to click open. It would take a very well designed cell to keep you for long.
851,,200,Unbound ,MtG - Amonkhet,Benevolence,"Your moral, spiritual, mystical, even physical natures, are involatible. Bolas could control you as he controls the gods who hold the trials, but twisting you into one of the nameless monsters that will ravage the plane during the Hours would be beyond even his power, and even that much would be temporary. Who and what you are cannot be changed, mutated, corrupted, or warped by anything, even your own abilities, unless you allow it. You cannot be turned into a vampire, infected with lycanthropy, corrupted, and so on, unless you allow it. This is not a blanket protection from having your mind manipulated, but it does mean you will always be true to yourself and your highest ideals, even in the face of such manipulation. Furthermore, you also possess the ability to slowly but surely reverse and escape mental and spiritual corruption and control as long as nothing is actively maintaining it. Even changes to your memories revert given a year or two."
852,,200,Paladin    ,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Benevolence,"There is one constant through those who strive to become Knights and Heroes in this place - will.

Be it the will to serve your allies and realm, the will to fight, the will to survive, the will to find what others don’t know...Every knight claims their title by acting on their will. Your reserves of will are great, and you are able to channel your willpower into self improvement easily, challenging yourself in whatever ways you deem fit, easily enough to transform this raw desire into the virtues of the Realm."
853,,200,Hedron Staff,MtG - Zendikar,Benevolence,"A staff with a hedron attached to the end. In the hands of many, it is merely a way keep Eldrazi from striking them, but in the hands of a lithomancer the hedron's might is closer to its origin: warding off Eldrazi in a wide area and allowing safe passage for one’s allies. Outside the jump, it helps ward off the various horrors of the multiverse. Here or out in the vast multiverse it’s a good tool to keep around when you want to sleep without being hunted by creatures that would harm you."
854,,200,Renewer of Nature ,MtG - Homelands,Benevolence,"During the apocalypse, the land itself died. The mana channels were run dry, and most creatures died as their life was drained by the mana-starved soil. Only the area that would become the Homelands survived thanks to the mana-gate opened below, while most of the planet was left desolate. Today, the Autumn Willow at the height of her power may have a chance at restarting the broken mana channels and bringing the planet back to life, but a spell that great would cost the lives of every creature on the planet, including herself.

You may not have the raw power to destroy everything and restore the natural mana of the world with one huge burst of energy, but what you do have is an aptitude for renewal on a smaller scale. Using your attunement to the primal order, you can feel out its corruption and cast ""small"" spells to restore that balance, restoring swathes of land to life. This way, you could expand outwards and slowly restore the ecosystem of the wastelands, or perhaps just focus your efforts on a single island to create a small but fertile retreat. It would take a very, very long time to restore all of Ulgrotha to life like this, but none would have to die."
855,,200,Wellspring,MtG - Shandalar,Benevolence,"The natural world is a world of untamed competition, of wild power, and perhaps more than any other: a world of life. Green mages know this principle well, and now you too have mastered the ebb and flow of vitality. Your efforts at mending wounds through regeneration or infusions of raw life force are vastly easier and more effective, and you have even learned how to bring forth new life and awareness from the world around you, such as transforming soil into mighty elementals or animating entire forests into armies of bark and wood."
856,,200,In Shining Armor,MtG - Shandalar,Benevolence,"You know who you are and what you stand for, and this resolve shines through in everything you do. You are guaranteed to never drift away from your true self no matter your experiences, though you will still learn from your history. You will not lose your connection with your humanity no matter the amount of power you accrue, nor abandon your values and goals due to the passing of time unless you choose to do so.

Even outside forms of manipulation such as mind-rending spells or insidious, corrupting influences will be substantially weaker when used against you."
857,,200,JUMP-START ,MtG - Ravnica,Benevolence,"Often, spells have a limit on how many times you can use them. An ancient scroll might crumble away into dust once the runes have been read, your mind might go blank after casting a spell you spent hours memorising. Well, everything should be given a second chance, right? This perk guarantees that you’ll be able to cast spells at least twice before they disappear. Make sure you learn from the first attempt!"
858,,200,Heart of the Underdog,MtG - New Phyrexia,Benevolence,"You have limited resources, while your enemies have access to most of the plane. Your numbers are small, and you’re weaker- but somehow you make it work. When you seem to be against the ropes, and vastly outmatched, you fight better, smarter- it's easy for you to plan around bigger forces, and you are experienced in guerilla warfare. Your attributes are boosted to help this along when you’re in these situations, but it will not be enough to overcome the gap fully."
859,,200,Jukai Promise Blade,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Benevolence,"Each and every student of the forest, upon graduating from mere trainee to fully fledged protector of the woods, is gifted with a weapon. A blade, a spear, a magical focus, it doesn’t really matter. What does matter is that this gift is not made from ordinary steel, but has been heavily enchanted by a Kami - in fact, it is proof that you possess a contract with a Kami to defend it from harm and tend to its lands in exchange for some small part of its powers. In this particular case, the blade is special not because of what it represents, but because it is capable of absorbing the backlash and overflow that may be caused by attempting to channel the power of a Kami through your body. In effect, it is a safety measure - instead of breaking yourself, the blade will break in your place."
860,,200,Legendary ,MtG - Kamigawa,Benevolence,A quality of some figures in this world which denies all imitations. Just like those figures of myth and battlefield legend you have a uniqueness that stops others from creating clones or copies of your form and powers without your direct allowance and intervention. Unless it’s willing don’t expect successful mimics to ever get your form or powers correct.
861,,200,Sunken Chest,MtG - Lorwyn,Benevolence,"Preparations for a day you had hoped would never come. The location marked by surface and subsurface landmarks, pointing at a spot on the riverbed where you can dig into the brackish mud and find a buried secret. A sturdy wooden chest the size of a full-grown kithkin, reinforced and latched with gold. Well, gold plating on bronze, but one would never be able to tell that without close inspection and certainly not down on the riverbed. 

The contents change, depending on what great need spurred you to dig up the chest, but they are always useful to you. Rarely will it solve your problems for you, but if some great catastrophe threatened the entire world it would at least allow you to survive mostly untouched. Perhaps it would hold supplies to survive, something to warn people and be taken seriously, or even an artifact that protects you personally from the effects. 

Whatever might be in it, you will be able to find and dig up a new chest each jump, landmarks appearing at the nearest river when you look for it."
862,,200,Poplar Resilience,MtG - Lorwyn,Benevolence,"Black poplar treefolk grow fast and regenerate even faster. They can spring back to life from a variety of injuries, and owe much of their regenerative power to the fertile mud of the swampy areas they live in. While you might not take root in such areas yourself, and might not even be a black poplar, you share in the incredible regenerative powers of these treefolk. Losing your leaves and even branches isn’t particularly debilitating for you, with it only taking a moment for you to direct sap away from a branch, even one of your limb-branches, that has been broken off before you can move on. As a tree you don’t feel pain like flesh creatures do, you feel it only as a signal of trouble. Then you can shut it off, and patch it up. 

There is never any prolonged 'hurt', and with your regenerative capacity rarely any long-lasting harm either. It’ll still take time to regrow foliage and branches, but if you got burned through some terrible circumstance, the burns would already be growing over with hardened sap and green, new bark by the time you're taking stock of the situation again."
863,,200,AWAKEN THE MAGIC,Wolfwalkers,Benevolence,"Only a Wolfwalker can make another, usually by biting them. You can not only make other people Wolfwalkers with your bite, but tease out other bits of personal potential. Perhaps awaken hidden powers, or bring out strength of character. You can control this so you can bite someone without turning them or giving them new talents."
864,,200,I’ll Be Fine,Skulduggery Pleasant,Benevolence,"The black stone that powers the Scepter of the Ancients was said to have sung to the Faceless Ones when their enemies approached, but when the Ancients took the stone, it remained silent. A long time later, Valkyrie Cain, thought to be a descendant of the Ancients, was able to touch the stone without it turning her to dust as it had to so many others. This is a gift you now possess. You are now able to touch materials that would indiscriminately kill others for touching it and passive magical detection systems can no longer detect you."
865,,200,Mindful,Magi: The Adventure of Sinbad,Benevolence,"As a certain future king may someday discover, there’s only one thing worse than being responsible for the deaths of your loved ones: Causing their deaths while your mind isn’t your own, your actions dictated by the magics of another. Fortunately, though, you have a pretty strong resistance against magical powers that addle, influence, and control the mind. Though it’s not total immunity, it’d take a seriously powerful effect to overcome your defences, approximately equivalent to a Djinn’s extreme magic being used against you. This protection also applies to similar mind control powers from other settings, such as those based on psionics instead of magic."
866,,200,Divine Intervention ,Magi: Alma Torran,Benevolence,"As a whole, Ill Ilah isn’t the kind of god that regularly interferes in the lives of its creations. Indeed, it’s debatable whether it’s even a conscious being or, as Solomon postulated, a mere lump of unfathomable power without will. The latter would definitely go a long way to explaining the literal gaps in reality in the world it created. However, it did intervene just once, descending from the heavens to save mankind from extinction, erasing the ogres who threatened them and granting the surviving humans the power of magic. It has never intervened again, but if it were to, it would be on your behalf.

For some reason, gods and other higher powers seem to be much more receptive to your requests for aid, and so are much more likely than before to heed your prayers. The smaller in scale or easier your prayers are to grant, the more likely they will be to answer them. A simple prayer for rain would almost certainly be granted, whereas something more powerful like destroying an entire army would be much less likely to be granted. It’s worth noting, though, that you’d have much better chances than almost anyone else, and those chances would likely rise significantly if you were to offer the god something in return, such as a sacrifice or favour."
867,,200,Bounced Off The Boundary,BlazBlue: Phase Zero,Benevolence,"The Boundary is a horrible thing to muck with. Messing with time - or dimensional borders - while not always destined to failures, does tend to have disastrous consequences. If the Black Beast proves anything, it’s exactly how bad an idea doing so really is. Regardless, you have a truly ludicrous ability to survive the fallout of doing so. So long as whatever space/time anomaly you’re facing isn’t an actual attack that’s being aimed at you, you’ll survive it. Yes, that includes getting sucked into a black hole and spat out somewhere else. Probably somewhen else as well."
868,,200,Around the Corner,Campione,Benevolence,"Good ol’ luck. Not the Irish one, but the real deal. You got the Devil’s luck. Enough to win the lottery as many times as you play it, no matter how improbable that is. You always get the best numbers and so long as something is a matter of chance, consider it good as won. The same luck applies to your everyday life, encountering artifacts or befriending those that will help you out in the future. Really, the only people in this world as lucky as you are the Campiones and those with the inborn talent to become one."
869,,200,Code Casting,Fate/Extella,Benevolence ,"You were always a deft hand at wizardry, the art of hacking the virtual world around you in the
Moon Cell, and you’ve not lost the touch you had back in the old Grail Wars. It’s made you both a
genius hacker with any electronics or computers but also a competent hand with a variety of Code
Casts. The equivalent of spells used by Masters and humans of the modern era, the Code Casts you
know allow for decent buffs to the strength and speed of your Servants or giving them advantages
against certain types of enemies, teleporting them across a battlefield or healing most of their
wounds. In effect, you have a range of low to medium strength Code Casts. Unlike normal, due to
these being personally cast instead of through Mystic Codes, your Code Casts work similar to the
Active Skills of a Servant. They can be cast without cost to yourself but have short cooldowns
depending on their strength. A minor heal code might only be usable every 30 seconds, while a
powerful all-rounder buff could take three minutes to recharge. Learning more Code Casts will take
personal practice, though using Mystic Codes as reference will be enormously helpful."
870,,200,General Position,Fate/Extella,Benevolence ,"A Master’s role is not to fight but not everyone acknowledges that rule. Why face a powerful, united
team when you can cut down the Master and send them into disarray? Thankfully you have some
protections of your own if you play to the role. As long as you remain the strategist and supporter to
others, enemies will find it far more difficult to harm you on the field of battle. Powerful shields will
automatically appear that can take numerous attacks from even powerful Servants. A determined
enough foe can eventually batter through, if they have a few minutes to spare, but doing so signals
to all those fighting for you that you are in danger, where you are and who is currently attacking you. "
871,,200,Buy Up,Fate/Extella,Benevolence ,"Not all Servants are equal and this only becomes more apparent as time goes by, favoured or
bloodthirsty Servants progressing far more via fighting more often. But ways become available to
bring the rest of your allies up to par. Taking this will cause a special kind of resource, QP, to be
generated as your or those you directly command defeat enemies. QP will gather within you and
allow you to instantly raise the power and skill of yourself or your other allies, requiring more QP the greater the increase. At first, this is only a general increase in overall power but in time, you may find
ways to focus it into specific things such as skills or shared powers. It also has an important limit, that the most you can raise anything with QP is to the highest limit that you or someone directly
working for you as an ally has. You cannot increase your lesser used Servants power beyond that of
your best Servant or yourself, whichever is higher. The same applies to more specific tasks. "
872,,200,Link Mode,Fate/Extella,Benevolence ,"A unique connection that appears between allied Servants in the Moon Cell’s reality, expanded to any ally you fight alongside now. When fighting close by another on your side, a line of intangible energy forms between you and up to three other allies. This allows you to naturally share passive abilities and buffs between each other, all benefiting as the original holder does while close to each other. Teamwork becomes natural and intuitive, even without prior training, and combination attacks can be easily performed with no planning or preparation. Such moves exhibit much greater power than normal. A Link state can only be maintained in the short range, no more than ten or twenty meters at maximum, and only while in the heat of battle. "
873,,200,The Hero Lives On,Fate/Extra CCC,Benevolence,"Servants aren’t merely summoned spirits. They are echoes and remnants of great heroes and villains of the past (usually), and what else is the past better for than for inheriting wisdom and power from? You may or may not agree with such logic, but at least you can prove it. With this purchase, you are able to pass on any of your abilities, artifacts, or resources. A Noble Phantasm can be inherited by a Master, and it’ll belong to them from that moment onwards, with everything that implies. You could pass on Skills too, perhaps even raw might if you wish. And, of course, you are giving up what you give away. If you gift your Noble Phantasm to your Master for their protection, you will no longer have it, and you can’t take it back without their consent, as it will belong to them. So do be careful with what you gift. Items will be attached to the recipient in the same way they were attached to you, and while they won’t inherit any experience with abilities and powers, they won’t find them difficult to use. You can also use this with perks or items. What will your legacy be?"
874,,200,Nectar of Immortality,Fate/Legends - Nirvana Yuga,Benevolence ,"A drink for demons, corrupt and glorious in all their might. A sweet nectar stolen from a divine
source that had a special interaction with your demonic body. Not only was it the cause of your now
eternally youthful form, it granted a special protection to you. An inability for you to be truly killed
by anything but a human. No matter their power, destiny will see it that any who are not humans
cannot confirm your death. They can hurt you as they like, seal you away, reduce your body to a
pound of quivering meat. And if a god were to incarnate as a human or inhabit ones’ body while
granting them their power, that too would fit the requirement. But otherwise, you’ll be ably posing
as the demon king that only the human hero can defeat."
875,,200,Victory Rebellion Queen,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Benevolence ,"Rebellion is in your very soul, fires of freedom that ignite the hearts of those around you. There’s no
need for a strong leader or organised army, not when you can easily fan even mild discontent into
small but violent uprisings. An actually tyrannical regime kicking down on a people? Revolts can
begin within just hours of you starting to spread your message, your words having effect on towns
many miles away. Provided you can find a shared target, you’re also able to direct the shared hatred
of humans and non-humans like fairies or the divine against one target, getting them work together
for their freedom without the usual antagonism. Yourself, and those affected by your incendiary
speeches, gain bonuses against those you hate and feel the need to rebel against, particularly
tyrants or other genuine oppressors. Your blows strike with greater strength, force of numbers can
overcome much higher quality troops and even magic grows stronger. Whether you get a chance to
find out personally or not, this bonus is most potent against anyone related to the Romans or
Italians, potentially allowing even an uncoordinated horde of wildmen to defeat a great Roman army. "
876,,200,Sand Man,Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Benevolence ,"The deserts that the Hashashin made their homes in and spent most of their lives working in are
unforgiving places. The natural terrain alone is among the more hostile environments in the world
but when it is filled with spirits, monsters and magical hazards of all different kinds, it becomes like a
hell on earth for anyone that needs to travel through it. The Hashashin built up a great many charms
and rituals to allow them to pass through, many of which are now imprinted on your body. These
charms grant you with an almost insurmountable resistance to the dangers of the wind, the heat and
the sun. Even a hurricane concentrated into a single beam against you would not even make your
hair flutter if you wished otherwise, only the hottest of magical flames burn you and harmful
amounts of light simply bounce around your body instead of striking you.

Elementals and similar beings linked to these elements find that they take much more damage than
normal from you, while they can sense that you are a being that could harm them badly. The charms
in your body also largely remove the need for food or water from you, leaving you to need such
sustenance only once a week at most. To pair with these charms is an extensive knowledge of how
to survive in the desert even long term."
877,,200,Saint War Order,Fate/Legends - Vive la France,Benevolence ,"The power of belief cannot be underestimated, not in the true zealots. The strength of your faith is true and real in a way few can claim, turning to physical power in your muscles and bones. Minor belief makes little difference but true zealotry or fanaticism can see an ordinary teenage girl crush heavy stone walls beneath her hands or slay armored men in a single swing. Much like the concept of faith itself, this boost can be shared. You are able to force a flash of intense faith and fervour in you and your allies, greatly increasing all physical parameters but driving you all into a violent religious frenzy against the foe. It can also be used on a lesser level to call on images of what you believe in to appear in the air, bolstering your will and self-control or reminding yourself and others of the true beliefs you all hold. It can even break a madman out of his insanity, for a brief moment, should the right symbol of faith be shown to him."
878,,200,Logistilla’s Tome,Fate/Legends - Vive la France,Benevolence ,"A leather bound tome, given to you by a powerful witch that you once aided. Or just stolen from
someone else who helped her. The book gives a powerful passive ability to the holder, rendering
them immune to most forms of magic below a certain level of power. A blast that could tear through
a row of houses could break your magic resistance but magic of less power won’t touch you. Actually
reading from the tome will allow you to summon a shield to block magic or send out a blast in all
directions that tears apart magic, both effects working on any magic short of a Reality Marble or
similar extremely high class magical effect. Even some creature from the Age of Gods should fear
you when you remember to read your special book. The witch who wrote the book also filled it with
some entertaining stories from her past and a range of notes on various magical beings."
879,,200,Huff and Puff,Angel Notes,Benevolence ,"The A Rays were made to survive the air and land of the new world. They can breathe in the toxic
grain and survive on food that should leave any normal human dead, from grain or from ultra- concentrated calorie counts. You didn’t stop evolving like that and soon enough, you found that you
just aren’t harmed by things that you eat or breathe in. Even the most poisonous of inhaled gases
won’t harm you, though skin contact ones still would and the most rotting, dangerous of foods won’t
give you so much as an upset stomach, though living beings that you swallow could attack you from
the inside out even still."
880,,200,Puppet Limb ,Kara no Kyokai,Benevolence,"A high class prosthetic made through magecraft. At first glance, it appears to be no different than your normal arm, a function of a disguise spell. The arm acts for all purposes as your own, though it’s more flexible than a normal human limb and can interact with the intangible as if it were fully solid. While only somewhat stronger than your normal limbs, the arm is very durable and even being sat on by an elephant wouldn’t harm it. Several secret compartments big enough to hide a small knife are in the arm and the arm is even able to extend greatly in the form of a telekinetic projection, grabbing onto things from up to ten meters away. You can have the limb already installed in place of one of your own or as an extra. When it gets broken, you’ll be sent another a few days later, sometimes even a little stronger than before. 
"
881,,200,Śarīra ,Kara no Kyokai,Benevolence,"Within one of your arms, the remains of a holy buddhist monk have been interred, fused to the physical form within. It makes the arm in question into a holy object, a force of significant power against unholy creatures of the night and even weakening weaker beings of such a nature by presence. It’s presence in your body also grants a greater resistance to death, making it significantly more difficult for death effects to be applied to you. While you take damage and injuries as normal, it makes you appear quite a lot more enduring than a normal human, and abilities like the Mystic Eyes of Death Perception would require prolonged focus to see your lines of death.
"
882,,200,Starborn ,Cultist Simulator,Benevolence,"There are dark and malevolent forces out here, jumper, and fighting the occult arts is bound to spoil one or two forbidden secrets that would destroy lesser minds. Lucky for you, your ability to pursue the truth is now unimpaired by the shackles of human nature. Through this perk you can learn any type of mystery, truth, or knowledge, without risking your wellbeing. This even expands to the realm of memetic, cognito and infohazards. No experience can unnerve you, no knowledge can break you, and no truth can unravel your soul.
"
883,,200,Stained Gloves ,Cultist Simulator,Benevolence,"A pair of black gloves. When worn, the hands behave with surgical precision, as if a lifetime of practice had descended upon them."
884,,200,Cinnabar Amulet ,Cultist Simulator,Benevolence,"A scarlet amulet that glows dimly with phosphorescent light. When worn, the body is never hot or cold, and always retains its temperature perfectly.
"
885,,200,Paradoxical Curio ,Cultist Simulator,Benevolence,"A reality bending trinket that represents the many Secret Histories. This curio only bends in bizarre ways when in the presence of supernatural danger.
"
886,,200,Dark​ ​Badge​ ​,Sailor Moon,Benevolence,"With this badge, you can grab decently-powered energy beams or charged objects and throw them back at the person who shot them. You’re going to have to get shot with something bigger if they want to take you down. You’re not getting shot today. Not at all. You cannot grab energy beams of an energy that are poisonous to you in some way, like a purifying beam.
"
887,,200,Revivification​ ​,Sailor Moon,Benevolence,"Your talent with energy manipulation has given you the power to snatch those from death, even if only temporarily. By feeding energy into a recuperating or lifeless body, you can either animate it or accelerate its reawakening. Someone who might take three days to recover from their injuries can be brought back in a matter of hours via a constant flow of energy, for instance. But toeing the line between life and death requires a price. To animate one lifeless body for a day through this method requires the use of energy from multiple people.
"
888,,200,Fountain of Youth - Boosted,DC Occult,Benevolence,"For another 200 CP (before discounts), it will also act similarly to a Lazarus pit, allowing it to even go so far as to revive the dead. (CG Note: Requires base Fountain of Youth - DC Occult first.)"
889,,200,Blood Ward ,DC Occult,Benevolence,"Your supernatural parent probably isn’t the kind you want rocking up to parent teacher interviews, but they may still want to take an interest in your life - no matter how much you wish they wouldn’t. This charm, perhaps a necklace, ring, watch, or similar thing provides a measure of protection from your own progenitors. While limited in scope, should any ancestors or other relations seek to use their familial bond against you using supernatural means they will find it much harder to do so, needing to exert far greater effort to overcome your defences, and almost certainly giving you enough warning time to do something about it.
"
890,,200,Song-Maiden ,Valkyrie Profile,Benevolence,"You were born with a beautiful voice and an amazing talent for song. Other people picked up on this, and all your life you've received formal training to enhance your singing even further, and turn it to more nefarious purposes. When used on the field of battle, your songs can fill soldiers with vast amounts of courage, hope and a will to fight, clearing them of any concerns like surrender, retreat, or hesitation and ensuring they'll fight to the death for your cause or the cause of your superiors as long as you continue to sing. Your voice alone can turn the very tide of battle. Restrained and judicious use can mitigate the downsides to this and be used heroically, but abuse will see you reviled as a witch or a monster for all the senseless death you cause.
"
891,,200,Never Get Drunk​ ,The Gods Are Bastards,Benevolence,"Sometimes you end up pissing off a goddess. Sometimes, it’s one of your ancestors who do so, by taking a leak over one of their shrines while dead drunk. Oftentimes, this results in a very thorough smiting. Fortunately, your ancestor got away with a bloodline curse; one that you inherited. Even more fortunately, you seem to have only inherited the incidental benefits. No matter how much you drink, you’ll never get drunk, which oddly enough, translates into an immunity to poisons and drugs of all types, even magical or alchemical ones.
"
892,,200,Luck ,Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline,Benevolence,"Do you want to live a carefree life?​ Fate seems to continually smile on you...it’s no coincidence, as your magic actually makes you just a little bit more lucky. You duck out of the way of lethal attacks more often, you find clues by accident just a little more, and so on. This doesn’t make you invincible, however, for even with magic luck is rather flimsy and random - it will just tilt in your favor a little more often. This is a passive effect without an energy drain.
"
893,,200,Empty Space ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Benevolence,"There’s an empty space in your mind that you can use to avoid forms of brainwashing or mental magic. Simply by retreating back into that space you can circumvent attempts to artificially alter your mind.
"
894,,200,Talisman of Rendar ,Warhammer Fantasy: Amazons,Benevolence,"A small talisman worn around the neck, carved with the image of the Goddess Rigg. This talisman acts as a magical shield, warding away weak blows and projectiles from the wearer and slightly weakening the attacks strong enough to get through its protection. Against fire however, it becomes much more powerful, rendering the wearer immune to all but the hottest of flames, the sort that can melt metal and stone in an instant.
"
895,,200,Raised by the Faeries ,Warhammer Fantasy: Bretonnia,Benevolence,"Just as you yourself were taught by your elders, you were often given the role of teaching those young children taken by the Fey to the realm of the Lady. You took quite a shine to the task, becoming an excellent teacher of any subject that you knew, though you did your best work with teaching others how to bring out and master their magical powers. You also noted that when you were far away from civilization and isolated, any of your students learnt even faster. It seems that the deeper you and your students are into the wilds of nature, the better and faster they learn from you."
896,,200,Barding ,Warhammer Fantasy: Bretonnia,Benevolence,"Just as a Knight has his plated armour, so too will his horse be gifted with their own set of metal barding. The set you have obtained is a particularly notable one, as it has been magically enchanted to fit itself perfectly to any mount of any size, horse or not, though the barding itself will remain that of thick steel without intervention from yourself. The armour will not slow any mount however and can even grow to cover the wings of a Pegasus or similar creatures without hindering their mobility.
"
897,,200,Dragon’s Claw ,Warhammer Fantasy: Bretonnia,Benevolence,"The dismembered claw of a terrible dragon known as Malgrimace, it has been enchanted and imbued by many Damsels of the Lady. The powers of this Claw are similar to that of the original dragon, protecting its wielder from any form of fire attack. Normal fire, the breath of a dragon, the spell fire from the Lore of Fire or even warp fire, it is all rendered as harmless as a summer breeze to the holder of the Dragon’s Claw.
"
898,,200,Royal Light ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Benevolence,"Though the Kingdom of Panthalassa has fallen into darkness, they were once the greatest heroes of the world, and a fragment of their light remains in their descendants. By activating a sigil of the royal crest on your forehead, you can summon a powerful light that attempts to repel and attack anything threatening you, though it can be overpowered by enough force. With enough work, the light can also shield companions nearby. However, at first you can only activate your defense unconsciously, and at the cost of potentially paralyzing headaches, so you’ll have to work to master your race’s power. Moreover, the light comes from your soul and thereby significantly drains your energy reserves. As a result, it is difficult to maintain the light for extended durations without severely draining your internal energy reserves, at least initially. Also, its defensive properties generally apply only to magical powers, though physical or elemental attacks powered by magic also qualify.
"
899,,200,No Limiter Can Hold Me ,Lyrical Nanoha,Benevolence,"You’re not the type to follow the rules, are you? It seems that attempts from an ally organization or someone you’re working for to limit your powers or magic in any capacity just don’t seem to take - limiters malfunction, shock collars short out and stop working, and so on. You also tend to get away with ‘cowboy cop’ moments or defying orders more often, so long as you act in the spirit of the organization you’re part of. Just try not to get yourself hurt...
"
900,,200,Boost System ,Lyrical Nanoha,Benevolence,"Boost Magic is a somewhat unusual type of magic that has only appeared in recent years, and designed to be used with specialized Boost Devices, which generally take the shape of gloves with glass domes on the back of their hands. Boost Magic is used to boost the parameters of another mage using the caster’s own energy, generally by layering a field or barrier over their target, essentially adding to their Barrier Jacket or just contributing the energy directly to the relevant system on the Device.

You don’t have to give up your Device’s normal form with this option, but you will gain the signature gloves, and be able to use them to direct your spells, with healing and boost spells gaining some potency – presuming they are spells you can deliver by touch or fist. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)"
901,,200,Silver Millennium Lining ,Generic MG,Benevolence,"Where others see unmitigated disaster, you see hope. You can find the good in any situation, the ray of light in darkness. You are more cheerful and harder to afflict with despair, sadness, or terror.

In addition, regardless of what kind of mental afflictions you do have, you can always overcome them and make a full recovery given time.
"
902,,200,Acquired Poison Immunity ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Benevolence,"Magic here requires a great deal of common ingredients, but many of these are often strongly poisonous. Many a witch will end up suffering a sickly constitution and long-term health issues simply from chronic exposure to dangerous chemicals. Fortunately, you’ve managed to accidentally (or not) poison yourself so many times you’ve built up an immunity to poison. Note this only works on poisons you can build a resistance to by regularly dosing yourself, some (such as arsenic or mercury) you cannot build resistance to no matter how many times you accidentally poison yourself, and thus this perk will not protect you against them. Still, you can chow down on as much narcissus or death cap mushrooms as you wish! But please remember that not everyone shares your immunity before you start working them into dishes.
"
903,,200,Gensokyo’s Computers ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Benevolence,"You can turn consenting beings into shikigami. They become increasingly stronger the more they act in concert with your will, though they do not gain new powers and only become stronger with their existing abilities. Shikigami are weak to water and getting hit with water causes them to short out, reverting them back into the base creature temporarily. They also almost invariably are excellent at mathematical equations.
"
904,,200,Hidden Kisses ,Peter Pan,Benevolence,"Everyone has their own childhood loves when they are young, often linking with the imaginary and fantastical, but they are rarely if ever fulfilled. Once you grow up, the hidden kiss remains on the right-hand corner of your mouth. Though its inner magic weakens after your first kiss, it stays on you, and can only come free if given to someone you can genuinely and openly share your innermost childhood wishes with. With this ability, you can ""steal"" the hidden kiss of a target. The theft requires building up an emotional connection with the holder, such that his or her hold loosens enough for you to snag it; fortunately, you have a charismatic nature that can melt the hearts of most people (even a fierce warrior or man-killing monster), though the exact way they react to their growing passion for you varies. Each hidden kiss you hold yourself increases your own childish innocence, making you more adventurous and less susceptible to corruption. However, if you hold onto and strengthen the ties you made to obtain the hidden kiss, you can form a deep bond with the former owner, the kind that is generally found only with soulmates. Moreover, by willingly giving a hidden kiss to someone, you grant that magical wonder to him or her; such a miracle could restore someone from the worst of corruption, or even bring the recipient back to life; however, in the latter case it would only work if the deceased one’s body is still physically present and “warm,” with the deadline at most being 24 hours.
"
905,,200,By Hook or Crook ,Peter Pan,Benevolence,"If either of your hands is ever removed from your body, you may instantly and bloodlessly replace it with any small tool or weapon (even a magical one) of your choice. Whatever you choose, it is further enhanced with moderate water magic that you can unleash on foes. If the tool-hand is cut off again, you can instantly will the tool back to your stump and reconnect it. When you wish, your regular hand will regenerate, and you can switch between your regular hand and the tool at will. In addition, each new jump you have the option of selecting a new tool when your hand/tool is removed from your body again; you can switch between any of the tools you have used as a replacement and your true hand at will. Any tool or weapon in your possession is selectable under the perk.
"
906,,200,Blank Rose ,Ib,Benevolence,"A white-colored rose. Whenever you give it to a person, the holder can bond with it in a manner similar to Rose ~ Embodiment of Spirit. The rose will accordingly shift to a color that reflects the user’s soul, and allow him or her to exist normally in realities that would normally alter or reject their existence. When the holder lets go of the rose for more than one day or chooses to relinquish control, though, the rose returns to its blank state and the former user loses the protection granted by the rose. However, until the time limit runs out, the person who was given the rose can automatically summon the rose back to himself or herself at will, as long as they have not relinquished their use of the rose back to you.
"
907,,200,Fungus Beer ,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Benevolence,"Made from basically any mushrooms the greenskin in question can find (and possibly catch) this fermented brew is best served in wooden mugs the size of buckets, because metal mugs would just corrode. The effects vary from person to person, but generally the imbiber is struck with an overwhelming sense of invulnerability and incredible fighting prowess, as well as being so drunk they can barely see, stand, talk or even crawl. While most of the benefits are dubious, it does render the drinker almost totally immune to mental manipulation, be it from spells or other abilities. Anyone who tries will find themselves projectile vomiting so hard meals they ate last year will see the light of day again.
"
908,,200,Hatter’s Hat ,Wonderland No More,Benevolence,"A fashionable piece of headgear that is suitable for practically every occasion. Wearing it magically boosts your charisma and increases protection to your head (also, if a blow to your head fails to overcome the armor enhancement, the hat will protect you 100%, preventing the blow from having any effects at all on your head). You can alternatively choose a hat or other headgear you already own to receive the benefits of this purchase.
"
909,,200,Gromril Chain Shirt ,Warhammer Fantasy: Halflings,Benevolence,"Rare is it that the Dwarves of the Karaks will give something freely to another. Rarer still is it that they would give a gift of gromril, such a prized metal treasured and valued more closely to the dwarven heart than even their own life. And yet like one Gabbo Flugbend, halfling adventurer and hero of numerous fields of battle, you have been gifted just such a treasure: A gromril chainmail shirt. Such armor is denser and tougher than anything that could be made by human hands, durable enough to push back against enchanted greenskin- and skaven-made weaponry; And from the dwarven rune-smithing that went into crafting it, all but powerful magicks like that of a Wizard Patriarch of Altdorf will bounce against it. Wear it well, treasure it. Such a gift does not come lightly.
"
910,,200,Shield of the Mirror Pool ,Warhammer Fantasy: Lizardmen,Benevolence,"A dark, reflective shield which ripples when struck. Not only does it defend against physical strikes better than any mundane shield could but any spell that hits the shield directly will harmlessly bounce off.
"
911,,200,Lucky Shrunken Head ,Warhammer Fantasy: Orcs & Goblins,Benevolence,"Small and gruesomely shriveled, like some over ripe fruit, only a powerful enemy could be turned into a shrunken head. However there are few charms so potent. By carrying this charm, usually by having it tied or mounted somehow to a weapon or bit of armor, a powerful ward will bless those who mark themselves with warpaint among your armies and those superstitious like the Savage Orcs are even more blessed.
"
912,,200,Pyromania ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Benevolence,"Do you feel that? The Red Wind is passion, it is raw emotion, it is such a wonderful feeling to just let it all out. Bright Wizards have something of a reputation for pyromania, for good reason. While in your case it will never become a true addiction, you will now find casting fire magic an excellent way to lift your spirits. A simple fireball might relieve your tension and provide a savory adrenaline rush all at once, and even lighting a tiny flame may soothe the chilling fear gripping you. Fire warms the body - why should it not warm the heart?
"
913,,200,Light in the Darkness ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Benevolence,"The light you wield is more than just a sword or shield against the darkness. Your battle is for the souls of mankind as much as it is for their lands. For those tempted towards evil by their own fear, pain, or loss, you may be the last hope of their seeing the light. In your immediate presence, the light of Hysh drives out despair in all those you do not see as enemies. This will not protect them from dark magic on its own, but you can at least drive back the darkness threatening their hearts.
"
914,,200,Amulet of Enchanted Jade ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Benevolence,"Though not necessarily created by your Order, this item is likely a product of Ghyran. A pendant carved from jade and ensorcelled such as to grant the wearer swift regeneration (though not enough to regrow limbs and such) is certainly something a Jade Wizard might wish to have on hand, when his or her own spells are diminished in the dead of winter. So it is that one has found its way into your hands.
"
915,,200,Appetite for Dust ,Endless Legend,Benevolence,"A blessing and a bane, you no longer require food, water, and you do not age. However, you do not heal naturally either, and MUST sustain yourself on Dust. The upside to this requirement is that Dust not only sustains you, but also heals you near instantly. You may also find some less savory ways to feed your Dust fix... The stronger the Broken Lord, the more Dust it takes to mend their body fully. The average Broken Lord can be pulled back from Death's door with 50 Dust. A hero of Legend? It could take several hundred. But then again, said hero is as durable as 10 lesser Lords, so it's a toss up. Magical healing affects you normally.
"
916,,200,Tier 3 Insignia ,Endless Legend,Benevolence,"Reserved only for legendary heroes (Like you) these expensive and hard to acquire inisignia provide a minor buff to anyone under your command within a mile of you. All buffs are the same as the Ring+Talisman, only provide a quarter the bonus.

Hyperium​: Time twists and bends on the field of battle. Your allies move just a little faster, while their foes move just a little slower. Maybe a point second here, two points there, but in the heat of battle, every second counts.

Mithrite​: Your warriors are... bigger. Stronger. More aggressive, and more ready to fight for you. Everything about them is just... better than it was before they joined you. It is not a huge difference, but on an even field of battle, you will certainly come out ahead.
"
917,,200,Blockade Bloodline ,Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past,Benevolence,"According to one of the four tales, the seven Maidens to whom the seal on the Dark World is anchored possess a unique defensive measure. When threatened, they can turn into a small crystal about the size of an apple. While in this form they become stupidly resistant to functionally everything, the transformative miasma of the Dark World, Agahnim’s mind magics, attempts to drain their magic, or even to simply kill them. In exchange, they have absolutely no offensive capabilities in this form. They can cast no magic, can’t talk, or even move under their own power - thought they can float in place. Exiting this form is a slow task, and is extremely draining. Alternately, someone else with a touch of holy light could free you in an instant - another Sage or Maiden, or perhaps the wielder of the Master Sword."
918,,200,The Jar’s Bargain ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventure,Benevolence,"While the Fairies of Hyrule are by far kinder than those you would find in other lands, there are still moments when the similarities between them can be seen. Catching a lesser Fae and promising to return it's freedom in exchange for a favor is an old favorite of the Hero's, though given that he's considered to be favored by the goddess that created the Fae... Well, I've gotten off track. Nine times out of ten, that favor comes in the form of healing, something you are now capable of doing. Give even a few moments of effort, you could heal a man on the verge of death to full health and even remove illness should they suffer from any. As a small addition, your magics are slightly more effective that you are in debt to, allowing you to raise the very recently deceased should your contractor fall in battle.
"
919,,200,The Blue Depths ,Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,Benevolence,"Either by a blessing from the Zora or a series of experiments with mystical potions, you are no longer in danger of drowning - you can spend hours underwater without needing to take a gulp of air...useful, especially if you expect to spend a long time in Lake Hylia."
920,,200,Power Bracelet ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages,Benevolence,"The Power Bracelets are a pair of thin gold bands with a marking of the Triforce on them. As one might expect, they enhance your power - that is to say, your lifting strength. With proper usage, one can lift up and throw heavy boulders, statues, small trees, even some enemies. Alongside these bands comes a Green Holy Ring, which grants you immunity to electricity and electrical attacks so long as you are wearing it. Now nothing is safe from your mighty muscles!
"
921,,200,Sky Armor ,Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword,Benevolence,"What, you didn’t think the clothes that the Knights and Recruits wear is entirely for show did you? Sorry, but it’s just not so. This outfit is heavily enchanted, though mostly in breadth of options and not the depth of their ability. Resistant to the wind and the rain, using a fragment of air magic to ensure you can actually breath at such high altitudes, preventing the sheer speed of the fancier maneuvers from knocking you unconscious. I’d call it a flight suit, but it’s also a decently protective suit of armor. Not to mention decently stylish.
"
922,,200,Alchemy Stone ,Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks,Benevolence,"Another piece of treasure, almost as rare as the Regal Ring from earlier. However, unlike the ring, this golden hued hunk of crystal actually has a use. You see, it’s rumoured that this artifact brings great riches to its owner - and for you, it seems to be true. Rupee’s show up more often, merchants will charge you less and give you more, ancient treasure chests untouched for hundreds of years will spontaneously refill themselves just in time for you to double check if you got everything or not. ...Mind you, this is only a handful of green rupees each time, maybe a red or a blue, but it applies to almost everything.
"
923,,200,Purple Potion ,Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks,Benevolence,"This particular brew is a bit more powerful than the Red Potion, but it's primary use isn't simply to restore your health. Instead, this potion has a delayed effect which is catalysed by you taking an extreme amount of damage. Basically, if you 'die', then this potion activates and gives you eight hearts back. Keep in mind this isn't a 1up - if you get ripped limb from limb or worse? This potion is good, but not that good. Since Hyrule no longer has durable bottles, you get a refill of this once every two weeks."
924,,200,A Bag Full of Kinstones,Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap,Benevolence,"A bag that holds a great many Kinstones of varying patterns and colors. It slowly refills when you use a Kinstone in a fusion, it takes about a week to recover a single stone. Comes with twenty Kinstones in the bag.
"
925,,200,Lucky Charm ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Benevolence,"A pretty simple Talisman, enchanted to give whoever holds it a little extra good fortune. Won’t save you from certain death, but should give you a much needed edge at times. Can take any form you want."
926,,200,Northern Strength ,The Elder Scrolls,Benevolence,"Giants are some of the most physically imposing creatures on Tamriel, able to toss around the smaller races like dolls. You possess this strength, as well as their thick skin, which is as durable as hardened leather and offers a decent amount of magic resistance."
927,,200,Gauldur Amulet ,The Elder Scrolls,Benevolence,"A powerful amulet crafted by Archmage Gauldur and stolen by his three sons, the Gauldur amulet is a useful asset to anyone. It greatly enhances the health, magicka, and stamina of the wearer."
928,,200,Blade of Woe ,The Elder Scrolls,Benevolence,"One of the most popular artifacts of the Dark Brotherhood, this enchanted ebony dagger is perfect for an assassin. Any damage you deal with this blade is used to heal yourself."
929,,200,The Support ,Genshin Impact,Benevolence,"Who says that only the gentle elements can be used for healing? Each type of element has its ways of helping people, and you know this better than most. However destructive or shocking the elemental power you may be using, you will find that you can find ways of using it to help rather than hurt should you choose. Rather than use the power to tear down others, you are instead adept at using that same power to build up you and your allies. You could use the power of pyro to provide a healing warmth, or convert the biting cold of cryo into a soothing chill that fades the aches and pains."
930,,200,Mermaid Blood,Danmachi,Benevolence,A blood from a mermaid xenos that has the ability to heal wounds at an accelerated rate. It heals small cuts in seconds to large wounds in minutes along with the capability to reattach severed limbs. For each purchase you gain twelve bottles of this mermaid blood and receive the same amount every month allowing you to stock for emergencies or even selling them for quick cash.
931,,200,Magical Canteen ,Danmachi,Benevolence,While people can go on for a few days without food but water is a must to allow your body to operate. This canteen possesses an ability to produce water on its own and the water it produces is some of the tastiest and freshest water out there. The water also has the ability to restore the drinker’s stamina and refreshes their tired mind though it won’t restore the mind energy that you used for the magic spell but the water can be used to replace food for three days with a diminishing return until you stop substituting real food for it this water.
932,,300,Superwarrior,Grant Morrison’s 18 Days,Benevolence,"There are untold numbers of warriors in this day and age, but to be a real, proper Kshatriya means to be a Superwarrior, a being who is as much crafted as born.

All but immortal, with wisdom, beauty, and strength of arms that defies all comprehension, you stride the world as if a god, for you practically are one in this base day and age. Your strength, appearance, and mental faculties are all boosted several orders of magnitude, hundreds of times until you stand as very close to perfection, or as close as any mortal being can get without having been born in the First Age, the Satya Yuga,

You possess extreme natural aptitude for all skills that can be learnt, though naturally you gain no knowledge just from taking this blessing."
933,,300,Infernal Immunity,Touhou Luna Nights,Benevolence,"You are cannot be hurt by fire. Fire based attacks and traps will simply curve around you or short out, leaving you perfectly untouched (even by convection). You may turn this off, in case for some reason you wish to have fire affect you normally. You may instead choose another classical Chinese element if you wish, including purchasing this multiple times to cover more elements."
934,,300,Five Elements Internal Technique,Kill Six Billion Demons,Benevolence,"Using your Atum, you may attune to one of the following elements: Fire, Earth, Water, Wood, Metal. While resting for 8 hours or longer, you can choose one, and only one, of these elements. When the chosen element is used against you, you can expand the charge in order to completely ignore the attack, regardless of your strength. This ability does not stack, and can only be used once per rest."
935,,300,Sacrifices Must Be Made,Bad End Theater ,Benevolence,"It’s kind of sad to see how often the Maiden and Overlord almost get together. In one particular ending the Maiden actually sacrifices herself to protect the Overlord. If... if you have to do something like that, right? If you need to sacrifice something supremely important. Yeah, your life is an option, but also stuff like inventions you worked for years on. Magic you paid huge prices to receive. If you have to sacrifice that kind of stuff, it will succeed. Lives will be saved, fighting stops, whatever. It’s going to work out and then some. Giving other people Good Endings at the cost of your own... It's kind of poetic in a way."
936,,300,Favorite Child,Beast: The Primordial,Benevolence,"It may seem odd to outsiders why almost every Beast seems to believe the Dark Mother is real. There doesn't seem to be a whole lot of evidence for her existence since she dwells in a place not even Beasts can go without having their identities ground to nothing by the Ecstatic Winds. But for Beasts, her existence is self-evident, as is her love for the Begotten. There isn't a place a Beast can go where they do not feel her presence or hear her speaking to them. Normally, this would not extend to other worlds outside the current cosmology, but now you can bring a little bit of the darkness of this world to others. This means there is no place you can go where you cannot receive your Mother's guidance. When you've truly hit your mental limit and your determination runs dry, she'll always be there to pick you up and reinvigorate you with her love, restoring all your willpower and potentially providing some other benefit, like a new Obcasus Rite. If you’re a Hero, the Dark Mother still seems to like you for some ineffable reason. Maybe she loves you, maybe she wants to eat you, but with her, it’s probably both."
937,,300,Amulet of Justice,Gloryhammer,Benevolence,"This necklace made of pure silk cradles a pure white gemstone. By holding it aloft and concentrating, you can cause the gem to resonate with all living minds within several hundred feet. Any mind that it resonates with immediately shakes off almost all forms of mind control or corruption, returning them to their unaffected state with no ill side effects. This even works on creatures turned into revenants by the Spell of Undeath. The only known exception to this is someone stabbed by the Knife of Evil—the insidious control of that relic stubbornly resists the Amulet of Justice’s effect."
938,,300,Memories of When Time Looped,Mobius Final Fantasy,Benevolence,"Like a certain Witch(and a certain Warrior of Light to an extent) you too are immune to the normal memory loss that occurs during a time loop, and as such are capable of learning the best and most optimal ways of using the extra time you are given in between loops to your advantage. And do not worry, for your mind will never deteriorate no matter how many times time loops in on itself or how many gruesome deaths you are subjected to."
939,,300,Limitless*,Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Benevolence,"No, not the technique. You have here a perk that nullifies strain on your body and mind from overusing a technique. While it doesn't make you capable of using a technique like limitless because of how complex it is and the drain, if you were capable of using it and wished to do what Gojo does you wouldn’t have to worry about refreshing your brain from frying it with overuse. This would let you be able to use an Ignition ability in Fire Force with no risk of Tephrosis from overuse. So use domain expansion a hundred times a day if you want with no problem with your brain."
940,,300,Unsealable,Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Benevolence,You now can never be sealed. If someone attempts to do so it will fail. You also have the ability to instantly recognize when someone is attempting to seal you. You can also now resist and have an easier time breaking things that will inhibit your movements or powers. Like magic chains or ability cancelers.
941,,300,Ars Magus: Phoenix,Blazblue,Benevolence,"A noncombat Ars Magus taking the form of a pair of gloves. When the user rubs both hands together, they can create a fire of renewal that heals wounds. The process is long and painful for the user due to the heat, and almost unbearably painful for the receiver, but when it's over any and all wounds will be closed without complication, bones will knit back together, and their skin will be silky-smooth (and hairless)."
942,,300,Minor Boon,Generic D&D 5e,Benevolence,"With this you can buy one Minor Boon per purchase. You can buy this however many times you like, of course. “Minor Boon” is defined in the notes, but if it grants immunity to damage, proficiency in all skills, or similar levels of power, it is not ‘minor’."
943,,300,Armored Giant,The Seven Deadly Sins,Benevolence,You have quite a strong armor. It is incredibly durable at least above that of your own personal durability. Enough to survive otherwise lethal blows with minimum damage. It can be of any design you want as it is quite well made.
944,,300,Alien ,Fate/Grand Order Part 2,Benevolence,"You are not native to Earth. Whatever Planet you are from, and whatever ramifications this may have on your nature (not a powerup but rather a sidestep in a manner of speaking), you get one main benefit from this; you lack a concept of death, at least in the sense that the Earth understands. What this actually means is that none of your organs are essential to your survival, and that you simply need to be repaired to be ‘revived’. Essentially, you cannot die in a biological sense of the word, making you closer to machines than anything, at least in terms of continuity of self between ‘deaths’. As mentioned, all of your organs are equally unimportant to your continued survival, and as long as even the smallest cell of yours remains, you can theoretically return from any amount of harm to your body.

Of course, without some ability of regeneration or some other way to repair yourself, this might not mean much. And it doesn’t mean you can avoid diminishment if something that supports your actual powers, such as a power core/heart with the same total output per second as the sun, is removed from your body. Additionally, if your ‘brain’, or whatever you have in its place, is destroyed, that will knock you out quite thoroughly until you are repaired, or until your own regeneration manages to repair the damage. You won’t get any issues with your mind from such damage though, it’ll merely be an issue of temporarily ‘dying’.

All that said, if something manages to completely obliterate your body without leaving any trace of it behind, you’ll be completely gone should you have no countermeasures against such a situation. As a final note, should you purchase both this and the Celestial Rank, you may be a weaker subspecies of an Ultimate One, although unfortunately you can’t be a subspecies of TYPE Earth as no such being exists. Doing this may give you a window of opportunity to perhaps grow to the full strength of an Aristoteles, should you have powerful enough resources on hand.

Requires Demi-Servant(Fate/Grand Order Part 1) to Purchase"
945,,300,Kitted Out,D.Y.N. Freaks,Benevolence,"A gorgeously crafted outfit ready and waiting for you. Half suit of armour, half flamboyant and fashionable outfit, it’s layered with enough magic to be better called a battle suit. Its incredible hardy against both physical and magical damage, to the point that explosions that vaporise multiple city blocks won’t even scratch it, and it’ll transfer that protections to the rest of your body and even use a small part of your own energy to boost it to keep pace with you. The suit will allow you to fly as fast as you normally move and quite agilely too, as well as significantly boost your physical strength and speed. It looks damn good but it’s by no means subtle, what with the armour and the throbbing magical power within it."
946,,300,Absolute Void Eye,Mushoku Tensei ~ Jobless Reincarnation ~,Benevolence,"The Absolute Void Eye can create an immense, insurmountable barrier around areas. While you could hold off an army with these and prevent people from entering, the drain is significant. However if purchased here you can create an independent barrier over an object or area but the strength and duration of the barrier depends on how much energy you used to create it."
947,,300,Mutated Physiology(Gilberda),Akame ga Kill!,Benevolence,"Around the world, there are several cases of people being born with mutated physiologies despite having no special heritage that could explain such a phenomenon. In many cases, these individuals with unique mutations are considered freaks or even feared as monsters and tend to have horrible fates, such as the Oarburgh Clan's maids that were sold by their parents to a circus while they were still children.

In theory, as these mutations seem to spontaneously appear in a bloodline despite we only having two known examples, they probably aren’t restricted only to humans and can happen with Danger Beasts too. Regardless if you’re a human or a beast, you’re one of such individuals, however, the mutation you possess depends on which version of this perk you take. You can purchase both versions if you want to.

Alternatively, for 300 CP, you’ll instead possess the same mutation displayed by Gilberda. While you look exactly like any other regular human (or a regular member of whatever species you’re a member of), your muscular constitution is abnormal, with your muscles being a few times denser and more powerful that of a regular human, giving you superhuman levels of strength. Even now, without any training, your strength is already above peak human levels, allowing you to physically overpower large beasts with ease, however, this is only the beginning, as the mutation grants you an innate potential to fully unlock your brain limiters through regular training. This will allow you to eventually reach a level of brute strength (and the endurance and durability needed to properly wield this level of strength) that surpasses the physical strength possessed by the members of the Elite Seven. At this point, you would be able to easily overpower gigantic danger beasts with your bare fists alone and even demolish an entire building single-handed."
948,,300,Authority of Imperishability ,Fate/Tale Of The Beasts,Benevolence,"You have gained a special immortality that only one other has. Being crushed, burnt, thrown, even if the whole planet exploded you would still live and regenerate. However you have a weakness, you can choose what this weakness is, as long as it’s something that some people of this jump can do. For Camazotz this was remembering his past, I wonder what it will be for you?"
949,,300,Invocation of Lindzei’s Directive ,Final Fantasy XIII-3,Benevolence,"Lindzei, the Fal’Cie designated to protect Bhunivelze and his world – yet as Nova Chrysalia stands testament, it has fallen short of its duty. To call upon his simulacrum is to call for his protection, a fleeting, temporary thing. A magical barrier in the shape of a serpent’s invisible coils forms a protective barrier around a limited area. Though the wall is strong enough to repel concentrated attacks and dissipates spells entirely, the cost to maintain the invocation is extremely high."
950,,300,Invocation of Benevolent Etro ,Final Fantasy XIII-3,Benevolence,"You’d presume that if Monoculus was searching for these kinds of relics in the Dead Dunes, it’s actually a good thing that neither they nor the Order got their hands on it. While the previous notes detailed a spell to conjure a simulacrum of Atomos, this one concerns the Goddess Etro, who contributed a part of herself into every human on Nova Chrysalia.

It is possible to call forth a simulacrum of the Goddess Etro, dying yet timeless. Under her watch, your companions find themselves empowered and her life expires slowly while contributing her life force to your companions. Should an ally fall while she is present, the simulacrum will vanish, contributing all of its energy into making sure your ally hangs on."
951,,300,Vitality Star ,Devil May Cry,Benevolence,The Vital Star is a green star-shaped stone made through alchemy. You can use one of these to get yourself back up to top shape and get out of a pinch.
952,,300,Why Does This Keep Happening,Epic of Leviathan,Benevolence ,"One of the reasons that the Doom Patrol is so interesting is due to their constant tendency to encounter bizarre situations. The only good thing however is that most of these adventures seem to constantly end in them becoming stronger or acquiring some new advantages. This perk gives you the ability to share this bizarre power. You may toggle this effect on and off at will. Whenever it is enabled you will constantly run into individuals or situations which draw you into various types of plots. If you manage to deal with the situation then you will receive some sort of power boost, artifact, or another type of advantage. These boons will always be useful in some way or fit one of your desires."
953,,300,Beyond Death,Magnagothica: Maleghast,Benevolence ,"What dies in Anzenmezzaron doesn’t stay dead. For the duration of your time in this jump, if you die you’ll awaken again six days later, somewhere within the city, with the taste of the grave in your mouth - and having lost something. It won’t be big; maybe the tip of a finger, or the memory of a summer day, or maybe some of your flesh will have slightly twisted. Die too many times, and you won’t recognize what you become. Those bloodoak thorn-forests have to come from somewhere...

By default, this effect doesn’t follow you outside the City, or into subsequent jumps. If you pay 300 CP, however, it will, though if you die outside the City you’ll wake up back in Anzenmezzaron. After this jump, this will function as a 1-up."
954,,300,Piscean,Scion ,Benevolence ,"Fashioned by the Drowned Road to live perpetually in the crushing depths of the ocean, such beings are utterly immune to oceanic pressure and drowning one way or another-at least, when it is not enforced by a divine being like Tethys. The blessings of the Titan also make them prodigiously enduring and resilient to physical damage. Immune to the Water Purview from a lesser divine being, the Earth and Fire Purviews can crush the flesh of Piscean beings with aplomb."
955,,300,Deuogdonio ,Scion ,Benevolence ,"If Samsara represents the struggle to free oneself from Fate, in many ways this Purview represents embracing it. Just as the ancient Gallic lords surrounded themselves with clansmen who entrusted their lives to their lord, this Purview celebrates the bond between god and man. Practitioners of this purview develop a mild resistance to Fate-based effects such as Fatebinding and even Magic itself. At low levels, this enables the transfer of Legend to mortals granting them greater resistance to mystic effects and prowess, or amours a mortal Fatebound to the practitioner lightly in mystical armour against all ills. At higher levels this may confer divine traits to mortals, expend some of the practitioner’s own vitality to save a mortal from death by injury and strengthen or weaken the bonds of Fate. At the highest levels this immersion into Fate extends to cutting some or all of their Fatebindings, negating the supernatural deference the Scion may inspire in mortals and forever free a mortal from the effects of Fate entirely at great cost i.e. a rank of Legend to tear the grand tapestry of Fate asunder and recompose the weave. Without that mortal in it, that is. While this power can also be used to sunder effects from the Magic Purview, be wary that a mistake risks annihilating both Scion and mortal from Fate for all eternity-such that even the gods would not remember them."
956,,300,Civitas,Scion ,Benevolence ,"This unique purview was created during the fires of war, as a necessity to share resources among their followers. At low levels, Scions may transfer small amounts of health from themselves to others and instantly share ammo to nearby allies. At higher levels, demigods can share their speed, strength or other attributes to their allies-including their innate capacity for defence. At the highest levels, gods may advantageously distribute injuries across an entire group, and even create a subconscious psychic network for a squad that enables intuitive and discrete cooperation as well as the sharing of divinely empowered attributes by different individuals."
957,,300,Útan Urd,Germanic/Norse Mythology,Benevolence ,"Urd, destiny, is not an absolute thing in the old myths. However, neither is free will. It is possible to alter the course of its flow in minor ways to avert or change events along the way but the nearer things get to the end the stronger and faster that flow becomes until eventually it becomes a fall. Though lives may be extended, this cannot be continued forever; it is a truth that the present must return to the past in order to begin anew, so to go against one's final end is akin to going directly against the full force torrent of destiny and history as it returns everything to the beginning.

Your true nature makes you an exception to this. You walk above the currents of Urd and so while you can follow it if you so choose you are unimpeded by it's flow; if you were unlucky enough to come across your ordained final end you would find yourself the one being with the absolute free will to change it.

For 300cp you can keep this advantage in future jumps and have also gained the gift of immortality, unaging and distant to the shores of time and death. You will not age, and are beyond the worry of disease or banal and mundane ailments. If the universe came crashing down to begin anew, you will find yourself standing upon its shores."
958,,300,I Feel Like I’m Going to Suffer an Unexpected Financial Loss Today!,Cultivation Chat Group,Benevolence ,"Sometimes your life is the only thing left when you have no money. Fortunately for you, whenever you spend your life, or any other valuable limited resource, you tend to be repaid for your efforts.

Whenever you make a true sacrifice - whether it’s of treasure, health, or even your life - the sacrifice will bring you corresponding benefits. Maybe your actions will earn you a favor from a powerful faction, get you into the good graces of a true powerhouse, help you create a potent artifact, or something similar."
959,,300,Resonant Iron Body ,Cradle V1,Benevolence ,"An iron body that absorbs, traps, and remember force madra one encounters. They seek out raging waterfalls, crushing depths, fierce storms and bone shaking earthquakes all to add to the ever-growing stockpile of force aura thrumming within their bodies."
960,,300,The Crimson Furnace Iron Body,Cradle V1,Benevolence ,"This Iron body involves stuffing yourself to bursting and then using life madra to accelerate your body, so that you digest it quickly. After about two weeks of this, combined with some pills developed for the purpose, your body becomes able to do it naturally. It's a great all-purpose Iron body; they are able to receive further benefits from elixirs that improve the body, and much of what they eat strengthens them and makes them tougher. The only downside is an accelerated metabolism: now they HAVE to eat all the time."
961,,300,Demonic Purification,Fate/Hollow Ataraxia,Benevolence ,"By touching a demon, you can purify it. Depending on the demonic presence, it could cleanse a demonic soul and redeem it, or it could simply obliterate the demon. You could also choose to grant them humanity, though they could theoretically still be evil even though they are no longer a demon (after all, it’s not like they have probably ever known anything different, though being human gives them the same shot at having a conscience just as any other human has)."
962,,300,To A Lingering Eternity ,Slay the Princess,Benevolence ,"Things do not last. That is the sad truth of this and so many other worlds. Things live, and things eventually die. Nothing lasts forever, not even universes, not even you. But imagine if there was a way to prolong this? To stretch the cruel moments snatched away by a vile vast and uncaring monster into forever? To this goal, this power can halt and extend the lifetime of a single person, object, or phenomenon. It is not permanent - that still remains vexingly out of reach - the things you prolong will eventually break down and decay like everything else. But it is a start."
963,,300,Bodies Don't Work Like That,Slay the Princess,Benevolence ,"‘H-How are you still alive?’ That's the question echoed by everyone who gazes at whatever poor soul you've currently decided to house yourself in. Their spines are broken, their arms snapped like twigs, their lungs crushed and punctured under layers of splintered bone and broken ribs, their organs reduced to a sticky red mulch and yet You. Still. Refuse. To. Die. By your will, they get up and continue to fight even when by all means they should be nothing more than a messy stain on the ground. It is both utterly horrific and yet bizarrely captivating in every sense of the word. So long as there's even a spark of stubborn defiance that yet endures within you, any body you take control of will not die even when logic and reality insists that they should."
964,,300,Even The Wounded Are Worthy Of Love,Slay the Princess,Benevolence ,"Now let me set the record straight right now; for all my faults and the fact that I literally run with the most unpopular opinion, I am not a monster and I'm not going to condone just leaving people out to dry.

ESPECIALLY if we're the ones who made the mess in the first place. So that's what this is - a way to empathize and bond with those we've hurt, a way to bring people back from the brink no matter who they are. Need to calm someone down from a sudden panic attack? You take this. Need to piece someone's mind back together from a sudden collapse? I'm your guy. You really, really need to bond with some messed up cosmic horror that you fucked up psychologically because you got too into messing with Her for stupid reasons at the behest of some cryptic fuck? (Hey!) That's why this is here.

Doesn't matter what that Narrator says. We break it, we're gonna fucking fix it or die trying."
965,,300,Mini Astral Candescense ,Final Fantasy XI,Benevolence ,"The Astral Candescence is an object of sheer mystery. It is an ethereal instrument that produces a magical ""Astral Wind"", which enhances the lives of whoever has it. This is a miniature copy of it slightly larger than a basketball (make sure nobody knows you have this! There is already a war over the original!) Those who stand around this arcane device gain the effect of Refresh and Regen for a full day as well as a moderate increase in gains from any training they do for a full day after coming near it. Also it looks really neat."
966,,300,Immortal Tyrant ,80s Sword and Sorcery,Benevolence ,"So you killed the hero’s parents, and then sent out your men to kill them as a baby. Now the hero is full grown, and it’s been like 20 years. You were gray haired and rather old when this started and now you’re... exactly the same. Are you a sorcerer? No. God? No. Just a warlord? Ok...

It seems you no longer age unless you want to. You are adapted to this state, with a memory and mind which deals well with the weight of eternity. This adaptation also means that your skills will not atrophy with lack of use, so you don’t have to worry about forgetting how to use modern technology while spending a decade in the quasi-middle ages. This also makes you a little more resistant to death from other causes as well, your immune system significantly hardier and better able to fight off disease, and poison which might kill an ordinary man would only render you in need of bedrest; this isn’t immunity, to either, but your resistance to both is slightly superhuman. This applies to injury as well; a sword through your gut will still hurt you, and if not treated kill you, but you could keep fighting afterwards for a minute or so."
967,,300,Destined Champion,80s Sword and Sorcery,Benevolence ,"You have a great destiny in store for you. And as one with a great destiny you cannot just simply die. This destiny isn’t all powerful, but you will find that in any situation your death is less likely than it ordinarily would be. Misfortune and accident will not kill you; your own stupidity might, but mere random chance will not kill you, and your own stupidity is substantially less likely to. Even more intentional death is less likely, as enemies decide to throw you into a death trap you might escape from, wounds miss your vitals, or blows miss you entirely. This destiny is not all powerful, and will not ensure your survival with certainty, but it is to be plain plot armor, helping you to survive events."
968,,300,Crown of Natak,The God of High School,Benevolence ,"A fancy golden crown now rests upon your head. The exact design is up to you but the effect of wearing this crown will definitely make it desirable to wear. As long as it rests on your head, your powers cannot be sealed away from you. No effect will be able to prevent you from accessing your own innate powers with this but once your powers leave your body, such as firing a blast of energy at someone, then those external expressions of your power may be affected as normal. The Crown will keep your body free of intrusions that would nullify you but its protection ceases outside of your body."
969,,300,Mutual Bonds,Final Fantasy IX,Benevolence ,"Well, frankly speaking, some people live in their own little world. I suppose you could call them “happily isolated”. You could also call them “mentally disturbed”, but I think you would prefer the former term. After all,you and your companions are the same way – able to put yourselves inside your only little pocket space – mentally, of course.

Nothing seems to phase your mood or surprise you, unless it’s each other, or you intentionally drop this boon. Of course, your mood can still shift – you didn’t become an automaton overnight! – but the shift is never likely to leave you catatonic.

Attempts from outsiders to manipulate your mind or inflict mental afflictions upon you will largely fail, though if the outsider is substantially stronger than you, a large part of the effect will probably still come through."
970,,300,Summoner’s Guard,Fate/Grand Order,Benevolence ,"How are you meant to fight alongside your Servant if they’re throwing around all these gigantic explosions? You’ll be able to stick by them with this, though you’ll still want to be wary of the enemy’s blows. You’re unable to be harmed by the attacks or negative effects of anything that you have summoned, whether it’s directed or accidental. Attacks just phase through you, though you may still be at risk due to the damage it does to the environment around you. This only applies to friendly or neutral summons, any being that is hostile to you will be able to harm you even if you’ve summoned them. "
971,,300,Down Special Defence!(Reflect),Super Smash Bros. Brawl,Benevolence ,"Reflect – You are able to adopt a special stance, or perform a specific action (such as a flourish of a cape), which allows you to reflect projectiles back where they came from. Regardless of the chosen method, the time period for which you are reflecting cannot extend past a few moments. After this, you will be open to projectiles and cannot reflect again for a brief amount of time. Further, the action you take for this reflection technique is always the same, allowing it to be seen through with repeated use. You will be unable to reflect some powerful attacks from enemies far beyond your ability to handle. For example, an average Fighter would not be able to counter Tabuu’s full power Off Waves.

For an additional 100cp (undiscounted), you are able to extend the time you are reflecting
indefinitely, as long as you continue to perform your chosen action. You will be unable to perform techniques other than the reflection as long you maintain it in this way."
972,,300,Down Special Defence!(Block Counter),Super Smash Bros. Brawl,Benevolence ,"Block Counter - You are able to adopt a special stance, preparing yourself for a counterattack. When you are hit by an attack whilst in this stance, you will receive no damage, and automatically counter with a close-range attack of your own. The power of your counterattack will always be slightly more than that of the attack you received. However, you may only remain in your counterattack stance for a few moments, after which you will be open to attack and unable to adopt your counterattack stance again for a brief amount of time. Further, the stance you take for this counterattack technique is always the same, allowing it to be seen through with repeated use. You will be unable to counter some powerful attacks from enemies far beyond your ability to handle. For example, an average Fighter would not be able to counter Tabuu’s full power Off Waves.

For an additional 100cp (undiscounted), you may add a minor effect to your counterattack, such as adding the fire element to it."
973,,300,Turtle(Wayzz),Miraculous Ladybug,Benevolence ,"Concept: Protection

Form: Bracelet

Tool: Shield

Power: “Shell-ter” - Summons a green force field. It can be up to the size of a building and withstand up to an RPG or two."
974,,300,Case of Dewdrops,Fairy Fencer F,Benevolence ,"How do dewdrops count as a healing item? Who cares? These are some incredibly potent dewdrops that when used rain down over all allies. This case comes with 8 Dewdrop Vials, 4 Dewdrop Flasks, 2 Dewdrop Bottles, and 1 Dewdrop of Salvation. Fully restocks weekly. Merges with the Healing Kit if the prior item was purchased."
975,,300,Elixir,Fairy Fencer F,Benevolence ,This is a single Elixir capable of fully healing you or one of your friends completely. Not even the common cold can withstand this miracle cure. If you purchased the Healing Kit the Elixir will somehow appear in there. Restocks weekly. Merges with the Healing Kit if the prior item was purchased.
976,,300,Well Forged Saber (Tier 2),Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Benevolence ,"For 400,000 instead, this can be upgraded to a proper Servant Universe powerhouse level. You’ll be kicking over Space Elevators and running cross-planet races easily enough. Strength worthy of being one of the Dark R.O.U.N.D.S or taking on a space dragon. Specialisation is possible again, reducing two qualities out of your Strength, Agility or Endurance to boost the third to astonishing heights. A super fast Saber might outrun a starship while a strongwoman Saber could make an Evil God flinch with her mighty punches. A Saber with natural strength will naturally be more confident. 

These ladies tend to be even more violent than usual for the class, getting used to solving problems by hitting them or facing them head on. 

Requires Well Forged Saber(Tier 1) to Purchase"
977,,300,Seeker of Artifacts,God Of War (2018),Benevolence ,"Were you looking for this? No? You just found this rune stone? You seem to have a talent for finding lost or forgotten artifacts, though the simpler and less powerful they are the more likely you are to stumble across them. For example you might stumble across a simple rune stone that gives a fire enchantment, but you would only stumble across the temple or ruin that an artifact like the Leviathan Axe would be in. It would still be up to you to find that artifact in the temple or ruin. Though you would have a sense for how powerful the artifacts that might be in the temple are, if there are any in the first place."
978,,300,Healing What Has Been Lost,God Of War (2018),Benevolence ,"Some say that time heals all wounds, and while that may be true in some cases it doesn’t hurt to have some help. With this perk you will know what you have to do in order to help someone heal from nearly anything. Broken bones? You know what you have to do to make sure they heal properly. Someone broke your friend's heart? You know what to say, when to say it, and what to do in order to help them move on. Someone was erased from existence? You’ll remember them and have a general idea of what you need to do to get them back. The only drawback is that the bigger the “wound” in question is, the more general the knowledge of how to help them is. If you just need to say some words to them or interact with a small town's worth of people then you know exactly what to do, but if you need to go across multiple dimensions to bring someone back from non-existence then you would only have a general idea of how to bring them back."
979,,300,Collector of Weapons & Gear,God Of War (2018),Benevolence ,"Outsiders like yourself often find themselves collecting odds and ends from all over the place, some of which may be magical items that are tied to the realm they came from. Unlike Kratos and the equipment and magic he had from his time in Greece, you have no fear of anything you own breaking down or fading away merely because you took it away from its land of origin or killed the pantheon who made it. They are yours after all."
980,,300,I Say When We’re Done!,God Of War (2018),Benevolence ,"Isn’t it odd that gods are able to be resuscitated like they were a normal human? With this perk you find that any being you face, no matter how esoteric their anatomy may be, is just like another human so long as your power is in the same ballpark as their own. For example if you were two conceptual beings going at one another you would find that you would be able to knock the other out, or resuscitate them as if they were a human. However if you were a baseline human going against a god, they would still be like a god from that setting. You are able to toggle this perk off and on at will."
981,,300,Mind of Water,Final Fantasy V,Benevolence ,"Your mind is like an ocean, vast and deep, with several layers. Due to this, psychic attacks on your mind, possession, or any outside force that would interfere with your ability to keep your own mentality will immediately fail, giving you full protection against such things."
982,,300,White Wizard        ,Final Fantasy IV,Benevolence ,"While certainly, your ability to use White Magic classifies you as a White Mage, you’ve taken that a step further. This perk grants access to the most powerful White Magic spells, such as Curaja, Arise and Holy. Additionally, you gain the innate power of the Phoenix Eidolon: your curative magics will have their power increased, and once per jump, if you are knocked unconscious, as long as you are not killed, your mana reserves are expended, and all allies in a fifty foot area are restored to full health and revived as long as they are not dead."
983,,300,Hauteclaire,HighSchool DxD,Benevolence ,"Said to have been wielded by one of the paladins of Charlemagne, this Holy Sword’s power is strong in its simplicity - it can purify what it touches, even that which it cuts. Resting the blade against the sick or poisoned can cure them of even a legendary beast’s venom or striking a foe with this blade can purge evil influences or possessing entities from their body with enough force - without harming the possessed or the corrupted themselves, if you so desire. May this light your way, Jumper."
984,,300,Victory Toast,Hades,Benevolence ,"While Dionysusmay not share his more violent brother’s appetites, he appreciates a good battle as a reason for a fine toast or royal feast. At the end of each of your battles you will taste lightly of the glass he raises in your honor. While the wine may be metaphorical, its effects are far from. You will find your deepest wounds closing as if you had several days of rest in bed after every fight.

A fight that is too short is never good entertainment for the other partygoers. As your strength begins to flag, you will discover your ability to defend yourself from further blows gains a moderate increase."
985,,300,Holy Shield,Hades,Benevolence ,"Even the wisest and bravest of soldiers are not without their scars. Pain is, after all, one of the best teachers. Yet the goddess still has those she favors. For a short moment after you are wounded, other attacks that attempt to strike you will be turned back on themselves to bite the soldier.

Should an attack lay waste to your life and threaten to bring death to your side, Athena’s protection will shield you further. You will be guarded for a longer time and the death blow will instead leave you at the very last shreds of your strength. She will only intercede in this manner once every ten years, so do not waste the opportunity when it is given."
986,,300,Phalanx Guard ,Hades,Benevolence ,"Allies are ever close at hand to one who is favored by Athena. Raise your sword, or shield, to the sky and call for them. Their shields will appear to protect you from all sides for a brief instant. So great is the strength of their shields that even the strongest of projectiles impacting them will rebound upon those who fired them.

The protection of your summoned allies sticks with you for a moment longer than the shields themselves. Any blows that seek your skin will find your armour much thicker than it should be for a short time."
987,,300,Protective Magic,Hellblazer,Benevolence ,"You are versed in sigils, wards and other rituals of protection. This can defend against physical and magical assault. Requires mana."
988,,300,My Live is Yours,Records of Ragnarok Gauntlet (Humans),Benevolence ,"When a warrior of the Einherjar falls... so will their Valkyrie. This ultimate willingness to follow another into death is the source of Volunds... but for you it goes deeper than that.

As a partner you not only will bring out the best of your partner but even nearly eliminate the pitfalls they suffer. A man so strong his own muscles are a threat to him could fight at his full potential with your aid. They will be at their greatest without any of their pitfalls as long as you will fight with them and you trust them with your live."
989,,300,Last Hope ,Records of Ragnarok Gauntlet (Humans),Benevolence ,"Humanity needs Warriors. They need people ready to face impossible odds and keep going. The kind of Spirit that makes you strive to reach the Heavens, the endurance that makes your name a synonym with ‘hard to kill’ and stand against an army with simply 300 brothers. As such, once per Jump, if something should have killed you, you may still live on. You will be grievously injured but still alive and still ready to fight. You are humanities Last Hope... don’t let them down."
990,,300,The Only Reason That Matters,Records of Ragnarok Gauntlet (Humans),Benevolence ,"They all think its about hate. About revenge. About having a reason to kill. But... Is there any man that needs a reason to protect his own children? Adam fights not to slay but to save. Every human on earth, from the youngest toddler to the oldest grandfather, are his children and he will fight to his last breath to protect them. Should there be a time where you share such a devotion, whenever you fight to protect what you love, all your capabilities will skyrocket. You can push your limits farther than before, a blow of yours could match the God Father of Cosmos and whatever pain you must bear will be childsplay. This will not guarantee you victory but may not make it unreachable... and even if you fall you will be remembered as a shining pillar of hope."
991,,300,Red Hoodies make great bandages ,Star vs the Forces of Evil,Benevolence ,"You’re rather harder to beat than you look... to the point even fatal wounds won’t slow you down for a while, even if it stops you eventually. You don’t stop until you drop, though, and even then you might be able to get back up with some healing. You’re not supernaturally tough; you just make people worry about how you’re still standing, and if they can drop you before you drop them."
992,,300,Radiation Resistance,Marvel Cinematic Universe - Volume 1,Benevolence ,"There's a lot of dangerous things in this world, and unsurprisingly radiation is likewise an issue. Not anymore with this selection. You now have a much higher tolerance to radiation; it would take wearing a suit of uranium rods while inside a nuclear fallout zone to affect you now. As a bonus, this also gives a good resistance to other harmful energies such as Asgardian magic or the energy blasts of Inhumans. It's still recommended to not be hit by these energies when you can, this just helps you out with it."
993,,300,Is the Kid Simply Unable to Die,Marvel 2099,Benevolence ,"You probably can, but death won’t take you easily. Once per jump when you would die, be telekinetically reduced to constituent atoms, be erased, or otherwise cease to exist, circumstances will arrange themselves to revive you, in relative safety to recover, sometime soon without it ending your chain. More than merely not ending your chain, you will find yourself somehow empowered by the experience; maybe your need for an energy source to use your powers is reduced or removed, or you find yourself in an upgraded body. This empowerment will only last until the end of the jump, reverting itself at the start of the next jump, but it will be something geared to helping you survive till then."
994,,300,Walking Church ,A Certain Magical Index,Benevolence ,"An enchanted habit known as a Walking Church famed for its level of protection. Not a Pope-class Walking Church like the one a certain magical Index uses, but it’ll do. Instead of being a walking nuclear bomb shelter, this Walking Church is more of a walking sturdily-built cathedral. Anything that wouldn’t damage that cathedral won’t damage it. It specialises in stopping magical attacks, and isn’t too shabby against physical attacks too. The cloth’s about as strong as a brick veneer, so that 5.56 round definitely won’t penetrate. However, it is very hot, stuffy and itchy. Good luck at trying to wear this underneath that suit of armour over there."
995,,300,Petrified Skull ,Darkest Dungeon,Benevolence ,"The top part of a human skull, cracked open like a nut and brimming with glimmering, alien crystals. Grants superb protection against eldritch and alien foes, weakening their blows, as well as increased vitality in general. "
996,,300,Gleaming Breastplate,Darkest Dungeon,Benevolence ,"A holy breastplate that not only protects against moderate damage, but even helps ward against killing blows and even lucky strikes for superb survivability. "
997,,300,Gauntlet of Absorption,Darkest Dungeon,Benevolence ,"A potent protective item for those who prefer to get hit, this gauntlet increases the healing done by the wearer greatly and gives increased resistance to damage. Blows struck against the wearer actually alleviates some accumulated stress, as well. "
998,,300,Pulley's Butterfly,Bayonetta,Benevolence ,"Oh this is rather neat. It looks shiny, it's pretty... that's not a problem, is it? An elegant trinket in the shape of a butterfly, this item creates a shield of radiant butterflies for you which will protect you from a majority of attacks so long as you have the magical energy to fuel it. Just beware that you don't overtax it... it would be a shame if you thought it made you invincible."
999,,300,No One Dies,Shovel Knight ,Benevolence ,You and your companions will not die from any battle you did not cause.
1000,,300,Elixir of Life,Generic Alchemist,Benevolence ,"A tiny phial of glowing, clear liquid that is the elixir of life. By ingesting this liquid, a person’s aging ceases entirely, they are returned to the prime of their life, and they become immune to disease. On top of this, if the drinker would be killed in some fashion, they will return to life once, the effects of the elixir spent and the benefits lost until they drink a new phial. You gain one of these elixirs every ten years."
1001,,300,Tria Prima,Generic Alchemist,Benevolence ,"You have, through means only you know, infused yourself with the Tria Prima; alchemical versions of Salt, Mercury, and Sulphur. This has made your entire being highly receptive to enhancement and given you some alchemical qualities found in the great works of alchemy.

This has made it so that any procedure or process you undergo that has even the remotest chance of beneficially enhancing you in some way will succeed, and with far fewer negatives, no matter how remote the possibility should be. They will not simply fail, harm you, or lead to death as the chance of success becomes a guarantee of success. This would let you swallow an energy field bigger than your head and, if even the slightest possibility existed of you succeeding, survive and benefit from it.

Additionally, any damage that is done to you, be it to your body, mind, or soul, will eventually recover no matter how severe it may be. So long as it does not kill you outright, you can eventually recover. The rate at which you heal is also increased by a factor of five. Should one or more of your aspects (body, mind, or spirit) be completely healed, the healing it would normally receive is shunted to your other aspects, accelerating the already increased rate you heal, split evenly between the remaining aspects."
1002,,300,Zhonya's Hourglass,League of Legends,Benevolence ,"This unassuming hourglass is an extremely potent magical artifact, capable of halting the implacable march of time for just a few precious moments. When flipped, this hourglass freezes its user in golden light for exactly two and a half seconds, rendering them completely invulnerable- And completely still, unable to act. The hourglass then needs a minute to run its course before it can be flipped again."
1003,,300,Warmog's Armor,League of Legends,Benevolence ,"This breastplate is woven out of living wood, and imbued with powerful, life-giving magic. When worn, this armor grants its wearer immunity to disease, incredible toughness, and powerful natural regeneration when out of combat. All the myriad wounds you sustain in a fight will mend before your eyes, along with any damaged clothing or armor you're wearing."
1004,,300,Spirit Visage,League of Legends,Benevolence ,"This darkened suit of leather armor pulses with an energy that suggests it's almost alive. Not only does this armor protect against harmful magic, it greatly increases the potency of the wearer's natural healing, and will increase all other healing effects by 25%- Whether it be supernatural regeneration, life-stealing enchantments, or plain and simple healing magic."
1005,,300,Mikael's Crucible,League of Legends,Benevolence ,"This golden, handheld crucible is less a container for molten metal than it is a conduit for healing magic. Not only does it boost the power of the holder's healing magic, it will boost the natural regeneration of its wielder, and when the crucible is opened, the wielder can cleanse one of their allies of any effect that slows, entangles, or imprisons them. After that, the Crucible needs 3 minutes to refill before it can be used in that manner again."
1006,,300,Frozen Heart,League of Legends,Benevolence ,"This crystal of True Ice is wrapped in an icy, angelic embrace. When pressed against armor or clothing, the Frozen Heart affixes itself and covers the garment in a layer of icy armor. This icy armor is very durable, regenerating any damage dealt to it, and its incredible cold slows the movements of nearby enemies. The cold will not harm the wearer, however. Pulling off the Frozen Heart will cause the armor to dissapate."
1007,,300,Banshee's Veil,League of Legends,Benevolence ,"This unassuming silver pendant of a cross is a great boon against offensive magic. Not only does it increase your resistance to magical damage, After fourty seconds of staying out of combat the pendant will surround its wearer in a ghostly veil, granting them complete immunity to one spell before it dissapates."
1008,,300,Magic resistance,Generic Dungeon Crawler,Benevolence ,"You resist magic that tries to impair your body and mind. While this mutation won't protect you from external threats such as magically-conjured fireballs or minions, hostile magics that attempt to directly target your being will flatly fail 25% of the time."
1009,,300,Just One Sip,The Dresden Files,Benevolence ,"When you live in a world filled with walking, talking food that doesn't just ask but frequently begs you to eat it, it can be awfully hard to resist. You've gotten quite good at resisting these sorts of urges, though, as well as holding back enough to avoid causing harm when you do indulge. It doesn't just apply to your demon, either - you're downright rock-like when it comes to resisting any form of supernatural temptation, or other forms of supernatural compulsion, and even in figuring out whether or not someone's trying to put the whammy on you in the first place."
1010,,300,"""Wolf's Blood""",Dark Souls 3,Benevolence ,"The Abyss Watchers of old made a vow with the blood of a wolf, binding them, giving them the power to combat the abyss. Though they fought it many times, they only became corrupted after becoming Lords of Cinder and the blood dried up. By purchasing this perk, you gain a similar powerful resistance to corruption. It is considerably harder for the Abyss, Deep and any other sources of corruption to take root in your mind, body or soul. This allows you to more easily combat dark monstrosities without fear of losing yourself. Be careful for straying from the light too long however, for this perk's resistance may eventually be overcome with enough exposure or very powerful corruption. If purchased with ""Simple Solution"", you become moderately more mentally resistant to corruption and will become stronger when currently being targeted by something attempting to corrupt you, whether this is an enemy or environmental. This addition in strength is just a bit weaker than the ""War Cry"" effect of ""Simple Solution"", but lasts until you're free of corruptive influences. 

(Sidenote: You may optionally have your eyes glow red when this power boost is active.)"
1011,,300,"""Vital Defense""",Dark Souls 3,Benevolence ,"A sword to the gut hurts an Undead or Unkindled Ash just as much as it would a regular human, even if they can come back from it. Keeping the misery of repeated deaths in mind, it’s no wonder that those who have retained their sanity will seek to wear as much as they can without becoming overburdened. Knowing the value of heavy armor you’ve learned how best to wear such equipment so that it does not slow you down, keeping your full range of movement so long as you’re not immobile. Also, your body seems to bear the weight of armor more easily, allowing you to wear the finest- or at least most protective- armor available. This toughness of body has increased your resistance to physical harm by just a tad, and offers a small resistance to poison and other toxic substances as well."
1012,,300,"""Twisted Reality""",Dark Souls 3,Benevolence ,"All who brave these lands and survive have some kind of power or skill that they can reliably use to protect themselves. For all who survive though, a pinch of luck is also necessary. Through purchasing this perk, your luck greatly increases. Sometimes this manifests as being in the right place at the right time, sometimes it's just finding a good piece of equipment worth salvaging among the rotten, decayed mess you navigate. This luck also manifests in more direct offensive and defensive applications. Your poisons spread more aggressively than they should, your weapons find important veins and arteries more easily, and curses have a harder time taking hold of you."
1013,,300,"""Miracles""",Dark Souls 3,Benevolence ,"Holy sacraments, the gift of the gods, the art of Miracles. Miracles are the fruit of divine tales that the faithful draw power from the use of holy chimes or talismans and deep prayer, each Miracle empowered by the caster's belief. You have studied some of these blessed stories with religious fervor, allowing you to heal yourself and those around you of minor wounds or common ailments, or speed up natural healing for a while. While still ignorant of many of the feats of the gods, a holy pilgrimage through these churning lands will surely enlighten you. Purchasing this perk has also aided your ability to trust and believe in others or vaguely defined concepts, for Faith is what fuels Miracles. Your Faith also wards you from the dark somewhat, and this ward can grow more powerful with regular prayer. (Sidenote: This perk also teaches you how to read braille.)"
1014,,300,“One Great Shield”,Dark Souls 1,Benevolence ,"A large, intricate shield that seems to have the perfect heft, is basically indestructible, comes in the shape desired and emblazoned with a crest of your own design. This shield can defend against all kinds of dangers like magic, flame or lightning, and can absorb considerable shock that allows you to defend against things many times your weight class. As long as the rift in strength isn’t so vast you’re unable to see the other side, you could take attacks from giant beasts and come out just fine, providing you properly blocked anyways."
1015,,300,Hematophagy ,Bloodborne,Benevolence ,"“Although blood had replaced medicine, drugs, and in some cases goods within Yharnam, one cannot sustain themselves on blood alone. Those who attempt to do so inevitably just become blood drunk, no better than beasts; but this ends with you. 

You may sustain yourself on blood with little to no ill effects. This retains your strength with no other food or water, increases blood based healing efficacy, and won’t let your inner beast encroach further on your mind unless you gorge yourself. Effects may vary depending on your prospective meals.”"
1016,,300,Celestial Dew ,Elden Ring,Benevolence ,"This antique bottle carries within it a rare solution called a Night Tear-and unique among its kind, can do its work without being used at a Church of Vows. Long ago the stars of the night sky guided fate, and in a remembrance of those times consuming it will reverse all antagonizations-at least, those that have not left a metaphysically lasting impact on the world. Refills once a week."
1017,,300,Miquella’s Needle,Elden Ring,Benevolence ,"Once, the demigod Miquella sought a remedy for his sister Malenia’s plague that lay beyond the fundamentalism of the Golden Order. This needle of unalloyed gold is the triumph of his studies. A powerful enchantment is laid on it, for it is crafted to ward away the meddling of outer gods. With this a victim of the Scarlet Rot that even the demigods’ powers alone seemed unable to heal could be cured-at least, assuming the Rot were not somehow intrinsic to their biology. Likewise, one embraced by the Three Fingers could cheat fate and subdue the Flame of Frenzy imbued into them- permitting them to incinerate the Erdtree yet avoid becoming the Lord of Frenzied Flame. In future worlds, the influence of similar corruptive forces and malign deities will be nullified with a jab from this holy curative."
1018,,300,Poised and Robust ,Elden Ring,Benevolence ,"Warmth fills the breast of every champion, whether kindled with the flame of ambition or the Grace of the Erdtree. And you’re unusually hardy, with an enviable vitality and resilience among your kind. You can take great wounds to your body and walk off far more than your frame would suggest, and run without exhausting yourself in full armour for longer than many would dare to believe. You are also tougher than you look, however you look, to the point where purely physical attacks of all kind have less of an impact on you than a standard member of whatever you are. “Instant death” effects are less likely to work effectively on you-save those of truly overwhelming force, like the anger of the divine. In addition you’re superbly difficult to knock off your feet, through a combination of sure footing and a particularly solid build. If you were but a man, you’d be the kind who could take on a charging knight on foot with a longsword and come out on top."
1019,,300,"Focused Mind, Resilient Body ",Elden Ring,Benevolence ,"A thousand maladies plague the lands between, and worse things that drive good men to madness. Whether through meditation or sheer grit, you’re far less susceptible to both than most of your kind. While you’re no less susceptible to general harm than before, the persistent damage left by conditions such as frostbite, rabid bleeding and infection find it far more difficult to find purchase on you-and you can fight them off with superb vigour. You also have a disciplined mind inured to many of the madness and sleep-inducing effects in this world. Elemental forces such as fire, magic and the holy power of the Erdtree are significantly blunted as well, as if you had imbibed all manner of concoctions to build up a resistance. No man will survive a swim in lava naked, but to charge through a dragon’s fiery breath and still be fit to fight? That, a man with this could do."
1020,,300,Tarnished ,Elden Ring,Benevolence ,"Ah. Poor, brave Tarnished. Once a man like any other, now raised from the peaceful repose by the Greater Will’s unrelenting demand for a new champion to become Elden Lord. It matters little if you were noble, commonfolk or brigand in life; the darkening of the golden hue from your eyes will signify to all that you are a wanderer on a seemingly hopeless quest, suffering a loss of communion with the Erdtree. Perhaps, only just perhaps, you are among the faintest and most distantly related descendants of Marika and Godfrey’s bloodline-though with little to show for it, save perhaps some faint affinity for the arts of war.

Not all Tarnished are so favoured, but it seems you are one of the lucky few to yet benefit from the Guidance of Grace: The divine revelation provided by the Golden Order, and perhaps the Greater Will that guides it. In your travels through this reality, you will come across tiny golden rays of light guiding you to your destiny as Elden Lord-resembling both a droplet in form, and a bonfire in ambience. Resting at such a site will restore both your body and focus (vital for casting magic of all sorts from this world) as well as cleanse you of all but the most dire of status effects. Do not fear poison, curses or raggedly bleeding wounds while in the presence of such a beacon-though richly embeddedcorruptive forces of directly divine power such as the Frenzied Flame will not be so easily quelled. Moreover, certain potions are miraculously refilled at such a site:
-The Flask of Wondrous Physick, filled with crystal tears that normally amass at the roots of minor Erdtrees capable of laying all manner of boons on the drinker.
-The Flask of Crimson Tears, which wondrously heals the drinker even in the heat of battle.
-And the Flask of Cerulean Tears, which restores focus similarly.

Die in battle, and should you have the resolve to return you may resurrect at the last Site of Grace you rested at. The Site’s soothing light also permits you to expend Runes in order to strengthen yourselves overall over time, and focus your mind on magic or Ashes of War to better wield in battle. The potency of

the flasks can also be increased or altered with Sacred Tears-faint vestiges of the Erdtree’s blessings in the past.

It costs 200 CP to gain the mantle of Tarnished in this world, but for 300 CP you may keep all the benefits of the Guidance of Grace for yourself. In future worlds the Sites of Grace will continue to appear along with all they provide, this time leading towards what events, individuals and locations of great importance to the world instead of the Elden Ring."
1021,,300,Oath of the Watchkeeper,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Benevolence ,"In life many oaths are easily broken. This oath however, is stronger than most. Choose one ideal, this powerful ideal by which you choose to live your life. When you choose, you can proclaim this oath to others while channeling Mana into your being, reasserting your goals. Those who know this oath and choose to help you willingly with action in pursuit of this goal, without duplicity, will find their magical skills honed. This affects you as well, aiding you in your spellcasting as the support of others strengthens your resolve. The amount by which you all benefit depends on how many individuals are close to you and their power. Needless to say this will not give you power equal to all of the participants, but it can be a crucial boost when the cards are down and everything is at stake. Those who choose to help you can leave at any time or be exempt if circumstances cause them to act unwillingly."
1022,,300,A Coincidence,The Sorcerer's Apprentice,Benevolence ,"This is essentially a one-time, very powerful twist of fate for you. Upon being 'spent' somewhere, you will gain a strongly fated meeting with someone of extreme importance, which will put you in the right place at the right time to benefit massively. Think the 'David meets Balthazar' moment levels of importance, that's where this can lead you."
1023,,300,Healing Touch ,Cultist Simulator,Benevolence,"Your affinity with the Heart has granted you a healing touch that will slowly heal the sick, mend the wounded, and even regrow limbs. This power requires conscious action, forcing you to at least acknowledge the problem before it can be treated."
1024,,300,Rise ,Cultist Simulator,Benevolence,"Through the aspect of winter, you’ve learned how to postpone the final rest of all things living, and while not pretty, it will allow you to raise and resurrect the dead.
"
1025,,300,Rod of Asclepius ,Justice League Dark,Benevolence,"An ancient and potent artifact. This golden rod is imbued with incredibly powerful restorative magic. By simply channeling magic through it, even a novice magician would be able to heal nearly any physical or spiritual malady short of death. It is also bound to you, meaning it can be summoned with a thought.
"
1026,,300,Heart Spheres ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Benevolence,"You can pull off pieces of your life force into energy spheres and give them to your companions. The spheres contain a piece of your power, and strengthen the abilities of those who use them. It can be used in a variety of ways, such as enhancing the user’s existing abilities, granting new abilities like creating a sealed pocket dimension for battle, summoning a samurai castle, or even restoring someone on the verge of death to full health. However, these orbs only have limited power to draw on, so use them wisely. If you have the Embraced in Wings perk, you can also use the energy of people you have absorbed instead of your own energy.
"
1027,,300,Timelessness ,Golden Sky Stories,Benevolence,"There are some things in life that don’t change regardless of circumstance. A little town that remains rural despite the efforts of industrialization, a group of animal spirits that don’t seem to vanish, even if people don’t believe in them as much as they used to.

You are timeless – in the sense that you don’t age at the same pace as the rest of the world around you. The effects of temporal magic and shifts don’t seem to affect you, as if you are detached from the same time frame that the magic would otherwise affect. Be wary – immortality isn’t as wonderful as it may seem, especially if the rest of the world continues to age around you.
"
1028,,300,Dwarven Will  ,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Benevolence,"The resolve of the bearded folk is legend, and a large part of why they were once considered living stone. When you set your mind to something you will not be swayed. Not by words or by fire or by thunder or by strength of arms. Spells and abilities that affect the mind are simple to shrug off, and the duration of any that do take hold are lessened greatly. You are resistant to other magics as well, though not to such an extent since you stubbornly refuse to acknowledge their existence.
"
1029,,300,Blessing of the Lady - Partial,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Benevolence,"You bear the Blessing of the Lady of the Lake, the Goddess of Bretonnia. An unseen but incredibly powerful enchantment you are greatly resistant to magic. Should you be a knight errant and in your travels find the Lady and be granted a sip from the Holy Grail you will find that you become almost completely immune to hostile magic, the power of enemy mages and sorcerors simply washing harmlessly over you.

This represents a 30% and 70% resistance to hostile magic respectively, and becoming a Grail Knight is no easy feat, something less than a handful of the most selfless, purehearted knights of Bretonnia ever manage. The quest itself will take most, if not all of your ten years here.
"
1030,,300,Healer ,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Benevolence,"Through magic, skill with herbs or training in the recently discovered science of medicine you are an expert healer, able to diagnose and treat the bulk of the common diseases and all but the most terrible injuries sustained in battle. The more terrible diseases gifted to the mortal realm by Nurgle may be too potent to deal with now, but as your skills grow even these maladies will fall before you.
"
1031,,300,White Lion Cloak ,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Benevolence,"The pelt of one of the Great White Lions of Chrace, this cloak still bears some of the power and majesty it radiated when the beast was alive, and as a result wearers of such a garment find themselves more charismatic and more agile. That the partially magical hide also turns blows as well as a good quality suit of chainmail doesn't hurt either.
"
1032,,300,Bath Body ,Neverland: The RPG,Benevolence,"It appears that some Bath Bear blood runs in you, for you were able to safely bathe in the Petrifying Well and gain some stone-hard armor. At will, you can cover your body with a rock coating (you can also dismiss the covering when you want). Your body will still be able to move/function normally, though the weight may slow you down a bit. The rocky exterior makes you more durable, but a strong enough force striking you in a single hit can crack off a bit of the armor. This perk also effectively makes you immune to petrification powers, for anything that causes petrification instead triggers this power and safely gives you the rock skin instead (any extra effects from the petrification will enchant your new coat). However, in the case you gained the stone armor via petrification rather than summoning it yourself, you cannot automatically dismiss it and will instead need to break it.
"
1033,,300,Life Restoration,Danmachi,Benevolence,A Resurrection magic that allows the user to bring a dead person back to life and restore their body back to pristine condition while reviving them. Though it guarantees to revive those who died within seven days.
1034,,300,Healing Ray,Danmachi,Benevolence,A healing magic that allows you to heal fatal wounds in seconds and restore the targets stamina and lost limbs when used against them. It also has a second version that allows the user to heal and restore stamina in a wide range but the effect is far lesser compared to the single target version.
1035,,300,Cure Ailments,Danmachi,Benevolence,A magic that allows the user to cure and remove any abnormalities and status ailments like poison along with removing any curse on the target. It also leaves a lingering effect that last for an entire day that allows the target to resist abnormalities and status ailments.
1036,,300,(Element) Barrier ,Danmachi,Benevolence,"Choose the element that you want and you would be given the ability similar to Lefiya Viridis or Filvis Challia’s Dio Grail flavored with an element of your choice. It’s a no chant magic that creates a circular barrier. The more energy poured into the spell the greater its defensive capabilities.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
1037,,300,Scroll of Great Warding ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Benevolence,"This scroll is not supposed to exist yet, and once it does it is meant to be given to your Supreme Patriarch. And yet, here you hold a copy. This scroll details a ritual designed to create a bastion from a combination of magic and pure faith. So long as Wizards channel the faith of the people and defenders in their most beloved goodly god, it will stand tall and proud against enemy incursion and repel any Daemonic or Undead creature which attempts to pass through it. An area lacking a Wizard to uphold the ritual or lacking in faith will become a breach in the wall, however.While fate means for this wall to work with faith in Sigmar and the Winds of Magic, you should (with some trial and error) manage to adapt it to other sources of magical power and faith in other goodly deities.
"
1038,,300,The Mark of Qazalak ​,Mage: The Awakening(1st Edition),Benevolence,"This tattoo is about the size of a silver­ dollar, appearing as a twisting spiral of barbed wire with the barest hint of a face. It may be removed at will by the user as one would remove a piece of cellophane, but it cannot be stolen or removed post­mortem, only given. When activated the Mark cleanses the bearers body of all poisons, intoxicants, drugs and other deleterious chemicals that may be in their system."
1039,,300,Potion Set ,Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword,Benevolence,"Five bottles, though I think you’ll find that these bottles are not empty. Instead, the bottles are all filled up with one of the five potions available at the potion shop. Your standard red heart potion, the green stamina potion, the health and shield repairing purple potion, the durability increasing rainbow potion, and the don't drown while swimming blue potion. They all refill once a month.
"
1040,,300,Yellow Potion ,Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks,Benevolence,"Alright, last but certainly not least. This bright yellow brew lacks the special trait of delayed activation that they Purple Potion has, but it compensates by being much more powerful. Whereas the Red Potion heals six hearts, and the purple gives you eight hearts, this potion heals everything. Doesn’t matter how much you actually have, the Yellow Potion restores you to the top of your game. That said, due to how rare and expensive this is in comparison, you’ll only be getting a single refill each month.
"
1041,,300,Potion Set,Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker,Benevolence,"“You got some Red Potion! You got some Green Potion! You got some Blue Potion!”

A trio of glass bottles, each with a useful potion inside of them. The first, a red potion, restores your health. The second, a green potion, restores your magical energy. The third, a blue potion, restores both. Each bottle will refill at the end of the day if you use it, but you won’t get any extra if you haven’t used it. If one of the bottles breaks, then you get a new one.
"
1042,,300,Mirror Shield ,Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker,Benevolence,"“You got the Mirror Shield! Its shiny surface reflects beams of light.”

The mirror shield is a sturdy and reliable thing, able to block enemy attacks with ease. However, as one might imagine, it’s true power comes from it’s well polished front, to an almost mirror like sheen - hence its name, the Mirror Shield. This mirror is intended to be used to reflect light, and adds in the faintest traces of holy magic, often stunning or damaging evil creatures and forcing ghostly beings to solidify for a short while. On top of that, the shield is also capable of deflecting full on light magic, such as the Light Arrows.
"
1043,,300,Blessing of Nayru ,Legend of Zelda: Hero of Worlds,Benevolence,"Increases your wisdom, gives you minor prophetic dreams, and allows you to use the spell Nayru's Love, becoming invulnerable for a brief time but incapable of using other powers or magic weapons."
1044,,300,Enviromagic Clothes - Water Breathing,Legend of Zelda: Hero of Worlds,Benevolence ,"Grants water breathing. 

(CG Note: The rest of this perk requires Enviromagic Clothes - Heat Immunity first.)

If you buy both, they can be combined by a skilled tailor post-jump."
1045,,300,Enviromagic Clothes - Heat Immunity,Legend of Zelda: Hero of Worlds,Benevolence ,"Grants heat immunity. 

(CG Note: The rest of this perk requires Enviromagic Clothes - Water Breathing first.)

If you buy both, they can be combined by a skilled tailor post-jump."
1046,,400,My Own Way,Shin Megami Tensei II,Benevolence ,"No one tells you what to believe or what to do. Period. If you make a choice, it will be of your own volition and without any voice whispering sweet nothings into your ear. More than simple resistance, your mind and soul are together an iron fortress against all that would seek to violate them. Things like enchantment or mind control find no sway over your perception of reality or thoughts, and illusions are insultingly obvious to you no matter how convincing the magician or caster behind it may be. Whether it claims to be divine revelation or simply attempting to steal what is yours, a lie is a lie. And lies are useless against you."
1047,,400,Demonic Infusion,Shin Megami Tensei II,Benevolence ,"Humans normally lack the strange and fantastical abilities of demons, relying on their silly gadgets and technology to stand a chance. Of course, you can instead lend them a bit of a helping hand. You see, some demons are able to voluntarily merge with a human host, changing them into demonic hybrids with the power of a demon and the soul of a human. This usually destroys the ego of said demon, but you’ve learned how to do it piecemeal. You can temporarily weaken yourself to grant demonic power to a human or mundane creature, granting them a fraction of your physical abilities as well as attributes based on your demonic form – ice magic and snow-white skin if you were a Frost, wings and holy magic if you’re an Angel, and so forth.

The stronger you want your new hybrid to be, the more exhausting and draining the process must be, and making them your equal in one go will likely destroy you. Still, even with a tiny fraction of yourself, your hybrid may grow stronger and develop thematically similar abilities on their own. It’s an investment, you see?"
1048,,400,Blessed Line,Kate Daniel ,Benevolence ,"Your line has been blessed you can choose a minor blessing from a god of your choice. Something like fire resistance, inspiration, or lucky love life. You get a new blessing every jump."
1049,,400,Smite the Wicked,Castlevania - Rondo of Blood,Benevolence ,"Despite the Belmont clan’s somewhat rocky history with the Church, the fact remains that they are without exception the greatest fighting force to ever do battle with monsters that has ever existed. And yes, that’s with merely one of them taking the field at any given time. It’s no wonder that they are often considered holy - and sadly, just as often to be unholy themselves. Still, for you this isn’t as much of a problem, your family has mostly dealt with those issues already. Instead, if you so wish it then you can actually generate and leak a small amount of genuine divine power, the light of the lord. This light causes all who view you to see you as a savior, a hero, an agent of the lord himself - and, occasionally, if they’re particularly religious, god himself. ...Well, regardless of such crazy talk, this makes it fundamentally impossible for people to acknowledge you as evil while the light shines."
1050,,400,Auntie’s Boon,Baldur's Gate 3,Benevolence ,"You get a disgusting patch of shriveled greenish skin covered by rough dark green hair. This is a boon granted by a powerful hag. You don’t need to consume this one though, unlike the one that is in the game.

You and any person you allow can attune to this boon for a minute get a boost to their capabilities. Anyone who uses this boon picks a physical or a mental stat, those being: strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom and charisma. This stat is boosted to its maximum as if the user have made purchase of All 20s perk.

This perk can only be used by each person once in their lifetime and anytime someone attempts to use this item a second time for themselves, the attunement process fails, and this item becomes a simple disgusting bodily refuse. This item also has a cooldown of a year between each usage."
1051,,400,Soul Mirror ,Anima Beyond Fantasy,Benevolence ,"Although at first glance, it appears to be a simple ring, Soul Mirror is much more, possessing three major abilities to protect its bearer from the ravages of magic. First, it increases their chances of resisting magical effects. Second, if they manage to do so, it returns the same effect back on the one who cast it. Finally, it grants control over that effect to its bearer, who treats it as a spell they cast."
1052,,400,Psychic Recovery ,Anima Beyond Fantasy,Benevolence ,"Though you may claim the power of the mind is unlimited, that is not... quite true. You may be able to strike out all day long, but you have a limited ability to enhance your mental blows. Most would recover that mental strength in hours: You recover it in mere seconds."
1053,,400,Mental Efficiency,Anima Beyond Fantasy,Benevolence ,"Your mind is honed, sharp as a blade. When you strain yourself to strengthen a power, calling upon the mental potential that lies within your mind, your powers will gain twice the strength they otherwise would."
1054,,400,Perfect Accumulation,Anima Beyond Fantasy,Benevolence ,"The strength of Ki is increased by your harmony to the world around you. No matter what action you take, it will not decrease the speed at which your ki can be gathered for use in your techniques, and when standing still, it shall gather faster than any other can claim."
1055,,400,Health Bar,MORTAL KOMBAT 9-10,Benevolence ,"In the heat of Kombat, you will always have an accurate read of the health of you and your opponent, represented by two bars at the top of your vision. In addition, you can keep fighting through any injury so long as your health bar is full, and have become bizarrely durable on top of that- you’re not any tougher, you can simply take more punishment. This means that, so long as you have ‘health’ left, you could fight at full capacity even after enduring the bone-crushing attacks of another fighter. Even getting stabbed in the brain or heart won’t do you in or impede you, so long as you have health left."
1056,,400,In The Grace of Time,Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous,Benevolence ,"The fortune of the fated, to be at the right place at the right time. Even as you bumble and butcher your way through this warped nation, you’ll be drawn onwards by fate to arrive just in time. In time for what? In time to be the one that makes a difference, if you can match up to the task. Rarely will you encounter the aftermath of some tragic tale, like a merchant caravan having been attacked by bandits, when you could instead arrive moments before the battle begins and be able to choose your own side. 

For your own quests, it also helps you arrive within any time limits that have been set, even if they are terribly obscure requirements that someone forgot to write down anywhere. Like understanding which month is the correct one for a grand ritual to be successful. This lure of fate, which often sees you discovering shortcuts and finding quicker routes to your destinations, also helps guide you to interesting events and places. All the better to grow your story and increase the ways you change the world around you. "
1057,,400,Mythic Companions,Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous,Benevolence ,"How favoured is the hero, to receive all these blessings and awaken all this unknown power. But how unfortunate for his friends, who don’t get special heritages or mythical weapons of their own. Your own circle of companions need not grow jealous, as destiny seeks to integrate them into your own tale. Your closest and longest cherished allies find that they are much more easily able to keep up with you as you advance in life. The fellow adventurers in your party, the rest of your sailing ship’s crew or hand picked retinue that supports your as king. They happen on their own ways of growing in power and ability, sometimes entirely separate to your own. New teachers that wish to pass down skills that only your companions know, legendary items found when they split from the group for a time, even secret powers of their own. Though this almost divine guidance won’t bring them to your level, it will help them remain worthy of being your fated companions. If they part ways or stop being your active companions, they’ll keep any benefits they gained but they’ll find the ease with which they kept up fading away quickly. "
1058,,400,Son Of A Saint,Castlevania - Symphony of the Night,Benevolence ,"Dracula’s wife was an interesting woman - she begged a man who might as well have been the devil himself for a favor and eventually married him... so that she could practice medicine on those who needed help. She was saintlike, despite her marriage to darkness. In fact, she was quite literally descended from a saint - the daughter or granddaughter of one, perhaps. One of your own parents possessed a similar pedigree, and by extension so do you. You’ll find that holy weapons and armors fit easier in your hands and rest softly upon your shoulders, and should you be a creature of darkness you’ll find your weaknesses oddly blunted - things like flowing water or sunlight, ever an irritant to vampires, would trouble you not at all even if they were supposed to be your own weaknesses. This is by no means an immunity to such things, but they simply don’t harm you any more than they would an ordinary person."
1059,,400,Living Dangerously,The Free Universe,Benevolence ,"When you’re gambling, the riskier you take things...the better the payout! Why shouldn’t gambling with your life be the same? You’ll find that the more danger you’re in, the better things go for you when they go well - little mercies become big benefits, and a saving grace does more than pull you out of the fire, it’ll turn the tides and put you on top! How else could you go from trapped in an evil genius’ lair to flying out of the fireball, gorgeous girl (or guy) in one arm and the macguffin in the other?"
1060,,400,Insane to Begin With,Old Man Henderson,Benevolence ,Can't drive something mad that is by itself mad. You simply are impossible to drive insane or otherwise be unable to comprehend the crazy shit around you. You could roll up the Necronomicon and smoke it and be no worse for wear.
1061,,400,No Party Killer,Old Man Henderson,Benevolence ,"One of the players, who died almost at every turn because of Hendersons schemes, surely would have appreciated him having this Perk. Your actions never cause collateral damage if you don’t want them to. You could blow up an entire City and miraculously everyone you don’t want dead will be unharmed. Those you want dead though? Well they will feel the full brunt."
1062,,400,This Is Some Kind of Joke,Castlevania - Aria of Sorrow,Benevolence ,"You won’t let anyone or anything dictate your destiny...not your power, not the will of the world, nothing. Corruption of your mind and body, whether from internal or external forces, find themselves gaining no purchase of your thoughts or actions. A dark power that would change you into the embodiment of wickedness has a negligible change to your personality, and you can hold back your emotions from acting rashly out of anger or grief. This effect is strengthened by thoughts or support from a loved one, letting you wield the power of evil for their sake and your own instead of some outside will."
1063,,400,Abyssal Archwitch,Valkyrie Crusade ,Benevolence ,"Around you at all times is a powerful shield that protects you from harm. The shield has as much health as you do. It takes enough damage to kill you to destroy the shield. Essentially, your health doubles, with you taking no physical damage for the first half. This shield, when broken, will restore itself after three hours have passed."
1064,,400,Demonwitch Spirits,Valkyrie Crusade ,Benevolence ,"You will receive the ability to cast a rather special spell from the chaotic Demon Realms. This is a powerful defensive spell utilised by the Demonwitches that reside there. While it is active, for a short period of time lasting no more than ten minutes, the damage taken from all elements bar a random one are reduced to the bare minimum. This is a relatively energy intensive spell, so use it sparingly. It cannot be stacked."
1065,,400,Earth Mail,Shin Megami Tensei ,Benevolence ,"Armor crafted from soil enhanced by magic. Though capable of withstanding high explosives, it is not sealed, making its defensive use against them questionable. Harmful levels of heat or cold have their effects halved by the enchantment within, and it increases your luck massively. Battles previously impossible to win can now be made into legendary upsets by you, as fate itself conspires to ensure those who wear this item find glory in combat."
1066,,400,Ultimate Incense ,Shin Megami Tensei ,Benevolence ,"Supreme version of a common mystical item. The incredible power held within it is released by burning, allowing whoever breathes in its smoke to have their strength, vitality, agility, and luck boosted by magical power. A sedentary otaku would have their feeble muscles granted power at the maximum level of human capacity, while a common worker would become blatantly superhuman. While a new stick will appear every week, a person can only benefit from it once. Note that demons, full or otherwise, can not have their power enhanced by it."
1067,,400,Talisman,Shin Megami Tensei ,Benevolence ,"A wooden ofuda, made by a western demonologist in a poor attempt at combining differing practices. The magic inside is crude, but extremely plentiful, as its enchantment was aided by a duke of hell. When held, it will guard its user, ensuring that if they ever die an extreme burst of magic will bring them back to life. While study will allow you to recreate this object, and even improve upon its design, the Jumper can only be brought back by its kind once."
1068,,400,The Winds of Salvation,Shin Megami Tensei ,Benevolence ,"You were minding your own business, living as normal people are wont to do, when you came across a demon torturing a group of people in the middle of the day. They were completely defenseless against such a beast, and you knew you wouldn’t do much better. And yet, you rushed forward, trying to stop it from hurting them. You don’t know how, but somehow you were powerful enough to defeat it. You scarcely remember what you actually did when you fought it down with your bare hands, but what you do know is that as the people you saved lay dying, you commanded the wind to move over them. Each gust of air glowed with a mysterious holy power and mended their wounds, and soon they were as if they had never been attacked. While you’ve yet to experiment and realize this for yourself, this healing wind is in fact the result of combining two abilities you’ve acquired. The first is that you may command the wind through magical power, initially only pushing men to the ground with wide sweeps and perhaps creating spears of compressed air capable of harming demons, but with time you may yet demolish entire buildings. The second is that you may expel holy light through your hands which heals those it touches, nursing even those at the brink of death back to health. Both come from the same source, and when used at the same time naturally merge, meaning that while you’ll be able to perform such acts as healing entire battlefields this comes at the cost of being unable to heal while commanding the wind to attack without aiding your foes."
1069,,400,Coin of Power,American Gods,Benevolence ,"Of protection, anyhoo. This is either a gold or a silver coin, representing respectively the sun and the moon. It can have a myriad variety of powers, being the centerpiece of a god’s might. Placed on a fresh grave it can resurrect a dead person so long as it remains in contact with their body, or it can give you fantastic luck.

But with you it has a more specific power, though it depends whether or not you enjoy that. For you, this coin provides you protection from the powers of gods and spirits. It conceals you from their sight, hides your thoughts from those who would view them and obscures your future, and reduces strong gods to mortal strength when trying it against you.

Or you can use it to bring a person back to life, including yourself if you die while in physical contact with it. Once used thus, it does better than its counterpart and brings them back to actual life, but can’t be sued for anything for the rest of the jump."
1070,,400,Interference Tolerance,Kane Chronicles,Benevolence ,"In this world, animal products often have residual life forces in them, which can interfere with magic. This is why magicians generally stick to wearing plant based clothing. However, you don’t need to worry about this, because like Sadie you have enough tolerance to such things that ignoring it altogether in the name of fashion won’t hinder you at all. This resilience also applies to other magic systems, and other weaknesses. Short of enemy action, any material capable of interfering with your magic can be disregarded without issue."
1071,,400,A Peacock Holding the World in its Beak,Grant Morrison’s 18 Days,Benevolence ,"No beast, be it ever so wild or trained to the acts of war will ever raise claw, tooth, or flame against you. No weapon made from any animal, be it bone, feather, or sinew, can ever harm you, and no fire kindled of wood can burn you. All poisons and venoms of the living world do nothing to you that is harmful in the slightest. Furthermore, in your presence, all those you have given your protection to shall be likewise safe from all such things.

For purposes of this blessing, all living things that lack at least the sentience of a man are considered beasts... including men temporarily stripped of their free will or rational thought."
1072,,400,Out of a Brighter Age ,Grant Morrison’s 18 Days,Benevolence ,"The Great Autumn Afternoon of the Third Age begins and the Superwarriors become prey to a new misery. Disease. Imperfection. Decay.

Not for you. While your curse is that you are incarnated in this age itself for the first time, it is not on you that the passing ages of the world can hope to make an impact. You find yourself immune, utterly unaffected by any and all attempts to change or transform you that do not have your consent.

It does not matter if it’s a petty sorcerer trying it or the Cosmic Law of the Universe you are in. Unless you allow it, your little pocket of Brahman remains as it is."
1073,,400,Primordial Spring Morning ,Grant Morrison’s 18 Days,Benevolence ,"All beings in the Satya Yuga are without vice and full of compassion. All humanity shall be living saints and there shall be no need for religion or faith. All humanity will be tall, powerfully built, honest, youthful, vigorous, well spoken, and full of virtue. There will be no need for agriculture or mining, for the Earth shall yield up her riches on her own.

There is something about you that is not of this world. Something purer, truer... something ancient. It seems that the Yajnatek labs were particularly successful with you, and they accomplished something they’d only barely dreamed of.

The memory of the Golden Age is strong in you, and it pours off of you into the world. Wherever you go, the world remembers the Dawn with you. Weather turns pleasant and mild, things like disease, age, and fear start fading from the land. The Earth grows bountiful to absurd extents, such as it was in those glorious days when the world was new.

While at no point will this make people physically equal to what they were in the Dawn of the Universe, the longer you stay around, the more of your power you put into actively enhancing your effort, the closer to the Satya Yuga the world around you gets. You get to decide the area this occurs across, but the larger the area, the more the effects are proportionately diluted. 

While the ethical, moral, and environmental effects can get right back to the first age, the martial effects you can cause cap out at making things about two thirds of what a modern day Superwarrior can do.

Your physical and mental attributes are increased to the point where you now stand as far above a normal Superwarrior as they do above the rank and file of the Third Age. Your speed is as lightning, your blows could shatter mountains, and your skin withstand blows that could crack a continent.

In future jumps, you find yourself the absolute epitome of whatever race, type, being, or entity you come to be. Whatever the reasons might be for someone to not be such, like blood, magic, curses or the decline of the very world itself, none apply to you in any way, shape or form. You are the greatest, mightiest, wisest and most perfect being there can possibly be for your race/species etc. If there was a first generation, you belong to it, though this does not change your starting location or time.

1074,,400,Hungry Hungry Hunter,Castlevania - Order of Ecclesia,Benevolence ,"It’s good for a hunter of monsters to have a healthy appetite; you’ll need it to build muscle and help your body recover from the wounds you will inevitably take. With that said, what you have is something that cannot be called a healthy appetite because you put ‘healthy’ to utter shame when you get going. You’re capable of consuming a full course meal in record time only to turn around and ask for second or thirds. Oddly enough this doesn’t seem to ever affect your figure in any meaningful way. If you’re wondering where it all goes, the answer is directly into your health. Any food you consume grants you a form of regeneration, taking the nutrients and mass of your meal and adding it directly into your body. Similarly, medicine that you take kicks in immediately, no need to wait half an hour for relief to begin. Combine that with your ability to guzzle down a bowl of soup, a nice thick steak, and a milkshake to finish it off with, all within the span of a few seconds, and you’re extremely tough to put down so long as your larder holds out."
1075,,400,Connection Established,Castlevania - Order of Ecclesia,Benevolence ,"A single moment where time does not flow. A challenge proposed by the guardian of time. And the rewards to reap should you succeed. ...Sorry, what was I saying? And where did this swanky helmet come from? Once or twice per jump, usually around the halfway mark of any given journey, you'll find yourself... spacing out for a brief moment? When you come back to your senses you’ll find something clenched in your hand, trinkets, weapons, and spells or similar things. Where they came from is a mystery for the ages, but they are now yours. If you tried to hunt down their original owner, perhaps you’d find a man in a white suit who would give you a smile and a wave before utterly vanishing, as if he never existed to begin with."
1076,,400,The Weakness of Sorcery,Warhammer 40K: The Warp ,Benevolence ,"What are those who hide behind their spells, rituals and psychic powers? They are weak and cowardly. You will not suffer as these weaklings do. You are immensely resistant to all forms of supernatural attack, requiring completely overwhelming effects to breach your defenses. Spells and psychic powers that might have otherwise inflicted grievous wounds dissipate harmlessly against you, with only powers far beyond yours able to penetrate this defence."
1077,,400,A Fragment of Will,Warhammer 40K: The Warp ,Benevolence ,"One should support another in the fight against Chaos. Be it physical and material support in the form of soldiers and weapons, or more spiritually, like in your case. You are able to share fragments of your powers and abilities with others. While these fragments are always going to be far lesser than the greater whole, they offer a number of additional benefits to those gifted. Those who receive your gifts are far more resistant to outside influence, be it from the corrupting touch of Chaos or the mutating tides of the Warp. The very souls and bodies of the gifted are strengthened, their willpower heightened to unseen levels and their bodies filled with endless vigour. Last, but certainly not least, it allows the bearers of your power to perform miracles; even a guardsman could slay a traitor champion in a manner akin to David slaying Goliath."
1078,,400,Beholden to None,Warhammer 40K: The Warp ,Benevolence ,"Beings born of the Warp are compelled to act in certain ways by the concepts that help form them. This means that entities like Daemons cannot ever act against the concepts that shape their being; a Bloodletter cannot take up pacifism, nor Daemonettes forfeit their pursuit of sensation, as examples. Your ability to act against and ignore such compulsions mark you as a further anomaly among the beings of the Warp. You are able to ignore any manipulations and compulsions that force you to act in certain ways, be they physical (like genetically engineered behaviour), magical, psychic or conceptual in nature."
1079,,400,No Anathema        ,Warhammer 40K: The Warp ,Benevolence ,"Being an independent party in the Warp has some benefits indeed. Unlike Chaos, there’s no force to act as your opposite and counter. Mundane and supernatural strikes that you might have otherwise been more vulnerable against now do no more damage than they do against others. Any weaknesses you might possess no longer exist, and that which may harm you won’t do so more than usual."
1080,,400,Unbound,Warhammer 40K: The Warp ,Benevolence ,"Many Warp entities, namely Daemons, can often find themselves bound to a form and forced to serve a master that is not their patron. It’s an important thing, especially, to have measures in place against such fools who would bind and imprison you. You cannot ever be mutated or forced into forms against your own will by either mundane or supernatural measures, nor be forced to serve another’s whims by the same token."
1081,,400,Dragon Gem ,Disney Lorcana,Benevolence ,"A gem for warding off supernatural evil, works on a national scale. It can also, once per Jump, bring someone back from the dead. Try not to break it."
1082,,400,Divine Hero,Disney Lorcana,Benevolence ,"You have the raw physical power of a Demigod, like Hercules or Maui. Your strength is so great, it can warp reality and accomplish things no amount of strength should be able to, like wrangling a cyclone or holding up the sky."
1083,,400,Healing Glow,Disney Lorcana,Benevolence ,"You seem to have absorbed some of the powers of a healing plant, much like Rapunzel. Now with a small song you can heal and restore youth. Or with a different one, wither and destroy life. Maybe don’t do that."
1084,,400,Work With Iron,Changeling The Dreaming,Benevolence ,"Most Nockers cannot abide the touch of iron in any way, but your skin is resistant to its bite for some reason. This ability allows you to work in many real-world situations, and while other Nockers certainly envy you for this ability, they also consider your condition somewhat suspect. Not only are you immune to iron, but all of your chimerical works are similarly resistant to the metal of Banality."
1085,,400,Síocháin,Changeling The Dreaming,Benevolence ,"Legend speaks of fae that have achieved the impossible and found the delicate balance between their mortal selves and the fae souls within. The Síocháin, as they’re called, are thought to have discovered the balance between Glamour and Banality and have therefore found true immortality. Though many question whether the Síocháin even exist, commoners wonder whether or not they’re just happy stories to give desperate nobles hope at the end of their lives. Yet you are one such example of the legend being true, having found true balance between the fae and human aspects of yourself. Not only are you truly ageless, your mind capable of handling the passing of countless ages without losing that spark of joy and wonder, but you will never again have to spend Glamour to avoid the Mists taking away your memories and Undoing you. Countless others would hound you to the ends of the Dreaming itself should they learn just what you have achieved, looking for just a hint of how to achieve it themselves."
1086,,400,Blasphemous Stones,Castlevania - Lament of Innocence,Benevolence ,"Men have religion, and religion has sacred artifacts. Though you are a monster of the night, you also have such things. The Crimson and Ebony stones are what a vampire would consider a 'sacred relic', and you are an ideal welder for them. In your hands, artifacts are more powerful than they ought to be, and some of that power bleeds back into you. The Ebony Stone creates a zone of eternal night, and as a creature of the night, it also means that under this darkness you would be far stronger than you have any right to be, as well as oddly resistant to holy powers. But of course, that's just an example. You don't have the Ebony Stone... Do you?"
1087,,400,Yopple Employee,Yo-Kai Watch,Benevolence ,"You really are a yo-kai researcher. Yopple is a company in the yo-kai world responsible for creating the best of yo-kai technology, run by supergenius Steve Jaws. You’re one of the engineers taught the arts of their craft, and are capable of making the strange spiritech that they are capable of, creating things such as sentient machinery or turning model toys into giant mecha, maybe even coming up with a way to create robots that replicate existing yo-kai. With enough time and the right parts, you might even be able to create your own models of the yo-kai watch, or possibly put your own twist on the blueprints."
1088,,400,Magic healing plant,Grimms’ Fairy Tales,Benevolence ,"Three magic leaves or a root or similar which will perfectly resurrect the dead and heal all their wounds and injuries, even if completely dismembered, if placed on a dead body."
1089,,400,Ambassador To All ,Princess The Hopeful,Benevolence ,"In the days of the true Kingdom, it is rumoured organisations were founded with the broad goal of improving certain concepts by taking responsibility for it, and incorporating it into their magic so as to make it safer and more harmonious with humanity’s wellbeing. While much of the truth behind such institutions is lost, you in particular somehow have a quality of magical energy that inherently integrates other concepts you affect it with the love and friendship of the Light, bonding with it to create constructive phenomena at your fingertips to propagate the kindness and will to improve that created it.

While with this alone you surely can’t make vampires or werewolves perfectly safe overnight, you’re still quite talented at developing powers that can help them reconnect with their buried potential for humanity and benevolence, mitigate their aggression or hunger with your mere presence and even befriend beings tangentially connected to them like the Uratha’s totem spirits (though be wary of entities as malevolent as the Strix, who act with all the malice of the Darkness itself). And as a final note, unlike other Princesses you seem capable of joining, mastering and even founding multiple Embassies instead of committing yourself to one, potentially becoming an advocate for all humanity to the other facets of the cosmos."
1090,,400,Harmony With Nature,Princess The Hopeful,Benevolence ,"Legno, the principles of harmony and inner strength honed into an Invocation, does its best work with living things. Thus all your magic is empowered when you wield it to restore things to their natural state, nurture growth and prevent violence without committing violence yourself. In wild, untamed ecosystems your power is greatly strengthened, the hum of life all around you lending your mystical powers strength and complexity beyond the raw power you seem to exert-as if tuning into the inexhaustible vitality of life itself. In turn, the wilderness seems to protect you in subtle but useful ways. The weather is gentler wherever you go, predators give you early warning on their territory and savage your foes, even the trees around you seem to enjoy rapid but subtle growth in ways that open hidden paths or obscure your pursuers.

Moreover by investing your Light into either a natural environment or an urban one you can bless them to coexist and emulate each other’s strengths to improve each other. Instead of tearing out the weeds growing on a crumbling tenement, you could coax forth vines of concrete and leaves of cement to shore up the faults in the building. Instead of clearing out the dead wood in a forest, you could bring about rapid growth subsuming it into a magically created elaborate treehouse. The natural spirits bound to such locations are never harmed by this joining, instead blessed by the Light as their habitats are; indeed, if such places did not already have such a spirit your blessings would create one with an innate gratitude towards you for the gift of life. With this you can also gift animals with the fruits of civilisation and sentient beings adaptations to thrive in nature too, such as making a bear intelligent enough to politely converse or gifting a man the sight of an eagle."
1091,,400,Miss Fixit,Princess The Hopeful,Benevolence ,"Whether it’s fixing someone’s broken down car or wrapping a bloody stump, it’s all about helping people for a Mender. So why should you have to choose the how of it? Henceforth, all magic you have that repairs machines can be used to heal living things of flesh and bone equally well while all magic you can use to heal wounds can also fix broken devices or complex machinery just as well. In the case of the former, this generally manifests as spontaneously manifested gadgets that can heal somebody, while in the latter the magic simply regrows missing components or smooths over broken machinery. Either way, you’ll be spending a lot less time fretting over what skillset you need to help those around you and more time actually helping. You also have a good mind for mechanics at a casual level, and could easily fix your own broken down car with the right tools as long as the engine still works."
1092,,400,Fighting Fit,Princess The Hopeful,Benevolence ,"When Champions dream, they dream of grand victories: Mountains knocked down, rivers wrestled from their paths and wicked armies defeated singlehandedly. How you’ve treated your body might not match those aspirations yet, but you’re certainly making an effort. Somehow, your physique has been honed as if you had been training for a cross-terrain marathon and a stint in the army simultaneously. If that isn’t enough, you can reinforce your physical actions with the Light to fight harder, better, faster, stronger in short bursts if you’ve ever needed to ram the monster under the bed’s head through solid concrete or pick a lock blind. Even when you aren’t doing it deliberately, when you spring into action sudden reverses of fortune and twists of fate make your efforts dramatically superior- as if you were living through an action movie. If it’s implausible for you to shimmy up a wall by your fingertips, you can do it with enough parkour. If you’re outnumbered and outgunned, you still have a chance to win a gunfight with the six-shooter in your pocket. And throwing a knife over your shoulder could see it ricochet unerringly into an unseen gunman with enough force to knock him off his feet. All of this just happens more and more as your mastery of the Light heightens, and surges drastically when you spring into action specifically to help or protect someone else."
1093,,400,Formidable,MTG - Tarkir                                ,Benevolence ,"When you fight alongside others in a large group, or alongside mighty beasts, you can use your collective presence as a medium through which to channel the power of nature, allowing you to spend red or green mana to enhance or evoke new potential from yourself or those fighting alongside you. You can teach this method to others."
1094,,400,Ferocious,MTG - Tarkir                                ,Benevolence ,"While you fight alongside a mighty beast or superhuman warrior, you can use their presence as a kind of natural idol, a mystical tool or ritual implement which magnifies the power of your spells or summons or enhances your allies, so long as they align with red or green mana. You can teach this method to others."
1095,,400,Bolster,MTG - Tarkir                                ,Benevolence ,"You can channel mana through your forces during training or battle, causing the weakest amongst your followers to more rapidly absorb skills and strength from the stronger, until all your forces have reached the power (though not gained all the abilities) of the strongest. You can teach this method to others."
1096,,400,Outlast,MTG - Tarkir                                ,Benevolence ,"You can channel mana into yourself and others, preventing exhaustion and, while fighting, slowly making you stronger and tougher over time. These benefits fade at the end of the battle, though you are still not exhausted. You can teach this method to others."
1097,,400,Ultimate Devotion,Valkyrie Anatomia,Benevolence ,"Valkyries are the nigh unstoppable maidens of battle, yet almost all of them owe their loyalty to a higher power than even they. Obedience draws out their true capabilities through trials and difficulties. This grants that same capability to you, improving your capabilities and determination when you truly believe and support another person and are following their orders. Additionally, you improve your techniques and abilities more swiftly, though this does not remove any limits to your power."
1098,,400,Weapon DNA,Valkyrie Anatomia,Benevolence ,"By nature, Homunculi are magical beings. Therefore, their magical reserves are greater than that of an ordinary mortal. Such a gift shouldn’t be left to a single individual now, should it? With this, you will gain the ability to draw magical essence from within your body and transfer it over to another person. Should this not be enough for you, or you simply don’t want to let go of your magic, you may also extract some of your body or other source of DNA, such as blood, infuse it with another for a temporary increase in magical capacity. This may be done by any means, whether by ingesting it as a drink or meal, or a blood transfusion. It won’t last for more than a few hours, however. Post-Jump will allow the transfer of any energy source, such as chakra, ki, etc. as well as increase your capacity for them."
1099,,400,Homewards,Valkyrie Anatomia,Benevolence ,"Life and death are cheap in a world constantly embroiled in conflict. Even famous warriors and captains are unable to always return safe and sound, despite what they promise. Sometimes, though, a miracle does happen. You can guarantee to somebody that you will return to them still alive and, once per ten years, you may enforce that, returning to them without fail so long as you made the promise less than a year ago, though not necessarily as you intended. This will not guarantee a victory against an unbeatable foe, merely survival."
1100,,400,Small Hitbox,Touhou Luna Nights,Benevolence ,"It’s very hard to actually hit you with something. In fact, any attack that strikes you outside your stomach area seems to just pass through you harmlessly. Anything that does hit your stomach will hurt you just as much as normal though. This does not apply to things that are not actually attacks."
1101,,400,Subverted Sealing,Touhou Luna Nights,Benevolence ,"Your powers, items and other special abilities cannot be permanently lost. While people are still able to suppress, steal or otherwise neutralise your own powers, you will find such a thing will not be permanent. Indeed, in most cases, it shall be as simple as having a solution immediately falling into your lap; perhaps an unexpected saboteur shows up to get your powers back, perhaps the weak point has been sealed away in the very next room, perhaps they may even fumble their magical sealing and put one far too weak on you that you can break through by applying a bit of effort. Only when they’ve been exceptionally thorough – such as creating an entire alternate dimension to nullify your abilities – will you find it more difficult to break, although you are always guaranteed to discover a solution.

As a side benefit, you will also find your enemies are completely convinced that their sealing worked on you; nothing short of demonstrating to them personally that your powers are back will make them think otherwise. And when multiple people were involved in sealing you, you can be assured that none of them will share the knowledge you’ve broken the seal with each other. Many opponents will enter a battle with you grossly overconfident, those with a sense of honour may choose to limit themselves for a “fair” fight, though again this will end upon realising you’ve broken the seal."
1102,,400,Loyal Servant ,Castlevania (Netflix) ,Benevolence ,"Whatever master you serve, the depths of your loyalty has made you capable of things that should frankly be impossible for someone like you. This is limited to more physical activities- including overpowering and killing a master vampire, or creating an army from hell that can threaten an entire country in the span of a single year- but the boost will depend on the depths of your loyalty. If you’re only inclined towards your master, the boost will be small- but if you are willing to die for them, then your loyalty will be rewarded in kind. Note that this has its limits; you can’t knock down castles or fight off armies with loyalty alone, after all. "
1103,,400,Redeemed,Castlevania (Netflix) ,Benevolence ,"Even a corrupt priest can repent, and find the Lord once again- even in the deepest pits of darkness, or when their actions are, indeed, being controlled by the devil. Even if by all rights becoming an undead monstrosity should make you an abomination in the eyes of God, his love will not leave you- and even if the flames of his wrath burn you, they will not burn as hotly. Essentially, your abilities no longer conflict with your nature or each other, and you gain an incredible resistance to your own powers. A zombie priest could stand in a river, bless it to make the waters holy, and stand in the new lake of holy water for several minutes without succumbing where undead stronger than them would be vaporized in an instant. "
1104,,400,Blackbox,Amphibia,Benevolence ,"So you’ve gone and gotten your head chopped off. Well no problem there, you’re a robot after all. Your head can now survive on its own without any complications resulting from a lack of a body. Additionally if your head is separated from your body it automatically becomes indestructible to everything except divine level entities."
1105,,400,True Faith,Vampire: The Masquerade,Benevolence ,"The Lasombra once strongly infiltrated the Catholic church, back in the nights when it wielded incredible political power of course. Regardless of what you believe in, you possess True Faith in it, the mystical quality that allows even a mortal to ward away vampires and exorcise demons. Correspondingly, you yourself are immune to True Faith and other hostile powers of belief or divine power which would target you due to your unholy nature."
1106,,400,Un-curseable,Vampire: The Masquerade,Benevolence ,"The Assamites seem to have terrible luck when it comes to getting cursed. The Tremere curse that prevents them from drinking Vitae overtook the Baali curse that gave them an addiction to diablerie which in turn replaced whatever their original curse from Caine was. Perhaps you have been cursed so many times there is simply no more room for more or perhaps you are a shining throwback to the days when Caine cursed every clan except the Children of Haqim. (And never mind the several other Clans who claim they were the only ones who weren’t cursed. They are all lying.) Regardless, you are immune to any further curses, no matter how great or small. This does not remove any existing curses however, such as the ones that make you a vampire."
1107,,400,Diamond Soul        ,Kill Six Billion Demons,Benevolence ,"It seems that, some time in the past, you studied a Shard of the Worldstone, a massive gem that was destroyed over 30,000 years ago. Through this studying, you have learned how to allow your body to take on Gem-like properties. When using this power, so long as you don’t move, you can’t be knocked back or down, and even a regular human who has this power would be as durable as a diamond, and this scale with how durable you are."
1108,,400,Destiny,Kill Six Billion Demons,Benevolence ,"There are many stories from many worlds, about heroes defeating nigh-impossible odds. They are mostly bullshit, made to placate the masses about how someone might come and save them. But maybe you are different? By writing a story about yourself, you may follow the path written. You go the way your story went, all the way to the end. Well, at least theoretically. Any tests you set for yourself must be overcome without the help of the Story, and “I win” stories simply don’t work. So, don’t expect to defeat Jagganoth just because your story says you did."
1109,,400,Missanga ,Wild Arms 2,Benevolence ,"This very colorful amulet brings good luck to its wearer, helping him avoid unnecessary confrontations, take the best treasure unnoticed, hit enemies weak points more often, dodge fatal attacks and in general make everything get better for its user."
1110,,400,Full Libra,Wild Arms 2,Benevolence ,"These scales have an enchantment that imparts a sense of equilibrium and balance on the user, protecting not only his mind against any harm, but also making his body resist poison, disease and transformations. Having one of these means you cannot be defeated indirectly, only a punishing amount of damage can take you down."
1111,,400,Life Giving Orb,Wild Arms 2,Benevolence ,"A magic orb filled with lifeforce, at certain intervals the orb pulses like a heartbeat and heals those around, filling them with life and removing wounds, regenerating organs and limbs. Pulses once every few minutes."
1112,,400,Holy Grail,Wild Arms 2,Benevolence ,"This cup is a popular enchanted item in this world, any liquid put on this cup will be blessed, giving the drinker good luck and a protection against harm in general. Any harm that is not specifically targeted will just avoid them and their belongings and any matters of chance or luck will favor the blessed. "
1113,,400,Regeneration,Wild Arms 2,Benevolence ,"Even more than others of your kind, your healing is really strong. In addition to your normal healing rates, you can further increase the speed in which your body recovers with training, subjecting yourself to damage while being full with drained vitality will make your body adapt to the point that your wounds will visibly close moments after being made."
1114,,400,Madonna of Destruction,Wild Arms 2,Benevolence ,"You have a special constitution, either your body or soul is special or maybe the connection between them makes it so that you are a perfect ingredient for any rituals, sacrifices or similar. What’s useful about it? Being compatible with these rituals means you have some special quality or rare characteristic and so every time you get identified as a target for a ritual or sacrifice you will also discover you possess some special or rare quality that you may find helpful. It's almost as if you were being compensated for the trouble.

In case of you being valid as a sacrifice to the guardians to protect the world means you can access a part of their powers and serve as a priest vessel for them. If you can be turned into a vessel for an invading parallel universe then you are also capable of unleashing all their powers without suffering harm (though you won’t necessarily be in control of your body). It won’t always be immediately useful to you, but the more you discover the capabilities of this constitution the more chances you have to find some characteristic that a clever jumper could turn into an advantage."
1115,,400,Sole Survivor,Wild Arms 2,Benevolence ,"Freak accidents, explosions of exotic energy, being exposed to alien blood, an unknown virus, bitten by radioactive spiders, used as a human sacrifice for demon summoning... All these events that should result in death, deforming mutations, sanity damage or simply death and yet some people not only survive but come out of it better than before, maybe they just are made of sterner stuff like heroes of stories and you can be like them.

Whenever you get involved in bizarre situations or accidents, not only are you guaranteed survival and full integrity of self, but you also get out of these situations with extra advantages, if there are any possible positive side effects in your situation then they will apply to you 100% of the time and even if there aren’t, the usual harm you would get will be walked off and you will instead develop new talents or abilities related to the event you survived, just like Ashley did.

At least the first time these events happen to you, more than that and you get the same chance of dying as everyone else. Though if you have some kind of safeguard or other 1-ups, you may spend them to invoke the first part of this perk: To guarantee survival and get superpowers from freak accidents or the like. This perk will not save you from mundane deaths, only extraordinary situations qualify."
1116,,400,Principle of Nonviolence,Mage: The Ascension,Benevolence ,"The Jina are a group of Jain ascetics who live lives free of material possessions or worldly influence. So great is their devotion to pacifism that they strain their water before drinking and sweep the path ahead of them as they walk, all so that they do not accidentally harm any insects. They are considered a moral center of the Tradition and their advice is sought on difficult questions of ethics. You have internalized the desire to harm no other to an equal degree: none of your actions will ever do more harm than you intended. A punch meant to knock someone out will never kill, no matter how great your strength. Even bombing a building would leave its very confused occupants standing unharmed among the rubble."
1117,,400,Strength Through Service,Mage: The Ascension,Benevolence ,"The Nephandi gain their powers through their dark patrons, most of whom are actually the vile dreams of the Malfeans around the mouth of Oblivion in the Underworld. When mass death occurs in the living world, a Tempest brews and the Malfeans awaken. This has the unfortunate side effect that whenever the Nephandi get too good at their jobs, they abruptly lose all their magick as their dread masters disappear, most recently leading to their defeat by a joint Technocracy-Traditions alliance during World War II. But when you are granted supernatural power, you slowly find it being twisted until it belongs to you in truth. After long enough, you’ll eventually find you can draw upon your power no matter what your master has to say about it. Even if they try to take it back or even die and are no longer available as a power source, you’ll find you are perfectly capable of continuing to provide whatever you need to keep it usable all by yourself."
1118,,400,Valiant Heroine ,Cereza and the Stray Demon,Benevolence ,"Many times, Cereza will look back on her journey into the woods wondering if it was a mistake. Many times, she will find the strength to carry on, determined to save her beloved mother. You draw strength from your connections to your loved ones and your determination to succeed, enduring more and fighting harder for what truly matters to you. Differences in skill or power can give way in a pinch to raw passion, and the odds favour you the more you challenge them. However, that is not just empty rancour in your case. As long as you keep fighting, there will be a happy ending at the end of your struggles, even in the most dire and bittersweet of circumstances. Your journey may pit you against ferocious foes and include heartwrenching betrayals, but if you can slay your final foe there will be always something rewarding at the end. Even if you only reunite with your mother for a fleeting moment, you may well make a friend so dedicated he will protect your child long after your death."
1119,,400,Anti-Magic Cloak,The Owl House V1,Benevolence ,"No, this cloak doesn’t have an aura with a mixture of red and black like Asta does when he activates Anti-Magic....although....it could. Would you want that? I won’t tell if you don’t tell. So yeah, this is an option, the cloak’s appearance can look like Asta’s Anti-Magic aura. But I am afraid it isn’t on the same level, since this cloak might defend you from magic, but not magic cast by the strongest witches. The cloak’s design and color is pretty much up to you."
1120,,400,Teachings of the Nox,Elden Ring - Caelid Wilds,Benevolence ,"The Town of Sorcery can claim a connection to the Eternal City of Nokron, as Sellians are said to be descended from the city’s inhabitants. Just as your ancestors’ cities cut off from the rest of the world, protected by ancient magics, so too can you offer this level of protection. You are a master when it comes to creating arcane barriers, ones that can keep out all but the mightiest and most determined individuals, at least if they can't meet the requirements for dispelling them."
1121,,400,Purifying Flames,Elden Ring - Caelid Wilds,Benevolence ,"After the disastrous battle that left Caelid what it is today, many of Radahn’s soldiers took up the task of keeping the Scarlet Rot at bay. Utilizing the power of fire, you can keep even the influence of something like the Scarlet Rot from consuming everything, keeping it at bay for untold millennia. Given enough time, you could perhaps even purge it entirely and other similar corruptive forces from the land. Of course, that’s assuming that the divine Rot won’t attempt to stop you."
1122,,400,Armour of Midnight ,Warhammer Fantasy: Dark Elves,Benevolence ,"Pity Malekith, for this suit of armour replicating the enchantments on his is a choice for you, not a necessity of survival. Rather than fusing themselves to your flesh to survive some horrific burning, the modified enchantments simply fit as if a second layer of skin leaving no chinks to exploit their considerable protection-and part to free you at your will. Forged from the hardest meteoric iron, few mortal weapons can harm it’s tremendous protection at all between the strong plates and the mighty enchantments. Magic is deflected by its wards too, but mundane attacks are particularly blunted by its protections. And should injury somehow reach you anyway, it’s inherent life-sustaining magics will greatly mitigate the wounds you take-whether by halting blood curses or staunching and sealing gut wounds.

This comes with a replica of the Supreme Spellshield: A greatshield that absorbs magic then unleashes its energies back at foes."
1123,,400,Storied Treasures Seized ,Warhammer Fantasy: Dark Elves,Benevolence ,"Many are the Dark Elves who have sought some advantage through artifice where their own lack of mystical training came up short. And many are those who paid a heavy price-though for you, it seems some foul taint of your Druchii soul eases such restrictions for you. Fortune favours your efforts to seek artifacts of all kinds, ancient temples conveniently having a side passage bypassing more dangerous chambers or crates of lost amulets washing up near you while you travel. Furthermore, the more vital such artifacts are to a truly important goal of yours the more their costs or other deleterious effects are suppressed by an instinctive flex of Dhar-which also makes them more powerful in your hands. A meagre ambition will provide little protection, as will a role for the artifact tangential to its achievement-but when you MUST draw a cursed sword to secure the destiny denied to you for a thousand years or more, you’ll find it burns with black flames and moves like an extension of your body."
1124,,400,Body of a Titan,Destiny: The Guardians,Benevolence ,"Your strength has reached levels that even other Titans boggle at, able to lift up to 2 tons with difficulty. Your light passively reinforces any armor you wear, letting you withstand twice the punishment before falling. Your battle instincts have sharpened to the point that you could fight without thinking, ripping into your enemies like a raging bull. Your abilites shine when on the defensive, able to take on forces twice the strength of your own and still have even odds of winning."
1125,,400,Light Within,Destiny: The Guardians,Benevolence ,"You are something that has never been seen before, someone who could wield the Light without a Ghost or the Traveler. You are an endless source of Light, refilling your reserves even in the darkest of locations. This inner Light allows you to resist any attempts to suppress or drain your abilities, allowing you to resurrect even in Darkness Zones. This perk acts as a Capstone Booster for 600cp origin perks, your inner Light enhancing your abilities further."
1126,,400,Apple of Virtue,I’m The Grim Reaper,Benevolence ,"This strange-looking apple is, in truth, an ancient artifact made to be a way to purify sinners and give to them a chance to escape from their eternal punishment. You receive this same apple that can be divided in 12 slices. Each slice, when ingested by someone, purifies them from any sin they might have committed before, removing a Sinner’s Mark if they have it, and removes any negative karma. It also removes any unwanted supernatural corruption, resetting them to their previous condition before being corrupted if they want it. Each slice of the apple, or the entire apple if all of its 12 slices has been eaten, will regenerate or reappear in your Warehouse at the start of the next jump after being consumed."
1127,,400,Ordered to Never Die,I’m The Grim Reaper,Benevolence ,"When you were created, God ordered you to never die and, as his words have power, you decided to obey. This granted you a form of limited immortality. You have much more endurance than before, being able to fight at full capacity even if your heart is ripped out from your body or stay alive and conscious even if you’re decapitated or if your brain is damaged. You don’t need any vital organs anymore, as you’ll be able to function normally even without them. The only way to actually kill you is by completely destroying your whole body beyond repair. In a few words: you get the same endurance of a Reaper. Unlike a Reaper’s flesh puppet, your body is capable of healing itself, being able to regenerate entire limbs in a few hours."
1128,,400,Humanizing Effect,I’m The Grim Reaper,Benevolence ,"You have a peculiar calming presence, capable of even forcing a berserking monster to calm down after around thirty minutes of exposure. This presence’s effect is especially good with beings with some kind of lack of the concept of humanity, for example, a Reaper losing their humanity, making their demon take over them, not only calming them but also making them recover their lost humanity. Thanks to this effect, any being with difficulty controlling their power’s influence can train their control with little risk."
1129,,400,Avatar,"Hunt, Kill, Repeat",Benevolence ,"The Olympians may have taken over the world by themselves, but keeping it occupied is a different matter. There’s only six of them, and one of them left to live a normal life. To solve this problem, You have undergone the procedure, and now have “peak human” physical abilities, and have received training in hand-to-hand and armed combat. Remember you’re nothing compared to an Olympian, though. The Avatars play the role of mooks in-series. They’re all brainwashed to forget their former identities, becoming nothing more than the mindless weapons of the Olympians. Fortunately, they seem to have botched the procedure with you. Your mind is free, and you remember who you are."
1130,,400,Man Behind The Men,Jump Force,Benevolence ,"What kind of villain does all their fighting in person? One with terrible management and delegation skills, that's who. With this Perk, you'll be able to enhance the minions and Followers under you, granting them heightened abilities and better tactics so long as they remain under your banner. It won't be a world-shattering enhancement in and of itself, but it's a strong enough one that what might've previously been an even match would become a one-sided rout in your forces' favor."
1131,,400,Power Of Friendship ,Jump Force,Benevolence ,"Any true hero can tell you, even those of the most brooding nature, that one's true power comes from their friends. Not just in the inspirational sense like with J-Skills, but as an actual tangible fight-deciding force. Whenever your friends are counting on you and you're the line of defense between them and harm, your overall abilities will increase based on the level of threat. Stopping a playground bully wouldn't be more than a small boost, but saving the very souls of your dearest friends would result in magnitudes of additional power. This boon works both ways, too; if you're in trouble and your friends step in, they'll get a minor version of this boost as they seek to protect you. This only counts for true friends, though; nameless minions/Followers won't count, but Companions almost always will."
1132,,400,Revival Orb ,Guild Wars 2,Benevolence ,"A unique development made by Asuras and Necromancers. Place it on top of a recently deceased person, and watch them come back to life! Requires a month of recharging after use."
1133,,400,Phalanx Strength,Guild Wars 2,Benevolence ,"When you fight, your strength and might grows ever steadily; say, 1% every couple of seconds. Not only that, but this increase is passed on to any such allies, no matter how many there may be. Putting you in the middle of an army could literally turn the tide. The power increase caps out at 25%."
1134,,400,I Believe,Guild Wars 2,Benevolence ,"By reciting mantras, hymns or simply uttering your own beliefs aloud, you can extend the effects of all your virtues (both the literal magical ones and the less visible personal ones, such a courage and determination) to all allies within hearing distance. This allows you to greatly enhance any fighting force you are a part of."
1135,,400,Smothering the Flame,Guild Wars 2,Benevolence ,"You, much like the Charr before you, have gazed upon divinity and rejected it utterly. No divine hand will guide your path, no Avatar or manifestation can force worship from you, no prodding or prophecy from the gods will chain your fate, nor will any malediction from high above strike you down. The gods cannot touch you; You are free."
1136,,400,I Dream of Peace,Guild Wars 2,Benevolence ,"Sylvari are pacifist by nature, taking arms only when necessity commands them. You embody this, and as long as you don't take up arms against others, they will find their blows ineffective against you."
1137,,400,Yes More Heroes,Beast: The Primordial,Benevolence ,"It's really unfair that Incarnate Beasts can just trivially and permanently remove your powers. Let's rectify that. You now have complete immunity to having any of your powers stolen, suppressed, drained, or removed. Not only that, but you can inspire people to follow your example and occasionally run into people with Heroic potential that, with time, you can awaken not through trauma like a Beast, but by building them up."
1138,,400,9 Lives,World of Final Fantasy: Mirage Keeper,Benevolence ,A version of what Tama does for you and your cousins. This is a rather meh version of a one-up. It only kicks in when there isn't anything preventing it. As for what it does? It is a regenerating source of revival of the time traversing sort. Essentially it rewinds time a bit prior to your death then kicks you out to your warehouse. 9 Charges. Each spent charge requires a week to be recharged.
1139,,400,The Blasphemous Depiction ,Mummy: The Curse,Benevolence ,"An ancient traitor to Irem created this blasphemous statue of the Judge of Death called Arem-Abfu in order to bring the Nameless Empire down from the inside. With the statue, you can resurrect a ghost in a corpse. The resultant body does not need to eat or breather, does not age, and cannot die from illness, and can only be killed if the body is severely damaged. Its curse is that viewers lose their ability to determine what is important and to filter out irrelevant information, driving them insane. As long as you own the statue, its curse is dormant even to other viewers."
1140,,400,Integral Soul,Fullmetal Alchemist,Benevolence ,"You’re not exactly from here, so why should your soul get torn out and eaten like the rest of the people here? Sure you might have a Gate of Truth if you bought Alchemy, but that doesn’t mean you’re beholden to the rules of this universe. You like your soul just where it is, and because of that, and your outsider nature, it stays just where it is, and unchanged to boot. Whether it's getting sucked out through a transmutation circle, getting eaten by a Homunculus, or having it tampered with, your soul just doesn’t allow it. That being said, attacking your soul by say... wiping off the thing it's anchored to, attacking it directly, and damaging it will all still work."
1141,,400,Blessing of War,Darksiders,Benevolence ,"War has given you his blessing. The more battle and violence you are surrounded by or participate in, the faster you regenerate both health and stamina. You also gain an aptitude for learning anything related to war. Swinging a sword a few times at an enemy will teach you the basics of swordplay and watching a battle for the first time will grant a basic understanding of tactics."
1142,,400,White Blut,Bleach,Benevolence ,"The bloody inheritance of all true Quincy. Blut is the natural power of Quincy blood, a trait that can be activated to greatly empower their living bodies. Through flowing Reishi into their blood vessels, they can take one of two traits at a time, each exclusive to each other. The first is Arterie, taking the form of glowing red veins beneath the skin. Arterie grants a very large increase to physical power, both strength and speed skyrocketing when in use. The second form, Vene, provides a similar effect to an Arrancar’s Hierro. Blue veins spread where you are struck, having greatly enhanced your body’s overall durability. This Vene can even halt excessive bleeding in existing wounds. 

The improvement gained depends both on the mastery of the user and the power they possess to give to the Blut. While your power may or may not lack, your skill is undoubted. You can greatly magnify either attribute when in use and have even learned to extend the Blut from your body, creating powerful forcefields in an area to defend from attacks or increase your allies’ power. This mastery might even translate to direct control of your own blood for other intentions, such as preventing others from controlling your physical form through the blood, as well as allowing you to greatly boost non-spiritual powers of the blood with your spiritual energy. Having naturally mastered the art, your Blut may even switch on reflex to attack or defend as you most need."
1143,,400,Age Bringing Glory,Bleach,Benevolence ,"Age is a strange thing to the Shinigami. While the general rule is that the more powerful one is, the slower one ages, it can often move at different rates for unique individuals. Two captains of similar age may look entirely different, one a beautiful woman in her middle years and the other a wrinkled old man, despite the old man being by far the more powerful. But unlike mortal beings, the minds and bodies of the Shinigami rarely become frail. However old you may become, you appear to retain the full capabilities of your youthful prime. An aging elder’s body still bulges with muscular power and a thousand year old doctor’s mind remains as sharp as ever. 

The Reiatsu flows out strongly and indeed, there are some ways in which this age only makes you more deadly. The passing of years will slowly, independent of your actual training or learning, reveal to you secrets and developments to your skillset. The idle consideration given to one’s powers or skills happens to uncover new ways to use old tricks, a method to slightly improve your control over a fire-based release or give a flash of inspiration to solve a long mulled over problem. These improvements come slowly but steadily, mainly to the things that you focus on in life. A legendary Kido Master would naturally find his spells and casting of spells to improve as he grew older."
1144,,400,Bringer of Life,Bleach,Benevolence ,"The doctors of the Fourth Division can save even someone with truly horrendous injuries, if they get there in time. But you? As long as they had a pulse a few seconds earlier, you can bring them to fighting fitness. From Kirinji’s training, as Unohana’s apprentice or your own self study, you’ve reached a similar level of medical mastery. Your mixture of mundane medicine and comprehensive knowledge of healing Kido allows for you to effortlessly restore even the most mangled of forms. Both raw damage and a stunning variety of ill effects can be removed with your attention, as well as easily organising the transfer of Reiryoku to reinforce tired warriors. 

Your techniques will often rely on your personal Reiryoku to sustain, though you still possess inhuman skill with ordinary medicine to complement and make up for the absence of power. If you had quite the amount of power yourself, it wouldn’t be impossible to restore someone to healthy fitness immediately after you melted every scrap of flesh from their bones, over and over again. So long as it’s short of actual death, or at least swiftly after death, you might as well be able to heal anyone you can get your hands on. "
1145,,400,The Name Means To Protect,Bleach,Benevolence ,"Only for the sake of others, do you find your truest power unleashed. Being exerted through the soul, Reiryoku naturally increases as emotions burn hot but more than most, you find your power running wild when you fight for the safety and happiness of another person. Spiritually, mentally and physically, you find your power growing temporarily while directly in need to protect another, with this benefit increasing depending on how closely bonded you are and how desperate the need for help is. 

A stranger being beaten up by bullies might only inspire increased confidence in your own abilities than any true growth in power. The same stranger about to be slain by a hungry Hollow, desperately calling for help? You could fight on even when exhausted as energy temporarily fills you to a little more than your normal limit. But something like a dear friend begging for you to stand up and fight again, their one saviour to whom they entrust their heart, could even bring you back from the dead and force you to an entirely new level of strength. The power gained will leave once the danger ends and too much power gained at once can leave you tired, drained or even unconscious for a while. "
1146,,400,Power of Friendship,Bleach,Benevolence ,"The hero doesn’t fight alone, not these days. There’s no reason that the friends he fights for can’t give it a go themselves to help him out, especially not when they’re in your presence. Your close friends and trusted allies grow stronger alongside you as you fight and continue to adventure, provided they’re joining you in your struggles. To a lesser extent, they can take advantage of the speed at which you grow if they also make efforts to improve, likely to greatly increase their efforts. 

What makes you special in particular is the ability to awaken entirely new abilities in those around you, sometimes as a direct result of energy you project and sometimes as a coincidence of being wrapped up in the same schemes you’re trapped in. The result is that normal friends or those too weak to really keep up in the struggles you face are able to develop powers that help bring them nearer your level. They might discover sudden Fullbring heritage to save themselves when you couldn’t reach them or suddenly unlock a supposedly impossible transformation to recover lost power as a Hollow. Once they have their new powers, they’ll be able to progress them as if they were truly inherent abilities."
1147,,400,Reborn from the Ashes,Gloryhammer,Benevolence ,"A hero cannot be defeated simply by making them die, and now neither can you. Once per Jump, if you are killed, 24 hours later you awaken unharmed in a safe location near where you died."
1148,,400,Holier Than Thou,Seven Deadly Sins,Benevolence ,"You certainly put the Holy into Holy Knight and thankfully it’s not just the attitude. Your very being is an absolute bulwark against corruption or possession of any kind, an inviolable sanctuary of which no dark force may defile and no spirit may enter uninvited. If you hold faith in anything, this incredible defence against corruption also bolsters the strength of your faith, making it even harder to convince you that it is wrong to believe in what you do. Of course, if you decided to purposefully lower the protections around your being and let something in, it would only be so that you could influence it over time. If you purposefully allow a being to possess you then you may, without their knowledge, slowly affect them so that they become a more good or more evil being over time. Perhaps even a vile demon could be turned into a heroic warrior if you had enough time to work with them in this fashion, though it may take years to do."
1149,,400,Self Porkrifice,Seven Deadly Sins,Benevolence ,"Pigs aren’t the most combat capable of beings. Certainly, there are many famous Pig fighters in the long history of your great race but compared against the vast number of your porcine kind that exists, these lucky few are one in a million miracles. Still, even if you are weak and unskilled, it doesn’t mean you can’t try to support your friends when they’re in need. And at least that bulk of yours lets your protect them better than anyone else. Long as you can get in front of it in time, you’re able to take all of an attack that would normally hit an ally, suffering its effects and power yourself to spare them the pain. Pigs are tough and quicker than one might think, so as you stick by the side of your friends, they’ll feel safe and secure for sure. Even a Pig meets its match one day though and you might find some time that you are willing to give up your porky life to save another. With a self-sacrifice this noble, you’ll be granted a one-time reprieve from the death this would cause. You’ll be brought back from whatever attack you nobly blocked with your own life, as a smaller version of yourself that will slowly grow to full size once more. Only once per ten years can you do this however. "
1150,,400,Druid Arts,Seven Deadly Sins,Benevolence ,"Passed down to a certain sect of humans by the Goddess Clan, you were raised in the arts of the Druid and have become a greatly knowledgeable Master in their use. You are a master of healing magics to repair in an instant any wound short of death, which have incredibly damaging effects against Demons or other unholy creatures. Indeed, you could even kill a Grey Demon with nought but a touch and the use of the Purge technique. You know and have mastered a wide variety of holy and nature based magic for attacking, defending and other utilities, along with many other Druid traditions and you can even revive the dead, so long as you have the body, up to two times each, though they will be weaker each time and the second time twists their personality greatly. And while nowhere near as effective, you also know many natural healing methods using various plants or medicines, as well as an in depth knowledge of the human body not found elsewhere in this time."
1151,,400,No Fun Allowed,Dragon Ball Super,Benevolence ,"Serious business goes on here. There’s no time for fun and games, not when you have worlds to destroy. If someone comes up trying to joke with you, you’ll just have to bat them away as you get back to some real work. Your dutiful nature seems to have granted you genuine power against fools who try to turn life into a gag. A comedy or ‘gag’ based character, the sort that might normally be able to warp reality or accomplish impossible things because of it being a joke and not because they possess the actual ability to do so, is powerless against you. Even if they were somehow able to take on some of the most powerful Saiyan Warriors in the multiverse, they would have no more power than they realistically held in their body against you, making these joking people only what they really are when they face you. Powerless jesters. "
1152,,400,Body of Steel,Dragon Ball Super,Benevolence ,"A lifetime of punishment and brutal torture has made your body a peerless example of the endurance of life. Where others faltered, you stood tall without a single noise of pain. What might kill another of your peers can only deal a minor wound to you, such as a bad bruise or cut. You are exceptionally, even absurdly tough for your power level and capable of taking attacks from much stronger beings as if they were an equal to you as well as taking the strikes of your peers as if they were actually much weaker. You’re not invulnerable but your foes might be tricked into thinking it at times."
1153,,400,Potential Unleashed,Dragon Ball Super,Benevolence ,"A mystic power attained only through a strange ritual administered by the former Supreme Kai of Universe 7, the potential unleashed state is a powerful form that forces out all your latent potential and then brings out even more power you didn’t know you had. Manifesting as a white aura around your body, it can even be easily utilised with other transformations without putting any further stress on your body. The power the form grants normally would be somewhere between the Super Saiyan 2 and 3 states but with mastery, as you have, the Potential Unleashed state has grown to enhance you with equivalent power to a Super Saiyan God transformation. "
1154,,400,I’m Not Gonna Let You Destroy My World!,Dragon Ball Super,Benevolence ,"A real hero never gives up, even when everyone thinks he’s been put down for the count. Like any true fighting hero, you’re able to get a second wind so long as you are willing to keep fighting. In any fight, so long as you are actually in a fight and haven’t been instantly killed, you’re able to get a huge burst of energy that not only lets you get raring to go again at full power but also heals many of your wounds. In dramatic battles that have high stakes like the death of everyone you love, you may even get further chances at revival like this, though each successive comeback will restore you with significantly less energy and heal much less of your wounds. Your enemies are a lot more likely to go for a death blow after you come back the first time too. "
1155,,400,Parry,Ultrakill,Benevolence ,"You’ve learned and mastered the art of punching things hard enough to send them back from whence they came. Parrying a projectile will cause it to be sent in the direction you’re aiming, increasing the projectile’s velocity as well as causing it to explosively detonate on impact.

Melee attacks too can be readily parried with a punch, dropkicks, blades, and punches from massive titans being reflected back to their owners. Though do note that particularly powerful AOE strikes may still damage you through the Parry, though not as much as they will the original sender."
1156,,400,Tiz’s Prayer,Final Fantasy Type-0,Benevolence ,"Due to the nature of the system, those who are young often prove to be the soldiers with highest potential. As such, it's not uncommon to see many young children on the battlefield. Those who survive more than one battle quickly realize that there is more to survival than just luck. But sometimes a prayer helps too. Once per battle, you may find yourself in a situation where praying does more good than anything else. And perhaps it just might...

Suzaku: Your magic reserves are fully recovered, and a magical shield descends upon your group, absorbing magical attacks for a short while.

Byakko: A hail of gunfire rakes the enemy, avoiding your allies, but knocking your foes away from you. It stuns them for a moment, as if to give you some reprieve.

Genbu: A portion of your life force returns to you, and a magical barrier descends upon your group, reducing the effect of incoming attacks for a short while.

Souryu: A magical wind blows across the battlefield, confusing enemies who pause for a moment, their eyes betraying them as they appear to be attacking their own allies. It lasts for a short while, but usually enough for you to get away."
1157,,400,High Elder,Honkai: Star Rail,Benevolence ,"You are now among the greatest of your chosen species; your strength, speed, durability, and intelligence all receive a moderate increase. You also receive another boost depending on your race in this jump. If you are a human, you gain preternatural skill with weaponry, enough to equal or even surpass the famed Sword Champions of the Xianzhou Alliance. If you are a Foxian, you gain the ability to shapeshift. If you are a Mechanical Lifeform, you receive built-in weaponry, such as missiles and lasers. Finally, if you are a Vidyadhara you grow a dragon-like tail and horns, and your ability to use cloudhymn magic rivals even that of the Imbibitor Lunae, not to mention gaining the healing abilities of Bailu."
1158,,400,Death’s Door,Honkai: Star Rail,Benevolence ,"You are now at your strongest in times of crisis. You receive an enormous boost in power when you are severely wounded, and this power will increase depending on the stakes of the battle. While the boost you would get while stabbed during a duel for honor would be significant, the boost that you would gain as you lay dying during a battle for the fate of a planet would skyrocket the strength of all of your abilities."
1159,,400,Spellfire ,Generic D&D 5e,Benevolence ,"You gain access to Spellfire. It’s a type of fire that you can use once-per-hour. It acts as a 9th level counterspell, a range of 70 feet. It also grants fire and magic resistance. It even lets you gain the spell slots you counterspell with it as your own, and use them as you see fit.

The only downside is it burns away the weave to do this stuff, which can make it, if used enough, a dead-magic zone.

If you’re known to have this, expect assassination contracts on your head. It’s a lesser, mortal mirror of Silver-Fire, below, and also coveted."
1160,,400,Pre-Nerf,Generic D&D 5e,Benevolence ,"You get the versions of things before they were nerfed. So, using the Mask of the Dragon Queen as our example, originally you could divide it and put it together. Later they changed it so you couldn’t take it apart anymore. With this, you can take it apart, still.

Any other changes that would be seen as a ‘Nerf’ you don’t have to deal with. You keep the fully-powered or functionality of the item. Never let your possessions be nerfed again!

In addition to all of this, sometimes you’ll find you can't keep all the cool stuff at the end of the adventures. With this, you now CAN keep all the cool stuff. Keeping in theme with our example, If you successfully complete Rise of Tiamat, you GET that Hoard. You EARNED it. There are no downsides to this. The economy is fine, everyone can rebuild and do everything they would have needed that stuff for without it somehow. This applies to all things in future jumps. If you put in work to get something, and someone wants to take it, a stern look is all that's needed to keep what is yours. Unless they’re a thief who is committing a crime to steal from you, then this doesn’t work."
1161,,400,Toughness,Generic D&D 5e,Benevolence ,"You’re tough. Tough as nails. You can take a blow which would drop another, lesser warrior to yourself and shrug it off. How tough are you? Tough enough to let this pathetic Bandit wail on you for however long he pleases, and not take any significant damage. Their boss isn’t really any better..."
1162,,400,The Mind of a Demon,Frieren - Beyond Journey's End,Benevolence ,"Demons are beings who are completely alien to any other humanoid species. Even if they share the same speech, their minds, emotions and instincts are those of a completely different world. As such, mental magics usually have no chance of affecting demons. You too share this protection, making it so only mental effects designed to affect your own kind can take hold on you.

Not only that, but as a Demon, you can ignore even magical restrictions that are based around emotions that are not native to demons. After all, a demon doesn’t understand things such as loyalty, guilt or evil like humans do. Trying to bind it to be loyal to the magician or commit no evil would not stop a demon from butchering his master if it felt like it."
1163,,400,He’s Gifted,Frieren - Beyond Journey's End,Benevolence ,"While the use of healing magic derives heavily from the power of the Omnipotent Goddess, it still takes a certain talent to use it properly. And on that, one could say that you are one of the best that there is around. You are capable of healing heavy injuries in moments, as well as identifying, treating and neutralizing deadly poison intoxications with just a shoulder tap. Surely, your talent would be immensely valued among adventurers. You can also use healing magic without the aid of a tome of the Goddess’ Scriptures.

For you, you can diagnose most illnesses with a single touch and heal them as well."
1164,,400,That’s Expected From A Warrior ,Frieren - Beyond Journey's End,Benevolence ,"Just like Dwarf warrior Eisen from the Hero’s Party, you possess an exceptional durability that may be considered unnatural by others. Being bitten and swallowed by monsters, falling from great heights leaving a considerable crater upon landing, even being on the receiving end of the attacks of great monsters such as dragons and strong demons, are just some things that you are sure to walk away with no damage, at best managing to gain a few bruises. It would seem that only demons of great caliber and powerful magics are something that can actually make you bleed, and even then, you are capable of taking and then recovering quite quickly from wounds that would be fatal for others, and even keep fighting with things such as multiple stabs from a Demon General’s weapons. Even being stabbed in the chest by a powerful demon would at best keep you at bed for a few days before you are back to doing some push-ups."
1165,,400,Scrolls of Fate ,Virgil’s Aeneid,Benevolence ,"You are destined for great things. Or if not destined, at least pointed in the right direction. This power, which can be toggled on and off, always leads you to events of great importance, subtly influencing chance to ensure you end up in a position to make major decisions and influence the outcomes. Of course, this power will not let you know which decision is the right one. Only you can decide that."
1166,,400,Warrior of Chaos,Stranger Of Paradise - Final Fantasy Origins,Benevolence ,"Though Jack may be in a category of his own Jed, Sophia, Ash and Neon are still incredible in their own rights. This greatly boosts your power and skill to be capable of matching them as they were during their battle with Jack. On top of this you will find that your power and skill always grow to match the strongest and most skilled among your allies so that you are never left in the dust and made irrelevant. Finally, this allows you to always be able to come back to life to reuinite with your friends as long as they are still alive much like they reunited with Jack at the end of the game."
1167,,400,Always a Way,Stranger Of Paradise - Final Fantasy Origins,Benevolence ,What Jack and his friends accomplished is nothing short of miraculous. They managed to break the hold over their world of a civilization with the ability to outright reset time. This grants you the same luck and shall we say plot armor that would allow you to always find a way to solve issues even ones as difficult as overthrowing a civilization capable of manipulating time. It may be difficult but it shall never be outright impossible.
1168,,400,Paradise Lost,Demon: The Descent,Benevolence ,"There is a belief among many Integrators that the God-Machine is broken, even sick in some way, as evidenced by the Contagion that many supernatural factions are concerned with. You’ve brought an offering to your errant creator: A unique exploit to heal and mend supernatural ailments by reversing causality. You can mend broken limbs and torn souls; if you can track down all the scraps and find out where the soul went after death, you could theoretically attempt to stitch a Cover back into a real person. Your healing powers can easily cleanse ailments as powerful as the Contagion itself, and you can enhanced them by forging them into Gadgets or potentially other means. The real question is whether the God-Machine will accept it needs help at all."
1169,,400,Momentum of Efficiency,Demon: The Descent,Benevolence ,"Some demons have learned to use a certain Embed to improve the efficiency of their own actions. You have completely internalised that knowledge of reality’s workings, letting you work twice as fast at any complex action with skill beyond most men. You also synergise so well with your allies, the more successful they are in combat or other endeavours the more successful you are too. Finally, the more you win the harder any direct opposition finds to accomplish a given task due to hiccups and small issues going wrong. Jumping in front of someone could make a gun misfire, for example."
1170,,400,Wall,The Seven Deadly Sins,Benevolence ,"Wall enables the user to form spherical, defensive barriers that cannot be affected by ordinary magic or physical attacks. The user can form a barrier around themself, and omnidirectionally expand it, allowing the user to push individuals away without direct contact. The barrier also has an additional effect of crushing the ground and creating a crater in the area where it is present"
1171,,400,That’s Odd,The Seven Deadly Sins,Benevolence ,You seem to be able to just straight up ignore racial weaknesses as if they didn’t exist. Like the writers forgot you had the weakness in the first place. As a vampire you can stand in the sun. As a Demon you can go through Ark. it’s like they don’t exist. It’s borderline insane but now you can have fun sunbathing. This works on future species you may become. Enjoy that nice looking silver cutlery and that nice tasting wolfsbane as a werewolf.
1172,,400,Costless,The Seven Deadly Sins,Benevolence ,No matter what you use or how you use it nothing will ever put a strain on your body. Even absorbing the power of a Grace will ever be close to putting even a single strain on your body. You seem to just have limitless room for it in your great soul and body. No matter how or what you use. You could be using a power that should be breaking you to actual pieces and shattering your soul to dust but you just seem to be able to ignore all that and use the power to its fullest potential.
1173,,400,Mighty Vessel,The Seven Deadly Sins,Benevolence ,"You seem to be the perfect vessel for anybody needing one. No matter how evil or good they are, you are always the perfect one for them. Here's the problem. They won’t ever actually be able to take you over. They will try and they might succeed for a few seconds but you always have the ability to drive them out. And in the process you may just take something from them. Whether that be taking their own power or their memories you will always gain something. And even if you did willingly give up your body they will impart something willingly. And when you do give in they seem to be able to draw out 100% of all their power inside your body letting them fight to the fullest without a single risk to your body from the overload."
1174,,400,Blessed Be,The Seven Deadly Sins,Benevolence ,You have gained three great boons from the gods. From the Supreme Deity you were given protection from the Commandments as well as all Dark Curses and from the Demon King you were given knowledge of the magic of the demon realm as well as immunity to brainwashing and possession of others. These things are quite incredibly powerful not to mention useful. I mean who knows what you could do with all that knowledge and power. Not to mention the fact that how you obtained this is up to you. Did you trick the two gods into giving you these blessings or did they give them to you for nothing else but their love of you. Every jump you may gain three other boons from gods in other worlds. Up to one from three different gods. This could be knowledge or immunity to a certain thing. Maybe you gain knowledge of swordsmanship or magic or perhaps you wish to learn of the secret knowledge the gods hold.
1175,,400,Eidolon of the Sun​ ,Generic Exalted,Benevolence ,"There is one simple truth about the Exaltations. They are weapons, and the beings they attach themselves to are warriors. Whether you be a poet, a bureaucrat, a sailor, a merchant, or even a humble farmer you are first and foremost a weapon to be wielded, tested, and one day broken. It is through these constant trials, these different lives, that the power of the exaltation is made manifest, and it is this power that once brought down the masters of Creation itself.

When you are fighting, you fight harder. Faster. Longer. When you are playing you play harder. Faster. Longer. When you are working you work harder. Faster. Longer. You live a more full life, for you burn brighter than any others, a reminder that even if the sun has sunk below the horizon that the day is not yet gone. In any endeavor you throw yourself into you will be noticeably superior than you otherwise would be, as you commit the fullness of yourself to your task. Even if you should be surrounded and alone, half dead and stumbling, they will pay for every single step that they take, and every last drop of blood that they spill. You may fall, o Chosen of the Sun, but you will not fall easily.

In effect you embody everything that is good within the Solar. Compassion, Valor, Temperance, and Conviction. So long as you act within these bounds you will go far above and beyond what any else might manage, so long as you dedicate yourself fully."
1176,,400,Golden Apple,Shin Megami Tensei V,Benevolence ,"A beautiful Golden Apple made by the Goddess Idun. While it may not hold the knowledge to become a True God, it IS a very tasty Apple that will heal your injuries greatly and invigorate you with one Bite. Not only that but it can grant agelessness, which would likely earn you a nice profit if you like Loki would want to sell them to the rich and powerful. You get a Basket full with them that replenish once per week."
1177,,400,Uncondemnable,Shin Megami Tensei V,Benevolence ,"To think all these countless Demons used to be so much more. Used to be True Gods far beyond their even now considerable might. All because one Creator saw them as underserving of their power and anted to remain in control uncontested. It would be a tragedy to have you suffer a similar fate. With this Perk, no one is able to copy, steal, seal or otherwise mess with your powers. The only way that would happen is if you yourself consciously LET it happen. Let them rant about you being a Heresy, they cant reduce you to a lesser state."
1178,,400,Imperial Champion and Canonneer ,Final Fantasy XVI,Benevolence ,"Imperial champions and cannoneers are massive soldiers capable of wielding massive weapons such as giant axes,clubs and cannons without any strain and now you gain their strength. This grants you a massive increase to strength, toughness and all physical attributes in general without sacrificing any of your speed and agility. Furthermore, you gain master level of skill and ability to use hammers,giant axes and cannons that you can easily carry around with your strength. You even seem to be dealing more damage than usual when wielding them."
1179,,400,Bona Fied Sanctified,The Elder Scrolls - Online,Benevolence ,"Many people pray for divine intervention, but none of them seem to have the success rate that you do. You're the ritual master de jour, handing out blessings like hotcakes. You know prayers to purge illness, chants to undo the harm of fatal poisons, rites that consecrate lost souls, and rituals that could let a group of around 20 walk through a wall of fire unharmed. Granted, these complex incantations, though powerful, take a bit of time, and in most cases you're at least somewhat vulnerable while in the process of casting."
1180,,400,A Lion’s Pelt,Greek Myth,Benevolence ,The pelt of a great lion which turned aside all blows turned into. This pelt cannot be pierced by all but the mightiest of gods and even they would need to put in great effort. Large enough to cover a large man if it were to be worn as a cloak. Although it is almost impossible to pierce this cloak will do little to stop the actual force behind a blow so you can still be beaten to death by a sufficiently powerful enemy.
1181,,400,Beast Beyond Nature,Greek Myth,Benevolence ,"Monsters surpass the natural world. Your body does not wear from disuse or hunger, diseases that ravage your lessers simply have no effect, age can only make you wiser and sharper never wearing away your thoughts, even if the gods were to wait for eternity your claws would be as sharp as they are now. The passage of time has as much effect on you as it does on the immortal gods. You are undying and shall only grow stronger as you age never losing a part of yourself to Cronos, yet even you who are undying are not immortal. The swords of heros can still take your life."
1182,,400,Quest of the Gods,Greek Myth,Benevolence ,"Hero's are the greatest of mortals, so should they not bear the greatest of tools? As a hero you seem all but destined to find or be given useful and powerful objects to aid you in your quests. As a hero with great tools are you not the greatest tool the gods could have? The gods give you grand quests which only the greatest heroes of this world could complete. Should you complete them you will be rewarded with great gifts. Fortunately they won't be to angry if you don't accept these often dangerous quests. In future jumps the gods of those worlds will still be more likely to give you quests and rewards for completing them as well as being less likely to punish you for not doing them."
1183,,400,Blessing of Hygieia,Greek Myth,Benevolence ,"You are blessed by the god of health, sanitation, and cleanliness. This has made you immune to all natural diseases and poisons and even to the worst of the supernatural, even a diseases or poison as strong as a cup of undiluted blood from the Hydra would not affect you. Furthermore the Goddess protects you from curses warding away any and all curses that God's or other beings try to place on you. This is not her domain so her protection from curses is less absolute than against diseases or poisons however it would still take something as a curse which could lay low a small kingdom."
1184,,400,Paladin    ,Diablo 3,Benevolence ,"Similar to the Crusader, but still very different, the way of the Paladin is more about healing others and protecting them, without much in terms of dealing damage to the wicked. You can channel holy light to heal your allies (even if they are Demons, as long as they are allies that's enough), create constructs out of light to stop enemies, infuse your and your allies weapons with armor to make them harder and much more. Your strongest abilities allow you to make an ally immune to all damage thanks to a shield of light you cast over their body. You can use this on yourself. This lasts only for a few precious seconds, but during this time nothing will be able to hurt you. Another technique is to create a copy of you made from light. This double is capable of doing every light-based healing ability you can do, without any cost to it, but it can be broken apart and killed by enemies.Creating a double may be tiring but keeping it up for a minute or two is not taxing at all. Now go and protect what you can!"
1185,,400,My mind is a Fortress!,Diablo 3,Benevolence ,"You wouldn’t believe how many people died from their own idiocy, curses or other things that came from within them. Now this will never be too much of a problem for you.

You now have the common sense to keep away and don’t touch specific things like the Black Soulstone or other similar things that would affect you in any way. These kinds of items will now exude a visible and hearable aura for you that, by itself, doesn’t corrupt you. The only way an artifact or item like this could corrupt you if you came into physical contact with it.

Additionally your mind and soul themselves are now more resistant against corruption of any kind by their proximity. You should still not try your luck with very powerful Demons or similar beings."
1186,,400,Don’t Mind Me,Fate/Grand Order Part 1,Benevolence ,"Even death isn't the end for those who prepare accordingly. And just like many villains the Master of Chaldea defeated, you've mastered the art of returning from death as an (allegedly) redeemed person, now (allegedly) willing to fight the good fight and save the world instead of being one of the threats to it. During this jump this comeback will take the form of becoming summoned by the Master of Chaldea as a Servant, but in future jumps you'll make your return in some other appropriate way should there be nothing like the Servant system to work with, which will always place you on the side of the ""good guys"", or at least the protagonist of wherever you are. However it is that you come back, it'll reduce you severely in power should you have been powerful in the first place, leaving you at the Mid Rank at best. Of course, with the right effort and possibly magical ritual, you'll be able to regain your former glory, unless people decide to stop you from potentially becoming a problem again. Of course, this works no matter how thoroughly you've been killed or destroyed, and it won't end your chain. You only get to do this once per jump, however.

This isn't all of course. As mentioned before, this return is in the context of (allegedly) having been redeemed. As long as you never seriously return to whatever nefarious plan you were performing that got you killed, all of your crimes, regardless of severity, will be forgotten (not necessarily forgiven), and you will be afforded a second chance at life. Of course, if you were never doing anything nefarious that got you killed or simply died by accident somehow, then there's nothing to worry about either, no? Even the most righteous or grudge-holding people will be relatively lenient with you and allow you a chance to form a less hostile bond. Of course, going right back to directly antagonizing people will rescind this second chance, but if you're patient you can wait until the perfect moment to backstab those naive goody-two-shoes and resume whatever you were doing before the heroes came around."
1187,,400,EX Rank Luck ,Fate/Grand Order Part 1,Benevolence ,"The circumstances arrayed against the Last Master of Chaldea are frankly absurd. Great beasts and heroes will oppose them, and they will even have to fight the very gods in their journey. All this while remaining a relatively unremarkable human, at least physically. It's a miracle that they could succeed at this task, a miracle you now share. Allies will seemingly fall into your lap, always with the right array of abilities to surmount the obstacles to come, even if you're not aware of them yet. Enemies will conveniently have better things to do than smite you, and even those laser focused on bringing you down will somehow be distracted, tricked, or blocked to allow you to survive. The right tools for the job will be placed at your hands at the right moments, and even the most hopeless situation will turn out to have a hidden solution that appears at dramatic times.

Nothing will truly be unbeatable to you, as long as you keep in mind a few things. This luck won’t care for any moral quandaries. Former enemies might become essential to your victory, and if you are unable to get over any grudges or distaste you have for them, they won’t be able to help you. Essentially, you’ll always have a winning hand to play, but it’s up to you to be willing to play it at all. You will have to accept the help of anyone, from the most upstanding moral paragons to the most repulsive monsters you’ve met, if you want to survive from truly great threats. Additionally, regardless of its strength, this is ultimately just luck. Rely on it, and you will find yourself depending on a suddenly absent factor. Simply have faith in your friends, and they shall see you through. As a final note, this does not work during climactic fights against your opponents. Your luck evens the board and makes even the most dangerous of beings possible to defeat, but actually attaining victory will have to be done on your own efforts."
1188,,400,Of Death And Rebirth,Fate/Grand Order Part 1,Benevolence ,"For all of the power that some beasts and gods may have, one thing that is constant is that sufficient damage to their bodies can kill them. Stab a god hard and often enough, and theoretically they would die like any other living being. There are some exceptions to this rule, however. A trait most commonly seen among particularly vicious demons, your physical body is far less essential than it really should be. As long as your Saint Graph, your soul in other words, remains undamaged, you shall not die. You may be cut into a thousand pieces, chewed up and spit back out, boiled alive and burned, but as long as your soul remains intact, you will survive.

Of course, this has also resulted in a peculiar ability that solves one of the biggest problems with this form of immortality, that being your ability to recover from any wound, no matter how severe, by simply spending some magical energy. The cost is generally small, but it is not negligible, so if you are forced to regenerate too often you may have to stop for a time to recover your energies, lest your soul become unstable and risk exploding. That said, if there is no leftover body for you to regenerate, you may have to spend a massive amount of magical energy to generate a new one. Alternatively, you can attempt to possess someone nearby, but this can be resisted so it's not guaranteed to work. As a final benefit, you count as truly dead for any purposes where that might be relevant, such as magical analysis. Not many opponents in this world can feasibly kill you now, although you should still be wary of anyone that is too powerful, as your resilience is not unprecedented."
1189,,400,I am far from holy wisdom,GrimGrimoire,Benevolence ,"You possess humility and self-awareness. Such a rare trait is a divine gift, for you can discern the depth of your flaws and wrongdoing, gazing through the veil of your own weaknesses. You can objectively judge your own actions, contributions, and accomplishments with a self-discernment that can only be called divine.

It is not mere self-reflection, but rather the spiritual grace bestowed upon you. It seems your soul is touched by the divine or perchance, a celestial spirit enrobed in flesh. The mark of such a lineage is that every imperfection stands out in stark contrast.

Yet, though the flesh may sully you, you are beyond the reach of corruption. Your will alone governs your choices, and not even the allure of worldly temptations may coerce you into succumbing to the dark abyss. You are incorruptible by any will but your own, and even that is only the corruption of your own choices, and hold no more weight than the mundane action of it. Nothing will rush your fall, or drive you into the darkness. Even if you are an angel fallen to the material world, you are holy, and will only ever become otherwise if you choose to forsake this and embrace that darkness."
1190,,400,Walking Miracle,Generic Angels and Demons,Benevolence ,"Through your own divine powers, you’re able to perform feats of healing that can only be called miraculous. These miracles manifest in the form of greatly boosted healing powers to a legendary degree, surpassing any and every angel with the exception of the ones whose power greatly dwarfs yours or that embodies the concept of life in some way. At the basic level, you’re capable of healing any mundane diseases and wounds, including severe ones like extreme brain damage and disabilities like blindness and deafness, to the point you can even resurrect the recently dead, as long as something is left behind from their remains, even if it’s just a puddle of blood. This is the healing ability you would get as a basic angel, with it being increased accordingly the stronger you are."
1191,,400,Heavenly Redeemer ,Generic Angels and Demons,Benevolence ,"As one of the loyal servants of Heaven, you’ve been trained on reverting the corruption spread by the forces of evil and redeeming those that fell for it. As a result, you’ve developed very powerful purification abilities, greater than that of a mundane angel even if you’re a mere human, allowing you to revert the effects and consequences of most forms of demonic/evil/dark/eldritch corruption. Even a human that was turned into a demon and isn’t willingly to recover their humanity could be healed with certain ease if they’re weakened and even a large area that was fully tainted due to the effects of the Abyssal Corruption perk can be returned to normal with a lot of effort, enough to fully exhaust any angel. If you don’t have a reserve of holy/magical power, you can fuel your purifying abilities using your own stamina or just use external power sources. By experimenting with your abilities, you can also extend your purification to other forms of corruption and not only those related to “evil” in general."
1192,,400,Blast Hardcheese,Heroes of the Storm,Benevolence ,"Goodness, you’re a strapping member of your species! You’re not just a physiological peak specimen of whatever you are originally-you’re absolutely gigantic compared to many of your kind, and correspondingly enduring without any loss of agility or swiftness. With this, even a human could take a sledgehammer to the chest and simply flex through the impact. Those beyond humanity in endurance might shrug off the high calibre bullets of futuristic firearms. More importantly, whatever gift of genetics has endowed your mighty form with superior musculature also lets you train fantastic physical feats that focus your strength and skill even further. An orc warrior might be able to hurl opponents great distances across the battlefield-perhaps near their allies, or hurl axes with pinpoint accuracy from those distances powerfully enough to cleave through armour and send even well-guarded opponents careening into their allies-to say nothing of a hydralisk’s spiny projectiles becoming far deadlier and hard-hitting. For a being of a dragon’s stature to have such gifts would surely let them live up to the bleak majesty of those creatures which took entire parties of legendary heroes to fell."
1193,,400,The Power of Faith,Heroes of the Storm,Benevolence ,"Sometimes belief in yourself is the only tool you have against the darkness. And sometimes, that’s enough. Your confidence and zealotry empower you in battle, such that a human woman could toss a heavy shield with strength and accuracy enough to ricochet among her enemies then catch it smoothly or send multiple nearby foes flying with a swung sword. Your faith even lets you stretch the limits of what’s physically possible based on your belief in the righteous judgement (or inevitable evil presumably, as a demon) of your assault, like stunning others with the glare of your shield or leaping high into the air and stunning others as you land. With greater faith than the typical crusader’s even more impressive feats may be possible-and do bear in mind that faith shall empower you proportionally no matter the strength of your body.

Should you already be a crusader, know that your gifts will be empowered even further with this."
1194,,400,Crest of the Star,Fate/Legends - Voyage to Valhalla,Benevolence ,"A strange pattern, imprinted upon your body. A design that does not belong to the Huns but instead an advanced ritual. Originating from a being far greater than the Gods, you are a far cry from even hoping to be like it. However this does give you a potent benefit. By expanding your Magical Energy through this Crest pattern, you can temporarily enhance the performance of any desired part of your body. While not as explosive as Mana Burst, it is still a great improvement and vastly more efficient. By wearing this Crest on your body you also gain a certain battle instinct. It would have just been missing otherwise."
1195,,400,Chainbreaking,Fate/Legends - Voyage to Valhalla,Benevolence ,"People seek to control what they fear. What is capable of bringing about their end. Fenrir, Odins bane and killer to be, was on the receiving end of such fear, being bound with three chains in hopes it would control him. Alas it only delayed the inevitable and Fenrir eventually brought down the Sun. Much like with said Wolf, restraining you is only temporary. Any prison, trap or restriction meant to contain you, will eventually give away. The more time passes, the less effective your bindings will be, till eventually you will always break out. Just be patient. Your time will come."
1196,,400,Mask of Alkosh,The Elder Scrolls: Dovah,Benevolence ,"A holy relic of the Dragon-Cat Alkosh, his light willing it into existence to help mend the tapestry of time, first worn by the Ja'darri the Endless. In addition to greatly increasing all of the wearer’s physical capabilities and their resistance to damage, it makes them immune to all hostile time manipulation."
1197,,400,Curse No More,D.Y.N. Freaks,Benevolence ,"Even the deadliest of relics won’t cause you any fear now. You’ve become immune to the dangers of any and all supernatural items, at least when you are wielding or using them. Be it a grimoire that drives its user mad as a side effect or a blade that sucks your blood from your body when you use it, you’ll be able to use these artefacts with no fear of harm or diminishment. Artefacts that require a certain level of harm to activate or grow stronger can be allowed to do so if you wish but you are able to cut short that harm at any time you wish, though this will also prevent you from progressing further with the benefits. You’d be able to use a Fragment till the brink of corruption for instance and stop yourself there but you would not grow stronger with that Fragment until you unfroze that growth."
1198,,400,One Pond to Another ,Final Fantasy XIV,Benevolence ,"Somewhere along the line, you went from being a fisher to a marine biologist. Maybe the line was drawn when you realized you knew more about how to keep marine life alive than how to drag them in with a line and fight them to the bitter end, before taking a bite out of them.

It’s probably also a bit more entertaining to see how marine life interacts with each other while alive than when they’re dead. After much experience, you have a strange knack for helping marine life grow and adapt to new environments, and you can quickly induce minor changes in marine life by placing them inside foreign environments.

A fish that usually survives in salt water will be able to adapt to living in fresh water much quicker than normal, and with time they may even adapt to breathe air. However, note that ideally the process should be performed in small steps. While the physical changes can happen relatively quickly, this won’t protect the subject animal from dying if the shock is too extreme."
1199,,400,Sanctuary Sprite,Final Fantasy XIV,Benevolence ,"A sprite defends her master, and your familiar will lay down their life if that is what it takes to keep you alive. Long ago, the Scholars of Nym relied only upon their own intellect and their familiars to repel assault after assault - and with time and experience, your familiar will only grow to be capable of similar feats.

Well versed in support magic, your familiar is protected with a magical shield so long as they are casting - capable of repelling physical blows and reflecting magic to a degree. This fae barrier extends to those within close vicinity, though the effect is dramatically reduced."
1200,,400,Oblivion,Final Fantasy XIV,Benevolence ,"When you live day to day struggling to contain a growing darkness within you, being able to temporarily forget about it all is a blessing. How many Dark Knights out there dream of the day when they can cast their darkness aside? And yet, afraid of losing all that they possess, they cling on desperately to their power...and the darkness that comes with it.

For a time, you can live without the influence of the darkness within, or any other mental parasites or afflictions which you may have. However, so long as you remain free of this, your access to your powers is sealed, and even your physical body weakens slightly."
1201,,400,Last Order,Final Fantasy XIV,Benevolence ,"To the Paladin of old, the word of their liege was law. If the liege would command it, the Paladin would lay down their lives without question. When the time comes, there is no question that you would be able to do the same – the only question would be who your liege is.

Should the charge that you’ve chosen to defend be struck by a fatal blow, you’ll instinctively sacrifice a large portion of your vitality in order to shield them. Should the blow be too powerful, such that it would overwhelm you as well, it will most definitely still kill your charge. Otherwise, your charge will escape intact and unharmed from the encounter. This can activate so long as you have enough vitality to pay the price."
1202,,400,Defiant unto Death,Horus Heresy: The Primarchs,Benevolence ,"In the Age of Darkness, there are many fates that would make death seem like a kindness, the merest promise of which would test the bravery of the most stalwart men. But you are not a mere man, are you? You have been gifted with the willpower to endure any pain, reject any dark temptations and even face your death with valour. At the very least, those who might seek to break your will through torture or promises of dark futures to come shall find you unbowed until your very last breath. "
1203,,400,Marketplace of Ideas ,Horus Heresy: The Primarchs,Benevolence ,"Perhaps you may trade secret favours away, perhaps you may be asked to sacrifice parts of your very body to them in exchange. Indeed, most entities you’ll meet will seem to be especially eager to give far more favourable deals to you than they’d normally give anyone. Almost as if they’re trying to bring you over to their side. Perhaps some may even seek you out directly to offer wisdom you need at a price. But you should still beware that extremely treacherous and deceptive entities are not safe to bargain with, and you still probably shouldn’t make deals with entities you know nothing about. "
1204,,400,Seeker of the Forbidden,Horus Heresy: The Primarchs,Benevolence ,"There is no end to dreadful truths and secret knowledge here. Some of it is merely disturbing, others dangerous to body and soul. Merely possessing forbidden knowledge will not harm you, nor will seeking it bring you censure. Using it, another matter altogether. "
1205,,400,Preternatural Resilience,Horus Heresy: The Primarchs,Benevolence ,"You are insanely difficult to kill, even by Primarch standards. A point-blank shot from a super-heavy tank will do no more than mildly injure you, as will standing directly in front of an absolute hail of gunship fire. Even reducing you to a pulpy mass of tendon, charred flesh and bone is more of an inconvenience as long as your brain survives; you will be able to eventually heal from even that. You could even happily breathe air so poisoned and corrosive as to be equivalent to Phosphex every day of your life without ill effects."
1206,,400,Proper Precautions,Elder Scrolls Online – The Vestige,Benevolence ,"Apparently you are ahead of your time, Jumper. You somehow managed to learn about the powerful Shadow Magic about an Era before the official discovery... and the terrible side effects it brings. So you decided to ditch actually learning the magic itself and instead learn how to minimize those side effects. You succeeded. Now, any skill, power or magic you learn will never harm or affect you in a way you don’t want, unless you let it for any reason, like making the effect more powerful. As a bonus, this will let you learn forms of magic or techniques that would be completely opposite and react destructively when used together."
1207,,400,Nemean Beast,Akame ga Kill!,Benevolence ,"The Cross Tail's threads are made from the body of a draconic Danger Beast that lived in the clouds of the East that possessed an especially stiff, rigid and resistant fur protecting its vital spots. Similarly to this beast, your body also has an extremely resistant external part (such as your fur, scales or even just skin) that further protects the region around your vital spots while also covering around a fifth of the rest of your body as well as being visually indistinguishable from any other part of your body. These parts’ durability is so high that it might even be considered indestructible by this world’s standards, requiring something on with the strength of a fully powered Incursio to bypass it, however, keep in mind that the rest of your body won't be as durable as these special areas. Furthermore, if your regular durability is already above this level, the reinforced portions of your body will be enhanced to always have at least five times more durability than the rest of you."
1208,,400,I’m Always the One to Dominate ,Akame ga Kill!,Benevolence ,"And you’ll continue being when it comes to within yourself. No matter what kind of mental/spiritual influences affect you in an attempt to corrupt or alter you in some way from within your own mind/soul, you’ll be able to overcome and conquer them in a matter of a few seconds through your own immense, monstrous mental strength and fortitude, as well as giving you an immunity against possession of any form, thus ensuring you’ll always the dominant one within your own mind and soul, requiring something that absolutely dwarfs you in mental power to overcome your dominion over yourself. However, this protection isn’t effective against physical effects, as your body will still be vulnerable to corruption and/or possession, but your mind and soul will stay untouched. This allows you to do feats such as easily dominating the insanity-inducing effects of objects like the Demon’s extract and resisting possession by even the fully evolved Incursio."
1209,,400,For Ultimate Justice ,Akame ga Kill!,Benevolence ,"To serve justice and to punish evil, it’s needed strength and you’re willing to pay the price needed to become stronger faster, even if it needs to almost destroy and rebuild your entire body. Fortunately, you’re perfectly compatible with any kind of body modification, biological or mechanical alike, as well as being able to easily handle the strain and pain that such procedures may cause on you. Regardless if your body is mostly replaced by mechanical prosthesis or if your body is altered to be mixed with some animal, you’ll be completely fine with these modifications without needing to worry about any potential downsides that you could suffer to some degree of incompatibility, like how the Gravekeepers’ Secret Arts may cause mental damage on those incompatible with the modifications for example."
1210,,400,Divine Rejection,Marvel: Age of Krakoa,Benevolence ,"The Deviants have an ancient proverb: ""The Celestials can go &@#$ themselves."" In addition to the perceived rejection of their creators, the Deviants have had bad experiences with deities in general—Notably, the head of the Priest Caste eventually became a Set Cultist. So, for the most part, they go without. Divine decrees and prophecies have no hold over you, you do what you want. If a god wants something from you, they have to come and get it in person. This does not stop them from smiting you, empowering you, or interacting with you in other manners, it simply means that neither they nor any other esoteric forces can control you or your fate."
1211,,400,Evolutionary Apex ,Marvel: Age of Krakoa,Benevolence ,"The course of evolution on Earth wasn’t random. Not in this universe. In addition to the Celestial experiments detailed previously, mitochondria are the product of an experiment from billions of years ago. The Kree experimented on neanderthals to make the Inhumans and some of them bred with humans before they isolated themselves. Various other aliens did similar experiments, microbes from space ended up here by accident. Gods, fae, and demons empowered, cursed, or transformed mortals, various hybrids were made, assorted exotic radiations and chemicals sometimes had heritable effects on those they were exposed to, genes mutated over time, populations moved around, traits were spread and/or culled by various natural and artificial means for various reasons. There have been countless fingers in the pie of human evolution, leaving the whole thing a convoluted mess. And with this perk, those conflicting and convoluted forces came together in you in the most optimal fashion. Or maybe you were just designed from the ground up to lack the perceived chaff?

First and foremost, you are not subject to inherent, racial, or biological weaknesses or any objective downsides to your powers. No allergies, no auto-immune disorders, no genetic diseases. A Mutant won’t react poorly to Terrigen, a Deviant isn't subject to Excess Deviation, and so on. If you were infected with vampirism during your stay in this world, you would be a mighty Daywalker indeed. Second, you have perfect control of every aspect of your powers, conscious and reflexive, and can never be harmed by your own perks, powers, or abilities or face consequences for having potentially volatile combinations of abilities be that harm or consequence physical, mental, or spiritual with you being the final determinant of what counts as harm. Third, you find yourself naturally existing in a state of perfect fitness that never degrades regardless of diet or exercise or lack thereof. Any improvements to this state made from your personal effort will likewise not degrade. With time and effort, you can achieve the peak of physical ability in all regards. An ordinary human with this perk could, for example, eventually rival a super soldier with such peaks scaling up with more powerful individuals. Finally, this perk serves as a Capstone Booster, enhancing the effect of certain other perks."
1212,,400,Samsara,Chinese Mythology,Benevolence ,"The cycle of death and rebirth is something that pervades this land to its deepest levels. The journey of reincarnation is one that all living things must undergo, be they beast, man, and sometimes celestial being. You are able to reincarnate once every ten years should you meet your untimely demise or make the choice consciously. Reincarnating will also clear you of all damage done to your mind and soul."
1213,,400,Monstrous Sage,Chinese Mythology,Benevolence ,"It is a fact that many yaoguai are met with hostility and suspicion from mortals. Yet, this is not a universal occurrence. Some spirits can coexist in peace with normal humans, perhaps even forming beneficial relationships with them. Some can be faithful wives and husbands, dutiful protectors, or even wise sages. It is a good thing, then, that people do not default to hostility in your presence. No matter what you are, people that might otherwise be hostile will be neutral and initially give you the benefit of the doubt. They will not attack you until you make such hostile intent clear, granting you ample opportunity to form positive relationships."
1214,,400,Rid of Weakness,Chinese Mythology,Benevolence ,"Some yaoguai have fears and weaknesses towards certain materials, methods or charms and talismans. Whether it’s things like peaches or blood, or even something as simple as certain breathing exercises monsters can be repelled. The same cannot be said for you. The materials, charms and methods that specifically work on your kind does not affect you in the slightest. Racial weaknesses are nullified and moot for you."
1215,,400,Expulsion of Three Worms,Chinese Mythology,Benevolence ,"Through the practice of Taoism, you have reached the goal of eternal life. By permanently expelling the three worms, Disease, Old Age and Death from the body, you have shed away your physical mortality. You cannot ever become sick nor age, and your body is nigh-unkillable. Nearly any injury you take upon your body will heal, up to and including total annihilation, though sufficiently powerful magical and/or otherwise supernatural weapons and effects can negate this protection. Your mind and soul do not share this protection, however, so be careful."
1216,,400,Fallen ,Hazbin Hotel,Benevolence ,"Hold on. You're not a sinner at all! Well I’ll be damned you’re a genuine bonafide Angel with all the natural advantages that implies. For details see the Angel Physiology Perk. Though you seem to have become slightly... inured to hell after spending so much time here, this forced inoculation has granted you a permanent resistance to your racial weaknesses from this Jump and a much easier time developing new resistances through exposure in future jumps.

You have also received a decent amount of Exorcist Training and would be able to contend with your basic kin on even grounds."
1217,,400,Restoration,The Destiny Universe,Benevolence ,"Stars are responsible for life as we know it, and your understanding of this idea leads into a mastery of the traditionally Solar healing abilities. With your Solar Light, you can literally burn away injuries, from the minor to the most life threateningly major, and you can even extend this beyond simple injuries - disease, poison, congenital conditions, radiation, your Solar Light can restore health to anyone. This is not limited to biological life either - your Light can restore function to sapient machines, repair damage, even cleanse malicious code from their circuits. 

Requires The Light of Creation to Purchase"
1218,,400,Healing Light ,The Destiny Universe,Benevolence ,"All evidence points to Ghosts’ healing abilities being limited to physical wounds, with no known examples of Ghosts being capable of repairing the myriad of mental maladies that sapient life is capable of suffering from. Furthermore, evidence suggests that Ghosts are completely incapable of healing any of the corruptive effects of Darkness. By purchasing this perk, you are not weighed down by these limits - should your Guardian be steeped in some sort of corruption, or suffering from any sort of mental trauma, your Light is capable of healing those wounds and easing your Risen’s pain."
1219,,400,Vanguard Support ,The Destiny Universe,Benevolence ,"Infrastructure and logistics—the required secondary powers of any war machine that few ever realize the sheer importance of. A great many Guardians simply take for granted that they can grab all the engrams and loot they can carry, fly back to the Tower, and get them decrypted by a cryptarch at a fair price—only for the items they find to be deemed useless, such that they’ll scrap the entire batch for raw glimmer. Even civilians living within the Last City often fail to consider the years of education and experience necessary to manage their defense—to say nothing of the interconnected network of people, machines, and processes that are required just to keep them alive and healthy. So many Hunters will simply hop in their ships and joyride across Sol without fully grasping the economics involved in keeping a starship ready to go at a moment’s notice. Without the infrastructure of the Last City, Guardians would within days find themselves limited solely to the equipment they have on hand and what thousand year old relics they could scavenge from the ruins around them. While such support is likely a given for Guardians in the Sol system, it is far from guaranteed in worlds beyond this one. This perk ensures that—no matter where you find yourself—you will never lack the support that others take for granted.

Have a ship? While you’re out exploring a planet, it will be fully refueled and repaired for when you get back. Have a computer? All you need to do is step away for a while, and it will complete its scheduled updates and security scans. Have an armory? By morning, any guns you’ve placed within it will have been cleaned, oiled, re-tuned, re-sighted, reloaded, and recharged. Food you eat will be replenished, water you drink will be refilled, vehicles you drive will be maintained, and machines you use will be repaired. It’s almost as though you have an invisible pit crew that starts to work the moment you walk out of sight. Hypothetically speaking, this pit crew has a comprehensive list of tasks to perform—many of which you may or may not have ever considered—and the assurance of their job well done is that you don’t even realize they’ve done it.

One thing to note, however, is that this isn’t a get-out-of-jail-free card: this is infrastructure and logistics. In general, this perk will provide you what you could expect if you went home and turned in your equipment. If your ship was obliterated in a fight, taking a walk won’t provide you with a fully repaired ship to replace the one that you lost. If you crash your car and abandon it, then that car is gone. A highly-invasive virus on your computer won’t vanish overnight, deliberately poisoned food won’t be purified, lost weapons won’t be returned, and stolen items won’t come back. This perk covers the little things that all keep the machine running but won’t help with the big things that break the machine. For that, you would actually need to get home, get help, or else fix it yourself."
1220,,400,Flying Brick,Miracleman,Benevolence ,"In an attempt to recoup some of the enormous losses of Project Zarathustra, the Spookshow created two more superhumans. Powerful, but less so than the previous subjects. Big Ben was one, and you were the other. Unlike Big Ben, you were deemed loyal enough that para-reality programming would be unnecessary, and were allowed to retain your sanity.

You can fly at 60 miles per hour, heave rocks as large as your body and uproot trees with great effort, and survive being punched hundreds of feet away (albeit with severe injuries). Most bullets bounce right off your skin, but large caliber rounds can still hurt you. Seeing as your strength and durability derive from sheer muscle mass and bone density, you have the appearance of a hulking brute. On the other hand, your rippling muscles would put any bodybuilder to shame."
1221,,400,This Single Dream,Miracleman,Benevolence ,"The last thing Miracleman and Liz Moran were expecting when their daughter was born was for her to speak only minutes out of the womb, or for her to become the most advanced being in the universe before her first birthday. Your own children will see similar growth in their bodies, minds, and powers. They’ll inherit all of your powers, surpassing you as infants, and by the time they’re adults their abilities will vastly outstrip even that. This applies to any superpowers and natural abilities, as well as traits like strength and intelligence."
1222,,400,Issue #25,Miracleman,Benevolence ,"You’re immune to your personal time being affected by outside forces. You can’t be frozen, slowed down, or sped up, and attempts to displace you elsewhere in the time stream or remove you entirely don’t catch. You’ll never be put on hiatus, Jumper."
1223,,400,I’m Not a Mutant ,Epic of Leviathan,Benevolence ,"While each different system has its own advantages and disadvantages a common factor is the ability to restrain the system entirely. This perk helps you with that issue. Your powers cannot be sealed or removed in any way. This applies to all methods that could be used against you such as mutant suppression zones, fuinjutsu seals, magic blockers, or anything else you can think of. You may however still use training equipment or seals designed to help you. For example if you are unable to control your energy and are in danger because of it then the seals may be applied."
1224,,400,Hydra's Blood ,Greek Mythology,Benevolence ,"You share some traits with the Lernaean Hydra such as its extreme healing factor that would let you regrow a missing limb in a matter of seconds, and poison blood so potent that even your breath and steps would prove deadly, should your blood touch the skin of another it would cause an intense burning sensation that could take years before finally wearing off. Note: With “Hundred Handed One” when you regenerate you may choose to have two of whatever was removed grow in its place."
1225,,400,Nemean Pelt,Greek Mythology,Benevolence ,"Like the Nemean lion (and Achilies, One of the Hydra’s Heads, and Caeneus) your skin is invulnerable granting protection against traditional weapons. Your invulnerability does not extend to your insides, and a strong enough force could potentially strangle/crush you."
1226,,400,Soul Sacrifice,Magnagothica: Maleghast,Benevolence ,"Your soul has been promised to the Dead God Gormengorr upon your final dissolution; then, it will be devoured by the god and consigned to eternal oblivion. That would probably be a real issue - if you planned on suffering such a final death, of course. In the meantime, this bargain comes with some real benefits, as Gormengorr (or what’s left of him) seeks to protect his investment. In short, your soul and consciousness are immune to corruption, curses, being stolen or basically anything else but direct damage, from anything less than a divine source - and even then you’re strongly resistant. Your body can still be touched, but you are significantly more resistant to corruption, curses and other such mystical afflictions."
1227,,400,Miracle ,Magnagothica: Maleghast,Benevolence ,"With the grace of the divine, all things can be conquered. When you lead the faithful in a rally or worship service (faithful to you, to a religion, to an ideology, whatever), you may pronounce a blessing upon them, empowering them with the blessing of a Miracle. The precise form this miracle takes, is that if they are killed, they have a chance (about one in three) to return from the dead a few moments later, healed of the injury that slew them just enough that they don’t die again. This blessing lasts indefinitely, but must be upkept by faithful activity on behalf of the blessed one.

If you have Exorcist, and they are near you (within a few metres), the chance is more like 50%. Alternatively, you may make it so that the next time a blessed one dies, they are certain to receive the Miracle’s blessing, but this only occurs once before you must bless them again. 

You cannot bless yourself with the Miracle.

Boost Requires Exorcist to Activate"
1228,,400,A Good Samaritan,Kult: Divinity Lost,Benevolence ,"Who says good things don’t come to good people? Not you, for sure. While you might not have the chaps to necessarily take charge and lead, you’ll find that there’s something ineffably calming about your presence that draws people to you like sheep to a shepherd. The trust you inspire is supernatural in nature, some element of your soul touching even inhuman beings with a sense of amicability. Around you the mad are soothed with a few reassuring words, the angry keep their tempers and the wicked sheathe the knives they would have stabbed you in the back with.

Helping, genuinely helping and looking out for others’ problem helps you too-soothing any burden on your mind or soul, to the extent of speedy recovery from any mundane issue of the mind while greatly alleviating the trauma of any supernatural one. Your powers to aid verge on the supernatural; already when you observe and focus on one you can perform a feat of miraculous healing-with a dire cost, for you must transfer the wounds to yourself or a nearby target. And given trial and error, you may discover other ways to heal with different costs and reagents. Best of all it seems your selfless spirit is being reciprocated by the world, for you invoke a passionate adoration from divine beings. Many of the Forgotten Gods who drift through this world have fond memories of grander times among the human passion plays, and your selfless spirit in particular ignites the ardour of puppy love in them. Though mankind was both beautiful and terrible in its prime, you are a living example of why even some gods who were victimised by its onslaught yet yearn for their reawakening."
1229,,400,San Greal ,Scion ,Benevolence ,"A mysterious artifact most definitely associated with Christian iconography, even the gods seem confused about whether this relic dates back to the Tuatha de Dannan’s mythology or the more famous King Arthur legend. It appears to be a humble wooden cup with no handle, wider than it is deep. When a normally drinkable liquid is poured into it, this relic removes all drugs, poisons, dirt and other impurities to render it fit for consumption. Furthermore when a Scion expends a miniscule amount of Legend, the san greal can transform that liquid into a powerful healing potion that can heal any malady or wound short of death, or maybe the worst poisons or diseases the Titans can bring to bear. On top of everything the san greal offers the Health purview to its owner, and while normally it can only be wielded by a truly pious holder it appears to recognise you as a worthy wielder."
1230,,400,Weathering The World’s Weight ,Scion ,Benevolence ,"The delineation between divine physicality and raw power is thin in the eyes of many. When Sun Wukong routed many of Chinese Heaven’s armies as a mere Titanspawn his unkillability and chaotic prowess became part of his Legend. When Thor fells armies of frost giants, he is the raw power of the storm. And whatever your beginnings, it’s become clear you’re unnaturally strong, resilient and swift even among your peers. A born warrior and athlete, upon apotheosis yours would be a tremendously destructive power even among the gods. Your Legend resonates strongly with feats that blur the boundary between miracle and might, and with enough adventures under your belt you too could race so fast time seems halted for environments and other deities alike for a few seconds or take a single blow from an angry Greater Titan on your abs with no harm. And though the feats of strength required to advance even further defy imagination, even this is not your limit."
1231,,400,Geotic,Scion ,Benevolence ,"Fundamentally connected to the life-affirming nature of the primordial biosphere, the creatures of Terra boast astounding regeneration- restoring both broken bones and gut stabs within seconds. Supernaturally effective damage, however, heals merely at a natural rate-and a being must be both within Terra’s realm (or at least a location deeply marked by her power) and maintain contact with the earth to enjoy these benefits. Last but not least while beings with lower legend ratings cannot damage Geotic creatures with the Earth purview, attacks incorporating the Death or Sky Purviews rend them as sunlight rends vampires."
1232,,400,If We Shadows Have Offended,Fate/Faerie Britain,Benevolence ,"“Think but this, and all is mended/That you have but slumbered here/While these visions did appear/And this weak and idle theme/No more yielding but a dream” – Puck, A Midsummer Night’s Dream.

It wouldn’t it be easy if you could just dismiss everything bad that happened in the world as a bad dream? Maybe it even is. But the line between dream and reality can be very thin.

You can aid your “allies” by layering them partially into a dream, imbuing them with the essence of night as “a time to escape reality”. Like a hero in a dream- world they will find themselves empowered in combat, without losing touch with reality as one might expect from such a dreamlike power.

Alternatively, rather than the nature of falling asleep, you can imbue your allies with the essence of the morning, filling them with wakeful energy and recharging any power sources they may possess. But while a refreshing morning can feel like it cleanses you of your sins, they still creep back nonetheless... the energy boost you provide is only a temporary benefit, and it will steal away in time.

More insidiously, you can infuse someone—be it an ally or an enemy—with the greatest of dreams. A beautiful dream such as to inspire someone to change their entire life—one that is consumed as fuel to propel the target to unbelievable heights of power. But once that fuel runs out, they fall asleep, and stay asleep, forever. If you use this ability on an ally, either be certain they are only inhabiting a temporary body, or be sure that you can afford to lose their services until the jump is over.

By manipulating the dreams of your targets, you are indirectly capable of manipulating their mind and consciousness. You don’t have fine precision over this, but it would certainly be within your power to seal away someone’s memories of a traumatic event... at least, until you want them to remember."
1233,,400,Protection of the Lake,Fate/Faerie Britain,Benevolence ,"One of the signature abilities of the Avalon le Fae, this allows you to harness your nature and connection to Avalon in order to bless the target. Their life will be blessed, which restores, reinvigorates, and reenergizes them; furthermore, this assures that their “fate” is protected from misdirection or corruption. People have a fated end, and this protection helps to ensure that their life does not come to a conclusion before that fated end. But, as Muramasa showed when he saved Artoria Caster from her own destiny, fate isn’t something immutable. This also provides an incredible defense against any sort of corruptive effects, allowing an ordinary faerie to fight against the Mors without having to worry about succumbing to the Mors Curse."
1234,,400,Queen’s Covenant ,Fate/Faerie Britain,Benevolence ,"Although the King Clan seems quite large at first glance, the truth is that other faeries are simply adopted into the clan. The head of the clan is able to imbue a fraction of her power into those she brings into the clan, making them much stronger, and only weakening her if she is far away from them; as long as they remain in relative proximity, she keeps full access to her abilities.

Now you too are able to infuse your minions with your power, making each one far stronger in exchange for a tiny sliver of yourself that you invest in them. As long as they don’t get more than a city’s-width away from you, you still possess your full strength, only losing access to it if they distance themselves from you.

You can also weaken your perks to provide lesser versions of them to your followers; in exchange for reducing your own perk by 1/100th of its regular power, you can instill a single individual with that same perk at 1/4th the power with which you would normally demonstrate it.

However, whatever you invest is permanently given up, and as such will be lost forever if your subordinates die or forswear their loyalty to you. But having an army of warriors able to fight at a significant portion of your own abilities may be worth the cost."
1235,,400,The Gift of Names ,Fate/Faerie Britain,Benevolence ,"When Morgan began gifting her Tam Lin with names from Proper Human History, it served several purposes—ones that are now available to you, too. The first is that it allowed her to partially merge the Spirit Origin of a Heroic Spirit from Proper Human History into her knights. Now, you can create this fusion for other people, layering a part of the “concept” of the chosen Heroic Spirit from Proper Human History atop your target and turning them into a faerie knight, a Tam Lin (even if they aren’t a faerie). This gifts them with a skill or ability possessed by that hero, although it is not of as high a rank as it was for the original.

Secondly, bearing the name of a hero from Proper Human History allowed her knights to distance themselves from their own true nature as nascent Calamities. Those you gift a Tam Lin name to will receive a superior version of this; any racial or inherent weaknesses they may possess will cease to have an effect for as long as they are known by their title as a Tam Lin, rather than their original name. They will likewise find that they have an easier time fighting against any urges of their base nature they may possess, such as the drive to destroy a nation.

Thirdly, it obscured the original name of the Tam Lin. Those you have gifted a Tam Lin name to will find that even people who already knew their original name are unable to remember, hear, or even read it. Know that this is a deceptive effect, so abilities such as Fae Eyes will see straight through it and remember it clearly. Furthermore, once someone manages to openly reveal a Tam Lin’s true name, this method of hiding that their name ceases to have an effect on anyone for the rest of the jump, although they will not lose their abilities if their true name is discovered. This will also serve to hide your Tam Lin’s true name from those who have some method to discover it, unless that individual also possesses the means to see “the truth” of things.

Unlike the original, those who bear the title of Tam Lin will be able to toggle these effects on and off, making themselves “normal” again if they would prefer to be, and reassuming these powers when they want them.

You cannot gift yourself a Tam Lin name."
1236,,400,Truth From Fantasy(World),Fate/Faerie Britain,Benevolence ,"Here is a simple fact: this world is not supposed to exist. It was a pruned timeline, and the entire Fae Era was only a simulation created by the Tree of Fantasy. It was Morgan who turned this from a simulation to reality, but everything with an origin in the time of the Tree of Fantasy—including every single human being that isn’t a changeling—is ultimately just a simulation interacting with reality as though it was real, and would be unable to survive outside of a Lostbelt or Lost World without a massive overturn to the very nature of Proper Human History.

You defy this paradigm. It doesn’t matter if you’re just a simulation or an imitation of reality; even if you left your simulation, you’d be able to survive just fine on the outside. Even if you were a fantasy, you could exist in the real world. Being a member of a Lostbelt is in no way harmful or risky for you; even if the Lostbelt were to collapse, you’d be left alive where it once stood none the worse for wear.

With an act of will, you can gift a copy of this perk to other people to ensure that they too would be able to live in an environment where they would otherwise be dismissed as a fantasy.

But perhaps that isn’t enough. Perhaps you want to save more people just those you can directly gift this perk to—or it could be that you don’t care about them at all, and only want to ensure that the land of Faerie Britain survives. By spending an additional -400 CP, you can expand this ability to enable you to make an entire “world” immune to attempts to delete it, prune it, relegate it to fantasy, or outright destroy it. In this jump, it would apply to Lostbelts and Lost Worlds—you could even make it apply to Singularities—but in future jumps it might be able to preserve planets, universes, or entire timelines, if they are in danger of being destroyed. You can control what this perk protects, in case you encounter a world you would relish seeing destroyed."
1237,,400,Svalinn,Germanic/Norse Mythology,Benevolence ,"A shield that could put the great hammer of Thor to shame. Indestructible and able to reflect all force, power, damage, and harm back on its attackers while remaining completely unmovable except by it wielder or owner. The shield is a dancing weapon and able to return at will to its owner, resizing itself for its owners needs. Raising it could protect the world from the full force of the sun, absorbing its power for other uses or scattering it to the winds, able to raise it to the sky and cast shade upon the world. Its wielder holding power and control over the wind, snow, ice, and shadow, it acts as a dark mirror to a certain sword.

1238,,400,Véurr Véoðr Vingþórr,Germanic/Norse Mythology,Benevolence ,"Hallower. Thor is often thought of as a war god and he is, but he is much more. Thor is also the god of purification. You now hold this power, you can break any curse, wash away any poison (yes, norse mythology is full of irony), burn away any disease, consecrate any land or sustenance, refine any metal, or even clean the environment. You may do this in a similar manner to Thor. Choose a destructive element like ice, lightning, or fire, you gain control over this element and may wield it like Thor wields lighting, you may break things and purify them with your element then restore them except now cleansed. This also may mend or repair things, objects, places, and the like freely, but it can not replace what is lost. You may even perform this action on souls. Or you may be kind and skip the destructive part of your cleansing. Things you have consecrated could be considered holy or sacred, lands will become more verdant, bodies more vital, metals more mystical. All these abilities grow with your power over your chosen element. Oh , as an aside you can freely ordain marriages with the full backing of the universe no questions asked mister preacherman. It will be accepted as legal, even where it normally wouldn’t be."
1239,,400,Fingerprint Stone Shield,Elden Ring - Altus Plateau,Benevolence ,"A great stone shield with an intricately carved fingerprint design. One of the heaviest of all greatshields, it offers unparalleled protection from all sources. Part of the tomb of an ancient god, the Readerless Fingers relayed their message through these imprints, said to be the very seeds from which frenzy first sprouted."
1240,,400,Jesus Loves Me Patch ,South Park: The Stick of Truth,Benevolence ,"A equipment patch that will revive you once per battle while here, outside this gauntlet it provides a single one up per decade. Does not have to be actually equipped to be used."
1241,,400,Death-Dodging Luck,Cultivation Chat Group,Benevolence ,"You keep seeking death, but are lucky enough that you haven’t found it yet. This luck doesn’t really help for anything else, but most people are fond of not dying. Risky behavior is actually safer for you than taking the boring, easy way out.

Once per jump, or once every ten years in longer jumps, this perk allows you to survive actual certain death, like being resurrected by a metal ball after failing a demonic tribulation in the Netherworld. The odder the way that you died, the odder the method of your survival will be."
1242,,400,Frenzied Strength Imparting,Cultivation Chat Group,Benevolence ,"You’ve learned Daoist Priest Horizon’s signature ability which allows him to impart excess strength to others, delaying his tribulation so that he can firm up his foundation. Granted, there’s still that problem that the excess strength could cause others to suffer their own tribulations, but you should figure out how to fix that by the time this jump ends if you try.

In future jumps, you can use this technique to grant others the ability to cultivate by imparting a minuscule amount of strength to them. You also have the potential to learn how to impart other perks and powers with this ability, though doing so will temporarily weaken them until you regain your strength."
1243,,400,Stressed by a Mountain of Luck? ,Cultivation Chat Group,Benevolence ,"You have very good luck: strings of coincidences end with you being in a much better position than where you started, even if the path along the way is sometimes a little bumpy (think “living in interesting times”). Your luck is also curiously contagious - friends and allies around you have their luck improved as well, without experiencing the same sort of excitement that you suffer. If one of your allies happens to be very lucky to begin with, the sky’s the limit to what you can achieve together."
1244,,400,Redirect,Generic TCG Anime,Benevolence ,"You’re experienced with dealing with other creatures’ magical powers to the point that you can bounce them back. So long as you are conscious enough to respond to a given magical/energy attack, you can negate it and send it right back at its source, dealing damage to them as if you’d cast it instead. This applies any of your relevant Perks to the ability, so if you’re a pyromancer getting a Fireball thrown at you, well...God help your opponent; on the flip side, if you’re weaker with a certain Element or what have you, your copy of the attack will reflect (ba-dum-tish) that."
1245,,400,The Strongest Kitten,A Wild Last Boss Appeared!,Benevolence ,"What a graceless option. But I guess all stories need a strong brute whose main gimmick is his muscles. You seem to be really eager to fill up that role with that stupidly strong body of yours. Whatever race you are a member of, at least from a purely stat perspective, you will always find yourself being at least ten times stronger than what you should have been at that level. At a lower level, this stat increase will be really noticeable, but at the higher levels it’s going to be terrifying, enough to make you into one of the ‘boss’ monsters of this world, regardless of what you are. 

Your combat powerness doesn’t end with your unnaturally excellent body attributes, you are also a genius when it comes to martial arts, combat sense and acquiring the related skills. But obviously someone whose mere fist is enough to pulverize your level peers and their cheap tricks is not going to need something like that.

You have the makings of a true Boss-Class Monster, and as such, your increased status also grants you an immunity to instant death attacks. It wouldn’t do for the King to be killed by such petty tricks."
1246,,400,Destruction Growth,Bofuri,Benevolence ,"Any time you or your equipment takes damage, when it is repaired you or the item will be stronger for it. The more damage taken, the greater the growth. A nick will hardly cause any growth, while near-total destruction will probably double the potency.

This also lets you toggle off any invulnerabilities you have and make any of your equipment temporarily destructible. After all, you need to get destroyed to grind."
1247,,400,Respawn Point,Bofuri,Benevolence ,"NWO’s respawn system has a bit of a problem - it only works inside NWO.

You get a limited version of it that works outside the game. If you die, you can respawn at one of your properties or inside the warehouse.

This works once before needing a refresh, which automatically happens ten years after use or at the end of a Jump, whichever happens first. But you can also refresh this if you or your companions and allies defeat the person responsible for killing you, or the group if taking you down was a team effort. Go and avenge yourself!"
1248,,400,Escortees Will Stand Within Two Meters of the Player ,Bofuri,Benevolence ,"Escort missions suck, especially when the splash damage starts getting thrown around. Now, anyone you’re escorting who isn’t a combatant is immune to being collateral damage - for them to be harmed they must be directly targeted. In addition, those you are escorting are granted a low threat status, meaning that your enemies will be focused on the escort themselves - that is, you.

Escortee NPCs also tend to have horrible pathfinding and get stuck. No more! Your escortees will be granted the speed, agility, and environmental resistance to stay close with you. If you’re on the back of your giant floating turtle 50 meters off the ground, they will be able to leap that high to ride with you."
1249,,400,Unpatchable,Bofuri,Benevolence ,"In a world where the devs can nerf your skills with a single keystroke, it would be better if that didn’t happen. You, your powers, your Items, and your personal equipment cannot be limited by external effects, except with your explicit consent. This also covers retcon-style effects, like from time travel.

If the effect is a rebalancing (some boon, some bane) of something, you may choose to have it manifest as a temporary boost with only the boons mattering. An effect with a duration of minutes or an hour will last about half as long, and longer effects have a duration that asymptotically approaches two months for permanent changes. You can choose to accept the rebalance, and then it will work as normal, with the remaining normal duration.

This also unlocks your NWO-granted abilities during this Jump, instead of waiting until the end."
1250,,400,Recuperation,Final Fantasy XIII,Benevolence ,"All living beings allied to you in your surroundings are healed, and they will find that after the healing, any wounds they receive will still heal quicker than usual. Effect lasts for five minutes. Can be used two times per day."
1251,,400,Paradigm Shift ,Final Fantasy XIII,Benevolence ,"Whenever you have allies fighting around you, you may form a “Paradigm” based on your classes. If you have no classes, the Paradigm is based instead of your battle tendencies.

Tendencies that have similar effects (Multiple Sentinels/Defensive Tactics) stack on each other’s effects.(A 3x defence boost in this case)

Tendencies which cover all fronts (Ravager,Sentinel,Medic/Offensive, Defensive, Support all mixed together) will lower the enemies effectiveness against you on all attacks, as well as boost each member slightly. (A 1.3x boost to each member in this case)

Each ally within a fifteen meter range is counted up to a maximum of eight allies. The boost scales with the more people there are. (To a maximum of 6x on similar and 2.5x on varied)"
1252,,400,Don’t​ ​Stop​ ​Me​ ​Now,Demon:​ ​The​ ​Fallen,Benevolence ,"When travelling from one destination to another, you are more likely to have safe travels, despite any hazards that might have been in your way. Bandits will pass you by as you travel through the woods, Cops simply won’t notice when you speed through a red light and miraculously don’t t-bone another driver. As long as you are only moving from point A to B, the path will generally be a safe one."
1253,,400,Beyond​ ​The​ ​Gaze​ ​Of​ ​God,Demon:​ ​The​ ​Fallen,Benevolence ,"You are immune to any outside source of corruption, including demonic Torment. You may use Low Torment evocations without it staining your soul and risk pulling you back into the abyss. It also becomes surprisingly easy to tell yourself that the ends justify the means, and others will tend to lean towards agreeing with you."
1254,,400,Push It Further,Cradle V1,Benevolence ,"As you explore the world, you will be dying to experiment with everything you see. No matter what you attempt, any experiment to grant you more power will be at least somewhat compatible and won’t result in instant death or hideous mutations. Any power you do receive will be integrated into your body seamlessly. This works for other things, like martial arts, but not the various pools of energy in your body."
1255,,400,Ankh,Egyptian Mythology,Benevolence ,"The very symbol of everlasting life. This ankh exists in a form of your choosing and may be freely combined with another item: it may be a tiny gold charm on a bracelet, a decorative head on the end of your was staff, mounted atop an awe-inspiring crown, or be a wand to hold in your hand.

The ankh has a broad variety of powers related to life and healing; it may rid disease from the sick, close open wounds, satisfy all the vital needs of the body (relieving hunger, thirst, exhaustion, the need of air etc.), bless a body to remain healthy for years, or restore vigor to the elderly. As long as the power is related to the restoration of a malady, illness or injury, the Ankh can carry it out on any person with a touch or a wave. It might even bless many people with lesser effects – healthy life – if used to bless a source of food or water. The height of its power is to resurrect a dead body to life once more, or to create a new mortal body for a spiritual being from scratch."
1256,,400,The Only Power Worth Having ,Marvel Zombies,Benevolence ,"Is willpower. It is not innate powers, or talent, or intelligence that makes greatness, though they certainly helped. Great things are achieved through the determination to see them through. And you’ve got the will to match the greatest heroes and villains. No matter what happens, you’ll keep going. Maybe it’s hope, maybe it’s a promise, or maybe it’s sheer spite, but nothing will deter you from trying to accomplish your goals. You will never give up. Ever, come hell or high water.

Moreso, this force of will can push you beyond what should logically be possible in some aspects. Ordinary, mortal wounds can be ignored to some degree - while a headshot would mean the end, you could stay alive after being shot in the heart long after you should’ve died, and even live to see another day if you get medical attention in time. Once a jump (or every ten years), you can multiply your strength tenfold for a very brief moment, when you’re really on the ropes and there’s no other alternative. Your will can push you beyond your limits and all expectations - but only once. Even if you were zombified, you could hold on to the morals you once had - resisting the hunger to some degree, or eventually even reclaiming your humanity (or whatever you were) in spirit if not in body."
1257,,400,Riskbreaker,Final Fantasy XII,Benevolence ,"Your companions are your greatest strength, and together, you can overcome even the biggest challenges. For each trusted companion within a small area around you, all of your defences will increase substantially. You’ve watched each other’s backs before – and it’s become wholly second nature to all of you."
1258,,400,Hero’s March,Final Fantasy XII,Benevolence ,"A fanfare roars above the din of battle, all allies who hear the magickal sound is invigorated. All your allies within earshot find themselves more vigorous, more agile, and more competent as the music plays. While channelling, no other actions may be taken."
1259,,400,Reverse,Final Fantasy XII,Benevolence ,"The mystic art of reversing damage is a finicky one. When you cast this spell onto yourself or your allies, you can temporarily absorb and heal damage up to your own equivalent in health.

When the accumulated damage would surpass your full health, the difference is still taken as damage. As with all spells, the effects of reverse can be dispelled. However, due to the inherent concentration needed in creating such a peculiar barrier, if there is a single foe within the area, this spell may fail on casting.

As this only affects the consequences of your foes’ actions, you may try to cut yourself after casting this – and you will bleed. You may try to stab your eye – and you will go blind. Be especially careful about reflected spells...as Reverse will ignore those completely."
1260,,400,The Curse of Achilles,Percy Jackson and the Olympians,Benevolence ,"Achilles, the legendary hero whose greatness is sung in the tales of the Trojan War. A man who, as a child, was dipped into the River Styx in order to make him invincible. That is, save for a single point. You too, are now like this. From this moment on your body is now invincible, blades and arrows all gliding off of your body and failing to make contact as you wade through battle, seemingly invulnerable. However, just like Achilles, you have a single vulnerable point of your choice. While the rest of your body could take incredible amounts of punishment, just a light jab towards this area will send pain arcing through your body and a solid hit will quickly dispatch to the afterlife. As an added bonus due to your status as the Jumper, you may choose as to whether or not you wish to be affected by the Achilles curse each year."
1261,,400,Masochistic Will ,Black★Rock Shooter,Benevolence ,"Oh dear, are you sure this is alright? To take such pain into yourself, eagerly, readily, without apparent cause or concern for your own well-being... It reminds me of a certain girl. Your willpower has been massively boosted, able to feel as though your arm has ripped off or both of your legs shot and broken and keep on going despite the pain and with only a single shout of pain instead of the crippling anguish that should overcome you. You’ve the will, the gall to say that you will be the only one to feel hurt, that they need not hurt yourself for me, in-front of your Otherself, a being made for the sole purpose of taking your grief and trauma to help you without blinking.

And perhaps that is more literal than you or they think. You can now take on the emotional and physical pain of others, suffering them and alleviating them for the person in-question. If someone has lost an arm, you can suffer through that loss and let them have their arm again, take the grief of a lost loved one or family member to let them move on peacefully. This perk doesn’t make you more physically durable so the physical portion of this ability will more likely to be unused, but the mental and emotional pain of people around you can be handled easily enough with your enormous pool of willpower.

You have to be close to the person, both physically and emotionally to activate the second portion of this power... due to the nature of this power, your Otherself would automatically count as someone available so you can take away the pain they feel from... you… 

Don’t think about it too hard."
1262,,400,Skill of Miach,Irish Mythology,Benevolence ,"Many are the miracle cures in the legends, for anything but decapitation or cutting the marrow through. But there was one healer who could reattach limbs, the son of Diancecht, Miach. It is his surpassing skill with healing you have, and more. For when his father grew envious and struck him down with a sword, Miach healed instantly each time. Until the third blow when Diancecht struck his head off. You also can heal yourself of anything but decapitation in a moment or two."
1263,,400,Healing Hands,Irish Mythology,Benevolence ,"The king’s hands are those of a healer, and none more so than Fionn Mac Cumhail. Whenever you cup water, wine or other drinks in your hands, it becomes a healing elixir that can wash away wounds. Three handfuls can mend anything short of death or dismemberment."
1264,,400,Sons of Mil ,Irish Mythology,Benevolence ,"Neither prophecy nor free will is supreme in the myths of Ireland; a man can fight his fate but can’t always win. Except for you, like the ancestors of the modern Irishmen landing on the shore, prophecies and foretellings seem not to include you, and those fated to die by a specific hand can certainly meet their end at yours."
1265,,400,The Needle's Might ,Slay the Princess,Benevolence ,"The strength you once had has been bolstered to levels unparalleled, far beyond anything living now. In a single blow, you can reduce legions of men to greasy pulp between your fingers, and blows slide off your flesh like oil. There is so little that can harm you, that can push you to the brink of death, that it has grown almost...droll. Tiring. Dull. You can win almost any direct confrontation with barely even grazes to show for it, and nothing can compare to your sheer power. It is vexing, maddening. And you yearn for the day when you can face an opponent who sits beyond you in strength.

Let it be noted that for all your raw power, you have also traded actual speed for the sake of it - you are far slower than you would normally be and it would be quite easy for some intrepid Hero of some sort to simply outmaneuver and bleed you to death in a battle of attrition. As unlikely as that is."
1266,,400,A Lover Never Surrenders,Slay the Princess,Benevolence ,"Hey what are you, wait no stop get out of-Ah, now that we have gotten that hard-headed villain of love out of the way, it is finally time to make sweet, sweet love to our beloved Princess! But we will need the power to make our desires a reality, and that's exactly what this is for. The power of true love shall guide the both of us in all things, and whatever foul obstructions that would prevent us on our valiant quest shall be destroyed by the sheer overwhelming brilliance of our yearning to be united with our fairest maiden!

...What he means to say is, that so long as your ‘true love’ for someone you care for in a romantic sense remains true and earnest, you will be able to completely ignore or sidestep whatever narrative conventions exist that would try to force or, as you'd crudely put it, “railroad” you away into an undesirable outcome. Eugh."
1267,,400,Ive got no strings,Final Fantasy XI,Benevolence ,"Some puppetmasters have found that over time their automatons start to grow and develop their own little quirks and bobs, almost as if they have their own personalities. Actually exactly like they have their own personalities, over time automatons (or robots like them) around you will slowly develop their own will and sense of self, allowing them to be able to do much more in any situation without you needing to constantly micromanage them. Though they will be both more powerful and more intelligent this could lead to some unforeseen consequences, their personality will develop depending upon how you interact with them so have care. This basically allows robots to gradually become semi to fully autonomous thanks to your input."
1268,,400,Revive,Final Fantasy XI,Benevolence ,"Death is a common enough occurance in an adventurers line of work and notmally it is the end of the adventure, but that need not always be the case. Your skill with white magic is something amazing and while normally revive will only allow you to awaken a passed out friend now it can truly revive the dead, provided you have the magic for it and they have been dead for no longer than 1 hour."
1269,,400,Chakra Healing,Final Fantasy XI,Benevolence ,"One secret of the monks power comes from their ability to manipulate the natural energy of their bodies known as chakra using it to enhamce their attacks or heal themselves, this ability allows them to survive much stronger attacks that their lightly armored bodies normally should. Unlike most neophyte monks you are a master at using your chakra to heal yourself should you choose you can do this do this almost subconsciously giving yourself something of a minor healing factor, wounds that should take days to heal instead take mere moments."
1270,,400,A New Route,Dies Irae,Benevolence ,"The future that has been set down as certain need not remain such. With your presence, events that normally must happen can instead be changed or avoided. Things that are fated to be cease to be such around you. You are able to break the bonds of fate, destiny and certain lines of events to make paths unable to be taken before now able to be travelled. This does not make the normally impossible possible, simply force reality to be unable to make possible things impossible. An event that might normally be locked to a single outcome despite your efforts can now be easily changed and such."
1271,,400,Leased Vessel,Dies Irae,Benevolence ,"Those who are favoured amongst the round table will often receive more support than usual, a gift or reward to encourage further good work or, in an emergency, a way to support a soldier against an enemy the commander cannot yet fight. Other people are now able to loan you a portion of their power or even outright abilities that they possess on a temporary basis if they wish, even if they lacked this power before. They must willingly and knowingly do this, being able to retake it at any time and the power will automatically leave you to return to them should they die or you leave the jump you gained them in. That said, while you are present, you can become the avatar of your leader’s wrath. "
1272,,400,The Hangman,Dies Irae,Benevolence ,"An executioner, a proper Guillotine Man, is a very precise kind of person. They focus entirely on that single cut, only taking what they wish. Perhaps not in the way you are now able to but the spirit of it all remains the same. You only harm, kill or destroy that which you wish to. This works on a physical level, letting you never harm an ally unintentionally with a stray shot and also on a more metaphysical level, letting you use a weapon that attacks souls and destroy only certain parts of a soul that you attack or destroy only the main soul and leave any connected souls alive. If you had the ability to interact with it, you can destroy only a part of it even if you should destroy all of it. "
1273,,400,Three Lives to Live,80s Sword and Sorcery,Benevolence ,"You have been bestowed with not one life as most mortals, but three. At the start of each jump choose a certain month of the year. Should you die, be destroyed, or even be unmade, erased from existence, or the like and still have one of these other lives you will be resurrected during the next instance of this month, in a place of relative safety and power for you. Nothing can strip more than one of these lives from you at a time, no matter how thorough the destruction of your being, the others safe until you begin to live them.

These lives replenish at the start of each jump or 1 life every 50 years, whichever comes first, giving you in effect 2 extra lives to use each jump. The resurrected from this perk may also restore you to the prime of your life, reversing the detrimental effects of aging."
1274,,400,Son of the Devil,80s Sword and Sorcery,Benevolence ,"Well maybe not the devil, but possibly his messenger and agent Belial, or failing that you definitely possess something demonic about you. This demonic heritage grants you strength slightly less than Mighty Thews and comparable to that of a strength focused Demihuman. More potent than your muscles is perhaps your hypnotic gaze capable of overpowering the will of another and putting them in an obedient thralldom. Well gaze isn’t completely right, as it is less a power of your eyes alone, and more your true demonic visage as you now have a second, twisted demonic face which is clearly inhuman and which must be revealed to use this gaze. This gaze takes effort and overpowering their will with your own, and you may only keep one individual enthralled in this way at a time, leaving them with little creativity or thoughts of their own being little more than a puppet that you control. The real value that you are paying for is your resilience and resistance to mundane injury. Non-magical weapons do you little to no lasting harm; you could be stabbed with a sword and even with the sword still inside of you it would do you no harm and the moment it was removed you would be completely unharmed, decapitation by a mundane weapon would be as simple as popping your head back on; sufficiently power assaults such as cave-ins or high explosives or cave-ins might harm you, but they would inflict only a small fraction of the damage that they should. In fact weapons which pierce your flesh find themselves inside of a fiery furnace capable of melting steel. Magical weapons and supernatural/mystical attacks, including such things as chi, can still harm you, though unless they’re sacred or holy in some way they will still do less harm to you than they would to a normal individual, and you will still heal from such wounds at an accelerated rate. While this will protect you from mundane fire along with most forms of direct physical harm, despite the fiery nature of your insides you have no particular resistance to magical flames over other magical forms of harm and damage. Also while this will protect you from physical wounds from mundane sources you still age, require sustenance, and this grants no particular immunity to disease or poisons."
1275,,400,Regeneration,The God of High School,Benevolence ,"Your body is capable of healing itself on a massive scale by utilising your life energy and doing so automatically. Whilst you now possess a quite significant healing factor even with expending your energy, enough to heal most cuts or bruises in a minute or two, when you actually spend energy this becomes far faster. You’ll be able to restore destroyed organs or severed limbs in just a few seconds and as you grow in overall power, the extent that you’re able to heal from will grow as well. Maybe someday soon you won’t need more than a head or a hand left to survive."
1276,,400,Heracles,The God of High School,Benevolence ,"The greatest hero of Greece, Heracles himself. In raw power it can be said to be one of the greatest Charyeok in the world and it grants this in the form of incredible physical might to its user. Even an ordinary boy would become able to lift hundreds of tonnes with a single hand or survive being kicked through multiple buildings with nary a scratch on their body, along with the endurance to fight for hours at a time. As your experience and bond grows, you will be able to pull out more and more of the legendary strength of Heracles."
1277,,400,Aftermath Survivor,The God of High School,Benevolence ,"Some pretty crazy battles go on around here. Even early on in the big tournament you’re entered in, people seem to be busting up the stage and the audience seats as they please. Later on there’ll be fights that bring the entire planet to the breaking point and whole countries will get wiped clean. A girl could really get lost and killed in all the confusion, if she weren’t as lucky as you. Long as you’re not a direct combatant or a target of any side in the fight, you’re just obscenely lucky in regards to getting out unscathed. People decide to chuck mountains at each other? The rubble always lands just a bit to the side of you, while never trapping you forever in some cave. People decide to blow up the Sage Realm? If you leg it really fast, you’ll be able to get to the portal that opened up just a bit near your position, instead of where it would normally open. Of course, if no one was going to open a portal in the first place, it won’t appear near you either. There’s only so far you can abuse your luck and if there’s really no way out of turning into collateral, it’d be best to start your prayers."
1278,,400,This is What I Want,The God of High School,Benevolence ,"In the past, you experience a crisis of identity, of not knowing what your place or role in the world was and finding yourself unsure of who you were. But you survived that experience and came out with the knowledge of who and what you really are. You are always aware of who and what you are as a person, what your essence of character is, and unnatural changes that are forced on you cease to be so. It is not possible to change who you are, through magic or torture or drugs or any other methods, without your own consent. Indeed, you can even stop yourself from changing over time due to natural causes, such as retaining the fiery ambition you have as a youth or preventing yourself from becoming jaded over time. You are always aware of the ways you are naturally changing as a person and can stop all or some of these if you so desire."
1279,,400,A Most Divine Constitution,The God of High School,Benevolence ,"A divine being is rarely one who falls to physical infirmities or the meagre wounds mortals are capable of producing. Even amongst Gods, your sheer endurance is remarkable. While most Gods would resist any mortal disease or poison, you are able to shrug off even the strongest of supernatural poisons or disease. And when it comes to being killed, it’s a trial and a half to actually make you stay down. You do not truly require any of the organs that frail humans rely so much on. Instead, so long as your body is at half there, you will survive and fight onwards. Even being reduced to a smoking, blackened skeleton from the waist up would not slow you down for a second."
1280,,400,Racial Taboo,The God of High School,Benevolence ,"The Taboo laid upon humanity is nigh absolute. Even the strongest human to ever live, Taejin Jin, a man who erased part of a country during one battle and could split mountains in two with one kick, could only lightly harm a Nephilim rank God with his strongest attacks. Once the taboo was lifted, that same man could kill those same Nephilim with a lazy slap of his hand. As a God you benefit from the Taboo laid upon humanity but in the coming years it is likely to be broken, one way or another. You will retain it however, in this world and any future ones. The taboo is now an innate part of your divine being, applying the same reduction to any attack against you that originates from a human being. Some attacks will damage or even kill you, depending on their power or special qualities, but anyone below the level of the monstrous Special Human known as Taejin is unlikely to even scratch you."
1281,,400,Twenty Dollars is Twenty Dollars,Chainsaw Man,Benevolence ,"There’s always money to be made if you’re willing to make sacrifices, but wouldn’t it be better if you were guaranteed a degree of safety in the process? Twenty bucks for swallowing a lit cigarette is now free money for you, Jumper. From now on, any time you are promised a reward for completing a task you will find it that much easier to do so. On top of that, the larger the reward is the greater the effect. If the reward is a result of a contract forged with Contract Creation, this effect is even more pronounced. A devil that would undoubtedly kill you would only have a coin flip’s odds if you were promised a truly great reward for it."
1282,,400,Drinking On Your Tab,Chainsaw Man,Benevolence ,"The brave Jumper, helper of the weak and savior of the hopeless! With this perk, you can repay the debts of others or take on their traumas. This doesn’t simply remove it from them, but rather settles it in the most efficient and wholesome way while transferring it to you. Even if the payment has already been taken, you can switch your own resources where theirs were. If you wish, they will know what you’ve done for them upon this occurring and probably be thankful for it. With practice this ability can be used to take on physical burdens in real time at greater and greater ranges, allowing you to tank for your companions. You can share these burdens with those who you have control over, too. One day you might be able to use this perk to spread the harm across an entire populace. If you’re evil, maybe you could even learn how to force your burdens on others?"
1283,,400,Spiritual Doctor,Fate/Stay Night,Benevolence ,"You have gained a Sorcery Trait, a unique aspect or ability of magecraft, known as Spiritual Healing. With this, one can perform surgery on mental or spiritual wounds as if they were physical injuries, using skill in magic and magical energy to heal them. This could allow the user to bring back the mind of someone who has gone insane or to heal damaged Magic Circuits. Beyond just healing, it is possible to use this trait to do other surgical actions, such as transplanting numerous Magic Circuits relatively safely or taking out Command Seals from a Master's body/soul and implanting them in another person. An esoteric technique such as this however, is extremely costly and requires great skill in medical techniques in the first place. Whilst you will never lose this Sorcery Trait from overuse like other users, you will need greater and greater amounts of skill the stranger or more dangerous the surgery you are performing with it."
1284,,400,Saying No,Fate/Stay Night,Benevolence ,"Evil is tempting. It's the easy path. The rewards can be so very tempting sometimes and not having to deal with the harshness that can come with doing the right thing, it's not hard to see why some people can fall into the worst sorts of lives. Maybe it was just pressure and stress, instead of dark temptations, but fall they did. You though, you can always so no. No matter the rewards promised to you, the temptations laid out before you, the threats if you don't comply or even outright control of your mind or body, you will always be able to refuse to commit any evil actions, regardless of the outside influence on you. It will always be your choice to make and it will be one you make free of any influence, based only on what you truly desire and need. Of course, this means that your choice will be yours to bear. If you pick badly, no one but you will be to blame."
1285,,400,Against All Odds,RWBY,Benevolence ,"Standing against the never-ending hordes of Grimm would be a death sentence for normal man. Good thing you aren’t. You are a Huntsman, the very embodiment of Quality beats Quantity. Sure the Grimm may come wave after wave but that doesn’t have to stop you. No matter how many enemies you are fighting, if you are capable of defeating each of them individually, they will have no more luck teaming up on you."
1286,,400,Gift From a Wizard,RWBY,Benevolence ,"Ozma has handed out his fair share of gifts over the lifetimes. The Four Maidens, woman with the power to control magic, were made by him, same with the Branwen twins and their power to transform into birds. You are capable of something similar now, and may choose to gift someone any power you yourself possess. This does come at a price however, as you wont be able to use this power while it is given away, though you may rescind them at any time unlike Ozma."
1287,,400,Cleyran Barrier,Final Fantasy IX,Benevolence ,"The sandstorm around Cleyra protects the city from intruders, a boon bestowed upon them by a fragment of Crystal and fervent prayer. But if a fragment could protect a city, certainly it should only take a shard to protect oneself.

This shard of crystal manifests a barrier of air around you and hovers in place. As long as the shard persists, physical attacks are deflected away along with projectiles. It suffers when exposed to heavy magic however, and as it serves its purpose, the shard whittles away until eventually nothing is left, and the barrier falls as a consequence. It takes some time after the barrier falls to redeploy a crystal."
1288,,400,Universal Transplants,Inscryption,Benevolence ,"Losing body parts is not uncommon in this cabin. Getting them back is...also tenable. Given a suitable substitute, you may replace a missing organ, tooth, or other body part with a minimum of fuss. Just pop it in. What’s more, if that body part had any unusual abilities, you’ll find those abilities have passed themselves on to you."
1289,,400,Pilot’s Gift ,Knight’s and Magic,Benevolence ,"Now, while a Mecha’s main job is to protect the pilot, it doesn’t mean that the pilot can’t do anything to help the mech. The more durable you are outside of the mech, the more durable the mech becomes. if your skin is hard as stone then your mech adds your durability to its own innate metal construction. The harder you are to damage, the harder your mech is. Things such as your Aura, A-T Field, and other supernatural defenses also help defend your Mecha."
1290,,400,Swindler,Hazbin Hotel/Helluva Boss Pilot,Benevolence,"Hey, you there, care to play a hand of Poker? You have an uncanny ability to con, to the point where you can go into a place where “the house always wins” and come out with all of the house's money. You know all of the tricks in the book, lying, cheating, tricks of the hand, you know it to the point where you can be the origin of the book and nobody would question it. This perk also gives a decent boost in luck, but only when you are gambling, playing poker, just about anything you would see in a casino. Try not to get killed by those you absolutely crush at the table, most here in hell don't like losing as much money you could rake in."
1291,,400,Demonic Hero: Wild Beast,Avesta of Black and White,Benevolence ,"There is something inside you. A powerful idea that shapes you entirely, and gives you an endless willpower that just seems to grow in intensity each minute. Something that lets you push through any pain, injury and setback, just to keep walking towards it. Only the twisted Magsarion could compare when it comes to the strength of your will.

Perhaps your devotion is not set on the same murderous rage and killing intent that seems to stream from the Jet-Black Knight’s mind, maybe leaning towards a more noble purpose. But it is just as dense and powerful. Your presence is so strong that even those who are vastly more powerful than you cannot help but to feel fear at the sound of your laugh, your mere presence and gaze making others tremble from the sheer pressure of your will. And even those who try to dry your emotions or peer into your mind find themselves instead drowned on your bottomless emotions, eventually being erased by the ever-growing flow of emotions.

To many, you may seem a walking vortex of emotions rather than a man. Yet you may find that imperishable willpower of yours is quite a powerful asset in a world like this."
1292,,400,The Perfect Subject,Fate/Grand Order,Benevolence ,"Any man of science and magic would be overjoyed to have you as their subject, even more so if it were willingly. No matter what the experiment or procedure is meant for, you’re as perfect a subject as they could ask for. Well, almost. No matter what is being tried, as long as it has a chance of success at all, you’ll find yourself tens of times as likely to be a good match for the procedure and for it to go ahead, if it does succeed, with far fewer complications and negative side effects. Whether it be physical body alterations, experiments on the soul, cosmetic treatments or an attempt to fuse you with the spirit of a Heroic being from the past, you’ll almost always find yourself compatible. If you did undergo the Demi-Servant experiment, you’d have a good chance of survival even as an adult, a guarantee as a child, and be able to live almost a full human lifespan instead of the short 18 years of life normally granted. "
1293,,400,Eternal Sunshine,Fate/Grand Order,Benevolence ,"When you walk in the room, it lights up everyone’s faces. Unfortunately it’s not your winning personality at work but the shining sun that follows your presence. Or perhaps another feature entirely. See, when it comes to conditionally activated powers, you’ve got the blessing of not really needing to worry about conditions. As long as you need to satisfy a location or time based condition to use an ability or item, that time or location will overlay itself on you and your immediate surroundings. Need it to be noon to use your powers to their fullest? The sun will constantly shine down on you as if it were noon. Require being in a specific building to have your greatest abilities accessible? That building will overlay some of its features in the ground around you to ensure you can simulate being there just fine. There are some limits however. Time based conditions that do not occur at least once a year will not work for you through this and location based ones must be places you have been to and that are currently accessible in your current jump. "
1294,,400,I Wish To Live As A Man,Fate/Grand Order,Benevolence ,"God himself could come down from the Heavens and tell you your purpose...and you’d be able to tell him to jog right on. Your life is your own, not bound to anyone else’s’ desires or beliefs about how you should proceed. Your fate and destiny is unalterable by the unnatural influence of any other being, even He Himself, and you are free from any feelings of obligation that you do not willingly take on. Merely having abilities that grant power will never make you feel like you should need to use them nor will anyone ask for you to do so or expect it. Everyone around you understands that the actions you take will be those you decide to do and that the only way to change that would be to forcibly take control of your mind or body away from you. "
1295,,400,Shining Lights,Fate/Grand Order,Benevolence ,"Poisons, knives in the dark, war, betrayal, sabotage. A leader has to survive some pretty hairy stuff. Often they don’t survive, betrayals are just as popular in legends as miraculous tales of survival. Don’t get too worried about all that. It’s good to keep an eye out but you’ll have a little bit of support now that you have this. It’s your ticket out of one impossible situation every ten years. A battle where every path ends in your death would open up to allow you to escape unheeded. Trapped in a room filled with bombs? A miracle occurs and your soul briefly separates from your body to avoid the blast and reform later in a safe place. Surrounded by political enemies united against you, about to topple you from the throne? A sudden conflict will arise to send them into disarray and give you a bit of time to ready a defence. It’s only once each time and it’s only going to give you a chance but a good leader shouldn’t need anything more than that. "
1296,,400,Starting On Your Best Foot,Fate/Grand Order,Benevolence ,"If the hero died before the story started, there wouldn’t be much of a story, would there? If the plan of the bad guy had gone ahead, you’d have died back in the explosion without a chance to resist. When it comes to the schemes of the bad guys of your story, you always get at least a chance to resist their plots. You won’t get blown up out of nowhere, assassinated before even knowing who your opponent is or otherwise made useless before the story even starts. There’s no guarantee you’ll make a difference but you’ll always be able to last through the first stages of whatever plan you’re fighting against. "
1297,,400,Lone Fixer,Library of Ruina: HamHamPangPang,Benevolence ,"Or Meister, or Librarian, or whatever else you are doing. Whenever you are left to do something without support either through allies being killed/incapacitated or not being there in the first place, you end up being significantly stronger or more effective than you were before. You still are only one person though so don’t expect to handle as many tasks as well as a group would."
1298,,400,Rot Resistance,Bibliomania,Benevolence ,"While Rot Adaption can eventually give you immunity after a lot of exposure, this perk on the other hand gives you a hell of a natural resistance to anything that isn’t purely physical effects meaning that any form of malady, curse, poison, sickness or condition you may be affected by will now at best barley affect you. You are effectively resistant to 90% of all effects that aren’t purely physical(though purely magical is 45% resistance instead). This is an absurdly broad level of resistance and due to its benefits even temperature is affected allowing you to be comfortable in both extreme heat and cold to the point you could sit in a bonfire and only feel a bit to hot while being unharmed, or swim naked in the arctic and only have to worry about the wildlife rather than the cold."
1299,,400,Enduring Legacy,Final Fantasy VII: Remake,Benevolence ,"The Ancients lived thousands of years ago, and yet their impact can still be felt today. Not only does Ancient culture and scripture survive to the present day, but even buildings and other constructions have stood the test of time. You too can now ensure your legacy lasts for millennia. The things you create, whether they be written works or physical constructs, will last hundreds of times longer than they otherwise would. This effect will improve if you or others actively work to preserve your creations. If the temple you erect goes unattended it could last for thousands of years, while a city that is carefully maintained will survive forever."
1300,,400,Unclouded Will,Final Fantasy VII: Remake,Benevolence ,"Cloud Strife didn’t have the strength to join SOLDIER at first. But where the body was weak, the mind was strong. Time and again, Cloud proved he could overcome life’s obstacles through sheer determination. You too possess his strength of will. Your psyche is resilient, able to work through any trauma given enough time. You have the tenacity to fight through any pain, and could overcome opponents while impaled on their sword. Even psychic domination would find little purchase on your collected spirit. No matter what attacks your mind suffers, your will shall remain unclouded."
1301,,400,Better Part of Valor,Final Fantasy VII: Remake,Benevolence ,"When you’re on a mission, you can’t afford to die in a heroic last stand. This perk amplifies your ability to avoid catastrophe and ultimate destruction. You know when and how to escape trouble should defeat seem certain, and almost always manage to save enough of your allies and resources to rebuild. Only the most complete and total defeats will leave you with nothing."
1302,,400,Collateral Damage,Final Fantasy VII: Remake,Benevolence ,"Migard is a dangerous place, what with super soldiers, freedom fighters, and monsters running around. An average Joe like you doesn’t want to get caught up in all that, right? With this perk, danger has a way of skirting around you. A crashing car may drive onto the sidewalk, only to swerve away from you. A fight between Avalanche and Shinra’s goons would happen far enough down the street to put you well outside the blast zone. You might even feel the need to take a long walk, only to find you narrowly avoided a city plate falling on your district. This won’t help if someone starts specifically gunning for you, or if you deliberately place yourself in danger, but you’ll never have to worry about collapsing buildings or stray shrapnel."
1303,,400,Suzaku’s Resurrection,Kurohime,Benevolence ,"The gods expressly forbid the use of magic to bring back the dead, and any attempt to use this world’s magic to revive someone from the dead will result in the Shinigami Angels coming to destroy their soul—and if you fight them off, more will come, and eventually even the gods will start showing up to destroy the resurrected soul and kill you in turn.

The sole exception to this is the power of Suzaku, the Phoenix, who holds the absolute power of resurrection and reincarnation. Now you too are able to bring the dead back to life in this manner... but be warned. Any given individual may only come back to life once per jump (or once per ten years, whichever comes first)."
1304,,400,Endless Devotion,Kurohime,Benevolence ,"Loyalty, love, and devotion are the strongest forces in this world. With enough love, you can even defy death. As long as the general shape of your body is relatively intact, your body will continue to function as though you were in perfect health. If you were to march through a river that dissolved flesh, and you were reduced to nothing but bone, you would still be able to lift your arms and keep pushing forwards. You could fight as well with a broken limb, or see just fine even if your eyes got slashed. It won’t let you keep control of a severed arm, however.

Finally, you have the remarkable ability to survive injuries that should be fatal... at least, for a little while. After you take lethal injury, you can keep functioning for up to a few minutes before your body actually dies. This gives you time to heal, to relocate an ally, or to keep pushing the one you love through that flesh-melting river."
1305,,400,Dark Can-not,Super Smash Bros. Brawl,Benevolence ,"Dark Cannons. Off Waves. These ‘cheat-like’ effects automatically force a Fighter into their Trophy Form without a battle. You are now immune to these effects; such unfairness is no longer your concern.

Post-jump, you will become immune to any unwanted physical transformations imposed on you by outside forces, ensuring that similar tricks similarly fail to take you out of the fight."
1306,,400,Bug-Free,Super Smash Bros. Brawl,Benevolence ,"Those Shadow Bugs are quite the pests, huh? Copying your form, then turning it on your friends. Fortunately, this won’t be a concern for you.

From now on, you are immune to unwanted attempts at cloning you or copying your powers, causing them to inexplicably fail. Unwanted is the operative term here; if you did have some Shadow Bugs that you trust, you could still have them imitate you and act in your stead, if that’s what you wanted."
1307,,400,Long-Lived,Miraculous Ladybug,Benevolence ,"Like members of the Order of the Guardians, your lifespan is dramatically extended compared to that of a normal person’s. While you aren’t immortal, you age far more slowly once you reach your prime, and will do so more gracefully than before. You won’t start to experience the effects of old age until you start pushing against 200 years old. A second purchase (discounts persist) will mean that old age will no longer have effects on you at all and once you reach old age you will simply stop aging.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
1308,,400,Wielder of the Miraculous,Miraculous Ladybug,Benevolence ,"Most people only have the potential to wield a couple Miraculous at a time, any more than that causing damage to their body, mind, and possibly soul. You, however, are able to use up to five at a time without any issues, or up to eight with training and abilities from elsewhere for handling such strains. This is, by itself, an incredibly powerful ability, if you can get your hands on a few of them, but for an additional 200 CP you can wield as many of the Miraculouses as you want at the same time. This also continues into future Jumps with items/artifacts which aren’t supposed to be used all at once by yourself (Infinity Stones, Ninjago’s Golden Weapons, etc) and Post-Jump, this ability allows you to combine super-modes or other transformations into a single enhanced state with the benefits of both. You still have to get your hands on the items and be able to use the super-modes but once you do, you’ll be able to handle it without consequence."
1309,,400,Walking Freak Accident ,High School DxD,Benevolence ,"That’s what you are, damn it. You could be a completely, in-over-your-head Human schmuck without any resources or special powers, and you will constantly be in the right place and the right time. Your luck lets you stroll past possibly-fatal accidents or encounters with a spring in your step, find a handful of yen on the ground when you need spending money for lunch, and just happen to eavesdrop on a conversation about a hunt for a Sacred Gear held by one of your classmates. In short, your luck protects you from accidents or happenstance while letting you stumble onto resources and clues relevant to what you’re after. Sure, you still have to act on it when it’s not protecting you, and you won’t find items of great power just falling into your lap...but opportunities? Oh, yes. There will be lots of opportunities. Just don’t lean too much on Lady Luck, or else it’ll run out before you know it."
1310,,400,I Should Be Dead By Now,High School DxD,Benevolence ,"How do you keep surviving?! Deadly situations involving powerful beings clashing just seem to...roll off of you. Lethal attacks fail to strike your vitals, huge explosions only knock you back, and a gigantic clash between supernatural forces just mildly inconveniences your trip to the grocery store. You now have strong plot armor against both happenstance and collateral damage. You’re also a lot more lucky in surviving dangerous or potentially lethal encounters, but someone hell-bent on you personally being dead or you pushing your luck too hard can still make a corpse out of you."
1311,,400,Miracle Man,Jujutsu Kaisen,Benevolence ,"A cursed technique that activates perhaps without you even being conscious of it, you’re able to store “miracles” you experience in your life for later use. Whenever you encounter a small, everyday miracle – which could be something as simple as seeing a digital clock when all the digits of the time are the same – it is erased from your memory and stored. Then, whenever you would take a fatal blow or are in genuine danger, these miracles are released, allowing you to survive through sheer luck. For example, if the ceiling were above you were destroyed and you were about to get crushed, a miracle might cause all of the falling rubble to land around you instead of on you. Or, if someone were to punch you in the face hard enough to kill you instantly, you might instead only lose a few teeth and go flying, your would-be killer assuming you’re dead.

Though you’re not innately aware of how many miracles you have stored up, there is a visual indication available to you. A number of triangular markings are visible on your body – when you have a miracle stored they become filled in with colour, but become just an outline when this is expended. By default these are located under your eyes, but can be found elsewhere if you choose. You can have up to six miracles stored at a time."
1312,,400,Domain Amplification,Jujutsu Kaisen,Benevolence ,"While quite a few different techniques for countering domains exist, none possess the same offensive capability as Domain Amplification. A rather complex ability, it involves coating oneself with a thin layer of their own Domain, as if surrounded by water. This has the effect of preventing the user from being targeted by the guaranteed hit effect of a Domain Expansion, but also comes with a useful secondary effect: neutralising the cursed technique of anyone it comes into contact with.

Now, you too are more than capable of using this rare technique, one few even know exist. Its power is such that it can even overcome a cursed technique as powerful as Limitless, bypassing its incredible defence to hit the user directly. However, there are two drawbacks to Domain Amplification: one is that the user is unable to use their cursed technique at all while it’s in effect, and the other is that its technique- neutralising effect can be counteracted by pouring enough energy into a cursed technique. Generally, the more energy you put into Domain Amplification, the harder it will be for other techniques to overcome its neutralisation. Needless to say, you can use Domain Amplification to counter supernatural abilities than rely on sources other than cursed energy, too."
1313,,400,Cockroach King,Jujutsu Kaisen,Benevolence ,"Gojo had a rather bad time when he first fought Toji Fushiguro. Stabbed through the throat and left riddled with deep wounds across his body, he was left to bleed out and die, completely defeated. Yet the strongest of sorcerers survived due to two factors: the first was an epiphany on how reverse cursed techniques worked, allowing him to heal his wounds. The other was Toji’s failure to make sure he finished the job, thinking that the lethal wounds he dealt would be enough.

You have a similar sort of luck to Gojo; somehow, you have an uncanny knack for surviving scenarios that really should have spelled your end. Your opponents frequently forget to do their due diligence in making sure you’re truly dead, giving you a chance to escape or recover. Even injuries that should be lethal may turn out to have instead just barely missed your vitals, incapacitating but not quite killing you. Though this protection isn’t absolute – an opponent who defeated you once is likely to do a better job confirming their kill the second time around, and some attacks might be too powerful for survival to be a possibility – it’s enough to get out of a sticky situation every once in a while, at least."
1314,,400,Broken Seal ,Jujutsu Kaisen,Benevolence ,"Sometimes, there comes along an opponent who cannot be defeated through normal means. One who stands so far above others that he’s quite literally untouchable. When such an individual comes along, there are often only two methods to deal with them: to find someone as strong or stronger than them to take them down, or to seal them away. The latter option was the method of choice used by Kenjaku during the Shibuya Incident to deal with Satoru Gojo, the greatest threat to his plans.

While you’re not totally immune to such effects, with this perk you’ll find that attempts to seal, imprison, or otherwise cause you long-term incapacitation without killing you are much less effective than normal. Weaker attempts to take you down in such manners fail outright, while even stronger attempts are far more temporary than they should be. Perhaps your allies find just the tools or techniques needed to set you free, or maybe the bonds holding you conveniently begin to weaken over time. Whatever the case, you’ll find that even the very strongest of seals can’t hold you for long – it’s never a matter of if you’ll escape, but when."
1315,,400,All Natural ,Jujutsu Kaisen,Benevolence ,"Some people are just born naturally gifted, their genetics putting them at a distinct physical advantage over others. With the right training, these people may go on to become record-breaking athletes, renowned across the world for their feats. And then there’s people like Itadori and you, who can exceed these limits without really trying, or perhaps even being aware of how unnaturally strong they are.

Even without the use of any cursed energy or heavenly restrictions, your physical abilities are a fair bit beyond the human limit. Through natural talent alone, you’re capable of such as feats as running 50 metres in just three seconds and throwing a shotput over 30 metres, both of which exceed the world records for such areas by an impressive margin, and you can likely go much further with actual training. This impressive physicality even helps with the use of jujutsu. When using cursed energy to enhance your body’s physical attributes, you get much greater results than normal, allowing you to hit harder, move faster, and shrug off more damage than others for the same expenditure of energy."
1316,,400,Inns Are Hospitals I Guess,Final Fantasy VII,Benevolence ,"Normally, they aren't. If you're injured or otherwise exhausted, no amounts of bed rest by itself will do anything to help you. At least before getting this perk, that was the case. So long as you and any active companions can manage eight hours of bed rest undisturbed, you will all awaken the following morning with all injuries healed, all personal energies restored, and fully refreshed to start a new day! Very handy for when you don't have scores of potions or healing spells to go through. Do note that any interruption of this rest will deny you the effects for a day and you get no special protections from ambushes or complications. Don't sleep in the slums."
1317,,400,Suspiciously Convenient,Final Fantasy VII,Benevolence ,"Alright, so let's say you're part of a ragtag bunch with no real supplies, influence, or a chance in hell on a journey to pursue someone or save the world somehow. Sounds difficult, right? Luckily, you tend to bump into things and people that can help you along the way. Need to sneak past a heavily militarized city? Luckily, there's a parade going on and you're mistaken for a new recruit. Your enemy is weak to magic but you don't have any Materia? Lookie here, there's one in a chest nearby! You need to go to a land that can't be reached by boat or airship? Good thing you're on speaking terms with a Chocobo Ranch owner who can eventually give you the means to breed one that can make the trip easily! And so on and so forth. The more difficult and far away these tasks are to complete, the smaller the helping hands and steps towards progress will be, but you will have a habit to bump into useful items and events that will speed you along your way. Just remember that luck by itself won't help much in extremely dire or dangerous situations. You can only get so many lucky breaks at once, after all."
1318,,400,Not A Puppet,Final Fantasy VII,Benevolence ,"There are a lot of things in this world that can put your very body and soul in chains. Whether its the oppressive lifestyle Shinra forces on both its customers and its victims or the corruption of all things involving Jenova souls, there are plenty of invasive forces that seek to control you. They're going to find it very difficult to get past you. Your willpower is iron, able to withstand a ridiculous amount of stress and trauma while still carrying on. What's more, this willpower translates to being able to resist involuntary mutations or corruption to your physical body, letting you hold onto your original form so long as you continue to resist it with your mind. Even a deadly infection like Geostigma will find you difficult to bring down or even inconvenience so long as you remain focused. You're not anyone's puppet and you're going to show that to the world."
1319,,400,Vial of Water of Life,Legends of Runeterra,Benevolence ,"How did you manage to find this? Nevermind. This is a vial of the Water of Life, whose healing properties were so great that it was said they could resurrect the dead. Of course, the only person who tried to use them for that purpose only managed to create the Black Mist. However, whoever drinks from this vial will be instantly healed from all physical injuries and all curses or malignant magic will be expelled from their body. Since you’re paying a hefty sum of CP for this, the vial will refill at the dawn of every day."
1320,,400,Unique,Legends of Runeterra,Benevolence ,"People that follow their how path all have a thing in common: there is nobody else quite like them. Sure, there can be someone coming from a similar background and race (like several Darkin) but even then, their powers and how they use them is completely different. That’s the case for you too. Your powers are your own, and nobody will ever be able to replicate them. Sure, imitators could emerge, but all they will ever manage are pale imitations that fail to use live up to the original. Of course, this is not all. This Perk also grants immunity to all attempts to duplicate you that don’t come from yourself, be it cloning, using parallel world version of yourself, temporal clones or whatever."
1321,,400,A Spark of Life,Legends of Runeterra,Benevolence ,"Despite all, there is still life in the Shadow Isles. The mighty forests have been corrupted, but they still endure. You too, now, are able to endure any type of corruption, acquiring all the powers it would normally give without being changed physically or mentally. Ever wanted to become a vampire but without all those annoying problems being a lord of the night bring? This is the Perk for you."
1322,,400,Trials of the Ocean,Legends of Runeterra,Benevolence ,"Nagakabouros, also known as the Goddess of Motion and the Mother Serpent, is a deity venerated in Bilgewaters. Sometimes, she tests those she deems stagnate in life, and if their souls are too weak, they’re killed. If that ever happens to you, don’t worry. You’re immune to any kind of soul manipulation."
1323,,400,Crate of Feathers ,Fairy Fencer F,Benevolence ,"Much like a certain firebird’s plumage, celestial feathers can be used to revive the fallen. Comes with 8 Cherub’s Feathers, 4 Angel’s Feathers, and 2 Archangel’s Feathers. Fully restocks weekly. Merges with the Healing Kit if the prior item was purchased."
1324,,400,Space Nomad,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Benevolence ,"Out on the space ranges, you gotta rely on your body to survive. None of this new fangled planet terraforming technology helps when you’re out in the asteroid sticks. If a meteor is about to hit one of the cosmo sheep herds, you’ll just kick it away yourself. The country-born strength to kick over space elevators that Big Artorium tries to put on your land is a must, as is the talent to turn a bow and arrow into an actually useful weapon in spaceship-to-spaceship combat. Surviving in any sort of cosmic environment isn’t too hard for you, as you appear bizarrely immune to the various environmental dangers. Solar radiation, near absolute zero temperatures, stars exploding as you migrate past. You’ll either know a few folk tricks to ride the waves safely or you’ll just be tough enough to ignore it outright. These same tricks are what taught you to tame most space-native lifeforms too, be it docile cattle to harvest for star wool or the more dangerous space monsters that threaten ships and powerful Servants. A bit of tough love, some tender pats and a lot of disciplined training can help you turn any creature you find amongst the stars into a trusty companion."
1325,,400,May All The Beauty Be Blessed,Honkai Impact 3rd,Benevolence ,"So many of these stories end so tragically. Family killing each other, friends sacrificing themselves for nothing, and the fact that humanity can be its own greatest beast, it seems as though the fight is slowly petering out...

But you won’t accept that. Your will to push on surpasses even some legends, enough to last just that extra bit longer, even when you’re on death’s door, to do what you need to do, and this is especially true when you do it for those you truly love.

In fact, even if you aren’t pushing yourself so hard, as long as you hold your bonds close to your heart, everyone benefits. They grow better as a person, find new talents or heightened skills, maybe even manifest new powers, and all of it is to protect their friends. No... At this point, the bonds between you can only be described as family. The world may be ugly, but there is still beauty to be fought for in it."
1326,,400,Token Of Gratitude,Honkai Impact 3rd,Benevolence ,"As you progress, you will do things that are hard, or even borderline impossible. Likewise, there will be many times you will need various resources to help accomplish upcoming goals. These two are now intrinsically tied hand-in-hand.

As you do difficult tasks, you will be rewarded with all sorts of various materials to help you do better or fulfill needs and demands you have, depending on the difficulty and scale of what you have accomplished. This is true, regardless of if there is actually anyone to reward you then, and instead, they will simply appear in a location you control or own, if nobody can reward you then."
1327,,400,Perfect Timing,Honkai Impact 3rd,Benevolence ,"You’re never really early, but you’re never late, either. No matter the occasion, you will arrive at the perfect time. While this may seem expensive for the value of the perk, it will cover all your bases. You will arrive with extremely lucky timing, giving you the perfect chance to shift things in your favor, or just turn the tides.

Furthermore, this has a slight leeway factor involved, in that you’re able to make it with perfect timing to things that would normally be impossible to reach in the timeframe given. Heroes will hold out just a bit longer until you arrive as backup, your trains will arrive early and travel faster to accommodate your needs. While there are limits, you can bend what is ‘impossible’, and push the limits of arriving just in the nick of time."
1328,,400,Bone Wrist,Final Fantasy VI,Benevolence ,"These carved dragon bones still hold the deep seated magic of their original owner. Macabre as it might seem to wear bones, they imbue the wearer with strength and vitality like those of the ancient dragons. Only legends remain of this artifacts' abilities. Still, they claim that the people who wore it into battle were mistaken for humans with true dragon blood in their veins. They speak of individuals that can shrug off pain and could send men flying with a single wild swipe."
1329,,400,The Game Was Rigged,Final Fantasy VI,Benevolence ,"Lady Luck is such a fickle bitch. Some days she’ll give you a wink and a kiss on the cheek while others she’ll kick you in the knee onto some broken glass. However, there are those, like you, that she seems to favor above all others. Even your bad days seem to pan out. A dropped ice cream cone will lead you to find a lovely new watch under a bench. A continent could come crashing down onto your airship only to find, despite all odds and common sense, that you and your crew end up alive at the end of it. Just don’t depend on your luck that hard. It might cost you an airship."
1330,,400,Godly Strength,God Of War (2018),Benevolence ,"You have a well of energy within you that you can tap into outside of combat to vastly increase one of your physical attributes to truly legendary heights even among the gods. If used to increase your strength you could stop yourself from being crushed between the fingers of a god the size of a mountain or flip a giant temple to reveal its secret underside. You could also channel this energy to your vitality to kickstart and increase your regeneration, channel it to your agility to let you cross great distances at blinding speeds, etc. At the moment this is too strenuous to use in combat outside of times of great stress and rage, but with a few hundred years of training you would be able to access this well of energy at any time. If bought with a warrior’s fury, this energy can be more easily accessible while in your rage but be wary of the drawbacks still remaining."
1331,,400,The Curse of Immortality(Imperfect) ,God Of War (2018),Benevolence ,"How did this happen? You are like Baldur now, you cannot be killed or permanently damaged by anything in the world, physically or magically. Unfortunately, you now have the same curse that plagues Baldur, being unable to feel any physical sensation at all. Pick a mundane material like mistletoe, if you are damaged by your chosen material the spell will be broken and your ability to feel returns. The magic of this spell returns in your next jump or after a decade, whichever comes first."
1332,,400,Born Of Uttarakuru,Thailand Mythology and Folklore,Benevolence ,"The people of the northern continent are truly blessed. It is the nicest continent in the mortal world, and second only the Heavens above Mount Meru. And now, it seems that your ancestry hails from this continent, granting you a host of benefits, all of which are fully inheritable, and don’t dilute with the generations. The most obvious benefit is that you will never degrade out of your physical prime. From the day you grow into your body’s full potential until the day you die, you’ll be at top form. This doesn’t stop skills and muscle memory from decaying of course, but aging will not sap your strength from your bones.

Additionally, you are very resistant to temperature, to the point you’re functionally immune to most natural hazards such as freezing blizzards or magma fumes, although doing things such as diving into arctic water or lava can still hurt you, if to a far lesser extent than it would hurt those of less fortunate birth. You’re also immune to any natural disease or poison, and vermin seem to instinctively avoid bothering you, leaving you free of pests.

Some other less conventional gifts are that you can tell if someone you see is related to you by blood, although you cannot tell the nature of this connection with this sense alone. And, if you or any of your descendants are women, any pregnancies and births will be free of any complications such things tend to bring, being painless and clean. Perhaps you were even born in the northern continent and simply ended up on the opposite side of the world somehow?"
1333,,400,Jumping Over The Sanzu River,Thailand Mythology and Folklore,Benevolence ,"Reincarnation is a strange thing. Memories and bodies are locked away, emotions and promises remain only in an abstract and spiritual sense, and your soul is given a chance to grow again. Understandably, not everyone is very enthused about the ‘memories are locked away’ bit, and some great sorcerers have attempted to skip the part of reincarnation which deals with memories, the crossing of the Sanzu River in the Underworld. Some even succeed. Like these people, once per jump you will be allowed one second chance, one extra life, a 1-up if you will. You’ll be born again as normal, of course, sometime between instantly or a few days after your death, and you will retain all of your memories and knowledge, although not any powers or skills that relied on your body or any kind of spiritual modification. This does not end your chain, in case that needs be said.

Of course, you can choose a normal birth, or to be born from ‘moisture’, or to simply spring up fully formed, as explained in the Origins section. Really, the choice is mostly made on the grounds of convenience. If you have time and wish for another start, you could be born normally, but if you have urgent business and don’t wish to abandon your life, being spontaneously formed would be a better choice. Of course, the demons running the Hells won’t like your shenanigans, and you shouldn’t expect this to work a second time per jump or millennia, whichever comes first."
1334,,400,Revived Every Sunrise,Thailand Mythology and Folklore,Benevolence ,"It is your birthright to rule men, and the world recognizes you. Perhaps not in the way you would expect, however. One might not expect rejuvenation of all things to be so regular. Every sunrise, as long as you aren’t actually dead, you will be restored to full health and any deleterious effects that don’t already supernaturally linger are brushed off of your being. Perhaps some dew drops kiss your body, or a cursed wind fills you with malicious energy, or maybe some other imagery you wish for. Wounds are healed, limbs are restored, and things like drunkenness are wiped away. This will doubtless be helpful when dealing with enemies who are not thorough, and maybe you could utilize it to reinforce your legitimacy if you’re charismatic enough. Go forth, Prince (or Princess), and show the world your majesty"
1335,,400,Phoenix Tears        ,DxD Universe,Benevolence ,"Three of the famous Phoenix Tears, they can heal pretty much anything as long as it hasn't been completely destroyed, it also cannot heal diseases, they replenish each month."
1336,,400,Holy Sword User,DxD Universe,Benevolence ,"And also user of a lot of things, because your body just seems compatible with everything, only 1% of the world can use a certain power? Then you are guaranteed to be able to do it too."
1337,,400,The Only Survivor,DxD Universe,Benevolence ,"Congratulations you now have plot armor, this plot armor only works in making you survive however, and it may put in really fucked situations to survive, a example being that they poisoned your entire family excluding you and now you have to hide in their pile of bodies to survive, this plot armor also isn't invincible if someone really wants to kill you they have a chance at breaking through the plot armor."
1338,,400,I Was Just Passing By,DxD Universe,Benevolence ,"You have some pretty good luck in having powerful people save you, these people also tend to take you in and treat you like family, these guys tend to be powerful and influential, but not truly at the top of the setting, a good example would be Azazel, he is strong and has a faction, but he is no Great Red. This perk works best the younger you are, if you are a kid it is basically impossible to kill you without somebody coming to the rescue, but if you're an adult this becomes a rarity that should not be relied upon."
1339,,400,Inheritance Insurance,Fate/Apocrypha V1.4,Benevolence ,"Most people want what’s best for people they care about. Even Mages, in some cases, particularly when it comes to family. It would be utterly heart- breaking if it turned out that something passed down to a child ended up being lethal to them. Now, that’s not a problem for you. When being freely given something, or when freely giving something to someone else – be it knowledge, abilities, an artefact, whatever – it is now guaranteed to never harm or hinder the recipient. People won’t cut themselves on a sharp knife, magical records won’t turn out to be cursed, and even inherited abilities won’t have some crippling or lethal drawback in future offspring. Even better, it continues to be safe to share or pass along as long as you wish. You can remove this protection if you want, even selectively if you want specific people to be protected or harmed by whatever gift or inheritance you provide, but you’ll never have to fear about hurting people you care about by accident when you’re trying to help them like this."
1340,,400,Lady of Eternity,Witch on the Holy Night,Benevolence ,"To hold this moment in your grasp, forever. To maintain one’s life as a magus absolutely. That is your gift. Great changes have a tendency to ignore you, your life or your magical works. As long as you do not provoke them, those boarding with you will respect your solitude and try to approach you on your own terms if at all. Living away from civilisation, fate favours your comfort and if not success then freedom from outside interference. More usefully, the Mystery of magecraft spells cast by you or other inherent properties subject to degradation over time no longer diminishes, nor that of your body, soul and mind. This protection is not absolute from supernatural malice, waived if you go out of your way to make yourself known to the outside world at large and lost if you yourself are moved to form a bond with another-benign or otherwise. But with a modicum of effort to keeping your routine separate from the world at large, you can survive on your own very well."
1341,,400,The Fearlessness to Keep on Living,Library of Ruina,Benevolence ,"The Library has a curious relationship with mortality. Those who fight within it never truly die, even the guests being perfectly recorded as books, and able to be recreated if Angela were so inclined. Unfortunately, the actual process of extracting and bringing forth the light relies upon emotions running high, so the participants on both sides of its battles don’t recall or aren’t informed that they won’t die. From now on, you’ll bring the Library’s protection with you into each jump, once per jump, you’ll come back from death completely whole and unharmed, but you’ll not know of this protection, the memories around it being fogged up so you think you just had a close scrape with mortality. You may recall it when you’re not in danger, but the instant your life may be on the line, all memory of this perk’s protections will vanish once more. "
1342,,400,To Overcome Crisis,Library of Ruina,Benevolence ,"Overtime sucks. And yet, the City never sleeps. Sometimes your office gets five assassination contracts in the span of a single day, all of which they give to you because upper management is made of idiots. Once you get home, you find that the followers of all five of your victims have banded together to get revenge, just as you were settling in to treat your wounds. Fortunately, you’ve found you have a knack for these sorts of situations, the exhaustion and lack of energy pushing you to new heights, making your sword strike more quickly and with greater force instead of dulling your blade. Admittedly, you’re still tired, and should probably stop to rest eventually, as all that exercise will leave you feeling it in the morning, but in the meantime all the accumulated injuries and exhaustion that should drag you down push you to new heights. Your exhaustion simply means you stop thinking about unnecessary thoughts and hesitating in the battle at hand. Not a single motion wasted, for you lack the energy for it, not a single heartbeat more than is necessary, for you might bleed out otherwise."
1343,,400,Excalibur's Scabbard ,HighSchool DxD,Benevolence ,"The legendary holy sheath and main component of the true Excalibur. It provides the user with increased durability to the point of being semi-invulnerable, as well as granting the user enhanced healing and regeneration abilities to the point of being considered immortality. If wielded by a devil it would grant him enough capacity to take on blows from gods of light without flinching, and such other feats. A formidable weapon waiting for the right wielder."
1344,,400,Midiclorians And Such,HighSchool DxD,Benevolence ,"It’s an open secret that there are only so many items that can properly heal some creatures, it may have to do with most healing reagents being holy and all that. I’ll give you these boxes filled with vials of phoenix tears and other reagents that serve to heal, or otherwise buff the drinker. You will get more boxes each month or whenever you run out of it, whatever happens first. Doesn’t look like much, but you would be surprised."
1345,,400,Enlightened User,HighSchool DxD,Benevolence ,"It’s all about compatibility with your weapon. Just look at the scarce capable wielders of holy or demonic swords, so few the church decided it was a good idea to try and use human experimentation and genetics to get a few. Sacred Gears are pretty much the same, with how much power they show being determined to their user’s talents. Then… there’s you. When it comes to wielding supernatural artifacts, you are a freak of nature, or a natural born miracle, depending on how you wanna see it. No matter what it is, you can wield it perfectly, pushing it to the very limits of its capacity and then going even further beyond. You can use anything, even ignoring restrictions that it may have, or use the kind of weapons that would usually damage the user without drawback. Taking a holy or demonic sword would let you match the exploits of it’s best previous wielders and then surpass them all. And if you have a Sacred Gear you would get its Balance Breaker in record time, while finding new applications of its power every other day."
1346,,400,Restart Escatora,HighSchool DxD,Benevolence ,"Eugenics, baby. Blood ties are important for a reason and now you have them on your side. Or, better said, on the side of your bloodline. Your genes have reached a threshold of perfection, and as such, you have become freed from the inherent weaknesses of your race. Devils that aren’t hurt by the Holy anymore than to any other element, daywalking vampires, elven men that are actually manly, and so on. This effect will be passed down your bloodline if you want to. Because of that, everyone who is into having strong descendants, wants to increase the power of their house, or just knows about eugenics (which are a thing in the supernatural world) will be pinning to have you as a spouse or stud for their family. Having a harem would be an easy, if highly political, task."
1347,,400,Appointment With Death ,HighSchool DxD,Benevolence ,"That basics of your way of fighting is attack before they attack you, hit faster and harder than anyone else, never receive a blow you can evade. A simple principle that became something more as you fought stronger and stronger enemies. Like an oily snake, you have learned to apply your slippery beyond the normal means, thus, you now can’t be taken by surprise. Your instincts have been perfected and there’s no being, no matter how stealthy or inconspicuous that can ever go past your guard, as your body reacts before they have even made their move. Furthermore, you can’t be affected by curses or poisons either, as they’re unable to take proper hold of you."
1348,,400,Patchwork Being ,The Voynich Hotel,Benevolence ,"Good news, bad news time. Bad news, you were almost killed recently. Quite bloodily too. Ripped limb from limb. Good news, you’re still alive. Sort of. Using a lot of thread, several magic needles, and scraps of witchery, you were stitched back together. Your body is now covered in scars that would not look out of place on Frankenstein’s Monster. On the plus side, your flesh absorbed some of the magic used to partially resurrect you. This has given you strength and toughness quite a bit past superhuman. You could shatter a truck sized boulder with all your strength behind a kick. Shrugging off the blows of a demon, or getting hit by a speeding car, aren’t outside the realm of possibility at all. Just be careful when you shake someone’s hand, yeah?"
1349,,400,Magic Resistance A,Fate/Csjete Halloween Trilogy,Benevolence ,"Functional immunity to magic, only a powerful Servant (or equivalent) can hurt you with magic."
1350,,400,Golden Fleece,God of War,Benevolence ,"The great treasure obtained by Jason and his Argonauts, the golden fleece has taken the form of armor, though only covering a single arm. Still, it is completely indestructible, and can be used to deflect approaching weapons and projectiles, sending them back towards those who deliver them. It is a potent defensive artifact, to be sure."
1351,,400,Chalice of Hera,God of War,Benevolence ,"The favored cup of the queen of the gods, it is an ornate silver chalice with a flawless emerald embedded within, with scenes depicting the glories of rulership and family. Within is a never ending amount of nectar, the drink of the gods. Just one sip can cure a man of all diseases and illnesses, as well as healing all wounds he may have."
1352,,400,Hide of the Nemean,God of War,Benevolence ,"So powerful and mighty was the Nemean Lion that all the works of man were incapable of penetrating its skin, incapable of even leaving a scratch. Much like that beast, your skin is practically invulnerable, unable to be damaged in any way. Blades and arrows cannot harm you, and magic will more often than not wash over you."
1353,,400,Blessing of Asclepius,God of War,Benevolence ,"Though the spirit desires to move forth, the body may not always be willing. For when wounds bleed and illness ravages, one must turn to the vaunted physician for remedies. You have been trained in such arts, a master of your craft. Not only can you mend flesh and broken bones with ease, but you can immediately tell if someone is ill or wounded with just a glance, as well as what ails them so."
1354,,400,Light of Determination ,Final Fantasy III,Benevolence ,"You are infused with the determination of a true hero. It will take monumental efforts to stop you, as you fight through any pain or damage short of being fully destroyed. Mental and social manipulations slide right off of you, and you will never grow bored or restless when working towards a goal."
1355,,400,Sidekick o' the gods.,Xena - Hercules,Benevolence ,"Where you go, your friends/comrades/flunkies go. Should you gain entrance to a place that is mystically barred to most, your friends can slip through the door alongside you. When traveling through dangerous terrain, your followers share a measure of your stamina and any resistances you may posses towards the natural hazards of the surrounding environment. This effect does not protect against any kind of deliberate attack or change them physically, but if you can make the journey, then your flunkies should be able to at least survive the trip as well."
1356,,400,Dead Count Shapeshifter,Fate/Apocrypha,Benevolence ,"Those who have just been born tend to be full of potential. A blank slate yet to experience the world, being so pure and innocent makes them quite receptive to gifts of power. Whether or not you’ve been recently born as well, you possess this trait as well. You are quite receptive to being given power, such as the heart or Noble Phantasm of a Servant. With a powerful source of energy, such as a Command Seal, you might even be able to transform into a Servant whose gifts you've received. Even without it though, you’ll be able to use them without any issues of rejection or overwhelming your body, although do keep in mind that having the magical energy to fuel such things is another problem entirely. As a bonus, you don’t lose parts of your lifespan from this, unlike a certain homunculus."
1357,,400,Athena’s Favor,Hades,Benevolence ,"The Goddess of Wisdom expects a certain amount of prudent judgement on how often those who choose to call upon her do so. Yet her response in the right situation will always be swift and absolute. For a time, any attacks made against you will not only have no effect, but they will turn against the soldiers who dare attempt to harm you. It matters not how strong, how many, or how varied the attacks that seek your life during that moment.

The strikes Athena’s divinity protects you from are now doubled in potency when they return to those who let them loose."
1358,,400,Touch of the Lethe,Hades,Benevolence ,"The River of Forgetfulness flows through the verdant fields of violent Elysium. It’s waters offer the warriors the opportunity to forget about painful memories to more easily appreciate the afterlife they have earned. You have dipped your toes into the waters and come away with a trace of its properties flowing through your veins. Drawing on Lethe's power will allow you to dull pains, old and new, of both your body and your soul. Forgetting about the wounds won't make them go away or magically heal them, but it will allow you to push through difficult moments and deal with the injuries when you have time to do so."
1359,,400,I Reject Your Humanity,Fate/Strange Fake,Benevolence ,"The tools of mankind. Much like the mythical Phantasmal Beasts of the Age of Gods and other creatures such as the venerable Dead Apostle Ancestors, yours is an existence that actively resists and rejects the advancement of humanity. In practical terms, this means that those attacks coming from knowledge of humanity and their tools, be it modern weaponry, magecraft or even Noble Phantasms, become useless before you. They won't even make you flinch or move, regardless of what force is used on you.

However, this is only limited to the tools of humanity, so humans attacking you with their bodies would work, and a weapon crafted by a non-human, or using non-human elements such as the claws of a great Phantasmal Beast would still be effective on you."
1360,,400,Ascension,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Benevolence ,"Forsaken by the god that created them and their halos broken, the former angels were little more than other mortals. There was one part of them that most had forgotten; they were originally beings of worship. As a few of their number upheld their oaths, those they protected began to believe in them. This belief eventually would catalyze in the angels their own divinity, ultimately manifesting as a halo made of their own power.

These halos were fickle, only manifesting for short periods of time, but manifesting longer the greater the faith in them was. It would grant the angels enhanced abilities related to the angel themselves, sometimes great strength, sometimes incredible speed, or a number of other things.

Whether this is something you have begun to develop because you were an angel once yourself, or if the power of worship simply isn't limited to them; you possess the ability to manifest a halo of your own."
1361,,400,Diamond Armlet,Final Fantasy I,Benevolence ,"Alright, let’s be serious for a minute. Mages are incredibly fragile and are usually the first person anyone with a brain is going to target in a fight. This goes double for a Black Mage or anyone dishing out offensive magic of any kind in battle. Wearing this armlet helps mitigate that problem, creating a field that greatly reduces the physical damage the user takes. It doesn’t work so well against magic, but...well, that’s what you’re for, isn’t it? At least it’s incredibly light and doesn’t add much weight to you."
1362,,400,Dragon’s Mail,Final Fantasy I,Benevolence ,"A heavy set of armor that bears the scales of a once-legendary dragon, now slain and forged into this enchanted equipment. It fits your form perfectly regardless of your size once donned, and cannot be removed from your body until it or you is destroyed or if you seek to take it off. As a bonus, it gives you considerable resistance to both physical damage and elemental (fire, thunder, ice, etc.) damage from magic. A fatal blow will be more of a frustrating scratch. Just mind the gaps in said armor."
1363,,400,Have Faith In Me,Final Fantasy I,Benevolence ,"White Magic is simply the art of restoring what was into what it used to be, closing wounds and removing ailments from a physical body. But what if you could have a more lasting effect than simply fixing things? When you cast beneficial support or healing magic on anyone besides yourself or things that are a direct extension of yourself, they will enjoy a resistance to disease or other ‘status ailments’ that would impair their physical or magical abilities, and their health will be considerably more robust. This effect fades over the course of a day."
1364,,400,Child of the Sea ,The Little Mermaid,Benevolence ,"You must have been important to Poseidon (or some other Sea God) in a past life because now the ocean itself loves you. It shows this love by granting you some special gifts. First being that you can survive underwater without being a merperson/sea creature. You can breathe as easily as if you were on land, can see even if the light shouldn’t reach you, and your body resists the crushing pressure no matter how deep you go. After all why would the water hurt you? Second is that you may protect items of yours that would otherwise be ruined by being submerged. Paint won’t run, paper won’t dissolve, and electronics will continue to function (for as long as their battery/power source remains...). So long as it’s yours the ocean will keep it safe for you."
1365,,400,Soldjar of Fortune,Elden Ring - Liurnia of the Lakes,Benevolence ,"Some folks are born silver spoon in hand, but that isn’t you. In fact, such soft living doesn’t fit someone like you at all, who all but thrives in danger and hardship. When faced with danger, you find yourself fighting harder, moving swifter and striking with more force. The more peril you are in, the more of your potential you can draw upon. Death is very much a possibility, but where in this world is wholly untouched by it?"
1366,,400,The Undefeatable,Fate/Legends - Baba Yaga,Benevolence ,"Is it the sheer perseverance of man or the subtle blessing of the Lord? Few had a death as drawn out as Rasputin but not out of spite but out of necessity. 4 or 5 lethal bullets, poison laced meals, being dumped into freezing water, that is what it took to silence the man. You too share his sheer persistence. Most if not all poisons barely inconvenience you thanks to your newfound immunity, and even if hurt in most vital areas you simply keep going. Even if you should have died from a wound, you will still cling to life, requiring extraneous time suffering the injury or truly over the top punishment than you should be able to endure to truly silence you."
1367,,400,Special Flag        ,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Benevolence ,"A yellow flag, with a red letter ‘S’ that floats nearby. Both appear somewhat blocky, like they were low-res. 

A person may use this flag by holding it deliberately above their head for a period of 3 seconds, whilst intending to use the item. The item then disappears, imbuing the user with an extra ‘stock’. A stock is used as a 1-up to revive the stock holder in the event of their death. Being revived in this manner will prevent the usual chain-failure that occurs due to death from happening. A stock may also be burned by the stock holder to teleport them back to a fight they have been sent flying away from.

Every new jump, a new Special Flag will appear in your Warehouse. Post-chain, a new Special Flag will instead appear in your Warehouse every ten years."
1368,,400,Goblin Armor,Wizarding World,Benevolence ,"Whatever wizards and witches may believe about goblins, fools dare to underestimate them at their own peril. Look no further than their craftsmanship, a skill so heavily guarded by goblins and vaunted by witches and wizards across the world. Clad yourself in this armor and witness for yourself just how mighty a goblin can be.

Forged from goblin silver, this magnificent set of armor has been enhanced with magic beyond what goblins are ordinarily capable of. You see, by channeling your own magic through the armor like you would with a wand, the silver shall glow a malevolent red as the corrupted ancient magic within come to life. Not only will you have a hefty resistance against most spells, almost equal to what a proper Shield Charm can provide, but so long as you continue to channel your magic through the armor, you will have a vast array of newfound abilities to use against your foes."
1369,,400,Shield of Love,Wizarding World,Benevolence ,"Hidden deep within the British Ministry of Magic, there lies a section of it locked away, restricted to the world beyond. It is here where the mysteries of the world are studied. It is here where scholars and Unspeakables seek to uncover the secrets of death, of time, of space, of thought, and of love. Even amongst its fellow mysteries, love is a powerful and secretive force, a kind of magic unlike any other. And it is magic like this that has weaved its way into your very soul, your very being.

For one thing, the Dark Arts and other similar magics are now considerably less effective against you. They falter and weaken when used against you and if they do leave behind any wounds, such wounds will nonetheless be easily healed and far less severe than they would otherwise be. Even something as dreaded as the Killing Curse shall be feared no longer.

Fittingly, your own magic has risen to new heights, especially when used against the Dark Arts. Your spells have become half again as powerful and when channeled against anything of a dark nature, is a magnitude greater, allowing you to dispel and counteract at a level beyond the likes of ordinary witches and wizards. Love is truly grand. Let no one say otherwise."
1370,,400,The Hero of the Story,Wizarding World,Benevolence ,"Ah luck. That ever so ethereal quality of man. Depending on who you ask, luck may not even actually exist. But in this world of magic, luck is very much a real thing. Just ask anyone fortunate enough to have imbibed the wonderful potion that is Felix Felicis. And yet, like all things, Felix Felicis is not perfect, and neither is it the most reliable if you seek consistency in your good luck.

While this alone will not provide you with that fortune, it will provide you with something that is perhaps even better. By choosing this, you shall live in interesting times and in doing so, you shall be rewarded. If you would but take the first steps, you will live life as if you were the hero of the story. You will find teachers willing to teach you all they know, secrets hidden away for decades if not centuries, and far more that could be in your grasp if you just... reach out.

But do be careful. To live in interesting times is to live in dangerous times. And yet it can be said that people like you grow best in such situations."
1371,,400,Golden Beast Crest Shield ,Elden Ring - Limgrave,Benevolence ,"Shield of dull gold with a beast engraved as its crest. Lighter than most greatshields, and subsequently easier to wield. The beast depicted is Serosh, aged counselor who guides the golden lineage. It is capable of protecting the user from the arcane just as effectively as a steel blade, washing over the shield as though it were water."
1372,,400,Diamonds By The Score ,Disney’s Snow White,Benevolence ,"Everyone hates group projects, but none more than the kid who did all the work only for the other members of their team to swoop in and claim the credit for themselves. And if you lose out on a grade or a reward because of it? Maddening. You can kiss those days goodbye because now your hard work is protected from those vultures. No one can take the things you’ve rightly earned, physical or otherwise. You get the credit you deserve, and will always reap the rewards you were promised."
1373,,400,Brit,Invincible,Benevolence ,"You have become physically invulnerable: nothing of this universe can damage you physically any longer. You can tank the punches of a Regent Viltrumite, walk through lava, and even geniuses on the level of Robot Rex are unable to figure out a way to harm you. Thanks to this invulnerability your body has also been increased and improved. You always maintain your ideal body shape as long as the minimum amount of caloric intake is maintained and you never gain unwanted weight. You have increased agility slightly beyond peak human with the flexibility of a professional gymnast. Your senses have been augmented, allowing you to see like a hawk, smell like a dog, and hear like a bat, with no risk of damage from overloading them. Finally your strength has been increased allowing you to access 100% of the power of your muscles at all times. This allows you to access the full potential power of the human body without your muscles tearing your tendons off of the bones. With this you could pick up, or with effort throw, a sedan. You may optionally choose to have this power give you snow white hair."
1374,,400,Weaknesses? I have no weaknesses,Invincible,Benevolence ,"Something interesting happened when your powers activated for the first time, the weaknesses that normally plague those like you seem eerily absent. You now find that the specific weakness that your powers suffered from are conspicuously gone. The limitations of your powers are all present and accounted for, but the things that could bypass them entirely no longer can. A Viltrumite would find that sounds that would normally cause pain, and potentially death among their kin do not affect them at all. A werewolf would find that silver no longer hurts them, though they may still be reliant on the Moon depending on the specifics of their curse. Someone with a weakness to a specific type of radiation, or even wood, would find that they no longer have anything to fear from those things. Have fun turning the tables on those who thought they had you boxed into a corner."
1375,,400,Master Healer,Wizard 101,Benevolence ,"The boundless energy of Life powers into you and through you. Your healing spells bear an uncommon potency, easily triple that of lesser Theurges. Additionally, you have a mastery of the doctoral arts to match your magical mastery. This knowledge combined with your sheer power has given you a respectable passive regeneration factor, effectively cutting all recovery times to one-fifth the standard and allowing for the regrowth of lost limbs."
1376,,400,Tower Shield,Wizard 101,Benevolence ,"Thaumaturgy is the magic of frost and stillness. It excels above all other schools in the field of magical defense, for winter lies at the end of everything, and great power must be expended if one is to overcome its grasp. Cloaked in winter mist, you carry around some of that magic-arresting property wheresoever you go. While never as good as a dedicated defense, you may be confident of stripping any spell directed your way of at least a quarter of its potency."
1377,,400,Shield of Virtue,Disney’s Sleeping Beauty,Benevolence ,"A replica of the shield that will one day be wielded by Prince Philip against Maleficent...or is his shield the replica, since you have yours first? Either way, this shield was created from all that is good, and it is a potent defense indeed. Rocks, arrows, all of these projectiles are easily blocked by the shield. But even more impressive is that this shield can even block the flames of Maleficent’s dragon form, which can incinerate rock and hammer with a force that even with the shield would send you flying. True, it can be knocked out of your hand if you are not careful, but you’ll find no better defense here."
1378,,400,True Love’s Kiss,Disney’s Sleeping Beauty,Benevolence ,"Don’t forget, Jumper, above all else this is a fairy tale, and one that came from the house of Walt Disney, nonetheless. Evil will always be defeated by good, for true love conquers all. Should you love someone, truly love someone, your kiss will have the power to break any curse placed upon them. It need not be romantic love, platonic and familial love will also work, but it has to be true love. Once per jump, you may even save someone from a curse that should have meant their death, bringing them back from the abyss. If a curse has been placed on multiple people, and the one you love is just one of the victims, your kiss will only break their curse, not the curse placed on the others."
1379,,400,Armor of the Deceased ,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Benevolence ,"A set of armor, crafted from the ribs of giants and fused into one piece, imbuing the wearer with their might. While adorned in this armor, not only will you find all incoming physical damage reduced, but your physical strength will nearly triple, allowing you to strike with much more force than before. Undead and spirits of all kinds will also be more passive and agreeable towards you."
1380,,400,Fires of Vitality,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Benevolence ,"The heat of Fire fills others with its warmth, resonating with the warmth found within life itself. The fire within you has stirred, leading to a great benefit regarding your vitality, or rather how quickly it replenishes. You can quickly heal from any non-fatal wound at an astonishing pace, something that is only further enhanced the more you surround yourself with fire and heat. In the right circumstances, it wouldn't be completely inaccurate to refer to yourself as unkillable."
1381,,400,Primordial Crystal,Dark Souls: Covenants,Benevolence ,"A treasure of the Everlasting Dragons, taken by Seath the Scaleless after he had betrayed them. When you bind yourself to it, an arcane link will form between you and the crystal, granting you the next best thing to true immortality. Not only will you cease aging, but you will be given a powerful form of regeneration, allowing you to heal wounds before the offending weapon has even left your flesh. These effects will last so long as you are bound to the crystal, at least until it’s broken."
1382,,400,Protecting Divinity,Dark Souls: Covenants,Benevolence ,"You have a most holy task, the protection of the first daughter of the Great Lord Gwyn, and by the Flame nothing shall stop you. When it comes to protecting someone, there are few who could match you, ensuring that no matter what odds you face, your charge will not be so much as scratched so long as you stand. You can also be summoned in phantom form to their side whenever they are in danger."
1383,,400,Covenant Leader,Dark Souls: Covenants,Benevolence ,"You are no mere conscript, another undead looking for meaning in this bleak world, but a true leader of your covenant. You can offer others an invitation to join your covenant, granting them weaker versions of the perks found here as they advance in rank. You may also summon them to your side for a time, be it for aid in combat or more peaceful tasks before they return to their world. As an added bonus, this will act as a Capstone Booster, empowering specific perks to newfound heights."
1384,,400,Charge!,Walt Disney’s Robin Hood,Benevolence ,"You are not just any royal soldier. You are one of the big boys, with enough strength to charge straight through stone walls without flinching. Furthermore, whenever you take action alongside companions in your immediate vicinity, each member’s physical strength is boosted."
1385,,400,Facelift        ,Hellsing Ultimate Abridged,Benevolence ,"If you wanted one of these, you could’ve just asked. A product of Nazi science, this advanced treatment uses vampire DNA to regenerate one’s youth. Normally this would be a purely cosmetic boon, granting the recipient a dashing appearance for the whole of their natural life. However the creative (or desparate) can draw on this youth, reclaiming their lost vigor and amplifying their physical abilities tenfold. This enhancement doesn’t last long; ten minutes at most, or shorter if you amplify your abilities even further. At least this version won’t consume your life force when expended. If used in this way, you will receive the materials for another such treatment after one month. Feel young again, Jumper."
1386,,400,Birds of a Feather,Hellsing Ultimate Abridged,Benevolence ,"You have NO right being here. This shit is crazy. You’re a third-rate merc thrown into an unholy blend of Bram Stoker and Castle Wolfenstein. And yet, somehow, you make it work. You and your allies are great at punching above your weight. Whenever your foes hold a significant power advantage over you, you and your comrades receive a boost to your teamwork and skill level. You fight more effectively, shaky nerves become steady, and even Lady Luck seems to give you an edge. This doesn’t guarantee victory, you’re still the plucky, loveable underdogs, but enemies underestimate you at their own peril. Punish them for walking into your traps, Jumper."
1387,,400,Conjure Scripture,Hellsing Ultimate Abridged,Benevolence ,"I see you’re going for a “House of the Dead meets Boondock Saints” vibe here. You can summon a suitably dramatic flurry of glowing bible pages, creating barriers of holy energy or binding seals effective against the demons of the night. Though flashy, few can argue with the effectiveness of countering monsters with their natural weakness. With enough practice, you should also be able to pull off Anderson’s stylish entrances and exits, teleporting a short distance and appearing in a maelstrom of glowing scripture. Don’t just be effective, be extra, Jumper."
1388,,400,Love Finds A Way ,Wizards of Waverly Place,Benevolence ,"For a Wizard to marry a mortal they are required to give up their power. At least that is the case for everyone else, you, however are the exception. Once per jump, when making a decision/sacrifice that requires you to relinquish your powers, you can instead keep them and go ahead with whatever you were about to do. Go ahead and marry that mortal if you want."
1389,,400,True Innocence,Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,Benevolence ,"Perrito is a truly pure soul feeling no grief despite all that he has suffered. It is revealed that his family attempted to get rid of him multiple times and even attempted to murder him by drowning him in a lake. Even after everything all he wants in life is some friends who care about him. You share this spark and have been granted the kindness of the world. Even the most cold hearted beings will treat you favorably and your path will be one of leisure. Much like how Perrito’s path was one of simplicity, the challenges you face will be of a lower difficulty. For example, all of the other challenges posed by the Wishing Star were incredibly dangerous, but Perrito’s was simple as long as your heart was peaceful. The world will provide plenty of opportunities for you to grow personally and to build up your forces if you wish to claim them."
1390,,400,Heart of Te Fiti        ,Moana,Benevolence ,"Once the jump ends, you will gain your own version of the Heart of Te Fiti. It is a powerful magical item and cannot be destroyed or copied. While worn, it gives health and vigor to anyone in proximity to it. It can sustain life long past the time it should have passed and makes plants grow stronger and lusher. While it is part of you, you will cure all corruption and bring forth lushness and verdant plant growth wherever you go. If you give it away (and you can do so once per jump) it will confer extreme longevity and a small fraction of all your powers to whoever you give it to. Only your chosen one and their descendants will be able to use it. Any life magic focused through the Heart will be greatly increased in power and reach. If you give it away, you get it back at the beginning of each new jump."
1391,,400,Demonic Durability,Disney’s Hercules,Benevolence ,"It’s not exactly the safest work, hanging around with gods and heroes while not being one yourself. So good thing you have this! You’re pretty ridiculously durable now. Get stabbed, burnt, cut up or whatever else, you just won’t die unless someone can do it to you in a way that matters. That is, with powerful, and I mean really powerful magic or other supernatural equivalents.

In addition, you also don’t feel the pain such things would normally come with. Well, you feel enough that you know something is going on, that is, but never enough to meaningfully affect you unless deliberately let it."
1392,,400,Anti-Magic Shield (nano coating) ,Marvel Britain,Benevolence ,"An enchanted and nigh-indestructible shield that has been covered in an anti-magic nano coating. This shield will block and nullify any magic that hits its face. Very useful when sorcerers are shooting death beams at you, but not as useful if someone sets the ground underneath you aflame with hellfire."
1393,,400,Golden Apple Tree,Marvel Magic,Benevolence ,"​It is a curious that so many of the myths and legends of the world contain within them tales of divine trees that bloom with magical fruits. Perhaps they are an echo of some primordial tree such as Yggdrasil or even of the Elder Goddess Gaia. Whatever the case, you have gained possession of one such tree which grows within a small forest connected to your warehouse. Upon this eternal tree blooms beautiful golden apples. These apples are among the most delicious food in existence and a single apple will fill the belly of any who eats it for a week to come. But the true wonder of the these apples is that they serve as a panacea, curing nearly all ills when eaten, Even old age can be warded against -- so long as a being eats an apple once a century, their aging will slow to a crawl that even the gods would fail to notice the wear of years upon them."
1394,,400,Beyond Death,Marvel Magic,Benevolence ,"Your wiles and your schemes have gotten you in and out of any number of situations in your life. But perhaps the most impressive accomplishment you have managed so far, is to erase your name from the Book of the Dead. This will allow you to return from death instead of meeting your fatal end. Of course, Death is savvy and will notice this aberration, so this will only work once per jump. Still, it is a note of pride that you have managed to outwit even Death itself."
1395,,400,I Have No Soul to Burn,Ghost Rider,Benevolence ,"Demons are soulless beings; however, in your case that might be problematic. So, instead your soul will, essentially, become a non-entity- it can’t be attacked, stolen, burned, destroyed, possessed, trapped, detected etc. unless you sell or otherwise remove it from your body, including putting/turning it into a physical object, or if for some reason you want others to interact with it. It’s important to note that these protections only apply to your soul since you, as a demon, are able to absorb souls (not directly; they need to be given willingly) to increase your own power. If you’ve already absorbed souls over the course of your adventures, they will be included in this protection. If you absorb souls afterwards, then they will not be protected until you’ve completed the Jump you absorbed them in. 

In someone attacks your unprotected souls, either to damage, destroy, remove, or otherwise harm them, then you may also be damaged by proxy; your protected souls(s) will still be fine. If you die from whatever they did, then your protected soul is fine; however your chain will end, or you’ll otherwise pass on. If you don’t die, than your protected soul is still fine; your other souls may not be."
1396,,400,We Just Crossed The Threshold,Loki,Benevolence ,"When you arrived, was there a flicker of scarlet light? The sound of distant thunder? Maybe not, but anyone claiming to know how everything is going to go when you’re around will be fibbing from now on. Any sort of prediction, foresight, fate manipulation or other ways to accurately predict or manipulate your future don’t work on you anymore. Destiny or fixed events don’t really apply to you anymore, and no point in your time is fixed or unchangeable unless it would benefit you. This peculiar nature of yours, being somewhat outside of the established rules of this Multiverse, has the potential to enhance some of the abilities you could acquire, acting as a Capstone Booster for the 600CP Perks here."
1397,,400,Lesser Brand,Marvel Primal,Benevolence ,You may give people a lesser version of the Starbrand with 5% the powers of the original.
1398,,400,Fist of Iron,Marvel Primal,Benevolence ,"In a moment of desperation or brilliance you buried your hands in the beating heart of a dragon. From that moment on, you found you could gather your chi into either hand to make an invulnerable fist of iron. Your hand when so charged cannot be harmed, you punch like a cannon and can learn to heal or channel any other energy you might wield this way. Perhaps most usefully, your iron fist serves as a kind of universal weakness, laying low otherwise invulnerable foes."
1399,,400,M-Day,X-23,Benevolence ,"You were one of the ones who did not lose their powers or worse their lives on M-Day. Going forward conceptual attacks fail to kill you, rewriting reality or time to get rid of you does not work, and any power that attempts to change your mind, body, or soul against your will fails. This also prevents the loss, theft, suppression, or removal of any of your skills, perks, powers, etc that you have."
1400,,400,Lucky ,X-23,Benevolence ,"Like Gambit you are one of the lucky ones, you can never die from a one hit kill attack or event. An attack that kills whatever it touches but nothing else would be completely ignored by you, but an attack that does major damage to an area and kills everyone else would still leave you gravely wounded. If such an attack was repeated before you were healed then it could kill you."
1401,,400,Blessing of Stan Lee ,Ultimate Marvel,Benevolence ,"You have somehow caught the interest of the greatest Watcher, Stan Lee. While he can’t help you, his interest made you a better version of yourself. Basically, this acts as a Capstone Booster. Also thanks to Stan’s influence, Perks / Powers / Mutant Powers bought in this Jump cannot be surpassed, removed, or stolen, and changes to the timeline or continuity no longer affects you, you still remain the person you were before, but with any additional memory you may be expected to have."
1402,,400,Heroic Sacrifice,Pet Avengers,Benevolence ,"It’d not be a superhero jump if no one died and came back to life in it. Once per jump, or 10 years whichever comes first, when you die for a cause greater than yourself you will find that your allies are inspired to greater heights of power and competence, their blows hitting harder, their will more unbreakable, and their thoughts far clearer than they otherwise would be. To make things better this death will not end you, but instead you will be revived through some means before the end of the jump. It might take 5 minutes or a few years, but not more than 4 years."
1403,,400,Multiversal Armor,Marvel: What If...?,Benevolence ,"The Watcher almost never intervenes, but when he does, he gets serious. Originally modeled after Uata’s plate, you may summon this armor to you or alter it’s style with a thought. Crafted from manifested psychic energy, this coat could protect you against all but the greatest of foes. Even Ascended Ultron couldn’t crack this plate outright."
1404,,400,My Reality,Marvel Civil War,Benevolence ,"There are too many reality manipulators in any Marvel-verse, this one is no exception. Thanks to this perk you don’t have to fear them as much, they can’t personally affect you. However, they can still create effects around you, such as delete the planet so you can’t breathe or they can still create a golem to pummel you to the ground or create a black hole to suck you in. Additionally, this also provides you protection against changes to the timeline."
1405,,400,Embers of the Heroic Age,Marvel 2099,Benevolence ,"The original Heroic Age ended, but even 100 years later its embers still burn. While the most powerful beings seem to be relics and remnants of the heroic age - Doom, the Fantastic Four, the invading Phalanx - the new heroes starting a second Heroic Age aren’t wholly without the power once shown in the original one.

Like some of the mutants, or the heroes of the original heroic age, you show the greatest power that made the original heroic age. Not the Power Cosmic, or any specific super power, but the ability to grow from your experiences, to break the limits of your powers and go beyond them in times of dire need.

When the odds are truly against you and those things dear to you at risk you may see your powers and special abilities momentarily swell to far greater heights than ever before, lifting ten times what is your normal maximum, or otherwise seeming to break the limits of your powers. Repeat this enough times and while this won’t be your new maximum you will find the limits of your powers and special abilities growing looser, and restrictions becoming less restricting or eventually falling away.

Even less extreme situations can cause this growth, though it will be slower. Conflict and danger will allow your powers and special abilities to grow seemingly without an upper limit other than when you run out of things that are truly a risk to you and your goals."
1406,,400,MYSTERIOUS FLOWER ,Helltaker,Benevolence ,"WHAT IS THIS FLOWER? I DON’T KNOW, YOU DON’T KNOW, NO ONE KNOWS. And your enemies will be just as confused! ANYONE who tries to attack or harm you will be momentarily STUNNED everytime they see the flower. They can grow accustomed to it but they’ll never be able to completely shrug it off as long as they’re attacking you. This translates to a big initial counter-attack window and a small one every time someone attacks you. Just like the rest of the Helltaker Set, this flower can also become part of you and your existence if you wish it to."
1407,,400,Sacrifice,Amalgam Comics,Benevolence ,"Always a shame when a hero falls, never to rise again. Once per Jump or decade, you may return from the grave, and if you died in a suitably heroic manner, you will be rewarded with greater powers than before. Perhaps giving you life to save the universe would make you the equal to Uatu or the Celestial?"
1408,,400,Fact of Life ,Amalgam Comics,Benevolence ,"The universe itself is a temporary aberration, to say nothing of all the time-travel. Well, you cannot be erased and if history is altered you will be present and remember the old version just fine."
1409,,400,"Bravest Soul, Biggest Fool",Marvel Cosmic,Benevolence ,"It has been said that foolhardiness and bravery are the same thing. That only an idiot would stand before insurmountable odds for such paltry and ephemeral things as justice and hope. Much like a certain Quasar, you are both brave and foolish. Those supposedly paltry concepts are everything to you and you would happily stand before the marching infinite abyss to uphold such ideals. When standing up to insurmountable odds you willpower and morale sky rockets. The more insurmountable the odds, the greater your power will rise. This will not work if the odds are near or in your favor. So long as you are doing something foolish for the right reasons, there is no such thing as impossible."
1410,,400,Beyond the Cosmic Norm,Marvel Cosmic,Benevolence ,"Well aren’t you a special little snowflake? A lot of people think they are one of a kind. Most of them are wrong. You are not. You are a truly unique being in the cosmos. You can not be copied, replaced, cloned, or duplicated in any manner unless you allow it. Even holograms and illusions of you stick out as obvious mimics no matter how perfect they might otherwise be. The universe has noticed your uniqueness and occasionally sends you helpful glimpses of things you should not know or be aware of."
1411,,400,Water Specialization - Lifebending ,Avatar: The Last Airbender,Benevolence ,"Water is the source of all life, and all life is a source of water. You are one of the rare Waterbenders able to access this source, bending water within living organisms. Aside from enhancing your healing, you may now control water within plants, leeching it from them or twisting them into any shape you desire. However, under the full moon, you gain the power to Bloodbend, controlling animals and even humans as your puppets, or leaving them as dessicated corpses. With time, you may truly master this art, Bloodbending even in the light of day.

Requires Bending Arts(Waterbending)  to Purchase"
1412,,400,Shroud of Martin,Fate/Zero,Benevolence ,"A Holy Shroud and important artefact of the Church, this red fabric is capable of sealing events or returning something to normal, so long as it is wrapped tightly around the subject in question. With enough material to cover the average sized adult man, it is an incredible tool for saving lives. Even the most ferocious and deadly of poisons could be stopped by wrapping the shroud around the limb or part of the body which was bitten, reverting that event until the victim could get to a proper care facility. This reversion effect is not without limits. It cannot bring back the dead and as soon as the shroud is taken off the being it is wrapped around, all effects are undone and they again suffer with full force what afflicted them. The shroud cannot be cut up into more than one piece, not without losing its supernatural properties, but any damage done to it will be undone within a day. This can be imported into."
1413,,400,The Walking Church,Toaruverse,Benevolence ,"A cloth symbolically takes the essential elements of a church, as such since the church provides protection to the needy; the Walking Church will replicate that protection for the user. It also uses the cloth-weaving, line stitching, and embroidery to successfully recreate all essential elements of a church. Because of this, anything that would not destroy a real church would be rendered ineffective against the wearer. This also specifically replicates the Holy Shroud of Turin, the defensive ability of her Walking Church has been extended to the Pope-class, rendering the defensive capability of the robes similar to the level of a nuclear bomb shelter making any magical and physical attack on you would be absorbed. This version is self-sustaining without need to be maintained by your and outside mana, and cannot be detected by magical or technological means."
1414,,400,All the Worlds Luck,Toaruverse,Benevolence ,Some use abilities and powers to become lucky while others are naturally born lucky either way being lucky makes those who are not envious of others that have it. Compared to others you have much more luck than them as you are prone to receiving fortunate events and things tend to follow the ways that you want to. Bad-luck and unfortunate things and events tend to evade or miss you along with abilities that rely on luck being prone to misfire or have low probability of activating when used on you. Finding treasures and winning the lottery becomes a trend around you as those around you especially your allies tend to be more lucky compared to others but not on your level of luck.
1415,,400,Damage Control,Toaruverse,Benevolence ,In battles the ability to minimize damage that does to the surrounding would be nice especially if you're protecting the bystanders caught in your battle field. With this you gained a preternatural ability at using your abilities to minimize the damage and destruction that the surrounding receives either it’s from your attacks or your opponents even putting conditions on your powers that only harms your opponents and bypass others or structures. Bystanders near your battlefields tend to gain plot-armor and incredible luck at avoiding receiving fatal wounds or dying no matter how destructive the battle you're doing and the range of the effects is equal to the maximum range you can control your abilities and powers.
1416,,400,Jamming Immunity,Toaruverse,Benevolence ,"There are many things like magic or technology that exists to disrupt or weaken everyone’s abilities especially for Espers but unlike them you are far too different. You are now immune to any supernatural ability and technology that would try disrupt, weaken, nullify, erase and manipulate your abilities or powers making you always able to use your abilities even in a no power zones or in the presence and contact with the Imagine Breaker. This also applies to technologies that you wield that things that would normally disrupt or make them malfunction would not take effect."
1417,,400,Sanctify,Darkest Dungeon,Benevolence ,"“Gilded icons and dogmatic rituals… for some, a tonic against the bloodshed.” The healing power of miracles and the wielding of holy radiance to smite your enemies is but one verse in the book of the Light. Just as effective are the variety of blessings one attuned to its powers can bestow, as well as the warding rituals used to sanctify churches- which may also be used to ward an area for rest should you decide to take a break while exploring, preventing the forces of darkness from intruding on your temporary sanctum for a time. One can even heal the deepest of mortal wounds which would otherwise require more in-depth healing on the operating table. These powers are yours, though they’re best utilized when at rest due to the time they take. Also; you have the ability to bless water, allowing it to cleanse profane artifacts and ward against dark magic and other crippling forces in combat."
1418,,400,"From Sickness, Strength",Darkest Dungeon,Benevolence ,"“Suffer not the lame horse, nor the broken man.” When medicine fails true paragons find the strength to carry on through faith, and sheer willpower. As the bile flows, the blood boils; as the limbs shake, they become strong; as the mind falters, the heart strikes true! When disease wracks the body and mind, you’ll find yourself strengthening in other ways to face the adversity within and without. The common cold may provide paltry gains, but a leper could shed blood like rain with this using naught but a broken blade. Paradoxically, being strengthened in this way typically staves off death from illness- though not necessarily the suffering it causes. But even when insanity claims your mind, making you erratic, you tend to act more of than not in your best interests- and with more vigor, unhinged as it may be. "
1419,,400,Cursed,Ragna Crimson,Benevolence ,"You have been ‘cursed’ by the great Dragon God, Jumper. Or so you say. Whatever the case is, you are capable of extracting your heart from your body. By doing so, you become unable to truly die. Any time your body would be destroyed, another one would pop up instantly next to it with your consciousness moving into that one. 

Taking your heart out also allows you to seal some of your abilities, if you wish to. This may allow you to pass as a regular human if you were to be a dragon, as well as granting you a form of shapeshifting.

By later restoring your heart to your body, you gain a temporal boost to your abilities. You may also send back your heart again to its previous place by just willing it in order to be able to generate new bodies again, but you will lose your power boost."
1420,,400,Eternal Snow/Sun Roots ,Trinity Wonder,Benevolence ,"At some point in the past, maybe after falling off of a glacial cliff for the fourth time, you came across the eternal roots. This is an extremely mystical and rare plant. If you were to consume these roots, you would gain a body completely immune to a specific affinity of ki depending on the type of roots. Consuming the Eternal Snow Roots would make you become completely immune to Yin ki, and thus cold based damage in general. Similarly, the Eternal Sun Roots would make you immune to Yang ki and heat based damage. Being frozen in a pillar of ice, or blasted by the full force of a dragon’s fire would be more annoying than painful."
1421,,400,Triumphant Return,Trinity Wonder,Benevolence ,"What doesn’t kill you only makes you stronger. Well, not literally. Rather, every time you get defeated and forced to flee in a serious fight, you somehow manage to have a lucky encounter soon after. You will find something that can raise your strength by another level. This may not be enough to defeat the foe who struck you down, but it is certainly enough to give you a noticeable increase in your strength. Wujin and Pink Papa had four different fights at the edge of the world and every time Wujin lost. But with every defeat, with every fall down the cliffs he encountered something that just made him stronger."
1422,,400,Guardian Angel,League of Legends,Benevolence ,"This glorious suit of golden mail possesses a pair of angelic wings, and is wreathed in a warm, comforting light. The armor on its own is effective at warding off spells and swords alike, but when the wearer of this suit of armor is about to take a lethal blow, the armor's magic will protect them- Suspending them in heavenly light on the edge of life and death for four seconds. After exiting stasis they will be brought back, albeit worse for wear- The wearer will come back at only a third of their maximum vitality, and the Guardian Angel will not be able to protect them again for five days and five nights."
1423,,400,Lifegiver,League of Legends,Benevolence ,"You know the selfless art of Healing magic. By pulling from your own lifeforce, you can heal the wounds of those around you with a soft green light. Your magic's comforting embrace will also bolster the defences of your allies, but your magic will tap your own reserves, slowly making your allies' wounds your own. Using this to bring back the dead might be possible, but may endanger your own life. By inverting this magic, you can also draw lifeforce from your enemies to heal your own wounds, but it's not terribly efficient at killing your enemies."
1424,,400,Ring of Mala,A Throne of Glass,Benevolence ,"A copy of a simple gold ring, when worn this ring makes its wearer immune to possession. Any possession attempted is rebuffed, and should someone be unwillingly possessed when they put on the ring, the possessing entity is immediately destroyed and killed. This is an object that can strike fear into the hearts of Valg Kings and Queens."
1425,,400,The Immortal Race,A Throne of Glass,Benevolence ,"You are an immortal Fae and as such, you are born of a race that is ageless. You have been adapted through nature and nurture to understand and be capable of withstanding the pressures of an immortal life. You are always able to see a reason to keep on going in life, and have a preternatural ability to bear the loss that pain and time will heap on you as the much more quickly ageing beings around you age and die. You will not linger on in grief, you will heal, move on, and be able to continue to interact with the world around you with interest and passion. Should the world change around you, you will be able to change and grow with it, while your life may be immortal you are now well adjusted enough to ensure that it will never be stagnant. More than this however you are guaranteed that no great loss or pain will cause you to Fade against your will, only your choice, made with a clear mind, will allow you to Fade into the Void."
1426,,400,Pair Up,Super Dragon Sword,Benevolence ,"Together, we are stronger. You are able to manifest a bond between two allies as a Pair - a powerful effect that grants both members of the pair the strongest of either partner’s statistics, and allows them to utilize their own mana and stamina to empower the abilities of their Paired partner. In addition, they are capable of knowing each-other's thoughts and instincts. Stronger bonds amplify this effect, and even allow their stats to be higher than they would be individually."
1427,,400,Radiant Example,Super Dragon Sword,Benevolence ,"Why simply settle for being a good leader, when you can be a legendary one? You can strike a pose and give a rallying cry, granting your allies the Vigorous (effectively doubles health) and Haste status effects. In addition, this Radiant order enshrouds the weapons of your allies in your choice of air, water, or fire energy."
1428,,400,Witch-hunter,Super Dragon Sword,Benevolence ,"You will not fall to the sorcery of these false idols and their servants. When you are at low health, you may shroud you and your party in physical shell (which reduces damage taken by a significant amount) and spell reflect, which bounces targeted spells towards a non-reflective target. In addition, your strikes are now capable of damaging an opponent’s mana in addition to their health."
1429,,400,Indestructible Hand Bag,Ben 10,Benevolence ,"You know what else is a pain when it comes to magic? Components can get destroyed or lost, items of power can be broken from constant stress, and mispronouncing a spell might see you turn into a frog or something. The good news is that this isn’t a problem for you anymore – if a spell can go wrong or backfire from something like battle damaged or a missed step, it simply...won’t. At most, the spell will simply harmlessly fizzle out. Also, any items of magical power you wield or any spell components you require stay on your person until you see fit to put them down or pull them out of your pocket. No more missing that handbag full of your magical items!"
1430,,400,Bored With Insanity,Ben 10,Benevolence ,"Madness can get pretty dull after a while, don’t you think? When the horrifying truth behind all of reality and endless eons of isolation get to you and drive you all kinds of batty, eventually you just run out of ways to be crazy and get bored with it all. Your mind has obtained a sort of ‘super sanity’ that completely insulates it from manipulation or stress caused by horrific revelations or just being stuck in one place for thousands of years. No attempt to control you or drive you mad through horror or ennui sticks to you, letting you stay clear of mind and able to shrug off insanity-inducing horrors with all the interest of a cheesy monster movie. Really, after all you’ve seen, this sort of thing is a given isn’t it?"
1431,,400,Stars and Stones,The Dresden Files,Benevolence ,"The Outsiders don't just refuse to play the rules, they break them, permanently. You've inherited this ability of theirs, and now you're able to let those around you slip the bonds of otherwise-inviolate supernatural laws. I'm not just talking magical contracts or compulsions, either - you can allow a creature to go against its fundamental nature. A vampire could be free of its hunger, a fairy could lie, and a Foo Dog could betray its family with your help. Only two restrictions - you can't remove a vulnerability, and you can't use this ability on yourself. You especially can't use it to eliminate said restrictions, so nice try."
1432,,400,"""A Smidgen of Life""",Dark Souls 3,Benevolence ,"The arms and armor of early men were forged in the Abyss, and betray a smidgen of life. For this reason the gods cast a seal of fire upon these armaments, and those who possessed them. These warriors now patrol the streets of the Ringed City, striking down those who dare to invade their home. Like the Ringed Knights, the equipment you wield shares your burdens, reflecting your own condition. When you are in good health, they appear pristine, unblemished; when you are suffering or hurt, they will become more tarnished and aged. However, until you lie broken and dead upon the ground your armor will stand strong no matter how worn and tattered it looks, nor will your weapons lose their effectiveness even when they appear frayed and rusted- taking much longer to break than they would normally. However this is the least of what this perk does, for the longer you wear your armor and wield your weapons, the more your very being will seep into them. At first they may change aesthetically to better suit your tastes or a chosen theme; but wait long enough, and they may take on powers evocative of your nature so long as you are united in battle. If purchased with “Vital Defense”, then even more life has seeped into your equipment, though making them more of an extension of your own body than separate beings. Your weapons and armor feel like a part of your body, allowing you to move and leap about like a wild animal and perform your techniques as fluidly as one breathes. Looser apparel, such as capes, are even capable of lashing out like extra limbs on your behalf to trip up or batter your enemies, adding a deadly and unexpected edge to your arsenal."
1433,,400,"""Yearning For Warmth""",Dark Souls 3,Benevolence ,"No Unkindled can ever truly claim the embers that burn within a champion’s bosom, which is precisely what makes their yearning for warmth so keen. By imbibing embers, one can obtain the power of cinder for a time though. This perk grants you the power to heal yourself and strengthen your body by consuming flame. In this strengthened state, your body becomes harder to injure and warm to the touch. Harmless embers will dance across your body in this state, allowing you to glow with fire's light. The potency of these abilities depends on the strength of the flame absorbed, but even weak flames can dramatically heal you. This ""Embered State"" will wear off over time, but may also be consumed if you take serious injuries. The flame consumption ability requires close proximity and is quite fast, but you may only imbibe so much of it before it starts to consume you from the inside out. If purchased with ""Rare Vitality"", your tolerance for flame raises dramatically. This allows you to actually use the ability somewhat defensively against fire based foes and reach a greater ""Embered State"" making you much more durable. Reaching a ""Greater Embered State"" causes harmless, small flames to dance across your body."
1434,,400,Temporary Reprieve,Dark Souls 2,Benevolence ,"“Days, weeks, months, years, decades, centuries, however long you have to stand guard is no issue. Your duty is more valuable than anything beyond the walls of this room, but to keep waiting in the absence of any actual intruders can be very tiresome. You have the ability to hibernate through your boredom, just shut your brain down for prolonged periods of time as If you died on your feet. It wouldn’t do to let anyone to sneak past while getting your beauty rest however, and so you may set conditions for your awakening, any you like. Something foreign poking up in your senses, being directly disturbed, someone attempting to go past a door you’re set to keep closed, whatever. Additionally, any degenerative conditions like poison, disease and even the undead curse will halt while sleeping via this perk. This allows potential treatment to be found and returned to you by comrades.”"
1435,,400,When Next We Meet,Dark Souls 2,Benevolence ,"“Life is a long road, and a lonely one for most in these lands. Fear, frailty and weakness creep into their bodies and minds. Even those great and mighty will be ground to dust with time, but you can make the difference. You acquire an incredible ability to ingratiate yourself with adventurers and wanderers. First impressions are great, friendship or at least cooperation more easily established, perhaps even companionship so the road no longer must be one walked alone. Most importantly, you now find that when you work with or support someone, your companionship keeps them healthy in mind and spirit. Your presence as an ally keeps memories from fading, souls from rotting and resolve as solid as iron. Not a hint of rust. They need not stay by your side even if desired to keep these effects, strong is the bond that lasts across vast distances. Even in the long dark nights the undead wander through, you can light the way. Isn’t that the value of some good old jolly cooperation?”"
1436,,400,“Dead Man Walking”,Dark Souls 1,Benevolence,"Deep within Nito’s tomb exists many giant skeletons raised by Pinwheel’s necromancy. Nito himself is also an intelligent, animate mass of bones. Would you like to join the party? On purchase, your lifeforce, consciousness and ability to animate is all concentrated within your skeleton. This means that while all those things like flesh and organs and muscles are nice to have, they’re no longer strictly ‘necessary.’ As long as your skull stays mostly intact, you may stay animated and alive even if you’re nothing but bones. Additionally, if your bones are scattered, you can exert your will to pull yourself back together. If purchased with Calcium, your bones are made even harder, taking on a toughness similar to high quality iron, making putting you down quite difficult."
1437,,400,“Dark Slumber”,Dark Souls 1,Benevolence,"After descending to madness and dark intentions, New Londo was flooded and the Four Kings along with their Dark Wraiths were sealed away beneath still waters. When the city was drained, they awoke from their slumber none the worse for wear. When an area you’re within is struck by disaster, artificial or natural it matters not, you are able to descend into a hibernation as others die and cities fall to ruin. You will survive, sleeping unharmed within the rubble until it is once again safe to awaken. When taken with Lambs to Slaughter, you exude a curse from your shallow grave, a subtle temptation that calls to the curious and naïve. This sways them to reach the source of the calls, clearing the way to you and allowing you to awaken more easily."
1438,,400,“Absolution of Sin” ,Dark Souls 1,Benevolence,"Velka, Goddess of Sin, is a rogue goddess not looked upon warmly by other gods. She nonetheless holds great power and influence, and is well liked by many of those within the Painted World due to this frail relationship. You are a priest or priestess of Velka like the ones found in Carim, and as such have the capacity to absolve others of their sins. This forgiveness is often sought after, as it can help others mend relationships after burning bridges and evade the notice of the Blades of the Darkmoon. Beware, as while forgiving sin can help someone mend relationships by softening aggression over their acts, it cannot remove memories. Any sin too great will be unable to be forgiven, and the secondary party’s anger or hatred will not be abated no matter what your customer wishes. If you have some working knowledge of Miracles, you will also have been taught Miracles associated with the Goddess Velka, Karmic Justice and Vow of Silence. When purchased with Banished Evil, you can absorb and channel the sins against the gods you forgive into a dark power that stands as the antithesis of the living. Wounds inflicted with this occult resource gush the victim’s lifeblood, either literally or metaphorically, not unlike Priscilla’s Lifehunt."
1439,,400,“Blight Swallower”,Dark Souls 1,Benevolence,"Fair Lady, former Daughter of Chaos, is worshipped by Chaos Servants for her charity to them. This deed was taking their disease into herself to save them from their suffering, at the expense of her own health. You have the same miraculous ability, to take the diseases and toxic build up from the bodies of others and consume them, cleansing them of their ailments. While your body is good at handling these things, it is not immune, which leaves the second part of the ability. You can eject toxins within your body as silk covered eggs from your back. Each egg holds a parasite representing the diseases or toxins, which can be bestowed upon others in a manner similar to Egg Head. The eggs are inert until being removed from you. If you have Egg Head, your maggot can now make like a leech and suck the toxins from you or someone else itself, though be careful or it may get sick."
1440,,400,Dragon’s Blood Droplet,Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,Benevolence,"A shimmering pearly crystal tear. If you have the Dragon’s Heritage or you were given the blood of someone who does, so long as this droplet is on your person, you will instantly heal upon being dealt a fatal blow. Once this happens, the crystal will turn grey and you’re unable to benefit from its effect. The color will return to it in an hour. You can also use it to heal someone of the dragonrot. Healing dragonrot will not turn the crystal grey."
1441,,400,Prayer Necklace ,Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,Benevolence,"A bandolier of blue crystal-like prayer beads. When worn, you feel healthier, and even sturdier. Even if someone were to toss a bull at you, you would somehow be able to catch it and remain standing even if you don’t actually have the strength to carry it. Additionally, while wearing the necklace, you will be immune to illnesses and your stamina is increased by two folds."
1442,,400,Written in the Stars ,Elden Ring,Benevolence,"You may not necessarily be an Empyrean with this alone, but it seems the stars look kindly on your fate all the same. A powerful destiny of great significance is yours now, letting you bypass barriers and wield artifacts that normally only a certain person can take hold of. If only the rightful son of the king can draw a sword from a stone for example, you could as well. But as long as the stars are not restricted or their influence on the world not otherwise disrupted, this destiny goes further to greatly enhance your mystical abilities of all kinds as well as granting you a great deal of fortune. It is not absolute, and no replacement for unwise decision making or truly impossible odds, but together it may be possible for you to contend with the direct incarnations of the outer gods with enough pluck and power. And should you fall into dire circumstances, an appealing love interest might just step forth at the right moment to get you back on your feet."
1443,,400,"No Maidens, No Problem ",Elden Ring,Benevolence,"It seems that chance and circumstance just keep lining up for you, even should you start from humble beginnings. Foes you run into often just happen to be fending off assassins or other dangers of their own, or have suffered great wounds or misfortune before your encounter. Old treasure chests have an astonishing tendency to contain legendary blades of old or enchanted (and surprisingly well-fitted) armour long thought lost to the Lands Between. Crafting ingredients and other consumables of all kinds practically litter the place wherever you go-never found by any except you, for some reason. This is much more specific when you have a concrete, ambitious goal such as becoming Elden Lord, but even should you simply strive for strength you’ll find yourself living a charmed life. Even seemingly impassable barriers or overwhelming odds can be beaten, if you correctly apply the right ally or McGuffin to drop in your lap when all seems lost."
1444,,400,Glorifier,MtG - Ixalan,Benevolence,"The teachings of the Dusk Legion’s faiths venerate the blood and its sacred nature, as well as the cycle of life and death - to believe there is no gain without loss, but also no loss without gain. Their magic epitomizes this, and this magic is now your own: By utilizing fresh blood from any source near you, you are capable of transmuting it into magical effects directly, capable of directly mending injuries and giving an unnatural zeal in your allies, or even directly improving their combat prowess and physical capabilities further. Those who know death, must know life. "
1445,,400,Renewed Faith,MtG - Amonkhet,Benevolence,"This world’s gods are benevolent. Unlike those of Theros, when you honor these gods they’ll honor and reward you in turn, to the best of their abilities. Or at least, that was the way it was before Bolas brainwashed them. Even now they’re still mostly benevolent, but the elder dragon has perverted them to his own ends. With you, at least, they return to their roots. In fact, all gods and divine beings act this way in regards to you, even to the point of exempting you from their wraths unless you’re personally involved."
1446,,400,Oathsworn,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Benevolence,"Knights of Locthwain pride themselves on being able to withstand anything in the pursuit of their goals, but there are those who take this beyond the pale - there are those who’s lingering will and endurance are such that they can fight fiercely and carry on even past the point where any other men would have died - such Knights are capable of even shrugging off even dismemberment and impalement as flesh wounds. Nothing less than tearing you into pieces and scattering your body around would guarantee that you could stop fighting- as long as you have a leg to stand on or a hand to grasp at, you can still act and move till your life force gives out.

Boosted: Oathsworn - > Deathless Knight
Now this is just ridiculous. Simply put, your stores of vitality are genuinely through the roof. If Oathsworn were difficult to put down, you are (barring the use of annihilating flame or being reduced to nothing but pieces and paste) downright impossible to kill with mere blade and bow. You can heal from nearly any wound within a few moments, and your durability is such that the easiest and quickest way to kill you would have to be decapitation followed by the destruction of the head afterwards - one or the other would merely give you a chance to recover your head and place it back on.

1447,,400,Knight of Lochtwain,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Benevolence ,"Lochtwain. The Court of Persistence. Knights of Locthwain are those who have personally won the favor of the immortal Queen Ayara, elven nobility who rules over the flying castle. Ayara is not easily impressed, and those who win her favor must overcome surmounting odds without showing any sign of surrender, performing grueling and mentally challenging tasks. Those who succeed have usually gained a powerful endurance of both mind and body, and can even call upon echoes of the necromantic power of the Cauldron of Eternity, granting them enhanced regeneration and vitality as well as sapping at the life force of their enemies."
1448,,400,Command Table,MtG - Zendikar,Benevolence ,"A rather simple table taken from a mobile command center, though rather special in what it can achieve. While seated around this mobile war table, you and any generals under your command will find your tactical acumen greatly augmented, and your ability to rationally assess the merits of various stratagems without bias coming to you easily. Equally importantly, it allows you to judge both the character and loyalty of those around you, to better understand and lead those beneath you."
1449,,400,The Unreal Crown,MtG - Zendikar,Benevolence ,"Not a crown, per say, or anything really - more the absence of anything. Three triangular black spikes of non-resistance that hover above the head of the bearer, marking them as alien for all to see. Since touching this would be a remarkably bad idea, you may call for and dismiss it with a minute’s focus. While wearing the crown space warping abilities are enhanced, and a passive distortion in the space around you by the crown makes aiming magic at you difficult."
1450,,400,I Am Durable,MtG - Zendikar,Benevolence ,"You are durable. I suppose some more explanation is needed: you are able to survive falling a few hundred feet from a cliff face leaving you only bruised rather than dead, or take couple of hits from one of the giant Pathrazer of Ulamog without being seriously impeded, let alone pulped like a normal human. You also gain a talent for understatement."
1451,,400,Life Finds A Way,MtG - Homelands,Benevolence ,"When the apocalypse turned most of Ulgrotha into lifeless wastes, the mana rift spared the great woods and allowed it to grow and flower further. When Feroz erected his Ban around the world, the buildup of mana gave rise to the Autumn Willow and allowed the forest to grow at an even more incredible rate. Whenever disaster or change strikes the Homelands, the Great Woods always seem to remain unscathed and even benefit from it.

Similarly, disruptions to the natural order, large-scale disasters, and sweeping changes just seem to spare and work out unreasonably well for you. A shield around the world might provide you with a massively potent well of mana, the rest of your tribes’ leadership being whisked away to their deaths by a summing leaves you the sole rule of your race, and joining a group of pioneers wanting to get away from the cities would lead to your new people gaining the loving protection of a benevolent force of nature."
1452,,400,Fiery Soul,MtG - Shandalar,Benevolence ,"Vast conflagrations, earthquakes that turn the very ground beneath one’s feet into a lethal trap, flashfires and infernos beyond mortal comprehension that leave nothing but ashes in their wake… Red magic is home to some of the most magnificent spells of wide-spread destruction. But those same spells are often self-destructive, leaving you at their mercy as much as they might pummel your foe into submission. Except your insight into the raw power of chaos and fire have given you a measure of control over such spells - and any others with similar consequences. You are effectively immune to all ‘collateral damage’ caused by your magic, and your followers and allies are likewise protected - if to a lesser degree. Though you might set the world ablaze in your wrath, you shall walk through the flames untouched and unyielding."
1453,,400,Might Of Nature ,MtG - Shandalar,Benevolence ,"The wilds of Shandalar are home to beasts of terrible power, and those who master the raw, untamed wisdom of Green magic know to draw upon this power. Any creature you summon into being, be it through the use of Shandalar’s magic or through some other method, has its physical might greatly increased. Though all such creatures are improved, this ability is most effective when used with summoned servants that are wholly ‘natural’, potentially granting them twice the strength and resilience they would otherwise have had."
1454,,400,Heart Of A World,MtG - Shandalar,Benevolence ,"Mage-duels in Shandalar are things of great beauty and terrible power, the mightiest wizards unleashing and surviving blasts that would rend apart a Wooly Mammoth several times over. Yet the secret to their survival is not physical might or resilience - like many other aspects of battle in Shandalar, magic is the source of these magicians’ unearthly endurance. Rather than weathering blows directly, each mage has the innate ability to protect themselves using specially-prepared ‘Mana Links’. Not dissimilar from the mana bonds that mages use to draw on arcane energy to fuel their spells, these links are instead used to create immensely powerful defenses to keep a spellcaster safe from harm. Most major spellcasters you might meet here have such defenses, ranging from barely sufficient to survive being struck by a Lightning Bolt to the near incomprehensible resilience of Arzakon himself. Now, you too can form such links - each of which requires a location rich in mana to establish. The more you acquire, the more difficult you are to kill, though keep in mind: as each location fuels your defenses, an enemy breaking your hold over such a place will weaken you as well.

You receive this power for free during your time here, starting with the equivalent of ten ‘life
points’ regardless of any further connections you make, and allowing you to form Mana Links with most locations on Shandalar. For an additional 400CP, you may continue to form such bonds in future worlds, though in all cases you cannot retain a Mana Link to a location in a different jump than you are currently in."
1455,,400,LUCKY SOUL,MtG - Ravnica,Benevolence ,"Ravnica is a dangerous place to live, especially if you’re not under the protection of a guild. A regular citizen could be abducted for experiments, taxed to the afterlife, or arrested as a scapegoat, and all while just being caught up in the constant conflict between guilds. This guarantees that if you’re not trying to get involved, these things just pass you by. The Rakdos festival happens in the next district over. The Gruul smash up some civilisation but your route to work is unchanged. The Simic experiment only mutates every other house, passing you by. You’ll be able to relax without worrying about the bigger things going on."
1456,,400,ADAPT ,MtG - Ravnica,Benevolence ,"There are many points over the course of life when you grow stronger, whether through natural means or through facilitated ones. Now those moments become more exciting. Whenever you have an increase in strength, you can almost guarantee that there will be some sort of additional effect. Was your eyesight always that good? Did you always think that clearly? Did you always have a tentacle there? Bear in mind that if you lose this strength then the additional effect will be lost as well."
1457,,400,PROLIFERATE,MtG - Ravnica,Benevolence ,"Unlike many in the Simic would have you believe, growth is a natural process, and should not be focused into particular areas. If you would use a spell or ward to increase a single aspect of your body, such as strength, all other related aspects will increase as well, such as speed and defences. The only drawback to this otherwise powerful gift is that the boost granted will take longer to have an effect, much like how growth is slower than forced growth, but the overall benefits far outweigh this small hindrance."
1458,,400,BATTALION ,MtG - Ravnica,Benevolence ,"Two’s company, three's a crowd. Or in this case, an army. Whenever you attack with at least two other companions, your powers become greatly amplified. Become briefly invulnerable, deal additional damage, attack faster than should be possible, it depends on the situation, but these effects gained simply by creating a unified offence are not to be underestimated."
1459,,400,FORECAST ,MtG - Ravnica,Benevolence ,"There’s a lot to be said for the element of surprise. Giving as little information away to your foes means they can never be entirely sure what you’re up to, giving you the edge... at least, that’s what it usually does. You can blatantly flaunt your powers and plans to the opponent, and any boost that would have been gained from the element of surprise is instead converted directly into whatever you’re planning on doing."
1460,,400,Lightning Greaves,MtG - New Phyrexia,Benevolence ,"A set of enchanted greaves, granting its wielder supernatural speed enough to match or even outspeed the fastest beasts of Mirrodin, and a strong protection against magic cast by others- both friend or foe- as well as most supernatural abilities that would target the user. This protection is not perfect, and powerful or particularly clever beings may be able to bypass it- but it will completely nullify most spells aimed at the user. Spells cast on wide areas, however, are not defended against- it merely prevents the user from being targeted."
1461,,400,Scales Of Justice,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Benevolence ,"No matter how many students join the Golden Tail Academy or are conscripted into the Imperial Army, there are simply never enough to keep up with the demands of the world. Attempts to increase their effectiveness through technology have gone well and have taken the edge off, but with the Asari Uprising slowly draining the ranks of the less loyal Samurai it still isn’t enough. Enter the results of an absurd amount of bribery and begging on behalf of the Imperial Court, a number of dragon scales taken from Ao and enchanted to Takamagahara and back. By crushing one of these scales in your hand, you may unleash a surge of healing magic so powerful and potent that it can be used to heal someone even after they have died, if only for a short time. And that is for those it is focused on, as even being in the presence of the scales being used can permanently enhance those nearby - not by a great deal unless focused, but by a noticeable amount. "
1462,,400,General’s Kabuto ,MtG - Kamigawa,Benevolence ,"Blessed armor of the Mad Daimyo’s Generals. The wearer of this armor will survive the worst the physical world has to throw at them without even a scratch, and magic slides right off this mystically enhanced vestment. The only problems are that the armor itself can be shattered by a canny opponent, attacks that would slay you instantly break the armor automatically though you’ll survive, leaving you bereft of its impressive defenses for a year and a day before it’ll appear on an armor rack in a property you own or in the Warehouse, at your discretion, and the amount of energy it takes to keep these miracles running is beyond most mages much less those less than magically inclined. A general tip would be to only activate the magics during emergencies."
1463,,400,Bushido,MtG - Kamigawa,Benevolence ,"The Way of the Warrior is one that is defined by its virtues: Rectitude, Courage, Benevolence, Respect, Honesty, Honor, and Loyalty represent the culmination of a warrior's way of life and when acting within the boundaries of these moral guidelines the Samurai is greater than the sum of his parts. His actions carry greater weight, his attacks become more effective whilst his skill at defense could suddenly boast gains beyond what he has trained for. This effect now encompasses you. Like the Samurai of yore you can gain boosts to your raw defensive and offensive abilities when acting within the virtues and you can even train others to tap into this power as well."
1464,,400,Inner Flame,MtG - Lorwyn,Benevolence ,"Flamekin spells do not simply burn, and pilgrims seek far more than to simply ignite bigger and brighter fire. Flames are the magic's primary form, but it is not merely heat that flickers up from the eyes and joints of flamekin mages. It is initiative, inspiration, the itch of curiosity, and the impulse towards action. A flamekin's fire is joyous, creative, and urgent.

As a flamekin mage your flames have many uses, from the obvious combat use of throwing fireballs far hotter than any giant's forge, or the conjuring of sheets of plasma to incinerate incoming arrows before they strike you, to the more involved cool-burning blue flames that allow you to examine and heal the minds and bodies of others.

But the most potent flame you could produce are white flames, their misty silver-white fire suffused with your spirit and emotions as well as your intellect and discipline. It is a cool fire that soothes troubled minds, makes you more alert and energized the longer you sustain it, and can be extended to others to feel and awaken their own initiative and urgent impulses. You could let it fill the void of a mind suppressed and wake your subjects, or perhaps grant a spark of initiative and emotion to what had previously been a mere automaton."
1465,,400,Blessing ,MtG - Innistrad,Benevolence ,"As Avacyn grants her blessing to the archmages of the Church, you are able to confer some of your energies to another through a touch. That they might better protect themselves or strike out in your name. Also allows you to have those you bless make use of the warding perk drawing from your power. This allows you to empower others with weaker versions of your powers by bestowing a small portion of your energy from any pool they can channel."
1466,,400,Archmage ,MtG - Innistrad,Benevolence ,"Say it with me as we go. “Dear, Avacyn, protector of all,"" You are an archmage in the Church of Avacyn, a protector of the people, blessed with holy magics of the Avacynian Church, to protect the people. Empowered by Avacyn's blessing, archmages can bless areas to protect them, enhance their strength, and shield both themselves and others with magic. (Angels may draw from themselves instead of Avacyn, if you prefer they are also boosted in power from standard angel to the level of Bruna, Gisela and Sigarda)"
1467,,400,Clarity ,MtG - Innistrad,Benevolence ,"Even as the world goes mad around you, you remain a bastion of sanity. Not only that, but should you have the means... you will be aware of how best to use it, to return those around you to sanity as well. This could prove useful with certain events on the horizon."
1468,,400,Formula Breaker,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Benevolence ,"The trickery of the unnatural ruins the community and stability of what nature brings. Strength and ability should be what decides a conflict, not mere falsities and deceptions. But the illusions of tricksters shall not reach your mind, and the sorcereries of your enemies shall not reach your body, so long as you remain strong. Your body now resists magic and the more powerful your physicality, the more powerful the spell you can resist, though whether you choose to resist a spell depends on your own decisions. In addition, you can apply this effect to those things you apply force too. Perhaps a man whom you hate possesses an enchantment of invulnerability, with enough strength you can punch through the magic. Or alternatively you can strike down illusions and curses. Keep in mind though, this solely depends on the strength of your body, not what strength magic can grant you by enhancing your body."
1469,,400,Hero’s Journey,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Benevolence ,"Sometimes the selfless must venture out alone to save the many. In this case a great pilgrimage or quest can be undertaken. When upon one of these journeys you shall find yourself with uncanny fortune. Perhaps you will find a great mentor who can aid you in your journey and teach you the ways of the world. Or arrive at the scene of a great confrontation from which a sword drops from the sky which will serve you well in future engagements. While such circumstances seem unlikely, they will be quite common when working toward a goal to aid others. 

Do keep in mind however, that such luck is not limitless and it can be all too easy for you to die should you let your guard down in a critical moment. This fortune also won’t grace you if you are wandering randomly without goal or acting toward selfish gain."
1470,,400,HEALING HANDS ,Wolfwalkers,Benevolence ,"With a howl and a spectral paw forming around your hand, you can heal wounds. If you act quickly, you can even prevent someone from becoming a Wolfwalker after being bit."
1471,,400,Izayoi,BlazBlue: Phase Zero,Benevolence ,"Sealed Armament Izayoi. Weaving Zero Izayoi. Immortal Breaker Izayoi. A mass produced weapon that was created ages ago, many of them have since been destroyed. In truth, they were a prototype for what will eventually become known as the Murakumo. In its sealed form, the weapon takes the shape of a pike and a shield that looks like a book. When released, a suit of armor and a sword. In both forms, Izayoi is resistant to the power of the Observers and Bystander. Oddly enough, it also draws in waves from the electromagnetic spectrum, thus interfering with radio and whatnot. When released, the sword becomes an Immortal Breaker, capable of killing things that shouldn’t be able to die via forcing the concept of death into them."
1472,,400,Divine Ancestor,Campione,Benevolence ,"Born from those Gods that lost their divinity and Authorities, reincarnating as something more than human, but not quite Gods. Remnants of ancient power, but not to be taken lightly. This power is alike such occurrences, a fail-safe, if you must. Once per jump, upon your death, you may return yourself to life in a weakened form, with only a mere half your power available to you until the jump ends. Much like a Divine Ancestor, you won’t be much more than the shadow of who you were at your perk, although you could probably regain full power with some sacrifices…"
1473,,400,Disaster Purification,Campione,Benevolence ,"A rare and powerful gift, the ability to negate all mortal magic that come in contact with it, strong enough to even weaken Authorities to a degree. Even someone without training in using such a power can easily dispel weaker magics around. For you, however, the scenario changes having mastered this gift completely and with enough control to not let your own magic be negated. The go to gift for anyone who wants to act as an anti-mage."
1474,,400,Fate Fell Short,Campione,Benevolence ,"Given you broke its knees before the race even began after all. If destiny ever had a say in things then it shuts up and listen when it comes to you. The power of ‘fate’, ‘destiny’ and other bullshit has no say in your affairs. This is something that all Campiones share, being humans that killed Gods, but you take it to the next level in terms of sheer ‘fuck this’. Meaning that there’s nothing stopping you from breaking destiny and its rules as much as you feel like. This doesn’t make those tasks any easier, but they are not impossible anymore. Can be toggled if you ever feel like fate is actually helping you for once."
1475,,400,Bonding,Fate/Extella,Benevolence ,"Such precious things and far more tangible than most realise. In your mind’s eye, you see a
visualisation of the Bonds you have with everyone you know. A number represents the level of
affection, starting at zero for strangers and going up as you grow closer. You’re no more charismatic
than normal with this and while you could raise the bonds normally, just fighting alongside someone
is enough to slowly but surely raise your bond level regardless of other dislike that might go on
between the two of you.

As someone’s bond level rises, they don’t just become closer friends with you, but find the limits of
their power rising. Where the potential they had was once restrained, they now find themselves able
to grow stronger and in more ways than before. Sometimes they will even develop new powers
entirely, especially at very high Bond levels. Finally, you don’t find any issue in maintaining many
Bonds at once, somehow finding time for your many friends to each feel valued and special to you. Perhaps it could even help with more romantic bonds."
1476,,400,Umbral Blood,Fate/Extella,Benevolence ,"A gift from the Umbral Star, given quite strangely without expectation of service in return or even a visible sign of spiritron corruption. The particles of the Umbral Star in you have reinforced your being against fluctuations in time. If you had the ability to travel between timelines, it would prevent damage or destruction to you from doing so. But even outside of that, you become for the most part immune to changes in the timeline or other dangers such as paradoxes or being erased in the past. Should the past be changed, you become aware of that old and new timeline at once, and you gain a sense for when and where quantum timelocks will appear. Most useful of all, is that time inevitably gives you a chance to act against those that would use it against you, guaranteeing that your enemies travelling in time will not cement your defeat but give you at least a small chance at interfering with their aims. "
1477,,400,Conceptual Jankenpon,Fate/Extra CCC,Benevolence,"Conceptual abilities, that is, abilities that rely on ideas instead of physical forces, are quite common in this world. A side effect of such things is that interactions between offensive and defensive powers matter far more than the power behind them. And with this purchase, you may benefit from such things even without using conceptual abilities, for good and bad. Fire burns wood and is quenched by water just as easily as anything aligned with the sun defeats anything aligned with the moon.

1478,,400,Sunny Skin,Fate/Extra CCC,Benevolence,"The craftsmanship of the gods is in a whole different realm than that of mortals. This armor is a good example of such. Being formed out of light given shape rather than any actual material, it’s incredibly difficult to destroy, even to the gods themselves. It fuses to your body instead of being worn, acting more like a second skin whose only indication is most of your body being covered in black, and it shares the radiance of the sun itself. The armor itself doesn’t nullify or even fully block attacks like you may or may not expect from divine armor, but rather reduces all damage received externally to a tenth of what it would normally be. Lethal wounds would be reduced to scratches, and superficial damage becomes practically negligible. Of course, if someone manages to deal damage to you from within, the armor won’t help, because as potent as it is, it’s still fundamentally armor rather than a remarkable physique. Strangely, it seems that wearing this, for a given meaning of wearing, fully blocks you from being deleted, whether by the Moon Cell or any other being. This is normally a unique possession of the Hero of Charity, so how come you’ve obtained it?"
1479,,400,Mental Defence,Fate/Extra,Benevolence ,"You cannot attack that which was never there can you? Those that try to attack or influence
your mind will themselves limp and ineffectual as it slips out of their grasp again and again. Given a lot of time to
prepare, they might be able to affect you, but you'll mentally slide by anything less than a prolonged session with a
mind reader. There are some beings that simply cannot be avoided, but these beings are incredibly rare. "
1480,,400,Barrier Code,Fate/Extra,Benevolence ,"This grants you the power to create barriers of force in order to protect chosen locations. With a minute or so's
concentration, you may summon one of these barriers out of thin air. Each is strong enough to require a demolition
team to break it down, though you can put more energy into it to boost the toughness, to the point that even a
Servant might have difficult breaking through. While these barriers have no time limit, each one does take a small
amount of energy to remain active."
1481,,400,Born of Troy,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Benevolence ,"Heroes are the ones that go out and conquer the villains, right? To those that say the heroes are the ones that act, you only need to look towards Troy to see just what a hero with a defensive mindset can really do. So long as you’re on the defense, you’ll be doing a lot better than anyone could expect. Your combat-related abilities and skills heighten enormously provided you fight defensively, on a local level or when leading entire armies. You could lock an army ten times the size of your force and led by the greatest of divine heroes down for a decade without much issue should you bunker down in a strong fortress with a good army or, provided you’re a fair bit beyond the average man already, give a good fight to one of the demigod heroes that roam the land. It’s handy that you yourself are indeed beyond the average man. While your physical abilities may be sorely lacking compared to the usual demigod breed, your skills in combat are enough to give even the mighty Achilles pause even when on the offense. "
1482,,400,Pelt of the Divine Beast,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Benevolence ,"The skinned pelt of the Nemean Lion, a legendary beast that Heracles once strangled to death. The
pelt, either looking like a lion belt or as a simple black sash, delivers a potent protection to anyone
that wears it. It rejects human civilisation, making the wearer immune against all the tools that
humanity has made. Regardless of the power of or behind the tool, so long as you have the pelt
somewhere on your body, it cannot harm you. At most, you might feel a tickle or a light brush, regardless of the monstrously powerful weapons used against you. The pelt itself will never be
ripped or torn, though it provides no physical protection on it’s own. "
1483,,400,Akhilleus Kosmos,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Benevolence ,"The shield made for Achilles by the god Hephaestus. Engraved with a detailed depiction of the Greek
world, the shield, beyond being an effective indestructible object, is able to project a immensely
powerful bounded field in response to any attack. To oppose the shield is the same as making a
world your opponent, is what is said, and the bounded field acts as if all of Greece was between the
attacker and you when activated. Should an attack be incapable of piercing both through such a
magical dimensional construct and lack the power to tear through an entire country, it will fail to
reach you. However, not only does the shield’s bounded field cost energy to activate and maintain, it
will prove far less capable against any attack particularly capable against ‘worlds’ or dimensional
constructs like this."
1484,,400,Kavacha and Kundala,Fate/Legends - Nirvana Yuga,Benevolence ,"Weaved from the light of the gods, the armour that is bound to your form could rightly be called a
near-invincible protection. A tight suit of armor integrated into your body, it provides unmatched
protection against any threat, whether physical or conceptual. All harm that comes to you from
outside of your body is reduced by ninety percent of it’s damage, turning major wounds into small
scratches and cuts. Many magical spells and powers will be reduced to useless sparks or negated
outright, such as the armor preventing you from being erased from reality by those that can warp
such things. But this protection does not apply inwardly, allowing any harm that originates from
inside your body to proceed unaffected, such as summoned spears piercing you from within. You can
take off the armor and even give it to others, the integration into your body able to be undone with
a thought. As well, when in the way physically, the armor can recede inside of your body to allow
you full access. Optionally, you may have a flamboyant cape of flowers appear behind you when the
armor is present on your skin."
1485,,400,Chakravartin,Fate/Legends - Nirvana Yuga,Benevolence ,"The great wheels of life and death, endlessly turning in the skies above. These two chakrams of light, one seven kilometers in diameter and the other seventy kilometers so, that hover in the sky above
you. The power of the Buddha, manifesting as a divine artillery platform that launches immensely
powerful arrows of light in a rain of fury against any enemy you have. This rain increases as any one
battle goes on, the Chakrams becoming more ornate and layered, until a maximum of seven rings
appear. Little can survive when every individual arrow unleashes enough force to strike down a
mountain and hundreds are unleashed each moment. Even the inner ring, with more accuracy than
power, can still seriously harm a powerful Indian warrior in a few shots. 

But offence is just one part of this treasure. It grants control over the cycle of life and death to the
owner, to an extent. Short of death, any wound can easily be healed by the wielder when the target
is within the radius of the chakrams. Those who would be unable to be saved can be prevented from
passing on, trapped in a state between death and life where they become vengeful apparitions. The
rings could even forcefully control these creatures to an extent. 

Were someone who was truly and fully enlightened to take ownership of this ring, they would find
much greater control over the cycle in this fashion and that the chakrams in turn would greatly
increase the control that they have in their governance of reality. A true Buddha could even alter the
size of the rings, without losing their power, and activate their final function of Amita Amitahba, forcing those within the centre of the rings to reach Enlightenment/Annihilation in almost all cases. "
1486,,400,Heavenly Scorn,Fate/Legends - Nirvana Yuga,Benevolence ,"Those who are left to support the household are far from helpless. It is not for nothing that arts like Kalaripayattu trained both men and women in it’s style and the wrath of a mother whose child is in danger is legendary. Your nature is the same now, when those you love are in danger. In those situations, you’ll find that your powers grow greater and greater the worse that danger is, provided you’re close enough to act in their defence at all. It’s a noticeable boost, perhaps even enough to double your normal strength if their lives are at risk, but you can force this further with the sacrifice of parts of yourself. The more valuable the part you permanently burn off, the greater the boost. Some of your blood might only be a brief but notable burst while a limb could result in several times as much strength for hours until every enemy has been beaten down. Something as integral and vital as your very divinity could bring you to the strength of the greatest of gods for a time, as Parvati herself once showed in her rage. The permanent nature of this sacrifice means that you will be unable to heal it on your own and that even others with enough power to match you will find it a far more difficult task, though not impossible. 

In a less dire method, you can instead heal the wounds and fatigue of other people by letting them partake of your body. These are temporary wounds, such as letting someone supp at your bodily fluids like blood, or a bite of your flesh. Even a few drops of blood would heal most mortal wounds and a slice of flesh could undo even crippling wounds to the entire body and unholy curses. These wounds will never kill you when given for the purpose of this ability, within reason, and slowly heal over a day or two."
1487,,400,Heroic Power        ,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Benevolence ,"While some endowed with great strength give off a brutal atmosphere, others are more in line with great protectors of the people. Your noble heart shines through your body, with bulging muscles and power to match any berserking beast. Your natural strength could smash great boats in two and is exceptionally useful for your new style of fighting, the use of the noble bow. Even with a crudely made bow, your strength greatly magnifies the power of your shots without damaging the flimsy tool in your hands. You’ve got enough skill to make distant shots on stormy seas in the midst of naval battles as well and your arrows have a peculiar ability to pin down enemies, piercing bone and rock beneath it while remaining far more difficult to remove than should be possible. 

Your physical strength has also drawn a bright and vital aura around your being, making others feel warm and healthy when in your presence. It’s easy to make friends with this and that aura will grow as your physical strength does, potentially even letting you show terrible monsters the path to friendship and heroism."
1488,,400,Knowledge of the Sowa,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Benevolence ,"The layman is as far from comprehending your movements as our world is from the sun. Achieving
harmony with your blade has pushed it beyond the boundaries of what the human mind can easily
understand, leaving opponents unable to read your attacks or intent when fighting with a sword. Every attack is unforeseen, a surprise manoeuvre not encountered by you before no matter the
experience they have with you. Enemies must rely on raw reactions, skill and instinct to fight you as
understanding the combat techniques you use remains impossible. With normal attacks, it is
possible for someone to actively keep in their mind what your style is and consciously counter it but
this prevents them relying on instinct. To any special techniques you possess, they cannot even do
this and each one will be completely unexpected. These effects can be used even with weapons
other than the sword.

This harmony you have reached has also given you a heart that could be described as a perfectly still
pool of clear water. Your focus in battle is legendary, unwavering in the face of fear and able to
patiently wait in a ready stance for days on end. Even magical interference on your mind slides off, unable to taint the clear water."
1489,,400,Protection of Andraste,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Benevolence ,"Who could lose when they have the favour of their goddess at their backs? As much as your enemy
may claim to be favoured by their own false gods, you’ll both become well aware of who truly
benefits, as divine power surges through the bodies of you and your men. Blessed by Victory itself, you and armies you lead gain great benefits when in battle. All parameters, physical and magical, are
raised noticeably once the battle is adjoined. This is strongest with yourself, your followers receiving
a smaller portion of the benefit. At a normal level, it would unbalance an equal fight but not so much
as to make it impossible for your enemy to win. When fighting a defensive battle, this boost
improves greatly. A battle of equals becomes a battle between elite soldiers and seemingly green
troops, terrified of their first fight. You and those who follow you gain reinforced willpower and
unnatural vitality, withstanding terrible wounds yet continuing to fight. All the ingredients needed to
turn a wild horde of tribesmen into a force that can crush even a Roman legion in battle. "
1490,,400,Chariot of Boudica,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Benevolence ,"Once ridden by a celtic queen in defence of her people, the chariot and white horses before you
haven’t rusted or aged a day. What the chariot embodies isn’t the crushing charge of the cavalry but
Boudica’s actions to defend her nation, leaving the chariot itself a bastion of defence. Both the
horses and the chariot structure can easily shrug off even heavy artillery fire, protecting any riders
from the impacts. It can also transfer much of this protection to those fighting alongside the chariot rider, spreading a potent defensive buff across the user’s followers, even to the scale of an entire
army. Not quite as strong as the chariot’s original defence but more than enough to give skin that
feels like steel for a time. At a shorter notice and range, you can also summon the wheels of the
chariot to give this defensive buff to yourself and closely placed allies."
1491,,400,Saint of the Shield,Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Benevolence ,"Faith alone cannot protect someone from all the evils that are present in this world. Believing that
you cannot be harmed because you are faithful is just arrogance dressed in religious finery. But
believing that there are heroes who can stand up to those evils? Perhaps even faith that you could
protect others from them? That’s some true power. You have become a nigh-invulnerable fortress. Your body is now hundreds of times tougher than it would normally be, such that a normal human
would be impervious to anything short of a powerful wizard or magical warrior. Your resistance to
the foul sorcery of witches and dark beings is now such that only the Grandest wizards will be able to
affect you. Even should you be harmed, your body can continue on through any battle.

Even starving, exhausted from a week of battle, with your skull split open by an axe and your body
barely holding itself together with mere threads of flesh and bone- you would not break nor bow nor
cease to fight at your fullest capability. There is yet work to do in the name of good and if you fell
here, there’d be one less hero to save those in need."
1492,,400,Child of the Stars,Fate/Legends - Strange New World,Benevolence ,"It is only unnatural that you are who you are. An outsider to any world you go to. Apparently, some
other beings in this world can sympathise. You’ve found yourself beloved by the eldritch beings that
hail from outside reality, the gribbly things in the cracks of space-time and the monstrous gods that
do not exist yet continue to act. This is to the point that lesser such beings and creatures of the
mythos often act as loyal and quite cuddly pets to you while the senior ones, such as the Old Ones or
other higher beings, usually dote on you as older siblings or parents might, protecting you when they
notice you in danger or leaving little helping gifts in your path. Those you specifically anger, while
difficult to do so, will ignore this mostly and they, unless you befriend them more, usually do not
make extreme efforts for you without reason. Of course, while this affection can bring great boons,
it can also bring great danger. The minds of these beings are often strange even in regards to the
weak creatures, much less the ancient and unknowable outer beings, so their gifts may seem more
like threats or danger, though rarely would it be without a silver lining."
1493,,400,Prophecy of Divine Return,Fate/Legends - Strange New World,Benevolence ,"Gods are rarely slain in legends. Least of all by mere mortal beings. Even when a god is laid low, the
common myth is that their return to greatness is prophesised, for good or ill. Your return to
greatness is similarly fated, at least in part, for whenever you are diminished, you find yourself
eventually returning to power. Should you be weakened, harmed, crippled or even killed, you will
find yourself provided with at least one chance to return to your state before the act was done to
you. Provided you can take that chance that clearly provides itself to you and are not interrupted. You may be fated to return but that fate can be broken and if such is done, it cannot be used again
for the same thing. Should someone re-harm a supernaturally crippled arm of yours before you can
use this chance to heal it, this power will not provide another chance for you. This power does
however, work on more than just physical injuries. Losing wealth, social positions, material objects
or even loved ones can all be affected. While you are in the chain, should you fail to return from
death by succesfully grasping the chance presented to you, it will count as a final death unless you
possess something else to mitigate death once more."
1494,,400,Grain Fed,Angel Notes,Benevolence ,"A Rays absorb the grain in the air to power their supernatural bodies, granting them abilities and raw
strength to outmatch anything the modern world could have mustered. You’ve gone beyond that
and learnt how to take in almost any material or energy in the surrounding air towards your body
and convert it to power. It won’t work on things used as attacks against you but you can draw
energy or charged material, such as Grain or magical energy, into your body and convert it to either
more magical energy for yourself to use or into a direct boost to your physical abilities that lasts a
short time. Depending on how dangerous what you’re taking in is, it may still harm you, so be careful
to not take in anything too innately dangerous without toughening up first."
1495,,400,Fairy Blessed,Fate/Legends - Garden of Avalon,Benevolence ,"It’s a rare man that gets the attention of the Fae and even rarer for that attention to be as positive
as what you receive. From your handsome face to your caring heart to just a smell about you, fairies
of all different kinds find that they can’t help but adore you and being around you. Not only are they
almost never violent with you without serious provocation but they are almost eager to become
friends with you and help you out. They can make for powerful allies and unlike most people, are
quite helpful with you if you should attempt to navigate their byzantine rules and tricks. One might
even say their pranks truly are good natured with you, rather then the sadistic tricks they do to
others. Past this fairy love, you have also received a blessing of great luck from the fae race, one that
applies in battle alone. This luck blessing is quite powerful, allowing you to defeat foes you should
normally struggle greatly against with relative easy for most of the time. It is fickle, a fairy blessing is
given by fairies after all, but by relying on your own skills as well, you can find yourself scything
through entire ranks of the enemy like a flash."
1496,,400,Avalon,Fate/Legends - Garden of Avalon,Benevolence ,"The legendary sheath of Excalibur, a copy of which now rests at your hip, though no one finds it
strange that it does so. This sheath is an incredibly valuable artefact, as it bestows powerful
regenerative abilities on you while at your side, allowing you to heal from almost any wound in
minutes at most. Even if most of your body was vaporised, as long as your brain and a fair amount of
the flesh and bone connected to it remained, you could restore yourself to normal in five minutes of
healing. Avalon cannot heal brain wounds and you will die if it is destroyed, though the item also
struggles to handle cursed wounds. Though it drains your energy, you can also activate the special
power of the sheath, which will place you in the world of Avalon while you maintain it. While here, it
is almost impossible to reach you and even dimension crossing effects will only work from insanely
powerful users. Effectively, it lets you dodge away out of almost any effect in an instant. Notably, Avalon as a sheath will resize to fit any sword you wish to put into it."
1497,,400,Witch Hunter ,Lord El-Melloi Case Files,Benevolence ,"You’ve got superb mystical senses, and can almost always sniff out
hidden magic and the purpose thereof, as well as a high resistance to any sort of
influence that hopes to throw you off the trail, all three of which grant you a serious edge
when it comes to investigation. You’re also trained in both the mundane and mystical
arts of tracking and discretely tailing suspects."
1498,,400,Mysterious,Lord El-Melloi Case Files,Benevolence ," Your soul is a self-updating Record of Mystery, akin to a Servant,
making whatever supernatural powers you use accepted by the World and similar as
possible if not as natural, and neither the decline or dilution of Mystery or the
degradation of your Thaumaturgic Foundation will ever weaken or destabilize your
magecraft or magic, true or otherwise, though again like a Servant you can still benefit
from spreading and deepening your Foundation or increasing the levels of Mystery, as
they can still bolster your abilities. Furthermore, all your supernatural abilities, even
those from other worlds, retain their normal potency no matter where you go, regardless
of how sensitive they normally are to changes in location, even in other eras, areas,
dimensions, or worlds where they shouldn’t function, even if you were to travel to a dead
World or voyage outside the Earth’s influence and Texture altogether - as long as you can
provide all the other normal requirements (like magical energy) and overcome anything
actively trying to stop you, your magical and supernatural abilities will work anywhere. They may not work exactly the same - mind the local ley lines, for instance - but they’ll
work, unless they’re completely removed from the local context, like traveling to alternate
dimensions where none exist. Beyond that, you also don’t need to worry about them
ceasing to operate because of changes or damage to the underlying system."
1499,,400,Beyond Bane,Tsukihime,Benevolence,"Why is there always a trade-off to perfection? A Dead Apostle is at the mercy of their hunger for blood and the light of the sun, and it takes so long to finally overcome these weaknesses...or maybe you’re just a lucky one who skipped a step or three? The weaknesses of your race apply to you, but only just. A vampire is merely weakened in the sun instead of made into a rotting pile in minutes, your thirst and need for blood can be satisfied with a gulp instead of gallons, a werewolf would only be irritated by silver, and a demon could even manage to wield holy weapons in their own malefic hands."
1500,,400,Synchronizer ,Tsukihime,Benevolence,"I’d be careful about who you shared this ability with,friend. Your body has a unique quality - bodily fluids such as blood, saliva, sweat, and...other things have healing properties. Someone ingesting or making contact with it will quickly find their wounds healed, both physical and mental - it could bring someone reduced to maddening,gibbering insanity back into clarity so long as the source of said madness didn’t return.Unusually for this ability, it works both ways - your body will quickly heal wounds and restore itself upon being damaged - not enough to grow fresh limbs back or reverse death, but cuts vanish in minutes and vital organs are brought back to full functionality after a few days of rest.Your mind likewise repairs itself, madness and mental trauma slowly fading away as clarity is restored, able to lift you from catatonia back into almost perfect mental health after a peaceful day.
"
1501,,400,Keys of Providence ,Tsukihime,Benevolence,"The Holy Church is going to be wondering how you’re nicking all of their favorite toys, you know. An artifact that can turn monsters that were once human back into humans, as if the corruption of their body never happened. Curiously, unlike the originals,neither of you need to be Catholic in order to use these to their full potential. Wipe away the curse of the undead and the damned with your own two hands.
"
1502,,400,Ritual Maker ,Cultist Simulator,Benevolence,"Hard work pays off, and you, jumper, have spent quite some time studying the occult. With this power you can now create rituals through which others may temporarily access your perks or powers. These rituals can involve anything from chants, to performances, to tools, or even reagents, and if you’ve purchased the Rites of Initiation, you may even require one or more Principles from this world to be invoked using influences or affinity. All rituals must require at least 10 minutes to prepare and cast, but you can otherwise set the terms and conditions freely. Know that after imbuing any power into a ritual, that specific power will be much weaker for a few days, and unless the ritual has stringent conditions, anyone with the appropriate knowledge may use it.
"
1503,,400,Kingskin Bodhran ,Cultist Simulator,Benevolence,"An irish style drum fashioned out of the leftover skin of an Hour. The sounds of this drum force the hearts around them to beat to the rhythm, even if death wishes otherwise.
"
1504,,400,Watchman’s Glass ,Cultist Simulator,Benevolence,"An ancient glass of polished silver anthracite. This unbreakable shield can be used to reflect the most radiant light, and even supernatural attacks will bounce off its surface.
"
1505,,400,Survivor’s Armor ,Sonny,Benevolence,"It’s easy to forget that some parts of this world are stuck in less-than-modern times, given the power armor, guns, helicopters, cars... but yes, they are, and this armor is proof of how they stay relevant in spite of that. This barbuta (look it up) and jointless plate-mail combined with thick cloth is fascinating. It provides minor increases to your vitality and speed, yes, but that’s not the primary function of this set. What is the primary function is just how durable it is, going as far as to bounce off tank shells, and it’s massive resistance to blunt damage means that unless the cannon is really powerful or hits between the plates, you probably aren’t going to feel that tank shell either. Lastly it has the unique property of resisting earth magic, letting you fight against mages that command the ground beneath you on even footing.
"
1506,,400,Paladin’s Set ,Sonny,Benevolence,"Following in the footsteps of Galiant the Paladin, I see? Well anyways, this set of silver and blue ZPCI armor provides minor boosts to all physical and magical stats, enough to be somewhat noticeable, as well as being as durable as you would expect top-notch ZPCI handiwork to be. This on top of the minor lightning element added onto your attacks. But oddly enough, that’s not the selling point. This armor adds to your blade or other such an incredibly potent poison, strong enough to kill an ordinary man in a few minutes if he doesn’t get immediate treatment. Hardier people can resist this poison, but you’ll be the bane of anyone else with this. Weird, right? You wouldn’t expect that from a Paladin’s armor set, which I suppose is another selling point if you’re the sneakier type of person.
"
1507,,400,"Ahahaha,​ ​Nope!​ ​",Sailor Moon,Benevolence,"You are quite aware of the flow of magic and energy in your body and how it’s functioning. If something was messing with that flow, you’d know instantly. This awareness also enables you to attempt to shut off any attempts to magically drain you, and to become aware of said attempt to steal it. Magic items trying to steal your energy, whether mana or general life energy, can be shut off under this perk.
"
1508,,400,Power​ ​Granting​ ​Deal​ ​,Sailor Moon,Benevolence,"You may grant a portion of your power and some of your powers to up to eight willing people at the same time, if you wish. This power is connected to you, and you may take it back any time you wish. However, your power will decrease the more power you give someone. You may also share your powers or other forms with people, but until you take them back you will lack the power you gave. You may, for example, give someone your fire powers or part of your vast wells of magical power or give your excess energy to someone to empower them.
"
1509,,400,Fountain of Youth - Boosted,DC Occult,Benevolence,"​A fountain appears in your warehouse, filled with sparkling crystal water that is always pleasantly cool. Anyone submerged in the pool will cease to age, be regressed to their physical prime (if past it), and be granted the ability to understand and speak to any creature in its native language, be it man, beast, or magical entity. Any non-sapient living being will cease to age, be regressed to their prime (if past it), and also be granted human-level intelligence as well as the ability to speak. For another 200 CP (before discounts), it will also act similarly to a Lazarus pit, allowing it to even go so far as to revive the dead.
"
1510,,400,Crystal​ ​Immersion​ ​,Sailor Moon,Benevolence,"You have a blessing of the crystal-based magical technology of the Silver Millennium. Your body possesses a special protection spell that cannot be dispersed easily. When you are near death, your body will become encased in a diamond-hard crystal and you will enter a deep sleep. Within this sleep, your body will slowly heal or suspend itself if the wound is impossible to heal from. This crystal, however, can be shattered with enough force, and your body can still be killed. People may use magic to heal you through this crystal.
"
1511,,400,Orgel​ ,Sailor Moon,Benevolence,"A star-shaped locket that doubles as a music box and can reawaken a person's true memories and will. While it carries a familiar tune that can help weaken someone’s hold on a person if they’re brainwashed, to truly banish the effects of the brainwashing or mind control they must physically touch it.
"
1512,,400,Ragman Suit ,DC Occult,Benevolence,"​A dark green cloak set over a skin-tight suit patchwork cloth in a plethora of colors and shapes. Well, it appears to be cloth; in truth, it is made of corrupted souls captured by the wearer. The suit was made long ago as a source of mercy and an alternative to burning in Hell for the souls captured by the wearer. The souls can aid the wearer, granting them strength and taking damage in their place. In doing so, they eventually pay their penance and are allowed entry into Paradise for their services. The more a soul helps, the faster they earn their freedom and they all know this, so most are willing to do what it takes – or they eventually come around to be willing, in any case.

The Suit already contains a few dozen souls that are willing to work for their redemption, which is enough to amplify your abilities well into the superhuman range when drawing on them, but you will need to capture more and continue to do so to retain and increase the suit’s power. Needless to say, this only works on the souls of the wicked. You also have absolute telekinetic control over the cloak, which is supernaturally strong and can stretch and contort, while wearing the suit.
"
1513,,400,Mental Fortress ,Libriomancer,Benevolence,"You have a very special tattoo on your left temple. This particular mark shields you from all forms of magical, psychic or supernatural means of detecting or tampering with your emotions and thoughts. It also makes you immune to possession or any means of divining or changing your thoughts or actions by any means other than mundane ones.
"
1514,,400,No Trap Can Hold Me ,Justice League Dark,Benevolence,"Well, not for long in any case. No situation is utterly hopeless for you, no prison inescapable, no magic too binding. Every minute your enemies leave you alive, torturing or gloating, is a gamble, and not one likely to pay off. This doesn’t simply apply to physical prisons: trapped in another dimension or adrift at the end of time, there is always a way out and you will always be capable of finding it. Escape is simply a matter of when, not if.
"
1515,,400,The Curse of Immortality ,Justice League Dark,Benevolence,"Well, a curse from the perspective of some. Your opinion may differ on the subject. Whether due to your nature as something inhuman or the effects of some strange magic upon you, you have been rendered ageless and immune to mortal disease. Your natural lifespan is effectively infinite. If you aren't killed, you'll walk to the end of time without a wrinkle in your skin or a single grey hair upon your head and you'll never so much as catch a cold for as long and you live.
"
1516,,400,Penitent’s Blade​ ,A Practical Guide to Evil,Benevolence,"A feather of an angel of contrition, this blade will cut through nearly anything. Further, if stabbed into a stone and used in a ritual you know which takes 49 hours, it will call down an angel of contrition upon Creation, who will then strike the minds of everyone within 49 miles with their every sin. No mortal in history without a Name has been able to experience this and not turn toward Good, driven into a mad desire to make up for every Evil, no matter how small, that they have ever committed, and forming the tip of the spear of a new Crusade. If you wish, you may bind this feather to a weapon you already own, adding these abilities to that weapon.
"
1517,,400,Warded Titan ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Benevolence,"The bones that make up your body were individually inscribed with powerful runes and symbols to ward off magic, evil and corruption. Your body is a gigantic bastion of defence. Only the strongest of wizards could get past your defences, only a powerful Daemon could corrupt you past your purity wards and even the vile powers of the more unclean forms of undead will fail to find purchase on your body, so long as the wards hold out against them. These protections even extend to whatever you are touching, the runes scrawling over to protect allies or weapons in contact with you, though they can only stretch so far.
"
1518,,400,Fountain of Youth - Boosted,Warhammer Fantasy: Amazons,Benevolence,"The secret to the long lives and good health of the Amazons, even when they have lived for centuries, is the Elixir of Life. The waters of the pools from which the Elixir is made heal all injuries in just moments, cure any disease and cleanse the body of all corruptions. It will even bring the drinker back to their prime age, allowing them to live for many years longer after just a single drink while retaining their full physical and mental peak. Most of the older and more accomplished Amazons are allowed to drink from a pool in order to retain their experience but you have access to a pool all to yourself. The pool contains enough water to allow for one thousand cups to be taken from it, each cup able to fully heal and return to their prime the drinker. The waters of this pool will slowly refill themselves, taking a month to go from empty to full. The pool will be either in an isolated, difficult for any but you to find the place or be attached to a property of your choice.
"
1519,,400,The Dark Mail ,Warhammer Fantasy: Beastmen,Benevolence,"A suit of chainmail with no recognized origin or creator, the only thing known is by the eight-pointed star of Chaos on its chest, whoever made it must have been one under the Dark Powers. While worn, the chains have a peculiar ability - for while other forms of armor may attempt to resist all magics, this chainmail has been specialized to counter weapons that have been enchanted or magically enhanced in some fashion. Sometimes, a relic such as those may simply strike the chainmail - only to discover that while it connected, contact with the dark chains rendered it a mundane lump of metal, wood, and stone. Other times, the reaction will shatter the enchanted blade or maul in the opponent’s hands. Even if an enchanted weapon is of such legendary status that it may be able to resist the Dark Mail’s influence on the first or second strike - such as The Sword of Couronne or Ghal-Maraz - continuously beating the weapon against your Chaos-forged garb may see it eventually fall victim.
"
1520,,400,Skull of the Unicorn Lord ,Warhammer Fantasy: Beastmen,Benevolence,"Atop your scalp or hanging from your belt is a skull - a relic of one of your greatest conquests, a lord of unicorns that you tore limb from limb. Its beautiful horn still glimmers, even through the filth and the depravity you engage in, and this horn holds power. So long as the unicorn’s skull is on your body, offensive magicks and curses wash off of you like mud in the rain, a fireball only lightly singing your fur whilst an Amber Spear would glance off your skin - if the amber wizard’s lucky, grazing you with a light slice. Be warned, however - unicorns are friends to all creatures aligned with nature and light, and should they see this skull... Actually, I’m sure you’re already looking forward to making hateful enemies.
"
1521,,400,Sacred Site ,Warhammer Fantasy: Beastmen,Benevolence,"The tomb of a Chaos Champion, a shrine to the Four Powers, or something of similar significance that you can determine at will. Regardless, this was the place you protected, where you were stationed and the Gods deemed you worthy. Besides being a site of religious importance and a magnet for treasure-hunting prey, there is one other... strange quality.

In, under, and around this sacred place is a deposit of Warpstone - that solidified piece of Chaos that rocketed out from the collapsing Warp Gates so many years ago. That meteorite crashed here, and years later, this place was built either into or on top of it. Warpstone is a death sentence for most of the mortal races, but you - the site’s guardian - react... differently to the Warpstone. Its mutative radiation touches you differently, instead mending wounds you receive and gifting you a growing resistance to magic. After the events of this jump, you may either attach this sacred location and its warpstone to one of your existing properties, or have it automatically slot itself into future worlds where it would make the most sense.
"
1522,,400,Temperature of Love ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Benevolence,"Compared to the other races, it may seem like humans can’t do much, but don’t worry – this isn’t a world made up of just strong people, so listen to the love in your heart and find your real strength there. Love can burn like the sun, and drive out the worst of darkness. You can resist and snap out of mind control effects, whether magical, psionic, technological, or mundane, whenever someone you care about is in danger. Furthermore, by launching just a single physical attack on the source of the mind control, you can dispel all effects of said source on its victims. The perk also strengthens your willpower to endure incredible pain to defend your loved ones.
"
1523,,400,Mermaid Beads ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Benevolence,"A set of blue spheres linked into a bracelet. If you wear the charm and touch someone you are sincerely in love with, a miracle of love will take place. This is not simply a way of creating romantic scenarios, though – the bracelet also allows the wearer to perform miracles for the sake of his or her love, such as saving the lover from an incurable disease. However, the user’s love must be genuine to work. Furthermore, miracles can only do so much on their own; unless you show the courage to step forward, reveal your love, and take advantage of the opportunity, life will go on, and the potential for love will not endure past the miracle.
"
1524,,400,Swords Can Be Wings! ,Senki Zesshou Symphogear,Benevolence,"What are you talking about? These aren't swords! You're not a sword! These are wings! Through flat out denial of reality, you can force conceptual effects that target certain concepts to stop working. Through sheer force of will, you can stop techniques like an 'ultimate sword breaker' from working on 'swords', which you believe to be 'wings'. The ability to resist these concepts is linked directly to the strength of your willpower versus the strength of the effect, requiring exponentially more willpower the stronger the conceptual effect, and is useless against indiscriminate effects, or rather, effects that don't target a specific concept."
1525,,400,Everything Is Gonna Happy ,Generic MG,Benevolence,"There is no point at which things are so bad you can no longer fix them.

No one is too far gone for your redemption, though they must accept it.

No one is too dead for you to heal or resurrect, though you have to take the time to heal them all the way up.

No curse can resist your purification in the end.
"
1526,,400,Doctor of Miracles,Touhou Project: Parasol Paradise,Benevolence,"You will gain the skills of medical professionals across all fields whose raw skill is unrivaled by any ordinary doctor. You however, take things one step further by seamlessly incorporating magic into your medical procedures as well. No disease or ailment, mundane or supernatural, will overpower you or your patients. Your specialty however, lies in making drugs, potions and tonics of any kind, as well as the skills to replicate or create more for an unimaginably wide variety of uses. As one would expect, you are not able to make medicines that would require a physically impossible process in order to produce, nor can you make the medicine if you do not have the ingredients.
"
1527,,400,True To Myself ,Tsukihime,Benevolence,"It doesn’t matter what others think of you.The Clock Tower, your own family, or even sane and rational individuals who balk at youractions. All that matters is that you’re true to what you want to be and what you want to do. Nothing can make you betray your nature unwillingly - mind control, persuasion, and more simply cannot touch your personality and your decision-making process. Also, so long as you don't make the choice to betray what you see as your true nature or what you see as right,consequences for your decisions simply...roll off of you. Causing trouble and death in a city by trying to claim a familiar? Water under the bridge. Drastically shorten humanity's already-declining time on this Earth to save someone’s life? No one thinks to bring it up after the act. This won’t stop those you wrong or harm from personally retaliating, but the long-term consequences...far away in the future you won’t be present for, out of sight and out of mind.
"
1528,,400,Gromril Armour ,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Benevolence,"Call this Mithril to a dwarfs face and expect a fight. The methods of making Gromril itself are said to have been taught to the bearded folk by the White Dwarf himself, and the armour offers both incredible resilience, amazing lightness and ease of use, a not insignificant resistance to magic and perhaps best of all after a long, hard night of campaigning, it requires no maintenance.
"
1529,,400,Power of Belief ,Neverland: The RPG,Benevolence,"When someone attacks you with a weapon that is not magically enhanced or made of silver, the attacker must thoroughly believe in you to cause damage. If they have any doubts regarding you (thinking you’re an illusion, believing you and/or your race is imaginary, thinking they’re in a dream/nightmare, etc.), the weapon strike will not harm you. Attackers with weapons can still damage you if they have a sufficient Wisdom stat (or equivalent stat), basically requiring their Wisdom stat to take the place of their Strength/Dexterity in determining the success of the attack. Attacks that do not use weapons are unaffected by this perk.
"
1530,,400,Old as the Trees ,Neverland: The RPG,Benevolence,"The Elder Tylwyth Teg follow their own pace and do not let others dictate their speed or actions. In addition to gaining the patience to carefully think over challenges, you gain immunity to mind-altering magic and resistance to mind-altering effects in general.
"
1531,,400,Monstera Reflect ,Neverland: The RPG,Benevolence,"Like the tadpole forms of Monstera (tree frogs that flatten themselves to resemble leafs), any spells cast on you are reflected back at a target of your choice for double the spell’s original strength/power (please note that this reflecting does not cost you anything, since it’s just using the spell already cast by the original caster). In addition, like the adults, you can reflect ice and fire, but now fire and cold spells/attacks are reflected for 2.5 times the original power.
"
1532,,400,Treacle ,Wonderland No More,Benevolence,"A bottle of pure treacle from the Lake of Treacle, where the Not-So-Little Girls Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie live. Consuming the treacle will heal most mundane ailments (pretty much any normal ailment that is not immediately life-threatening); all such ailments qualifying will be healed together with the treacle. It also gives a temporary bonus to your vigor. Once empty, the bottle refills in a week.
"
1533,,400,Humpty Dumpty’s Potion ,Wonderland No More,Benevolence,"A rare potion that Humpty Dumpty painstakingly plotted to create in an attempt to make his fragile egg more impervious to damage. And this one actually works! While drinking the potion gives the user stomach cramps for several minutes at first as well as tightness in muscles/skin, the end result will be immunity to all normal physical damage to your body (or at least your outer parts). If consumed, you will get another bottle after one year’s worth of unbirthdays; however, drinking the potion again will not grant previous users any further enhancements.

At your liking, you can make it so that anyone who uses the potion without your permission will suffer the negative effects of the faulty potion from canon: although the stomach cramps will only last half a minute and the drinker will gain extra toughness/durability each combat round/minute, they’ll also get the unsettling feeling of skin and muscles tightening (and something more); after 9 combat rounds/minutes, the unauthorized user will turn completely to stone, and promptly die as their body cracks/crumbles to pieces.
"
1534,,400,The Panacea,Danmachi,Benevolence,"You gained three bottle of Panacea that can recover your mind from mind down to complete recover in an instant and heal all of your wounds except decapitation and lost limbs along with removing all abnormalities like poison, petrifaction, paralysis, charm, curse and etc. additional bottles of panacea would gained every month with the same amount allowing you to stock for emergency."
1535,,400,Ageless and Eternal,Danmachi,Benevolence,"As a god, you do not age and this will apply in your apparent age will not change at all allowing you to retain your eternal youth. In future jumps should you start as a child you can naturally age until you reach the prime of your race or de-age yourself older than the prime of your race. You can also choose age if you wish or age for a while, stop aging and begin again should you change your mind. This is also an absolute defense against any effect magical or otherwise, which would alter your age against your will."
1536,,400,Spawn of Order ,Warhammer Fantasy: Lizardmen,Benevolence,"Mutation and the ravages of Chaos are issues for the lesser races. Indeed there have been no recorded incidences of Lizardmen falling under the sway of Chaos as, while often savage, they have remained agents of Order. You find that any attempt to mutate or alter your body or mind against your will (magically or otherwise) is met with a cold-eyed stare and (if possible) the dismemberment of the offending party.
"
1537,,400,Tyrant Crown ,Warhammer Fantasy: Ogre Kingdoms,Benevolence,"A crown fit for any Tyrant, made in image of that of the Overtyrant Greasus Goldtooth’s own. Wearing this ogre sized crown increases the wearer’s intelligence, making humans into geniuses and Ogres able to match normal humans. It has many protective enchantments, giving the wearer a good defence against all kinds of magical effects directed against him and when worn and visible, will protect any nearby allies of the wearer from suffering from any sort of fear, uncertainty or madness.
"
1538,,400,Thiefstone ,Warhammer Fantasy: Ogre Kingdoms,Benevolence,"A mysterious little stone on a string, imbued with powers against magic and to find magic. Wearing the pendant grants a small amount of magical resistance to the wielder and increases the power of any existing magical resistances the wielder has. It also can detect magical items and draw them towards itself, a common practise being to wave it over corpses to collect any hidden magic trinkets the corpse may have had in life.
"
1539,,400,Shield of Warding ,Warhammer Fantasy: Orcs & Goblins,Benevolence,"This heavy steel slab of metal is meant to be held up as a shield, though few would be those among the human races would wield it as such. It has the power to scatter spells and deflect projectiles for entire units of an army, just over five hundred strong is how many can benefit from it’s blessing at any one time. The effect itself seems to have more than a four out of six chance of working when it involves projectiles and the magic resistance is strong enough to necessitate nigh doubling most spells to be effective.
"
1540,,400,Bonewood Staff ,Warhammer Fantasy: Orcs & Goblins,Benevolence,"A staff composed completely of one solid bone of unknown origins, bearing many glowing green glyphs. Wielding this staff in battle is easily as effective as walking in with a massive cudgel or a fine longsword, and besides the effectiveness as a hand weapon it makes the user's difficult to harm or hinder using magic. This Magic Resistance is potent enough to completely diffuse spells about half the time and allows him to use magic with greater ease, easily channeling the energies of the magic safely.
"
1541,,400,The Land Provides ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Benevolence,"The primary duty of the Jade Order is the maintenance of the Empire’s farmland. A fine film of Warpstone dust blows in and corrupts the soil thanks to the air currents of the world, and Ghyran is wielded so as to fight that influence. You are especially adept at this, with your spells mending weakened crops and fallow soil as if you were twice the mage you otherwise are. Famine is a myth, once you arrive. With enough effort, even the ruined soil of Sylvania might one day bloom again.
"
1542,,400,Protection from Corruption​ ,The Gods Are Bastards,Benevolence,"You’re protected from the corruptive effects of your own magic, as long as it’s used in moderation, and will receive a mental warning when you begin to cross the line. This should prove rather useful if you’re so foolish as to call upon the infernal, as ordinarily, your own magic could take your life before you even realized you’d hit the limit.
"
1543,,400,The Best Part of Waking Up ,Warhammer Fantasy: Skaven,Benevolence,"... IS SNORTING WARPSTONE DUUUUST! You think I joke-squeak, but it’s actually quite the habit among Grey Seers. It does so much for them, too: A quick and dirty boost-growth to their magical potency, an influx of energy to keep them awake, numbs the pain of any wounds they may have received... And-and if we’re being honest, they’re just plain addicted. Of course, snorting the raw solidified essence of the Warp and Chaos-stuff is not without its dangers, as some mutated and insane priests can quite readily attest to.

You have the benefits of such a warpstone addiction, without the nastier side effects - and such a benefit applies to any other drug, ingested concoction, or edible in the skaven larder or chemical laboratory. At most, sniffing up a line of warpstone dust will make your eyes bulge out momentarily, or make you have the suspicion that your whiskers are plotting violent betrayal. Any other drug or similar object will drastically maximize the benefits over the disadvantages, at the same time ensuring you won’t suffer pesky issues such as “overdose” or “brain overload.”
"
1544,,400,Warpstone Armor ,Warhammer Fantasy: Skaven,Benevolence,"Also called ‘The Warp-Shard Plate,’ a suit of plate armor crafted for the most skilled and renowned Stormvermin - of which Queek Headtaker stands as one of them. Meteoric iron melted down with warpstone shards, with a Grey Seer looking over the forging as he chants the hymns of the Horned One, and carving runes to draw their god’s evil influence about the wearer. The rats who bear such a suit of armor are nigh-destined for greatness.

One such suit has been crafted to your specifications - a perfect fit. A rare example of above-average craftsmanship in skavendom, your suit of warpstone armour is a beacon of evil power. Not only good at defending against even gromril weaponry of the dwarves, every blow struck against it causes the malign power of The Great Horned Rat to explode back at the foe who dared strike at you.
"
1545,,400,There is... Another Way ,Endless Legend,Benevolence,"The energy within Dust sustains you, not Dust itself. This energy can be found elsewhere. In the living. By taking this, you become a spiritual vampire, able to suck the very soul from creatures to sustain your body. Any wounds you inflict on your foes will restore a sliver of your health, while slaying your foe will restore a portion of your health. The stronger the foe, the more it will restore. Let the slaughter begin.
"
1546,,400,The Collar of Khorne ,Warhammer Fantasy: Warriors of Chaos,Benevolence,"This spiked collar is worn only by the greatest champions of Khorne and his many Daemons. Khorne’s immense hatred of magic is reflected in this collar, which protects the wearer against ANY spells that aren’t impressively strong or are casted by a weak-willed mage. This is not complete immunity, but you may stride much more confidently into battle knowing that underhanded tricks are of no concern. Normally, these collars are impossible to remove, but this one is able to be unclasped and removed if you desire.
"
1547,,400,Stable Casting ,Warhammer Fantasy: High Elves,Benevolence,"A pitfall of magic, at the very least the magic of this world, is the ever present possibility of ‘miscasts.’ Should the spell slip from your control you might just drop that Fireball on top of your head instead of your enemies. This Perk is a blanket protection against such harmful slips of yours. Should a spell of yours be primed to blow up in your face, the magic will ‘flow away’ instead of exploding.
"
1548,,400,It Stares Back​ ,Mage: The Awakening(1st Edition),Benevolence,"Unfortunately, you have been seen by the abyss. You can feel it watching you, even more so than most Mages. But this awareness of being watched is not without benefit. You gain a sixth sense related to abyssal spirits, able to tell where they are as well as whether or not they are aware of you. You also gain a sufficient understanding of what could cause a paradox in this world, and can sense when the eyes of sleepers (normal people) are upon you. You are much less likely to invoke a paradox and can more easily recover from the damaging effects of your own spells. In this and future worlds, your magic is much less likely to fail and result in a catastrophic backlash or be disrupted by outside influences.
"
1549,,400,Defensive Magic ​,Mage: The Awakening(1st Edition),Benevolence,"All of the Arcana possess at least one defensive spell meant to protect the caster from outside forces. At the start of each day you may select one Arcana that you can cast spells in. You are now able to cast and maintain the defensive spell of that Arcana constantly throughout the day at no loss of mana to yourself. This defensive spell is much harder for other mages to dispel, but may still be broken by overwhelming force, or bypassed by the objects/entities that it does not protect against (i.e. the mind defensive spell only defends against sentient beings that are intentionally trying to harm you, while the fortune defensive spell only protects you against things that could be avoided through sheer luck).
"
1550,,400,No Strings on Me ​,Mage: The Awakening(1st Edition),Benevolence,"Your will seems to be your own. At least mystically speaking. To date, there does not seem to be a spell or oath that can actually make you do anything that you yourself do not want to do (not that they don’t exist, just that they have yet to be discovered). You are immune to nearly all mystical compulsions that would affect your mind, and even signing an oath and swearing in blood would not bind you unless you desired it. You will not however gain the benefits of magical contracts unless you do choose to submit.
"
1551,,400,Coin of the Jester King​ ,Mage: The Awakening(1st Edition),Benevolence,"This golden coin bears the face of a king wearing a jester’s hat on one side, and a pair of crossed wands on the other. The bearer of the coin may concentrate with it, removing the minor effects of fate and coincidence that would work against them. Penalties such as unfavorable winds, rainfall or even a crooked dealer in a casino will not impede the bearers chances of victory when in use. (Note; it can only remove a single deleterious effect when concentrated upon, it cannot create benefit for the user)
"
1552,,400,Totem of Undying ,Generic Minecraft,Benevolence,"This dark artefact will save you from death once, if it is in your possession upon taking a fatal blow. Once taken, this artefact will break, healing you up to fill and will not return until 10 years has passed or the start of a new Jump, whichever comes first."
1553,,400,Sole Protector ,Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds,Benevolence,"“We had legends. We had heroes. Lorule had hope. But all that is gone. Lorule has only me now.”

When you are the sole defense of something, be it a person, organisation or object, to the point that your loss would result in the destruction or death of that which you are protecting, you’ll find yourself in a much better position to defend it. Your intellect, reflexes, strength and magical power all receive a significant boost for the duration of the ‘battle’ (which can instead refer to non-combat such as a court case) until you have triumphed against your enemies or lost all that you have been fighting for.
"
1554,,400,Pure of Heart ,Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past,Benevolence,"In truth, Link actually has two ‘spirit animals’ in the Dark World, the aforementioned rabbit and a wolf. It depends on which version of the story you’re being told you see. Regardless, in the version where Link was a wolf, he wasn’t nearly as affected by the miasma. Turns out being a kind and loving dude who’s major concern is saving the pretty lady because it’s the right thing to do doesn’t leave much room for corruption to latch onto. It’s not a perfect defense as Roam and Ghanti could tell you, but it’s more than anyone else has. By remaining clear minded and staying away from negative emotions - greed, for example - you can become immune to mind altering and transformative magics. Even when you fail to be wholly pure, you’re still extraordinarily resistant. Roam actually turned this to his advantage, turning into a birdman and gaining the power of flight at times. Just be careful not to ‘cheat’ like that too often lest you invite the miasma in to stay.
"
1555,,400,Ancient Bloodline ,Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past,Benevolence,"As strong as they are, the seals meant to lock Ganon away do have a weakness. Those who cast them. Or their children, as the case may be. You have the somewhat odd power of shoving your magical debts onto your children. A seal that lasts as long as you live can be transferred to your granddaughter, and she can transfer it to her child, so on and so forth. This does have the effect of vastly increasing the magical reserves and potential of any child you have, if only so that they can handle the threats this will inevitably draw towards them and that they might one day replace you as a sage. You don’t even have to teach them anything and they’d still manage to learn at least the basics - what might they do with an actual teacher?
"
1556,,400,Force Fairy ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventure,Benevolence,"Now I’m not entirely sure what separates a Force Fairy from an ordinary Fairy, but this particular one seems to have taken up residence inside a glass bottle and demanded you take her with you. In exchange for feeding her Force Gems by the hundreds if not thousands, she’s agreed to provide whatever assistance she can, mostly in the form of the famous healing talent that almost all Fairies are known for. Use her as much as you like, but be careful not to run out of Force Gems. You rather need those for something else. As a signing bonus of sorts, you’re also allowed a single healing for free which she will be giving to you in the form of a complete resurrection should you ever die, once per ten years. It’s not a great rate, but it might just save your life, quite literally.
"
1557,,400,Mirror Shield ,Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening,Benevolence,"Significantly better than the proverbial board. It’s actually an unusually light tower shield. The front bears your crest, if any, or others if you prefer. In any case, it’s polished to a mirror finish, and thanks to the magic protecting the shield, won’t smudge or fade. The real purpose of the shield (beyond normal shield stuff) is that it can block magic attacks. Spells that hit the shield won’t carry their effect onto you. Also surprisingly good at blocking fire.
"
1558,,400,Mirror Shield ,Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,Benevolence,"This shield’s polished surface can reflect both light and energy - the former could easily be used to blind enemies and manipulate the reflection for certain puzzles while the latter is ideal in overcoming the magical energies of mystic enemies. However, it should be noted that it doesn’t do as well against solid projectiles - it does well against its chosen enemies, who are dangerous. Just pack a spare shield.
"
1559,,400,Naryu’s Love ,Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,Benevolence,"A spell handed down by the goddess, this power allows you to surround yourself in a diamond shaped barrier. While you aren’t able to attack or cast spells in this state, you can rest assured as there are almost no attacks in this world that can harm you while Naryu’s Love is active.
"
1560,,400,Magic Potion ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages,Benevolence,"A magical potion either bought from Maple or stolen from Syrup, and yes that is a horrible pun. Regardless, this very expensive potion is actually somewhat amazing. On top of being able to fully heal the drinker AND cure just about every mundane disease, it also comes with a wonderful quirk. You see, the potion has the ability to basically teleport itself into your mouth should you become critically injured. Mind you, it won’t actually do anything if you get disintegrated or something, but as long as you’re reasonably intact it’ll heal you back up. Unfortunately, it’s pretty much impossible to get more than one of these.
"
1561,,400,It Just Appears...,Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap,Benevolence,"Kinstones, a simple stone disk that was broken in half which can be fused together to make those who do so happier. Fusing Kinstones creates really odd effects such as magic chests just appearing in the local area, Golden Enemies suddenly spawning, and secret doors opening where once there was no door at all. These are all things that can happen when you have a unity of Kinstones. Now not only do Kinstones, and the widespread collecting hobby, carry over to worlds that you are in, but their effects on the world do as well. You can find these spawned Chest, Enemies, and Secret Areas for a lot of the local loot.
"
1562,,400,Magic Armor ,Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker,Benevolence,"“You got the Magic Armor! Use your magic power to create a barrier around you that protects you from enemy attacks!”

A purple gem with some sort of orb inside of it, made in a far away land. When activated by feeding it a small amount of energy, it will transform into a purple aura that surrounds you. Incoming damage is more or less ignored in this state, though momentum is not. Also, it’s not your magic that takes the damage, it’s your wallet. Unfortunately, it only takes rupees. That’s not too much an issue though, since you can usually find a handful just by mowing the yard.
"
1563,,400,Magical Shield ,The Legend of Zelda,Benevolence,"An improvement from the shield given by the Old Man, this shield can easily reflect the magical attacks of both Ganon’s wizardly comrades and the Prince of Darkness himself.
"
1564,,400,Water of Life ,Legend of Zelda: The Adventure of Link,Benevolence,"A gift from a crone in your village, this Water is mystically enchanted to be a great healing boon. When you would otherwise die in battle(and only in battle, from your wounds), you will see that this bottle of water will empty out and restore 3 “Heart Containers” worth of vitality to you. This water is difficult to brew, however, it takes at least a full 3 years for this water to refill after use. What’s more, you’ll note that any other forms of damage may not heal quite as well as this simply restores your body. However, it will save your life.

"
1565,,400,Risk Free Botches ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Benevolence,"One of the risks of magic is that when it goes wrong, it tends to go disastrously wrong. However, even a sorcerer’s worst botch is not nearly as bad as an Awakened mage’s. You share this trait, regardless of what kind of magic you’re using. While you can still miscast a spell, the resulting disaster shall be more of an annoyance than a catastrophe.
"
1566,,400,Recovery ,The Elder Scrolls,Benevolence,"Wounds gained during battle can hamper your chances of victory, even minor ones. While you won't be visibly regenerating, you can heal from most minor wounds within hours, and fatal wounds will be completely fine after a week. This effect can be heavily boosted through the use of Restoration spells, and whatever scars don't disappear will always look aesthetically pleasing."
1567,,400,Standing Stones ,The Elder Scrolls,Benevolence,"Thirteen runic stones found within the icy tundras of Skyrim, now inhabiting your Warehouse. They were made in the fashion of the thirteen major constellations within the sky, and are able to grant power to those who attune to them. Each stone grants a unique ability based on the constellation, but each person can only be attuned to a single Standing Stone at a time."
1568,,400,Ring of Perfection ,The Elder Scrolls,Benevolence,"This gold enchanted ring is incredibly rare and sought after, as it will enhance everything about a person. Whosoever wears this ring will find themselves stronger, faster, smarter, and luckier than before."
1569,,400,Ring of Phynaster ,The Elder Scrolls,Benevolence,"This ruby ring is said to have been created by the Hero-God of the Altmer, Phynaster. It offers the wearer potent protection from poison, shock, and magical damage. Additionally, it extends the wearer's lifespan indefinitely so long as it is being worn."
1570,,400,Spellbreaker ,The Elder Scrolls,Benevolence,"The Daedric Artifact of Peryite, Daedric Prince of Pestilence, is said to still be searching for its original owner, and will not remain the property of any one else for long, though that is not the case should you purchase it here. This dwarven-made shield not only protects its wielder from physical damage, but also from magical attacks, by negating any and all spells directed towards it."
1571,,400,Heart Locket ,Undertale,Benevolence,"This simple, red, heart-shaped locket may look unassuming, but it's actually an extremely useful piece of protection. Not only does this locket boost your defenses against magic of all kinds, it strengthens the defenses of your SOUL. Not only will magic that directly attacks your SOUL prove less effective, but attempts to remove your SOUL or corrupt it will prove much, much more difficult so long as you wear the locket. This effect is amplified the stronger your SOUL is- It's certainly potent for a Monster, but it's much more effective for a Human."
1572,,400,Manifestation Of Desires,Genshin Impact,Benevolence,"Contrary to what the general populace believes, it would appear that Visions are not something simply granted by the seven Archons. In fact, they have little to do with the process. Visions are formed by a person's desires and an unknown other aspect, possibly originating from Celestia itself. You will be taking the role of that unknown aspect. Should a person’s ambitions and desires reach the sufficient level required you are able to call it forth and crystallise it into the form of a Vision, with all the good and bad that comes with it. The element that is granted will naturally depend slightly on the person in question.  "
1573,,400,Damnation Eternal ,Genshin Impact,Benevolence,"Some people’s greatest wish is for them to gain eternal life; Immortality. Others though, they know it as a curse. Forced to watch as all they know and love ages and dies, while they keep on living. You have been cursed with this eternal life by the powers of Celestia. You are entirely unaging and substantially harder to kill. But even this has a limit. Not even the gods can escape death, so how could they fully deny it to others? That said, a death of natural causes is one that is barred to you. Only by blade or magic could your death come."
1574,,400,Congenital Positivity,Genshin Impact,Benevolence,"You were born with a strangely high amount of positive energy, similar in nature to that of Chongyun. While this means your body has a tendency to overheat, it also means that ghosts will actively avoid you. Your positive energy drives them away, making them flee often before you can even see them. This would make jobs as an exorcist very easy, as you need only sit in the area of the haunting to drive the evil spirits away, though on the flipside, it might increase scepticism of your job since you never actually seem to encounter any ghosts. Luckily it appears you don’t have the same trouble of this excess positivity running out of control, like Chongyun."
1575,,400,Purification Power,Genshin Impact,Benevolence,"When the Traveler awoke from their centuries long sleep, they soon encountered the corrupted form of Dvalin. It is because of this that a unique ability of the Traveler was discovered; the ability to purify certain corruptive, or corrupted, objects. This is an ability that was even admired by the Anemo Archon himself. Like the Traveler, you are able to purify the poisonous and corruptive. It isn’t even a conscious act to do. Simple contact with you will quickly start work to cleanse what has been tainted. This has the added benefit of making you immune or at least resistant to many unnatural corruptive or corrosive forces."
1576,,400,Strong And Small ,Genshin Impact,Benevolence,Sometimes big things come in little packages. The big thing in this case would be your physical strength. You are impressively strong for your size. Your elemental power acts to empower your body without any conscious effort. This isn’t just at the level of being slightly stronger than normal; you could easily and comfortably lift entire carts filled with luggage with little strain. You may need an incredibly sturdy weapon otherwise they are unlikely to last long with the strength you are swinging them around.
1577,,400,Fighting from the Back​ ,Persona 4,Benevolence,"Well, let no one say that all you do is talk. You now have the ability to cast all of the group buff and debuff spells, Heat Riser, Debilitate, Dekaja, Dekunda, Rebellion, Revolution, Makarakarn, Tetrakarn, and Salvation. These don't cost you any effort or magical/mental/etc. reserves to cast, but they all have a collective 5 second cool down between uses, meaning after you use one you have to wait 5 seconds to use another, and you can't use the same one twice in a row."
1578,,400,Aura Surgeon,World Seed,Benevolence,"One thing that all beings and objects in Neolife possess, and soon those in the real world as well, considering that exposure to mana leads to its manifestation, is an Aura. You could consider it a magical blueprint of how something works. And it truly shows everything: skills, abilities, physical makeup, personality, memory, and much more. Animals and plants have flowing auras, full of twists and turns, whereas processed items like machines have jagged auras, full of hard lines like a 3D circuit diagram. One peculiarity of Aura is that any of its changes are reflected in the being or object possessing the Aura. Xeno-shifters, an advanced Druid class, make use of that to mimic the aura of lifeforms they have studied in order to gain both their forms and abilities, for example.
It is also how Technomancers are able to replicate the effects of implants within themselves, by simply copying their Auras into their bodies. But for all of its potential advantages, tampering with your own Aura can also go incredibly wrong if you mess it up, especially when it involves your brain, such as causing brain damage, death of personality, or just the normal kind of death. It’s good, then, that with your skill at manipulating and changing Auras, yours and those of others, mistakes like that won’t ever happen. It wouldn’t be wrong to call you an Aura Artisan.
So long as you have an example to study, you’ll be able to safely and successfully apply any of its abilities or peculiarities either to yourself or somebody else, and even combine parts of the Auras of many beings to create truly powerful forms. After studying a massive amount of different Auras to get a feel for how they work, you’ll even be able to go so far as to create original Auras and beings, or change parts of your Aura to give yourself entirely new abilities."
1579,,500,RNGesus Is My Best Friend,Mobius Final Fantasy,Benevolence,"Mobius Final Fantasy is a Free To Play Mobile RPG, and as such has to make a profit somehow right? The way Mobius made money back when it was still in service was through a Gacha system, which many of you should be familiar with by now. This Perk makes it so that you will never again suffer through Gatcha hell. Been eyeing that one super powerful unit but there's only a 0.5% chance of drawing them? Congratulations, your next multipull will give you just the amount of that one unit you need in order to max them out(or, if a single multiple isn't enough, every single multi pull you... pull from will give you the necessary amount of that one unit, until you can eventually max said unit out). This also applies to material drops, weapon and armor upgrade success rates, weapon and armor drop rates and anything else that's reliant on you getting extraordinarily lucky. No more breaking out the Visa or Debit Card for you my friend, it's all smooth sailing from here."
1580,,500,Ars Magus: Nemea,Blazblue,Benevolence,"An Ars Magus taking the form of a grand, flowing cape with the color and texture of Lion's fur, with a hood like a lion's mane. The cape is completely invulnerable to every kind of damage except blunt trauma - even swords and bullets merely glance off its lustrous fur. The cape is also capable of flaring out large enough to cover twenty square feet and retracting back again on command."
1581,,500,Major Boon,Generic D&D 5e,Benevolence,"You can have one Major Boon for this. This could be proficiency in everything, immunity to all forms of a type of damage, or similar. “Boon of the Stormlord” is an example of a Major Boon. Full list in the notes. Yes, you can buy as many of these as you damn well please. How far into debt will you go, though?

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
1582,,500,Critical Over,The Seven Deadly Sins,Benevolence,"Critical Over augments the user's physical strength to its absolute limits and lasts until the magic wears off. This can make someone with only a 24,000 strength level reach 40,000, nearly doubling the user's strength. This ability works best as a trump card used in times of crisis."
1583,,500,Curseproof ,Generic Exalted,Benevolence,"You don't suffer from The Great Curse, nor can you ever suffer from The Great Curse or anything like it, the loophole that allowed it to take place being effectively closed. This is A Big Deal in setting, though virtually no one knows about The Great Curse in the first place. This perk also makes you heavily resistant to curses in general. As a final bonus you not only know how and why you became Curseproof, but you also now understand how to make others Curseproof as well. It will be a trying and difficult procedure even for Exalts accustomed to hardship but the sheer importance of what you can do with this is not to be underestimated. This could, literally, change the dynamic of the entire world. Finally while you can teach others only Exalts on the level of a Solaroid can actually perform the procedure (with you being the exception if you aren't a Solaroid yourself), so keep that in mind.

If you don't take this option you can still rid yourself of the Great Curse post-jump but you'll have to research the method yourself, and it will likely take you at least a hundred years before you manage it, assuming you manage it at all. Additionally even if you do figure it out the method you devise will only work on you, your companions with Exaltations (if you have any) will need their own methods, though you may of course choose to help them in developing their own cures.

If you do not purchase this option you will have all memories of The Great Curse sealed while in the jump and will not know that you are affected by The Great Curse, nor begin research on a cure for it, until after the jump has ended. This additionally locks anyway any information you may have on The Great Curse via other methods, such as written materials, digital information, or even simply censoring the Exalted handbooks if you happen to have copies of them."
1584,,500,Whittled Goat ,Shin Megami Tensei V,Benevolence,"This small figure holds a great enchantment within. Recreating it appears to be impossible but the effect it grants is still great. On the moment of your death, this Statue will shatter, reviving you with full health and cured of any wound. Upon usage you get a new Whittled Goat in the next Jump."
1585,,500,Wings of Rebellion ,Persona 5 Royal,Benevolence,"Life is full of hardships... but you have prevailed. You have gained the Wings of Rebellion that shall allow you to soar above the limits of normal man. While these are only metaphorical Wings the Power this Perk gifts you is far above any normal Wings could give you. Your Willpower is unbreakable, nothing may tear you from your path be it god, demon, despair or any sort of corruption trying to make you something your not. Your Justice is your own and you will never betray your principles. Only you alone decide your Will and may adapt your own Worldview and continue to grow as a person as you fight for what is right. 

This Perk will also serve as a Capstone Booster for certain Perks below."
1586,,500,Angelic Armaments ,Diablo 3,Benevolence,"You can now summon flaming angelic swords around you to block incoming attacks. You can also let them fly at high speeds in a direction of your choosing. These swords are imbued with divine flames. If you use them to defend they will block any sort of damage, even ones that a sword not normally should block (like poison). But make no mistake. While they are quite sturdy, they can break after enough damage has been suffered. Show them the Arsenal of Heaven!"
1587,,500,Heroic Willpower,Slay the Princess,Benevolence,"Because it seems we're just running down the list of all the fantasy novel tropes today - what next, you want me to tell you “The Power of Friendship will always save the day?” Well, it would certainly be appreciated. Quiet. Anyway - your sheer will and desire to pursue your goals have simply taken on a will of their own, quite literally in fact. Things that would try to outright crush your mind and spirit can be pushed back so long as even a spark of your Willpower and Heroic spirit remains within you. Eugh."
1588,,500,Balm of Protection,80s Sword and Sorcery,Benevolence,"Inside this small, ornate container there is a balm or ointment. Its exact effects will remain unknown until it is applied, and there’s only enough of it for a single creature. But when it is applied it will provide temporary protection from a certain hazard that the recipient will soon face, or is already facing. Applied with a specific goal in mind, it will usually work for that goal - it could be used to break an enchantment which controls the mind or applied to gain protection from the fires of a monster of living flames able to instantly incinerate a human and kill even a demigod with its flames - otherwise it will just be a hazard you happen to face during its duration. The balm’s effects do only last a limited time, and the more powerful or wide in scope the effect it is protecting from the shorter it will last, though it should never be less than half an hour and will never be more than 1 lunar month and usually will be less than a day. The balm’s effects also tend to be rather specific in their application - it may protect you from an individual’s magic or an individual type of magic, but is unlikely to make you simply immune to magic, it might protect you from a dragon’s fire breath but not their claws and fangs - but will gravitate towards the greatest hazard especially if you have a specific hazard in mind; if the recipient is immune to flame but can’t survive a dragon’s bite it might make the recipient’s skin impenetrable for a time.

If used this container will refill at the beginning of the next jump or in 10 years whichever comes first."
1589,,500,Ox(Stompp),Miraculous Ladybug,Benevolence,"Concept: Determination

Form: Nose Ring

Tool: Mallet

Power: “Resistance” - Makes the user invulnerable to superpowers. This means it cancels out the effects of Miraculous Powers, akumatized abilities, and other magical abilities directly used on the user. This power also protects what the user is equipped with but only if they were equipped with it when they activated the Power (so if you put on a ring after using Resistance it would still be vulnerable). Post-Jump this will nullify anything that is explicitly magical/mystical even if it’s down to a science, but it won’t work on anything that’s explicitly scientific even if it works like magic. This means it will cancel out Doctor Strange’s spells but not Superman’s laser eyes. This Power lasts until detransformation or until the Power is used again."
1590,,500,Golden apples,The Song of the Nibelungs,Benevolence,"The goddess Freia (in Wagner's canon) or Idun will supply you and your companions with her golden apples of youth. These apples will rejuvenate, heal and give you the vitality you held at the prime of your life and then some. You won’t have to worry about some giants stealing Freia away or even her death as those apples will somehow still always be delivered to you. If somehow your supply of apples were stolen, cut short or someone prevented you from consuming them, you would again start to feel the weight of age on your shoulders. If you manage to eat of them before your death you’d be immediately returned to your prime again."
1591,,500,Immortal ,Invincible,Benevolence,"You my friend have been cursed by an extraordinarily powerful being. You are immortal, unageing, forever in your prime. You may fly, no longer need to breathe and have physical abilities at just about half of those of a young Viltrumite. You are able to destroy buildings and take building destroying blows, along with flying at supersonic speeds, with the stamina to operate full bore for about 48 hrs before needing to rest. You are also able to survive and fight in a vacuum. The greatest ability you possess however is your regeneration. You can heal from anything that damages you, regenerating so fast that people can watch it happen in real time. If your heart is plucked from your chest it regrows, as would a cut off arm or anything that is similar. The only weakness that your regeneration has is that of removing your head from your body. Should this occur, you will fall into a coma akin to death until the head is touched once more to where it was removed. Should your head be completely obliterated it will regrow with no memory or personality loss. The only way to truly, and permanently, kill you is to rip you apart atom from atom to the extent that there is nothing left to regenerate from. Still, if you are in a state where your head has been removed from your body and you are in a coma when a jump ends, you will lose the chain as if you had died."
1592,,500,Spiritbending,Avatar: The Legend Of Korra,Benevolence,"A new unique skill that utilizes knowledge of both healing and spirituality to alter and affect spiritual energy. Users of this power can restore balance to corrupt spirits and corrupt pure spirits. It also has the potential to be used on humans to either purge an individual of evil, or completely destroy someone’s soul. The only drawback to this ability is that it’s virtually useless in combat as it takes a great amount of time and concentration to use.

Requires Bender(Water) to Purchase"
1593,,500,Force Field Generation,Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Benevolence,"You can create powerful force fields with your mind to guard from damage; enough damage will overwhelm your ability to maintain the shield, causing it to disappear and causing mental strain. You can’t generate force fields inside of things, but you can utilize your force fields to batter and even cut your enemies, if generated in the right way."
1594,,500,Red Hot Shot,Bayonetta,Benevolence,"A VERY powerful trinket that any Witch worth her salt should have. By purchasing this you have a device which can save you from the brink of death! When you take an attack that should have normally killed you, the item is expended automatically and you're left with a bit of extra health. Works once per jump."
1595,,500,Pentakai Bench,King Arthur ,Benevolence,"Just as every king has his followers, all drawn to him by numerous reasons. You have your companions. Whenever one of your followers are near you, both of you get a small boost of power, around a tenth of your or their base power. This increases with the amount of followers you have around you each getting the boost as well."
1596,,500,Kiss ,Peter Pan,Benevolence,"A “kiss” (really an acorn or thimble) that you can wear on a necklace around your neck. The kiss has the power to absorb the full power of a single projectile, thus preventing it from actually hitting you. You then fall to the ground unconscious, and people may think that they actually killed you until you wake up. Don’t worry, the “kiss” isn’t destroyed; however, it won’t be able to block another projectile until 24 hours have passed.

1597,,500,Red Magic ,Drakengard and Nier,Benevolence,"Thanks to a blood ritual from the Watcher Cult, your body has been dyed blood red. Besides giving you a paint job, this ritual has enchanted you so that you now resist magic. From magic missiles to dragons breath, any sort of arcane attack does a small fraction of the damage that it would. What’s more, when you’re hit there’s a chance that the magic will be reflected, turning into a dangerous arcane bolt that homes in on the caster. Note that this doesn’t make you invincible however, just resistant. If someone drops a magical nuke on your head, you're just as dead as everyone else nearby. It also colors you completely red, although if you choose it will only dye a single body part, like your hair, eyes or a hand.
"
1598,,500,Undying ,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Benevolence,"Many have sought immortality, and the closest to finding it was Nagash, the first Necromancer. The foul unlife he brought his willing and unwilling followers to is now yours to share. Dead though still aware you need not eat, nor breath, and such flesh as you have remaining shall never tire again. You have shed your mortality as a snake shrugs off its skin, and now all eternity is yours.
"
1599,,500,Crown of Alice - 1st Segment,Wonderland No More,Benevolence,"A copy of Alice’s crown after becoming a queen in Through the Looking-Glass, though it has since broken into three pieces. Each purchase gives you a single piece of the crown, each with its own special power (you get to choose which piece for each purchase). If you buy multiple pieces, the crown will start to come together, and you’ll get the cumulative effects of the individual pieces. When all three pieces are bought, the crown is fully restored, and it will now additionally make the wearer immune to all magic that controls them mentally or physically). The individual pieces’ powers are as follows:

1. 1st Segment- Permanently enhances your “armor” defense for all forms you take.
"
1600,,500,Crown of Alice - 2nd Segment ,Wonderland No More,Benevolence,"A copy of Alice’s crown after becoming a queen in Through the Looking-Glass, though it has since broken into three pieces. Each purchase gives you a single piece of the crown, each with its own special power (you get to choose which piece for each purchase). If you buy multiple pieces, the crown will start to come together, and you’ll get the cumulative effects of the individual pieces. When all three pieces are bought, the crown is fully restored, and it will now additionally make the wearer immune to all magic that controls them mentally or physically). The individual pieces’ powers are as follows:

2. 2nd Segment- Permanently boosts your spirit for all forms you take."
1601,,600,Cogito Ergo Sum,Shin Megami Tensei II,Benevolence,"Few know the truth of this world: Once upon a time, the demons of now were the gods of old, and Angels of today were the demons of yesterday. Holy and unholy aren’t concepts built into reality, merely manipulated and staged by the triumphant forces of Law and their opposition. Having realized this yourself, you have wisely decided no such rules will apply to you. If an Angel demands you be pure of heart in order to earn their services, they will judge you as worthy even if you’re the type who lies and steals. If a demon-possessed weapon would encroach upon your body to corrupt you into a monster, you will find it unable to do any such thing and will work just fine otherwise in your hands without the extra ‘gift’. In other words, powers and forces that demand you be aligned to a particular ideology or level of goodness or evil find you an acceptable vessel, letting you wield the sacred in one hand and the profane in the other without needing to be one or the other. Likewise, corrupting influences that would make you involuntarily drift to one side or the other have no sway over you."
1602,,600,Man Made Messiah ,Shin Megami Tensei II,Benevolence,"But just as Man cannot live on bread alone, they cannot wait for the divine to grant them a savior. So why not make one in their own image, the same way God made Man? If you’ve entered this world with memories, you may sometimes have visions of a strange man in robes speaking to you as your body rested alongside several others in test tubes...memories of your creation. 

You were genetically engineered by cutting edge science to be the very model of a Messiah for the Center. Your body is stronger and tougher than that of a normal human, able to survive a drop from Earth’s orbit and land with hardly a scratch on your person. You were programmed with a natural talent for fighting demons, quickly mastering new weapons you obtain and being able to defeat entire squads of the Messian’s Temple Knights and similar foes with martial prowess alone. In addition, you were designed to rally the disparate factions of humanity under the Messian’s banner, and as such you have not only an aesthetically pleasing appearance but a natural charisma that can quickly turn former enemies into allies, creating an army just around the message or cause you fight for by force of personality alone. Just try not to dwell too much on the fact you’re an imitation...or worse, the reason for the coming wrath of God..."
1603,,600,Lone Wolf,Duel Monsters – The Shadow Realm,Benevolence,"They say an unarmed man on his own is powerless before REAL strength in this world, that magic and might beyond a mortal human would fell such a man. But you know that willpower alone can overcome everything, at least for a while. During battle, you can enter the state known as “Lone Wolf”, where you are able to heavily resist the effects of magic and physical damage being greatly mitigated during the fight - blows that would shatter your bones merely bruise, magical firestorms lightly singing you instead of reducing you to ash. However, once you enter this state you will be forced to keep it up until the fighting is over, and when the fight does end you’ll lose this benefit. Still, through your will and this technique, you could truly outshine a magician for at least long enough to kill them with your bare hands. Just take care - even with this durability, injuries can add up quickly."
1604,,600,Lord of D,Duel Monsters – The Shadow Realm,Benevolence,"As the master of Dragonic Tactics, you are now a worthier master than any other. The Dragons you have a mental bond with and fight alongside with using the “Draconnection” on can shrug off magical effects and powers off with their willpower alone, as long as their pride outweighs an enchantment’s strength they can resist it greatly. The Dragons are mighty beasts, but by your side they become mightier!

Requires D. Connection to Purchase"
1605,,600,King of the Beasts,Duel Monsters – The Shadow Realm,Benevolence,"The kingdom of the wild does not answer to nobility of blood, but power and power alone. You are rightly called the King of the Beasts, because you have physical might and durability(though not much else) that lets you come out of an all-out brawl with every beast and Beast-warrior in a region...and come out on top, with barely a scratch! Not only that, but you can command the respect of any non-sapient beast weaker than you, regardless of species or temperament. Animals are pure...they know who’s strongest."
1606,,600,Red-Eyes Transmigration,Duel Monsters – The Shadow Realm,Benevolence,"The Red Eyes Black Dragons were not afraid to get their hands dirty, and there is even legend that one has become an Archfiend through dark magics while still retaining its agency. You are not any different, now: You can contain and mix corruptive powers with ease, and while their negative side effects may kick in, you gain a greater amount of power from them. Not to mention that whomever would use corrupted or ‘evil’ energy as a way to control you will find no purchase: You retain your sense of self, even being able to use the powers granted by a deal with the Archfiends against them with no fear of recourse."
1607,,600,Swords of Revealing Light,Duel Monsters – The Shadow Realm,Benevolence,"Only a right fool would fail to see the use in a powerful defensive option. Variants of this spell are extremely popular among many spellcasters, both novice and masters alike. This spell produces a trio of “Swords” made of a dazzling bright light. The light alone is capable of taking foes off-guard and revealing the place of hidden foes, but their true strength is the barrier that is created between the 3 Swords. Reports have been recorded of these barriers being able to withstand a rampaging Blue-Eyes White Dragon’s attacks without breaking. But...this defense is not eternal. Every 30 seconds this spell is active, a sword will disappear. This means that after 60 seconds, the barrier will be gone completely and the only benefit will be a single “Sword of Light” capable of creating light. This is mentally intensive to cast, though you don’t need to focus on the spell once you’ve cast it."
1608,,600,Noblestalk,Baldur's Gate 3,Benevolence,"Noblestalk mushrooms are one of a kind medicinal fungus that can cure all ailments know to mortalkind. Usually, they are quite a bother to harvest, but you seem to have some in your possession already. Nature of the ailment it cures doesn’t matter. Disease, poison, infections, amnesia, confusion, depression or even things like spiritual corruption will be purged upon consuming this mushroom. To summarize, it can cure all things that are classified as a status condition and then some. It’s not able to cure your tadpole infection within this jump though, until the netherese magic modifying it is undone at least.

Also, consuming even a single stalk gives you a permanent resistance to normal diseases and poisons. Consuming more stalks over time could make you immune to all poisons and diseases (magical or common) eventually (usually takes three to five per person).

If you are a skilled enough alchemist, you can distill potions of status effect immunity that its effects could last for days from a single stalk of this mushroom.

You get ten stalks initially and get ten more each time you go to a new jump. They are placed in a perfect magical stasis that only breaks just before consumption or usage. They are magically sterile and cannot be reproduced."
1609,,600,"Hope Is Gone, Or So It Seems",Baldur's Gate 3,Benevolence,"But the game’s not over yet... the song goes. This is true on many levels for you. Within you exists a bottomless well of hope that you can draw upon any time you need it. While you are drawing upon your well of hope, despair may not take hold off you and any of your allies. Spirits will be lifted; heads shall be raised back up and morale will be unbreakable. They will look up to you and as long as you stand, they will fight by your side. This aura of hope grants you and your compatriots a boost to their battle prowess and also suppresses all negative status effects and conditions, while this aura is active.

But this is not the only use of this perk. Once per jump or one time per ten years (whichever one is the longest) whenever you are in a situation with no way out, you can call upon this perk and a path will open for you to fight another day. If you are on death’s door, an ally may arrive and save from the brink of death, if you and your companions are captured, you will get a chance to break free before your execution. This is basically your get-out-of-jail-card. You may choose to activate this ability at any time, but if you are facing jump failure or certain death without having one-ups, this perk will automatically activate itself and go on cooldown."
1610,,600,Not What Will Happen – What Will You Do?,Baldur's Gate 3,Benevolence,"No door is closed for you anymore and no odds are insurmountable. You jumper have the potential to do anything and accomplish the impossible. Any problem you face, roadblock you encounter and dilemma you find yourself in always has a good ending available, for you and for those you care. As long as you search for a way forward, the universe itself will give you an option. You or any of your allies don’t have to turn to a mindflayer to defeat an ancient brain, your friend whose heart is a infernal engine doesn’t have to make a choice between returning to hells to survive or explode in a fiery death, nor does your vampiric friend need to sacrifice the lives of thousands to enjoy sunlight for a little more time. No – just no. You’ll find a way forward. You always have, and you always will.

This doesn’t grant you a path to victory or a similar ability. It just opens an alternate path, a one you can follow with your heart and mind in the clear. Chance of your success depends on your actions and your willingness to commit to this cause and even then, some things can be near impossible to achieve. But if there is a path, you’ll find it and walk it with no regrets. This perks also grants you the ability to invalidate prophecies and destined fates. Now go jumper, follow your heart’s desire."
1611,,600,Orpheus’ Blessing,Baldur's Gate 3,Benevolence,"You carry the blessing of the Mother Gith in your mind. Maybe you are a secret descendant of Orpheus, Prince of the Comet? Or you could be simply received the blessing by a pure chance as a result of a psychic storm in the Astral Plane? It matters not in the end. What matters is that you have it in your grasp. This is the ultimate weapon against the ghaik. This ability is so important even the immortal Vlaakith fears that if the bindings of long-lost prince were ever to be weakened, it could spell the ending of her tyranny over githyanki.

Your mind is a profound concept of pure harmony that none can influence. You are immune to all kinds of mental influences. Be it mind reading, mind detection, mental domination, mental corruption, mental afflictions, emotional manipulation, thought manipulation or psychic attacks. No power that is mental in nature can affect your mind unless you allow it. If someone were to make such an attempt on your mind, you could reflect it right back at the offender, if that is what you desire, causing them immense psychic backlash. This is the ultimate mental defense, feared by all ghaik.

Not only that but you can extend this protection to all who is within 100 meters of you. Size of this aura slowly expands with time and practice, and in time it can reach multiple kilometers even (capped at 10 km). This also grants you the side power of sensing all minds that are not invisible to detection within your aura’s range. You can not only sense them, but instantly become aware of any mental influences that is placed on them and dispel it with a single thought.

Furthermore, you a continuously in a state of pure harmony in your mind. No event can phase you; no emotion may overwhelm you and no matter how bizarre of an event occurs, you’ll never get caught in surprise. You are capable of rational and unobstructed thought in all situations. Your sanity is a monument that will last ages, meaning that nothing can cause you to succumb to insanity or mental disorder.

Now go forth jumper and fear not of the might of ghaik and their thralls. Your mind is a mental fortress that will never fall."
1612,,600,Powerful Soul ,Anima Beyond Fantasy,Benevolence,"Your soul is a strong one, burning brightly into the darkness of ignorance, burning through the blinders that were placed upon you. It is inhumanly great, beyond the grasp of most mortals. Furthermore, it will slowly grow back to full strength, never permanently leaving a state of perfection, no matter how you maim it. Finally, if you so wish, where your Ki would ultimately be limited by your body and will, now all that matters is the burning strength of your soul."
1613,,600,Heart of Crystal ,Xenoblade Chronicles 2,Benevolence,"A Blade’s core crystal is their heart, and no gift is more precious than a heart given willingly to a worthy partner. Whether you’re a Driver or a Blade you have a unique core crystal which is split between you and your partner, similar to Rex and Pyra’s shared core crystal but without the drawbacks. This crystal allows you to share your life force with your partner, not only greatly strengthening the connection between you both but allowing each to serve as a backup for the other’s life; if the worst should happen, neither partner is truly considered dead until both partners have been killed, as the core crystal acts as a backup for both you and your partner. With enough energy expended through the core it’s possible to reconstruct a body, mind, or soul from the crystal’s records. Should you acquire extra lives from other perks or items neither you nor your partner count as dead until both of you have been slain."
1614,,600,Unleash Shining Justice!,Xenoblade Chronicles 2,Benevolence,"When all hope seems lost you unleash your true power with a mighty roar! A secret technique of the Tantal royal family, you’ve unlocked the same secret power that Zeke possesses, a powerful super mode which massively augments your combat prowess for a brief time. Once per day you can unleash your full power, becoming immune to conditions that hinder your combat effectiveness like blindness or paralysis. Your strength and speed triple during this period, multiplying not only your natural strength but also any effects gained from other sources like a Blade’s ether boosts. This limit break lasts for several minutes but consumes a great deal of energy, leaving you fatigued at its conclusion. With extensive training you could eventually learn to extend this power’s duration and reduce the downsides to a negligible effect."
1615,,600,Boy Meets Girl,Xenoblade Chronicles 2,Benevolence,"Alrest is a world of incredible beauty but even the grandest vistas pale before the sacred bond between humans and Blades. The power of this bond is more than sentiment, it’s real and tangible enough to turn an ordinary boy into a true hero for the sake of his loved ones, or give a common Blade enough strength to cross swords with an Aegis. That power now rests in you, yours to share not only with a Driver or Blade partner but with all others you hold dear. Your love and support allows you to draw out incredible strength in those you care for, honing them into the best possible versions of themselves. Those whose spirits are battered and broken find their scars and traumas healing with your care and affection, and powers long lost return to them as if they’d never left. Moreover, the deeper your relationship with a person grows the more you’re able to draw out even greater strength from them, and them from you, even beyond the limit of what should be possible. Even a child could find the strength to go toe-to-toe with a master swordsman centuries his senior if the villain stood between him and his loved ones."
1616,,600,Great Redeemer,Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous,Benevolence,"It isn’t always righteous fury and purging flames. Some elements of the Crusade argue that the path to victory can be made with kind intentions, instead of the sword. You have come to understand Good, Evil and why people are drawn to each. You see clearly into the hearts of others, even millennia old demon-queens, to comprehend what kinds of people they are and what they believe about morality.  

But most importantly, you are able to bring healing and redemption to others. As long as there is even a shred of goodness or hope left in them, you can inspire with your words and actions the desire to change. Your heartfelt beliefs and sincere arguments pierce through contempt and amusement to leave even Evil Outsiders shaken. If there is a chance, however remote, that they can become Good, you can make it a genuine possibility. They still need to choose to take that step, however tempting and easy you might be able to make it with your friendship and the wonders of being Good. And while you could guide even an evil demigod to ethics and morality, you can’t guarantee them forgiveness from everyone they’ve hurt. "
1617,,600,"Father, Son, And Holy Belmont",Castlevania - Symphony of the Night,Benevolence,"An interesting little tidbit for you - even when possessed by the dark priest, Shaft, Richter Belmont was almost wholly immune to attacks of a holy nature on account of his own overwhelming devotion to the slaying of vampires. I’m not quite sure how that makes sense, but it is impressive nonetheless. However this came about, you’ve managed to duplicate the process - as you slowly murder your way through the armies of the night, performing good deeds to the small folk and rescuing kidnapped maidens, you’ll find that your own resistance to the divine will increase. If you like, think of it as adding your karma to your defenses - a simple man may only be able to shave off a few points of damage, but someone who has devoted their life to the slaying of foul creatures? You’d be able to outright ignore an entire church throwing their collective might at you. You’ll also find that this process also raises your defenses against curses and poisons - not to the same extent, but you wouldn’t need to fear being turned to stone by the Medusa or some such."
1618,,600,Bestowment,The Free Universe,Benevolence,"An example of the truly fantastic capabilities of a magician, you are able to directly imbue the powers of your spells as Extraordinary Traits for others to use - be it a permanent version of a spell to enhance their abilities or allowing a spell to call lightning to be used by them at any moment they like. Unfortunately, you cannot Bestow a spell’s power upon yourself - the process simply fizzles out."
1619,,600,Atlas Method,The Free Universe,Benevolence,"A grueling set of exercises that would leave even olympians nearly dead, the Atlas Method has given you two major benefits : First, you have access to the “Body Hardening” techniques that are famed for their use in conditioning the human form to become ever harder and stronger. From the Stone Ox method of sitting under waterfalls and taking attacks from fellow students to enhance endurance to the “iron hand” striking training, to the acrobatic “Kick Practice” that allows a man to jump up, kick something directly overhead, and return to a standing position in one fluid motion, you are able to test your body’s capabilities constantly. The more potent benefit is that you have entirely broken out of the idea of a human “limitation”, that is to say your biology’s usual limits on developing greater strength, greater speed, durability, and other capabilities are removed. As long as you’re willing to push yourself, you could easily reach blatantly superhuman heights of ability with the same training regimen as normal - albeit kicked up a notch in scale due to the necessary part of needing to push what you’re normally capable of to take advantage of this."
1620,,600,Foreign Contact ,The Free Universe,Benevolence,"The truth of Outsiders is that they’re only foreigners for so long, many alien beings integrated with earth’s history in the past and have become naturally part of the history of the world, contacting with mankind until they became our heritage. So too, you will be able to bridge the gap between peoples. You have gained the strange ability to grant your biological capabilities and powers to others with a meaningful and physical contact, such as the touch of a glowing finger or mind-melding with the participant in question. What’s more, you are able to always intermingle and have viable offspring with a member of a sentient species, regardless of physical differences - how else would there be so much mystical, eldritch and cosmic heritage in humanity’s collective blood?"
1621,,600,The Modular Man,The Free Universe,Benevolence,"Perhaps it is the result of your artificial origins, but you’re much less strict about how your form needs to be shaped or what it needs to operate - as well as being less likely to reject helpful new capabilities. Your body is much more modular and accepting to new “upgrades” and changes, such as enchantments, biological implants, or even completely hotswapping new bodyparts! How this manifests is up to you, and based on your Primary Extraordinary Trait, but it is acutely useful when you’ll need to adapt to a new situation. Take evolution into your own hands."
1622,,600,Magnum Opus,The Free Universe,Benevolence,"The arts of making heroes...or at least powerful people like them. You are able to leverage your existing technical/scientific/magical know how to create extraordinary people, such as how the Super Patriots or Martial Cantarel’s Tableau Vivants were created(such as the safe processes to integrate your machinery into someone’s biology), able to either create superhuman beings from scratch or convert people into these figures of prowess and might."
1623,,600,GM’s Favour ,Old Man Henderson,Benevolence,"On the other hand it looks like someone really likes you. As if you are their special fetishized self insert with two katanas. You have a plot armor of sorts, making things simply go easier your way."
1624,,600,Reroll a Character,Old Man Henderson,Benevolence,"A certain player had to do this a LOT over the course of the Campaign. So now you get to as well. Once per Jump, in the event that you died, you may design a new Origin of your time in this world. It will be the same Origin you selected but you can edit things about it like where you are from. For all intents and purposes this will be you... just controlling a different body. If you make your way back to your allies you will find it easy to convince them you are their formerly deceased friend."
1625,,600,Hand of Power,The Silmarillion,Benevolence,"Huan was the Hound of Valinor, and the great Eagles are messengers of Manwë. They were mighty beasts, and in the service of higher powers, they changed the course of fate on many occasions.

This perk has two main effects. Firstly, you are blessed by a higher power, your natural gifts taken above and beyond the mundane. If before you were an eagle, now you are large enough to carry off a full-grown stallion or duel a dragon in the air. If before you were a bear, now you are a living titan of muscle and ferocity, your very tread is capable of shaking the earth when you charge into battle. If you were a horse, your very being embodies the ideas of swiftness and freedom, and you could outrun and escape any pursuit. Regardless of whether or not this spiritual power finds expression in size, you are proof against all but the most potent and prolonged of torments or corruptions, and find any magic in line with your species’ associated qualities uplifted and strengthened further. For humans this would enhance ingenuity, for dwarves stubbornness and endurance, for elves beauty and wonder etc.

Secondly, if you choose to take up service under another, you will find yourself well-rewarded, according to the stature of your master and the nature of your service. If you serve the Valar, they will give you advice and guidance in signs or dreams, and you will find yourself enhanced still further by their spiritual power. If you serve a lesser being, they will reward you as best they can, take care of you and give you gifts which others might deem strange for a ‘mere animal’. You may serve multiple masters in this way, but only those you truly give faithful service will ‘count’ for the purposes of this perk."
1626,,600,Lord of the Star,The Silmarillion,Benevolence,"In the First Age, through Lúthien and then Elwing, the blood of Maiar, elf and human mingled, and of that line came the line of the kings of Numenor - and your line. While all Numenoreans have great longevity, your lifespan is extended by a quarter again, and your will and spiritual power is similarly increased. Furthermore, when you make use of magical items to which you are entitled by right, your ability with them is magnified; they will obey you as they would not others, and curses and negative effects they carry are weakened against you - though not entirely removed.

Beyond these more mystical benefits, however, you also gain more practical ones. You may or may not have lands and titles within Numenor, but if you were granted such you would have the wisdom, skill and judgement to administer them ably, to keep your subordinates loyal, your peers respectful, your lands bountiful and your people happy - or subservient, if you are more inclined to wring value from them by force. You can easily administer a domain of this type, easily learn and memorise laws and rules, and have the judgement to apply them fairly; if you so choose, you can make your court a haven of justice, without sacrificing stability. Finally, you are a skilled tactician and general, able to command armies from the front or the rear, and to achieve grand victories even from disadvantageous positions."
1627,,600,Unwearied,The Silmarillion,Benevolence,"It is said that of all the elements with which the Valar made the world, water was the one which Melkor was never able to fully subjugate. You have partaken of this trait, and are resistant to both the corruption of evil and the weariness of time in a way shared by few others. Although you are not entirely immune to external corruption or the weariness created by an immortal life, you are far more resistant than others, and such things do not cling to you forever. Even if you should suffer corruption of one kind or another, you will find that so long as you can escape its source and find rest, relief and some kind of happiness - particularly if you do so near the sea or some other great body of water - the consequences of corruption will slowly fall from you. Just as the sea sheds all torments and becomes clean once more, so are you and your spirit - and under your care you can provide this same relief to others."
1628,,600,Time Synchronisation        ,Anima Ark Of Sinners,Benevolence,"The reason Celia arrived in this city is that she is capable of synchronizing with the frozen time of Ark. You on the other hand possess an immunity to time related shenanigans which also allows you to synchronise with places where time flows oddly and break the cycle within. 

Finally, you can qualify for any and all prophecies no matter how excluse they may be.

Boosted: Timelord

It would seem that rather than simply being immune to time you are now capable of freely manipulating it in a range as large as the city of Ark. This also makes it so regardless of what kind of prophecy or plot you are involved in you will always find that they end up benefiting you even if it is simply something like allowing you to forgive yourself for your past sins.

Boost Requires Ark of Eternity to Activate"
1629,,600,Inner Light ,Castlevania - Aria of Sorrow,Benevolence,"Maybe you don’t have a special quality or fighting spirit that you can use to battle through the castle. But the darkness that Dracula commands is that of evil and wickedness itself...so wouldn’t a soul filled with light ward off such a thing just as well? There’s a natural gentleness and warmth in your soul that not only easily inspires both friendship and love towards you and others you open up to, but this ‘light’ wards of corrupting and controlling forces. Words of encouragement or even a keepsake you gave to those you care about can let them resist even the call of the greatest evil, holding onto themselves long enough in remembrance of you and what you inspired in them."
1630,,600,Mirror Maiden Shard ,Valkyrie Crusade ,Benevolence,"This crystalline shard of glass seems to hold within it the reflection of a girl. When held to a broken or incomplete being or object, they will be made more complete and whole. If it is unrecognisable from the final product, it may take up to 4 shards to fully complete it. Restore a goddess to her prime or fix a seemingly unfixable sword. Once used, another will appear in your warehouse in a month's time."
1631,,600,Stronger and Sturdier!,Valkyrie Crusade ,Benevolence,"With this, one can apply a ‘level system’ to a building/structure. By sacrificing the same amount of resources that went into constructing it, you can make it bigger, stronger and more advanced than it was previously. The amount of resources required takes into account 50% of previous upgrades. Who knows what you might end up with eventually?"
1632,,600,Angel Statues        ,Castlevania - Order of Ecclesia,Benevolence,"Scattered throughout the land you will find them, hidden in caves, buried deep beneath the earth, on the tops of tall mountains, in the center of an abandoned village, even inside of Castlevania itself - statues of angels with their hands held up in prayer. If one looks closely, a faint light can be seen shining between the statues hands, as if they were holding it there. Reaching out to this light and giving a simple prayer will heal you of all that ails you, closing your wounds, filling your magical reserves, and flushing any poisons from your system. To be clear, a team of dedicated healers working on you all day long would be less effective than thirty seconds of quoting scripture before these statues. However, the lord's blessing does not end there. Once per jump, should you pass away within a day of having visited one of these statues you will find yourself waking up on the ground before it with the clock having turned back to the time of your visit."
1633,,600,Lost Descendant,Castlevania - Order of Ecclesia,Benevolence,"In the village of Wygol there lives a kindly old lady with a fondness for hats and a truly spotty memory. If you visit her and let her ramble on, she will eventually come to mention her grandfather, a hunter of monsters who bore a whip, and perhaps even touch on her own career as one. If you let her mind wander for even longer, you will eventually come to a shocking discovery - you are related, albeit somewhat distantly. More than that, you are a Belmont. Sadly, the power and prowess of this family lies dormant within you, and bringing it to the forefront will be a trial and a half. Despite that you are still deemed holy by the world, if only just. Dark magics are a smidge less effective on you, and your blows equally more effective no matter the weapon you use. Unfortunately, the Belmont are fated to fade away for a time, and so you are not the hero - instead, you are the one who will support them in their time of need. When you give, the recipient begins to take on a small part of the fated rivalry with the darkness your family holds. When they commission armor from you, you give them flowers for their birthday, they ask you for advice, or you donate your own blood to them... If you are on their side then so is God himself, and they will live a blessed life."
1634,,600,Answer to Oneself,Warhammer 40K: The Warp ,Benevolence,"As a notable power in the Warp answering to no one but yourself, the vulnerabilities that affect other Warp entities no longer apply to you. Unlike those wretched Daemons that serve under their patrons, your powers and abilities can never be taken from you, nor can you be weakened beyond your base level of power. Forcing you to act under another’s will is likewise an exercise in futility, with any attempts at doing so failing. In addition, any source of power you can access can no longer be cut off from you by others. You also can no longer be altered by outside forces against your informed consent. This independence has made you all the stronger, for your essence is more powerful than those of the greatest of Daemons; not even an exalted Greater Daemon accompanied by a few of its unnamed kin can hope to match you, and a Chaos God must use some effort to quash your existence.

1635,,600,Act of Creation,Warhammer 40K: The Warp ,Benevolence,"Entities born in the Warp are shaped, strengthened or weakened by particular metaphysical conditions. The same thing applies to you, with certain metaphysical conditions granting a very significant boost to both your physical and supernatural parameters. Should certain conditions be met, such as fighting against a certain being or type of being, crafting a particular item, or some other circumstance, you will gain a boost proportional to how many conditions are met. The broader the condition/s you choose, the less powerful the boost will be. A condition as broad as going to war, for example, might only give a boost equivalent to allowing a baseline human to physically match an Astartes, while something more narrow might allow the equivalent of Drach'nyen being able to fight the Emperor himself."
1636,,600,If It Takes Us A Thousand Years,Castlevania - Lament of Innocence,Benevolence,"Certain members of the church took it upon themselves to make sure that all of the letters that Mathias and Leon sent home did not make it all the way there, and to ensure that no letters from home made it to them. They believed the distraction would be detrimental to the crusade. Because of this, Mathia returned home mere moments before his beloved Elisabetha breathed her last. It broke him. It destroyed his faith in men, in god, and drove him to do horrible things. While you can still die, you have something to ease the pain. Reincarnation. Should you die, the jump will not end in a mere ten years. Instead it will continue, the clock ticking away as the years roll by. A minimum of one hundred years will pass, and then you will live again. Most of your powers, most of your memories will be gone, but fate will see you driven into the hands of your lovers, should they have managed to survive all this time. Once you reach the same age you died at, the ten year countdown will resume and you will gain your powers and memories back."
1637,,600,God Himself Is My Enemy,Castlevania - Lament of Innocence,Benevolence,"A pious man would never do this. A pious man would never even think of it. But you aren’t particularly pious anymore, are you? Some time in your past, you lost something, and it drove you to the brink of madness. The specifics are something that escapes me, but it seems that you have become the universes champion for magics dark, creatures foul, and acts profane. Because of this, your usage of those things... I’d say you were incredibly blessed with luck, but you’d probably stab me. Regardless, risky methods, absurdly dangerous plans, techniques that run the risk of a fate worse than death if you fail... all of these things go off without a hitch when it’s you doing them. Don’t worry about trying to absorb the power of that hundred year old and incredibly powerful artifact - it was made by men who wanted to spite god, you want to spite god, the thing was all but made for you, clearly."
1638,,600,Spirit-proof ,Yo-Kai Watch,Benevolence,"Well isn’t this interesting? It appears that since you’re not naturally from this world, you developed an absolute immunity to spiritual possessions, so yo-kai can’t inspirit you! This can prove to be very useful if a certain yo-kai’s inspiriting would serve as a hindrance in a certain situation. Of course, there are cases when inspiriting would serve to be useful, so you can toggle this on and off at will. Postjump this includes any power that tries to influence you in any way."
1639,,600,Magic rose,Grimms’ Fairy Tales,Benevolence,"Well, more like an anti-magic rose. Holding this rose you’ll be immune to the effects of magic on you. Magic flame and poison can’t harm you, curses won’t work etc. Touching a transformed being or object with this rose will return them to their normal form."
1640,,600,Curse breaker ,Grimms’ Fairy Tales,Benevolence,"You’re the promised prince. The one who is said to be able to lift the curse that has plagued the land for decades or the one that holds a sleeping beauty for a century or the one destined to slay the dragon. You won’t be able to undo all magic with a touch. You merely will always step into the role of the one that is destined to undo a great curse or evil or something similar. You must still overcome challenges if they present themselves, but you will at least be the one who could potentially succeed while others straight up couldn’t."
1641,,600,For Your Sake,Princess The Hopeful,Benevolence,"Few believe it, but it is the sincere goal of the Queen of Tears to protect those she cares about-even from themselves, if necessary. When you are truly determined to protect what is utterly important to you-be it a person, an object, even a kingdom, idea or legacy-even the vilest and most profane powers at your disposal can be infused with Lacrima magic to make them excel at protecting, defending and sustaining what you hold dear. Even Lacrima itself is affected, letting a wielder of Tears’ avatar defend groups with the power needed to protect individuals from harm. The greater your sacrifice, the greater your devotion to protect the more you can bend the nature of your powers to save those around you; perhaps a powerful practitioner of Lacrima could replicate the Queen of Tears’ creation of the realm Alhambra is sustained by on a small scale, weeping into existence a pond full of fish that can sustain a small commune. But many may be unwilling to trust a protector so vile as to sell the world out to the Darkness, and your devotion has given you one more gift: When you explain your genuine efforts to protect the smiles of those you truly care about, your sincerity is fully communicated and your devotion becomes infectiously reciprocated. They may not understand all the harm you inflict on their behalf, but at the very least you can break down crying in their arms knowing those who matter won’t doubt why you’re doing it."
1642,,600,All The Colours of the Wind ,Princess The Hopeful,Benevolence,"In the Court of Clubs, one need not be violent, nor charismatic, nor even truly sovereign to rule. The mark of its Queen is the capacity to be all those things, yet choose to be at peace with the world instead. Something in this has inspired a breakthrough in you, and when you act as a teacher or mentor to others you quickly share with them a sense of innate wellbeing and sagacious solace from the woes of the world. Violent louts bury the hatchet and grow beyond brute force around you. Leaders of all kinds turn to cooperation instead of backbiting and deception as long as you’re there to supervise the meeting. Nature itself not only undergoes prosperous growth while cleansing itself of both mundane and supernatural pollutants in a radius that grows with your stay, but actively protects those who treat it with respect; predation is part of the natural cycle of course, but showing respect to prey and never taking more than you need is the mark of a good hunter. Natural predators protect those who have so shared your teaching as if they were part of their pack, prey animals assist in daily chores so long as they are not approached with violence and even plants seem to grow in such a manner as to shelter you and your followers while providing hidden paths to ease your travel. Your blessing may be subtler than other Courts’, but with patience comes a modest greatness. All actions you take to spread harmony and provide aid without violence cascades outwards, provoking further beneficial change-and often through the actions of those you helped, be they man or beast."
1643,,600,Sing Your Heart Out,Princess The Hopeful,Benevolence,"Once more, with feeling! Your performance really does shine now-literally glowing with Light when you put your heart and soul into it. Even a sufficiently dramatic unveiling of your sculpture or painting accompanied by a heartfelt speech or song about how it’s merits embody the unwavering nobility of yourself and your allies can suffice, if you’re not a singer or musician. All around you those sworn to your goals fight harder, perform better, recover quicker and generally work harder on top of whatever bonuses your musical Charms or other beneficial magics grant them; with a couple other Troubadours working together to bolster your performance you could amp up the benefits of this too. Last but not least, all around you the land is not just saturated with Noble magic to the point of being consecrated but the Darkness, it’s taint and similar malign forces are harshly repelled as if restless spirits treading on sacred ground-save those truly obedient to your righteous cause. And this isn’t taking into account that your art concentrates and amplifies the Light in its purest form, spreading forth a wave of mystical benevolent forces that continue to make everything better around the site of your performance. All the world really is a stage, and as the star of the show you’ll make the night of your show one to remember."
1644,,600,Help The World,Princess The Hopeful,Benevolence,"True resurrection is a stupendous feat even for the Nobility, with the power needed to bring back another from death taking great concentration and leaving them at the brink of life. But if even death is not beyond the Light’s power to address, what more could be done through it? When you study the woes of the world, when you engage in deep meditation upon what you have learned and focus on your own will to offer treatment to it-notionally nothing is beyond your capacity to heal. Even the Abyss were to blight a town or you turned your hand to attempting to cure your vampire friend, the Light would reveal a ritual or other procedure by which you can restore the infected or wounded to a recoverable state. Extant conditions like old age, exhaustion or even death could be treated with the right resources and a powerful enough Princess. It will take time and effort, your success is not guaranteed and truly great destruction may be logistically beyond your bound to heal. But through the kindness and devotion of supporters and fellow practitioners, you can amplify your efforts through the pulse of the Light in order to bring succour to a world that has been suffering for far too long."
1645,,600,Lux Aeterna,Princess The Hopeful,Benevolence,"The battle between hope and despair is neverending, and come what may should you survive it here you’ll be able to continue mastering the power of Light and aiding others with it. But sensing your interdimensional nature, the Light learns of lands beyond this world of darkness where it’s nurturing touch could do much good. With your investment here you may become a beacon for the Light, radiating it into new worlds for others to harness. A novice Prince or Princess could merely cover a county in the Light, but as you grow in power with the Light and similar fonts of positive emotion you may cast a greater light around you. One with the power of a King or Queen could cast the Light over an entire Earth-sized planet. Any who are amenable to the Light’s values may become new Nobility and seek justice on their own terms in the world-although, as the Light’s partner in this you may also direct it to Enlighten specific individuals, though you yourself will have little influence over what Calling they rise to. The Light knows to do no harm above all though, and should you deem it necessary in a new world you may rescind all effects propagated by this perk-save selectively those affecting you alone.

Last but not least, for the gift of bearing the Light to other worlds you gain three blessings. The first, that anywhere you settle in and put a modicum of effort into loving, caring for and generally maintaining or refurbishing in accord with the Light’s values will gradually become a Blessed Place: A land of outstanding beauty in which aesthetic, intellectual or moral excellence (depending on the location’s function) is supported. Some locations may be easier to do this in than others; most prisons may require significant improvements to life quality, while a hospital will qualify simply by you administrating or working in it. Beings touched by the Light feel their sorrows fade away in that location, and based on the location’s function certain positive aspirations and efforts affiliated with it will be bolstered with subtle but profound inspirations-while opposing negative ones blunted in effort. The duration of your stay and the magnitude, necessary risks to self and consistency of the good deeds within will determine the length and intensity of this spread; just arriving you may cover only a small, well-cared for room but in months a hospital that routinely saves the lives of patients requiring critical surgery could beautify an entire city.

The second is simply a plethora of Wisps shared with you by the Light that shall grow as you master it’s principles; a novice Princess would have the total amount of Wisps as five or six of her peers. 

As for the third, while any Queen worthy of her crown would win her power from the adoration of her people the intensity of the Light shining through you allows you to develop a unique Avatar charm based on your understanding and values of the Light’s principles rather than the example blazed by a Queen. Even if you lack the usual mastery of such charms’ users, you may pay the usual costs to undergo a second transformation that grants a great power for the short while representing the fulfilment of your beliefs and ideals. Great changes in character by yourself or significant alterations in perspective may alter this transformation’s aesthetics and powers too. While this power is commensurate with those of the other Queens’, as it is not filtered through their specialities it does not apply the Invocation restrictions their does."
1646,,600,Dragonclaw,MTG - Tarkir                                ,Benevolence,"Of all the Khans, the leaders of the Temur are perhaps closest to the dragons - closest to nature. You are possessed of immense strength, enough to kill a bear with a single blow, and both you and those under your command are more resistant to magic which would imprison or control you the stronger you are. Additionally, you have a deep affinity for elementals and other natural spirits, able to understand them on an instinctive level, and live alongside them."
1647,,600,Chooser of Life,Valkyrie Anatomia,Benevolence,"Valkyries bear the great burden of selecting the souls of the dead, knowing that they will be subjected to further warfare after their death. You possess that most important of traits in a Valkyrie: a compassionate heart. You can ease the sufferings of your companions almost instinctively, understanding their feelings, listening to their stories and truly learning who they are, releasing them from any burdens, improving their capabilities by a proportionate amount. A light worry might not make much difference but helping a Half-Breed feel as though they have a place by your side or a home to belong would have a truly massive effect on their abilities.

Further, you have an insight into just how far the potential of your allies reaches, and the ability to guide them along the perfect path to improvement. This, alongside proving their merit in battle and overcoming their own flaws or weaknesses would allow an ordinary mortal to stand on even footing with the Gods and could bring the supernatural to even greater heights."
1648,,600,Get Serious,Touhou Luna Nights,Benevolence,"When defeated in battle for the first time in the fight, you can instantly heal yourself, refresh all your special abilities, and all your abilities will be roughly doubled until you are either defeated again or the battle ends. You need to be alive to use this ability, however. Making a dramatic speech about using your full power is recommended, but not necessary."
1649,,600,Grazier ,Touhou Luna Nights,Benevolence,"Narrowly dodging attacks and enemies restores your health, limited-use items and special abilities. Indeed, it is very easy to completely heal yourself and recover your abilities as long as you are good at near misses, however this gives diminishing rewards the more supernatural abilities stack your chances in your favour, such as grazing attacks that are frozen in the air while time is stopped. Still, with a bit of dodging it’s entirely possible to totally refresh yourself in the middle of a battle. Unfortunately, actually getting hit by the attack will naturally spoil this."
1650,,600,Dark Magic Resurrection,Disney’s American Dragon: Jake Long,Benevolence,You are a powerful dark magic user boosting the power of your spells. Though the real power doesn’t come until you die. When you die a ritual performed on you once per Jump will revive you good as new. This restores you to the prime of your life and undoes any injury that would be considered fatal to your current state.
1651,,600,Your Dad’s Fucking Dracula,Castlevania (Netflix) ,Benevolence,"You are no mere monster. Whether you were created or directly fathered by him- or perhaps adopted, if still a human- you are a child of Vlad Dracula Tepes, and therefore enjoy a greater degree of power than others of your kind. A vampire would find themselves second only to him in power, equivalent to Alucard, while other creatures of the night would surpass the greatest of their kind with ease. Vampires, sharing his curse, would gain speed that leaves them a blur, the ability to fly, and the ability to shapeshift into a wolf. Humans, too, would have much greater powers than others of their species, gaining the strength to toss other humans around, the speed to outrun horses, and a mind that could make them a master in whatever field they choose to devote themselves to with no problem. Finally- while this won’t have much use elsewhere- Dracula does think of you as his child, even if you do not support his genocide of humanity."
1652,,600,Holy Man,Castlevania (Netflix) ,Benevolence,"Oh blessed be the Lord, who has gifted thee with the ability to perform miracles in His name. By saying a prayer while holding a crucifix you can bless water to make it holy, allowing it to burn demonic and undead creatures to ash, and with the proper rites and materials you can consecrate a church or weapon in the name of the Lord, guarding the church and the faithful inside it against evil and making the weapon adept at slaying unnatural creatures. These blessings will remain without your presence to uphold them, letting you gift them to others, but only so long as your intended recipient doesn’t profane your gift in some way."
1653,,600,Heart of the Community,Amphibia,Benevolence,"Frogkind are considered the heart and soul of Amphibia’s society. Their rustic way of life has granted them a unique perspective among the beings that inhabit Amphibia. Now like them you share this perspective; you understand the strength that comes from working with another and building others up. From now on your power will increase in accordance with the number of people you work closely with, the closer you are to these people, the stronger you become. Strangers provide no boost, acquaintances provide a minor boost, friends provide a large boost, and family will provide the largest.

Boosted: Your calamity gem has changed to mimic Anne’s blue gem of heart. You may use the boost provided by “Heart of the Community” to assume a superpowered form that’s essentially an in-universe equivalent to Super Saiyan. All the base powers provided by the gems are more powerful; the enhanced physical abilities with an emphasis on speed and agility, flight, energy manipulation, and a limited form of telekinesis. All of these are stronger than the other calamity gems' power, to the point where you’d need to use the two other gems in unison to match it.

1654,,600,Loved by Lady Luck ,The Ghost and Molly McGee,Benevolence,"Life and Death dance a never-ending tango to the tune of Fate's capricious hand. Yet you, my dear, possess an extraordinary gift - Luck. It's the kind of Luck that can transform the mundane into the sublime, and make every day a symphony of unique experiences. With every flip of a coin, you call heads or tails with unfailing accuracy. Sweepstakes are your playground, where you always win, and the world of opportunity opens its doors to you, inviting you to climb the ladder of success with ease. The universe conspires in your favor, placing you in the right place at the right time for life-changing encounters that leave a lasting impact. Embrace your gift and savor every moment, for your life is a tapestry woven with golden threads of chance, woven by the hand of destiny, and illuminated by your Luck."
1655,,600,Humanitas,Vampire: The Masquerade,Benevolence,"No Clan clings to humanity like the Toreador. They may be mocked as fops, but no matter how much other Kindred may disdain humanity, it offers undeniable benefits in resisting the Beast. The spark of Humanity never withers in you unless you will it so. You can still feel and think like a human no matter how long you live, what kind of creature you become, or what strange experiences you have or lifestyle you lead. You always have the full supernatural benefits of the heights of Humanity no matter what your actual morality is like, and you count as similarly pure hearted for other litmus tests of morality, sanity, or stability."
1656,,600,The Bite,Vampire: The Masquerade,Benevolence,"Diablerie has always lurked in the heart of this Clan, even before Augustus Giovanni usurped its founder. Cappodcius’s original plan was to diablerize the source of Cain’s curse, God, in order to become a god himself. Augustus for his part was less ambitious, “merely” diablerizing an Antediluvian and usurping its clan. And while he didn’t manage to fully drink Cappadocius’s soul, he managed a better job of it than Tremere or the Lasombra and Tzimisce did. As for yourself, you never have to worry about side effects from absorbing someone else’s soul. They will always meekly surrender their power with no chance to usurp your body afterwords. Perhaps you should follow in your founder’s footsteps and seek out a member of the 3rd Generation yourself."
1657,,600,The Beast Unleashed,Vampire: The Masquerade,Benevolence,"As the Gangrel succumb more and more to Frenzy over the years, they accrue more and more bestial mutations. Rarely, very rarely, one of these may actually prove useful rather than being merely disfiguring. For you however, any effect that mutates your body will only do so in helpful ways. Instead of growing fur on your hand, you will grow a claw; instead of useless fins, gills. This applies no matter if the change comes from your Clan’s curse, an enemy using Vicissitude, hostile Life Magick, or some similar effect from beyond the world."
1658,,600,Armor of Will,Kill Six Billion Demons,Benevolence,"Realistically, most heroes would die early in their adventures. But that would be boring. You aren’t gonna die to something as petty as falling down the stairs, are you? You have plot armor, and this has the effect of being hard to kill, unless said attack was deliberate. You avoid accidents by centimeters, walk out of a building shortly before it explodes, and more. However, as was said earlier, if it's a deliberate attack against you, then this plot armor is less effective against that.

Boosted: Your plot armor increases to such an extent that only a deliberate, planned attack on your life would kill you.

Boost Requires Demiurge to Activate"
1659,,600,Force Unit,Wild Arms 2,Benevolence,"This mysterious crystal, as long as it is in contact or close with your skin, fills your body with energy and recovers your stamina, mental or physical. If you have this crystal you will never need to stop to rest your body, nor will you accumulate mental fatigue.

Only one person can benefit from this at a time and it takes a few minutes to start working. Separating from the crystal doesn’t cause any negative effects, just makes it so your stamina can be exhausted again."
1660,,600,Reflex         ,Wild Arms 2,Benevolence,"This pair of gauntlets possess a powerful defensive enchantment, it grows denser or harder to always provide the same relative level of protection to you as its base form would to an ordinary person, in case your skin gets more durable than normal. These gauntlets can also be used to reflect magic directly aimed at you, accepting only beneficial effects. They accept any upgrades you apply with the best possible results."
1661,,600,Overcoming Uncertainty ,Wild Arms 2,Benevolence,"Doggedly pursuing a target through obstacles and misfortunes can be troublesome, but you can succeed if you persist, because you have a special quality, your persistence can “force” probability to bring you results. By repeatedly failing an action over and over you can eventually attract the future you want and bring it to reality. You have a mental gauge within yourself that fills itself after failure, the more this gauge is filled, the stronger your influence over the future becomes. By spending this gauge you start to “feel” the right way to guide your actions in order to reach the result you want. The larger are the odds you are fighting the more you will need to try before becoming able to attract success so be prepared to face countless failures.

Every failure fills the gauge with the same amount and your mental gauge can only be filled with genuine failures, not calculated ones. You can choose when to switch from accumulation to spend your gauge. When you start spending it will guide your actions and bring you to advantageous situations even if you don’t have enough to force your success, so if you combine this luck with some skill you could attain your objectives anyway. It needs to be a possible future, this ability cannot bring the impossible after all. You will be able to instinctively tell if something is possible or not."
1662,,600,Heroes Do Not Die,Wild Arms 2,Benevolence,"A Hero embodies the will to show courage, they personify bravery, shake off doubts and steps forward following the road with the spiritual strength and willpower to never give up or accept defeat.

You have this courage, even being abandoned, blamed for a crime you didn’t commit and left to rot for years can’t make you despair. You have endless willpower that lets you choose to do the right thing in every aspect of your life and the manliness that transcends any preferences, attracting everything you want to attract. Once you make a decision, no foe can make you doubt yourself and stop you from moving forward and friends you make will always choose to believe in you if not given hard proof of betrayal.

In addition to your bravery, you get the ability to augment your whole body beyond your limits, greatly increasing your senses, strength and durability. In this state you can instinctively sense how to cause the most harm to your opponents, not only will your attacks be strengthened but also penetrate through any exotic defenses. Such power is not without cost, you will strain your whole body and spend a lot of energy while in this state and once knocked out of it, you won’t be able to augment your body for at least a day. With training and practice you can reduce this cooldown."
1663,,600,Multiversal Suffrage,Mage: The Ascension,Benevolence,"They say that the Consensus is decided by everyone’s collective opinions, but that’s not quite true. Vampires lose their avatars when they’re embraced. Spirits never had any to begin with. And what about widderslainte, born with inverted avatars who can only seek Descent instead of Ascension? But you can grant anyone the right to contribute to consensual reality. With but a moment’s concentration, you can forge a whole new avatar for someone who lacks one. It’s up to them to demonstrate the will needed to Awaken on their own, but now they have the same chance as any human. This applies even in future worlds, giving them the potential to learn Awakened magick. You may also grant any purchases you have of the Paradigm or Cross-Paradigm Training Perks to others, quite useful in preventing people from non-consensual realities from having their will-working tainted by their understanding of the unbending rules of their native worlds."
1664,,600,Power Shared Is Power Squared ,Cereza and the Stray Demon,Benevolence,"What do the terrifying Thorned Pestilence and a bumbling newly born demon have in common? A bond with their partner, be it through shared hatred or unlikely friendship, strong enough to surpass their limits. Your bond with summoners or others capable of empowering you with their own abilities transcends mere teamwork-when you fight for something you both believe in, you can exceed your own limits. Reaching new transformations and/or leaps of growth where all your powers and abilities spontaneously escalate, letting the young Cheshire compete with the great Lex Talionis in a fight. Moreover, you have some means of transmitting your form and semblance to your partner so they can use it in battle. Be it by creating a grand illusion with your shared traits, becoming a weapon they can use or giving them your likeness through the Demon Masquerade technique, you’ll never be far from a friend in need."
1665,,600,Strong Independent Demon ,Cereza and the Stray Demon,Benevolence,"What a bother it is to the denizens of Inferno, to be so powerful and yet so limited. Imagine what you could do if you didn’t need a witch’s assistance to simply survive outside your reality. Perhaps becomes of some strange, distant lineage you do not require such things like being summoned by a witch or incarnating in their hair to survive outside Inferno. You may use your full power and form freely, instead of being confined to a stuffed toy. Should you actually be summoned, you may still benefit from the powers of your partner while costing no magical energy to be maintained.

And if you are not a demon, you instead gain an immunity to undirected, passive environmental effects of all kinds. A demonic dragon might still burn you by setting the land ablaze, but you’ll be able to breathe in space with no issue and skip through the fiery pits of Hell as long as no will is consciously directing them to burn you."
1666,,600,Witch of Genesis,Cereza and the Stray Demon,Benevolence,"Arch-Eve Origin. The title assigned by a crafted tyrant from the far future to the Umbran Witch whose determination and strength was powerful enough to clash with his immutable truth. And now, there is another. Your soul contains a strength to it capable of challenging absolutes and inevitabilities. So long as you remain strong in spirit, you will prove remarkably hard to wipe from existence by esoteric means; a god must physically blast you with light or darkness, and cannot simply doom you to a miserable end. Moreover, as the ultimate X-factor no matter how bitter or sorrowful your life as long as you have concrete goals, your own determination twists fortune strongly in favour of accomplishing them. Guiding friends, powerful allies with mundane facades, discovering long-lost artifacts, it is no exaggeration to say that you are the main character of the multiverse. Even if you come across foes you cannot best or seemingly lose allies forever, so long as your spirit remains unbowed your sheer determination will provide second winds and unique chances to seize victory from the jaws of defeat. Last but not least, this comes with a tremendous amount of magical energy equal to Cereza’s own. Coupled with the above, you could unlock advanced Umbran magical techniques such as Witch Time even as a child-and as an adult, seemingly sacrificial techniques like offering your heart to a demon to unleash it’s Deadly Sin form could be done repeatedly. It all comes back to you, now. You have come to the foreground of reality’s stage, and everyone’s waiting with baited breath to see you dance. Even if you start with baby steps for now, in time you could work fate and chance like a pole.

If you wish, you may take Cereza’s place in this timeline (or be an iteration of Cereza) but you must also take the In The Spider’s Web drawback for no CP."
1667,,600,No one said being a Witch Hunter would be easy,The Owl House V1,Benevolence,"It surely isn't, Philip needed to corrupt his very being and consume the souls of palismans to keep himself alive for 400 years, change his identity, manipulate all of the Boiling Isles into believing that Wild Magic was dangerous so that they would submit to his will through fear, fight against those who wanted to overthrow him, manipulate an extremely powerful being into teaching him a lot of things, prepare the Draining Spell and the Day of Unity, only to be stopped by the extremely powerful being he manipulated and almost die. Emphasis on ""almost die"". Philip managed to survive a blow that should be fatal, that guy is like a cockroach, extremely hard to put down for good. And now so are you. You will be gifted with a Regenerative Healing Factor, allowing you to survive almost everything this setting has to throw at you, though The Collector and/or Titan Luz could maybe defeat you. But the good thing is, at least once per jump (or once every 10 years) you get a second life, regardless of how much you are disintegrated, blown up, what have you. When your Healing Factor can't handle it, you will somehow survive it and regain your body with time. This can be toggled on and off.

Boosted: The Titan Blood increases your Regenerative Healing Factor to a point where a combined effort of: The Collector, Titan Luz, Eda, King, All Coven Heads, among a lot of other beings in the Boiling Isles would be required to destroy you beyond the capacity of your Healing Factor to do anything. But even then, you now have two second lifes, so you should be alright. This can be toggled on and off.

Every ten years, you can share a version of said characteristic with 10% of the original power, with a maximum of 1200 beings. You can also share a 50% version with 600 beings and a 90% version with 300 beings. Those beings will lose said characteristic ten years after receiving them from you, but every ten years, you can select one being to get a 100% version and keep it permanently. Though this doesn’t necessarily guarantee those beings won’t turn against you after receiving said characteristics, so do be cautious when sharing your powers, will ya?

Boosted: The Titan Blood coursing through your veins greatly improves your ability to share characteristics. Now, every ten years, you can share a version of said characteristic with 10% of the original power, with a maximum of 2400 beings. You can also share a 50% version with 1200 beings and a 90% version with 600 beings. Those beings will lose said characteristic ten years after receiving them from you, but every ten years, you can select two beings to get a 100% version and keep it permanently. And now, as long as the target agrees with following the terms you establish, in exchange for the characteristic; he/she/it won’t be able to disobey them.

1669,,600,Chosen of Khaine,Warhammer Fantasy: Dark Elves,Benevolence,"You have seen the face of your god, and it is gloriously crimson. While many bear the Runes of Khaine that provide his blessing and protection, you are a true herald preordained to represent Khaine’s will in the mortal world long before the first great sacrifice of Har Ganeth took place. In your dreams and waking hours alike, violent whispers reveal to you all the ways of slaughter and malign portents writ in blood. Where blood flows, or your visions guide you, or where the heat of battle is thick, divine power flows through you to execute Khaine’s will with a might beyond mortal measure. The Blessings of Khaine come more swiftly and spontaneously to you than any other as you continue to shed blood, his divine representative in the mortal world, and others will intuitively recognise it: Both the faithful, those subsumed in violence, and soon-to-be sacrifices cowed by an unnatural terror. Perhaps if Khaine himself were ever to be laid low, you moreso than any other would be guided to his legacy-and fear not, your investment here ensures all the favour of being Khaine’s chosen even after whatever dark fate awaits the god himself."
1670,,600,Corset of the Chain,Final Fantasy Tactics,Benevolence,"Clothing blessed by a ‘goddess’. This mystic item can be worn by either gender, it’s not always actually a corset that’s the just it’s default form, and provides benefits beyond the pale of many other armements held in this world. This mythical armor protects completely against dangerous forms of Gravity, Flame, Lightning, and Wind manipulation and even the powers of Holy, Water, Ice, and Earth manipulations are halved in their effectiveness. That effect is in addition to the massive boost to your physic that you gain from donning the blessed bustier. You may import other forms of armor and accessories into this legendary laundry, if you so wish, to compile the cloths forms and abilities."
1671,,600,A Unique Existence,Final Fantasy Tactics,Benevolence,"You’re a being that is, in a word, a singularity. You will never have a problem with foes copying your style, techniques, or even doppelgangers taking your shape. There is only one of you and this fact is so immutable that even acts that would shift reality are flat out ignored unless you grant your express permission. Whilst this won’t shield you from, say, the established systems of magic and weapon arts or more esoteric methods, such as dragging the air out of the space you stand in, it can stop the God from just erasing your existence with an effort of will."
1672,,600,Blessed By God,I’m The Grim Reaper,Benevolence,"If God has his favorites in creation, you are obviously one of them. The main signal of this is your extreme luck, capable of matching even a literal god of luck in your best days. You’ll win games of chance and gambles with an almost perfect chance of victory, skills with little chance of properly working will basically work almost always with them failing occurring just once a year, your enemies’ weapons suddenly stopping working or even literally breaking sometimes and your opponents suffering from their bad luck, such as they developing sudden illnesses, failing on front of their weaknesses or just tripping over their own feets. Again, obviously, luck won’t always save you and sheer stupidity, like challenging an extremely powerful enemy, like a Prime Archangel or a First Reaper, or jumping into a volcano, will still definitely kill you. This perk also greatly boosts the power of any luck perk that you might have, including the ones from other jumps.

Boosted: You’re maybe one of God's favorites, but luck isn’t the only blessing you might receive. Firstly, any divine being, including deities and similar existences, will have a positive first impression of you, usually paying attention to you without considering you worthless just because you’re a mortal, with most of them considering you as a possible ally or even a friend in some cases depending on their proximity with you. Unless you’re directly hostile to them, they’ll, at the worst scenario, maintain a neutral attitude towards you. In addition to this, you’re also able to form deals with divine entities to enable you to permanently or temporarily channel a portion of their godlike power to gain access to their abilities and/or knowledge. The exact details of each deal depend on the conditions established during its formation, with some deities requiring only worshipping, others just wanting to gift you and others may ask for specific things instead. These deals can also be canceled by you at any time if you want to.

1673,,600,A Pale Dream,Guild Wars 2,Benevolence,"Due to your unusual nature, you are shielded from all outside influences. The Nightmare? The Elder Dragons? None may breach the sanctity of your body, mind and soul, and you stand above them, adamant and unyielding, regardless of whatever trickery or twisted means they may employ. Be Yourself, Jumper."
1674,,600,Apex of the Hoard,Beast: The Primordial,Benevolence,"Valuable objects, both magical and mundane, just seem to find there way to you. Unless you put effort into actually stealing from people (which you are quite good at), most of the valuables that enter your possession are things that no longer have an owner. Sometimes it feels like your Lair is the place all important things that have been lost or forgotten eventually end up. As a creature of legend, there might even be some truth to this."
1675,,600,The Hero of the Story,Beast: The Primordial,Benevolence,"Everyone knows how the story is supposed to go. The hero slays the monster and saves the day. As much as Beasts may say they're fighting destiny by flipping the script, it really does feel like the deck is stacked against you every step of the way, and at the end of the day, you were born to job. Not anymore though. You may be a an underdog, but people love an underdog, even a very bland and two dimensional one. And you're going to end this story right. Fate seems to smile on you when fighting an enemy who is more powerful than you. You'll find yourself having lucky breaks, allowing you to foil their tricks and schemes. In combat, your blows will strike harder and truer than they should, and your enemies always seem to whiff. When it comes to the defense of others, you are a truly dangerous foe in combat as you push yourself harder than you thought possible. You won't even be doing your monster-slaying on your own, as worthy companions will flock to your side. The best part is that no matter how much you defy the odds, stronger enemies always seem to underestimate you. "
1676,,600,A Myth that Won't Die,Beast: The Primordial,Benevolence,"Incarnate Beasts must maintain their Myth to continue to receive the benefits of their elevated state, but such effort is not required from you. Your story and legacy are not ones to be forgotten or erased. Any attempts to do so are quickly seen through or subverted. In this perk’s most mundane form, all attempts to suppress such information without your permission fail as people continue to talk about you in secret. Erasing people's memories fail too, as people begin to recall such information shortly after it's removed from their mind. Even using time travel fails to work, as the information continues to circulate as an urban legend without a source, even as it ceases to be literally true. Since a Beast and their Legend are so tightly woven together, these benefits also apply to you. Even better, you can never simply be erased from existence, and if time travel were used to change your past or kill you, you would recall both versions of the event and continue to exist as you are, plus any positive alterations that may have occurred from the temporal changes. This protection even extends to those you care about as long as they've played an important part in the story of your life, even if nobody has heard of them."
1677,,600,Written on the Scroll of Ages ,Mummy: The Curse,Benevolence,"The Sesha-Hebsu believe that history, indeed reality, is a god, the words of history tattooed on his flesh. Some of the Sesha-Hebsu make a practice of censoring blasphemous truths from their own records, sure that the flesh of the Scroll of Ages should not be defiled by such “lies.” The strongest can take this even further, erasing someone entirely. You are immune to such effects that would utterly erase you from reality, such as the Uterrance called Redacting the Word. Even more exotic attacks, such as an Exarch erasing the symbol of you from the Supernal Realms or a time traveler killing your grandfather before he sires your father, will fail to remove you from reality."
1678,,600,Unending ,Mummy: The Curse,Benevolence,"The sabotaged Rite of Return cursed the Shan’iatu of the Akhem-Urtu to never leave the material world. They will continue to arise until the end of time, no matter if their bodies are destroyed, their canoptic jars smashed, and humanity is driven to extinction so that there are no more corpses for them to possess. Like them, after death you will revive when called back by your cultists or once every 1461 years, forming a new body from nothing if required. But that’s not useful to you on your chain, so as a bonus the first time you die in each jump, your chain will not end. Instead you will enter henet, a death cycle in which your spirit roams free from your corpse, returning to unlife after many days with your Sekhem slightly weakened. If you were already on the last dregs of Sekhem, you will instead have to wait until your cult revives you or you are automatically awoken by someone despoiling your tomb, though the upside of this is that your Sekhem will be fully restored. You cannot repeat this feat again until the next jump and if you haven’t revived by the end of the jump you fail the chain just as if you were dead."
1679,,600,The Power to Share,Bleach,Benevolence,"Every one hundred years, they say, a special Quincy is born. Born crippled, without their senses and in a fragile state. Born without the ability to make use of the energy around them. In ages past, these poor things were often killed early on in superstitious fear. Their family had no idea of their true potential. But you survived, the true nature of your power slowly restoring and empowering your body, until your wounds disappeared and you regained the Quincy powers that are your birthright. 

With a touch and acceptance from each side, you can impart a fragment of your soul to another being. All ailments of the recipient, be they physical or mental or spiritual, will be healed by the process. In return, the fragment would be engraved with all the knowledge, skills and talents of the person who received the fragment. The price? A severe reduction in lifespan for the recipient and on their death, the fragment would return to you with all it has gathered. Not just the mental traits but also the stolen lifespan and even a significant amount of the spiritual energy the host once held. These fragments can only be gathered and absorbed in your sleep, the dead treasures combining into your being once you enter the slumber.

If you go beyond mere contact, and trade a drop of your blood, you can awaken the powers of a Quincy in another individual. While this only grants the base traits of a pure Quincy, and is quite incompatible with Hollow Reiryoku, it also binds them to you. Resisting your commands will prove a terrible struggle if bound and you may find a way to sustain your life so long as your bound Quincy remain. Your presence will do them more than enough good to pay recompense, as one who can share as you do will naturally reinforce greatly the speed at which Quincy develop. Both their Quincy powers and spiritually in general. 

The final step you have available is to allow Quincy to drink deeply of a cup of your blood, imbued with a significant fraction of your soul. This ritual will inscribed a Letter into their spirit, allowing them to awaken a unique power suited to the Letter and their own personality. The potential for these ‘Schrift’ varies, based half on overall spiritual power and half on affinity for Quincy abilities. While all Schrift start weak and must be developed, some will end as merely a hardening of the skin or manipulation of fire. Others reach a stranger height, even making the imaginary into reality. 

There is a downside to your nature. You must continue to share and reclaim from others or else face the prospect of slowly returning to your natural state. Blind, deaf, dumb and helpless in every way. Though it will never kill you, you must always be aware that you rely on the spirits of others to maintain your existence. Hardly fitting for a King. 

With time and experimentation, it may be possible to uncover new ways to use this power. Yhwach would eventually create techniques that allowed him to resurrect from death so long as the Quincy baring his soul fragments still lived, as well as a method to steal back the fragments and Quincy power in general to redistribute as pleased."
1680,,600,Jaeger,Bleach,Benevolence,"What happens when you take a Hollow utterly obsessed with evolution and bring him to the peak of power? Sometimes you a rather special example of the race. You possess an active evolutionary trait that allows you to adapt to threats even without the consuming of souls. Exposure to something and survival of it will cause resistance to begin to build up. Surviving a deadly Quincy poison and returning to a healthy state would likely leave you with a strong resistance to toxins of all kinds, not just that one poison. The more specific it is, and more powerful the threat, the quicker this adaptation will develop. Being cut or crushed is likely to only give very small gains even when critically injured but exposure to unique Kido spells or strange drugs that the mad scientists keep making would return a rapid resistance or outright immunity. You need to survive it first, a Hollow has to prove it’s worthy to be the king of the pack, but you’ll only get harder to kill as you live longer. "
1681,,600,Base Mixture,Bleach,Benevolence,"At the end of the day, we’re all humans here. Shinigami, Hollows, Quincy, just about everyone has a human as their basis regardless of what racial supremacy they might spout. Humanity is the base foundation and maybe that’s why they’re so malleable, with such potential to be altered. More than most, your being is open to modifications and change. Experiments or enhancements that have to do with the mixing of the races have a much greater chance of success and a much lower chance of any sort of complication. 

Hybridisation, often a fraught endeavour, seems almost natural to you. So much so that it might happen entirely accidentally. A Plus spirit whose spirit chain begins to hollowify would be much more likely to somehow absorb that hollowfication without losing their self, becoming a mixture of both soul and hollow without the need of soul science or magic. Even impossible mixtures, like the normally poisonous combination of Quincy and Hollow reiatsu, are possible. 

Your children will also share these traits, if desired and in part or full, allowing you to easily pass on things that probably shouldn’t be passed on. How does a Shinigami child naturally develop a Zanpakuto spirit, without ever touching an asauchi? He inherited it, clearly. "
1682,,600,Exposure Therapy,Bleach,Benevolence,"A normal human, fated to never give a meaningful contribution to this battle between life and death, right? It’d sure suck to be friends with the guy who saves the world, if he forgets about you in the process. But if you can stick around long enough, this might help you stay relevant. Exposure to power will very slowly cause related powers to develop in you too. The constant presence of a uncontrolled source of spiritual power will quickly awaken your own spiritual awareness and very slowly unlock spirit powers of your own. This might mean gaining enhanced physical abilities and the power to create fire or even lucking into a more unique ability, if you had secret potential of your own. 

Achingly slow compared to naturally gained powers, you can still slowly develop in power and ability from exposure, then start training what you’ve gained intentionally. This isn’t limited to just supernatural power sources but long term exposure to intense sources of mundane power can be quite hazardous. You might develop something useful from sitting around a nuclear power plant all day but are the health problems really worth it?"
1683,,600,In Hoots We Trust,Gloryhammer,Benevolence,"The belief you inspire in your allies boosts their own capabilities beyond their normal limits. All of your allies, followers and companions gain a noticeable boost to all of the skills and attributes, with the strength of the effect being proportional to the amount of faith they have in you.

Boosted: Hootus Dei

The more powerful you are personally, the more exaggerated this ability’s effect is. At low levels, a friend who knows you have their back will react quicker to danger and be safer for it. At higher levels, even the least of those who worship you will spontaneously be able to perform miraculous feats of strength and skill as if through divine intervention, if their faith be true.

1684,,600,The Fires of Ancient Cosmic Destiny,Gloryhammer,Benevolence,"Fate swirls around you like a turbulent river, conspiring to place you in pivotal roles in matters of great significance. Fortune will smile upon you, allowing you to find assistance and resources in the most unlikely places. You will never be killed or permanently incapacitated in anything but the most dramatic and important of circumstances. If you seek allies, you will attract those with the weight of destiny upon them—once-and-future kings, destined warriors and chosen ones will be drawn into your orbit.

Boosted: The Legend of You

The weight of your personal destiny supersedes and overwrites all others. Even if only the prophesied king should be able to draw the sword from the stone, you will be able to as well. A weapon useable only by the chosen one will respond to your hand just as easily. If the tyrant may only be slain by the destined warrior, your blade will also suffice for the deed.

1685,,600,God,Seven Deadly Sins,Benevolence,"A power sourced from the Demon King. The usage of God lets you instantly negate any and all magical attacks or effects against you. Even things that are much stronger than you will be nullified once you activate this ability. However, there is a one second delay between uses of this ability that is enforced, which speedy attackers can take advantage of to hit you with magic anyway."
1686,,600,Full Counter/Physical Counter,Seven Deadly Sins,Benevolence,"You’ve gained the power to reflect attacks back upon your opponent. No matter their strength, you can reflect it back at the opponent with a little over double the power of the original attack. This has several limitations however. You must actively parry these attacks and if you are not fast enough, or cannot read the nature or timing of an attack, then you will not be able to reflect it. Furthermore, there are two variations on this technique, only one of which may be taken with each purchase of the power. The first is Full Counter, which can only reflect Magic attacks and is ineffective against indirect attacks or purely physical blows. The second is Physical Counter, which can only reflect purely physical attacks and is useless against magic or indirect attacks. Both of these versions can also choose to simply make an incoming attack vanish instead of reflecting it or store the damage of attacks within themselves by taking the hit and the damage head on instead of reflecting it, releasing all that stored damage twice over against a specific enemy later on.

1687,,600,Zombie,Seven Deadly Sins,Benevolence,"You drunk from a Fountain of Youth. You drunk all of a Fountain of Youth to be more specific. Somehow you found another one and stole away with the gift of immortality. You possess a body that is completely immortal and will heal quickly from any damage. No matter the damage done to your physical form, it will never kill you, no matter how badly you are torn apart or how much are you is burnt away to nothing. You do not need to eat or drink, thus never fearing starvation, and you never need to fear death from old age as you no longer age. You cannot even be affected by poisons or diseases. The only thing that can kill you now is by attacking your soul directly. Of course, whilst you are immortal and regenerating, there are weapons and abilities that can force your body to heal at the normal rate or even to leave scars."
1688,,600,Heretic,Seven Deadly Sins,Benevolence,"The Great Witch Merlin professes an innate ability to resist the laws of the Ten Commandments, a set of ten absolute abilities that would normally only be resisted by the other Commandments and the very greatest of the Goddess and Demon Clans. Supposedly as a result of her ancestry including a particularly powerful demon, you too share this trait with her now. Effects that would normally be ‘Absolute’, even if only against certain categories of being, are not so much anymore against you. Oh, if you lack power in comparison to the foe using this ability, it will in effect be almost as perfect an ability as normal. Rather, if you are weaker than or equal to the foe, all this will grant is the chance, potentially a very small one indeed, to dodge or block that effect when you ordinarily could not. This chance will be greater the closer you are to that foe’s power and will continue to grow even if the foe is weaker than you. If you are sufficiently powerful in comparison to your foe, to the level that a battle between the two of you would be an effortless win without this ability of theirs being taken into question, this won’t be a matter of chance anymore, their supposedly perfect power will simply not be so anymore, weakened in the face of your obvious superiority. "
1689,,600,Predestined for Greatness,Seven Deadly Sins,Benevolence,"The prophecies have already been told long before you were born. A new King will rise and lead his nation to greatness. Fate has already decreed your ultimate destiny and thus any attempted alternate ends to your story must be truly mighty to force your fate to meet its end. Events that might lead to your death often decide to not do so, with you managing to escape just barely alive when you would have died. So long as you strive for greatness and Kingship, this protection will remain strong and unmarred but there are fair number of foes deadly enough that they might overpower even a destiny as great as yours. And remember, this destiny only cares for your survival. A King is nothing if he cannot claim the throne for himself all this fate will do is ensure that you do not die an ignoble fate to some unimportant commoner."
1690,,600,Apostle,Seven Deadly Sins,Benevolence,"A long lost Apostle of the Goddesses, thought to have largely disappeared from the world, unlike what few Druids are left in Britannia. You’ve discovered both your heritage and the ability to use these holy powers to benefit other beings. You have incredible, innate powers of healing that require little effort on your behalf. Unlike the Druids or the magic of the Goddesses, this is not reliant on individual spells but raw magical power. Even at the beginning you can heal the wounds of dozens or hundreds of combatants at once and even bring back to life those who have died in the last few minutes. As your power improves, the range and area that your powers will increase. Apostles who also take the Druids option find that they have already mastered their new powers. They are able to heal a small army at once and bring back those who have been dead for very long times even without a body, though no more than once will their ghost return from the afterlife. "
1691,,600,Gonna Need a Better Prison,Seven Deadly Sins,Benevolence,"The Goddess Clan may have struck the final blow in the ancient war with their sealing of the Demon Clan 3000 years ago but it was hardly the first time such an event occurred. Sealing away beings or whole Clans was seemingly a popular alternate choice to those who couldn’t or wouldn’t kill them outright. You are always able to avoid these fates however, as there is not a thing that can keep you imprisoned in one place. No prison or binding, whether physical or magical or stranger than either, can limit the freedom with which you move. Prison doors are left unlocked or walls crumble before you, magic spells fray apart in front of your eyes and even the great Coffin of Eternal Darkness would crack open just enough for you to pass through. "
1692,,600,King of Man,Seven Deadly Sins,Benevolence,"Much like the Once and Future King himself, you are destined to rule over all of mankind. At least, that is the feeling that human beings get when they look upon you. Even if they’ve already promised their allegiance to another, when a human being sees you, they recognise you as their true, rightful King and know that the only right thing to do would be to follow your orders as if you were their King in oath, instead of just feeling. This is not mind control or domination, just human beings realising that they want to follow you and your kingdom, so they can deny orders that would result in things they absolutely disagree with, at least until you know each other better or change the circumstances. This can be counteracted by other highly charismatic, strongly willed and powerful human leaders as well, competitors for the throne if you will. Unlike them, you possess one additional ability, the ability to awaken Holy Knight Abilities in your followers. Not all will be strong enough in body and mind to take it but those who are will find themselves with greatly increased physical and magical power, along with possessing an innate magical ability of their own like all Holy Knights. As a King of your race, this perk also confers a bonus Power Level of 20,000 onto you."
1693,,600,True Immortality,Dragon Ball Super,Benevolence,"To never age, never be harmed and never die. The meaning of true immortality and now your new true form. You have become genuinely and truly immortal. No attack, no matter how strong, can kill you and you appear strangely immune to energy based attacks. You can be harmed by physical blows and even torn to pieces by them but your body will almost instantly reset to your healthy prime, taking just seconds to recover from any injury, no matter how severe. Even attacking your mind or soul is utterly futile. Unlike a normal immortal of this place, you have the ability to grow in power or change over time if you wish and will not suffer degradation of your perfect form just by adding in the cells of a mortal being. Perhaps you could even learn to pull the same trick Zamasu did to become Infinite Zamasu, creating clones of yourself or infecting spacetime itself. However, despite all of this, it is possible for you to be destroyed. You cannot be killed but if something, such as Zeno-Sama’s Erase power, were to erase your very existence, then you would still be destroyed. Anything short of negating your very existence, and it still requiring an immensely powerful user of such abilities to do so, will be ignored and made pointless. "
1694,,600,Jumper Is Stronger Than Time,Dragon Ball Super,Benevolence,"Power is all that matters in this world. Skill helps, strange abilities help, allies help but in the end they’re all going to bow before sheer power. Whether you have the sheer power you’re after yet or not, you most certainly know the way to use it. Through the application of raw power, you are able to break through any kind of special ability, strange effect or ‘hax’. If someone stops time, you can break through and continue moving as normal simply by possessing more raw power than your opponent. A power that allows someone to rot the flesh of anyone they came into contact with would fail on you simply because you were just too strong for the opponent to hurt. Even someone hiding in a different dimension may not hold up against you, as you smash your way to their little pocket hide-away with raw strength. The stranger and stronger the ability, the greater the difference in power there must be between you and your opponent, but nothing is ultimately too absolute or weird for you to crush. "
1695,,600,Will of the Trailblaze,Honkai: Star Rail,Benevolence,"You are a true inheritor of the will of Akavili, Jumper. This perk comes with many effects. The first is that you have increased charisma: you will almost never be in danger from a misunderstanding unless the other party is totally unreasonable or you are completely unable to communicate with them, and you will also be better able to convince friends to leave the safety of their homes and explore the stars with you. The next effect is that you will gain increased conviction in what you believe to be right. This will not make you blind to the obvious if you are in the wrong, but it will make you immune to villainous words meant to poison your mind and could even allow you to sway the hearts of others in your own right. The final effect is that you will gain luck that borders on plot armor. While this does not guarantee victory, it means that you will be much more likely to succeed in your endeavors and that at the very least your journey won’t come to an end because of a stupid mistake or freak accident."
1696,,600,Mystilzla,Frieren - Beyond Journey's End,Benevolence,"Curses are the bane of humanity. A type of magic that cannot be defended and cannot be reversed by them, as their principles are not understood. However, there is a special type of magic known by the great Sage Serie. One that can only be learned after at least a hundred years of practice, and even more decades to perfect it: the Curse Revesal Magic - Mystilzla.

Whether through your own efforts, or due to Serie granting the spell to you via Fearvelia, you have come to learn this spell. Its mechanism is simple, but extremely effective. By spending a great amount of mana and activating it as the enemy casts their own spell, they can reverse the effects of any spell cast upon them and throw them back to the caster, even those that don’t follow any known magical principles.

In future worlds, you may extend the usage of Mystilizla to other targeted magical effects."
1697,,600,Divine Favour,Virgil’s Aeneid,Benevolence,"Your piety has been noticed jumper, and you will find it rewarded frequently during your time here. Deities and other immensely powerful beings find themselves fond of you, and now and in future settings will often grant you boons and benefits befitting their nature. Vulcan may grant you a hand-forged shield, while an eldritch being is more likely to drive your enemies insane. Regardless, such favours are great gifts, and assuming you react with gratitude, may lead to even greater rewards in the future."
1698,,600,Invoke the Muses,Virgil’s Aeneid,Benevolence,"The Muses are the divinities which govern the arts, to whom all epic poets must address their works. Before any creative endeavour, you too may dedicate your work to the Muses and call upon them to assist you, and receive divine inspiration in return. You will work more efficiently and skillfully in this state, and the quality of whatever you are creating or performing will be substantially enhanced."

Much like her, your very being radiates light, this makes others feel at ease and drives back the darkness of evil and monsters who will avoid places where you remain for long unless it happens to be saturated with enough darkness to drive out your light.

Boosted: Source of Light

Nevermind, it seems that you are an even greater source of light that princess Sarah is. Your presence actively drives back darkness and negativity, monsters of darkness,chaos and discord shrink back in your presence. You can make the world a better place simply by existing.

You’ve come upon an insight adjacent to the Shift Consequences Exploit without any of its risk for exposure. When something or someone important to you is in immediate danger, you are instantly aware and you can gauge the extent (if not necessarily the nature) of the damage. You can then instantly choose to take the consequences onto yourself. The Idigam’s jaws miss the monument, the man blinks as the unholy curse washes over him, the tower stands tall in defiance of the meteor that would have flattened it. You bear all the cost.

1703,,600,Hope,The Seven Deadly Sins,Benevolence,"The user is able to tap into the hope of their allies, allowing them to generate a magical aura around their body, or part of it. This aura can be used in several different ways such as creating mini yous or enhancing your strength in leaps and bounds as well as healing and even flight. This is a Hero Type magic and is one of the few to have ever been recorded. This ability has far more to it then it seems so hope you have fun."
1704,,600,Lucky Bastard,The Seven Deadly Sins,Benevolence,You have this insane luck that lets you push through and defy the terrible and horrifying odds whether that be getting saved in the nick of time by your friend or your lover deciding to sacrifice themselves for you so that you can live by giving you the fountain of youth and then for the next long long years you try and bring her back and on a trip from purgatory you learn how to gift things like that immortality away and you bring her spirit back from the dead. You have the luck that eventually leads you through hardship and gives you everything in the world. This insane luck that works on the small as well as the large. You dodge that strike that should have killed you by falling on your ass or you barely get hit by your opponents ultimate strike. This luck is quite intense as well and always pulls out the right random circumstance. Be careful though. You're quite lucky but house always wins in the end y'know?
1705,,600,Immortality ,The Seven Deadly Sins,Benevolence,"You have gained the Immortality of the Fountain of Youth. The power to live through any physical damage no matter how grave. Even suffering your entire top half being turned into nothing but blood you would still eventually return to your origin form. There are various other things such as your ability to basically ignore pain so that you don’t go insane getting your lungs ripped out or your arms torn off or something. You also have some really great tasting blood. Your blood is basically the top tier SSS-Class for vampires and other blood drinkers. You do have a few weaknesses. This doesn't make you invulnerable so you have to heal from damage and neither your soul nor your mind are protected from damage so demons and illusion casters are your worst enemies at this point as well as their being certain things that can permanently injure you such as the Purgatory Fire of the High Ranking demons and certain specific powers. Your blood also assists plants in their growth and other such things. Just don’t let anyone turn you into a blood pack or a sprinkler you hear? You gain an increase of 5,000 to your power level and once every ten years you may sacrifice your immortality to truly revive someone from death. It will return after your jump or ten years."
1706,,600,Fateless Circle​,Generic Exalted,Benevolence,"You are the master of your Fate and no other. Attempts to hinder you through prophecy or the manipulation of Destiny fail outright, attempts to divine your location, your actions, your intentions, or indeed anything at all about you using supernatural methods simply do not work upon you. This protection can be shared with those close to you, no more than eight at a time, and this protection never interferes with your own abilities or methods. You may grant this protection with a touch and at no cost, and it lasts until you revoke it which may be done at will regardless of where they are in relation to you.

In Creation Fate is a powerful thing and you are perhaps the only being that is not subject to it, and can not be made subject to it, in any shape or form. In future jumps this works on similar abilities. As a side benefit individuals that use such abilities will not realize you possess this protection, their predictions and visions seeming to be accurate but, in truth, failing to account for you. Additionally so long as you're striving towards greatness you will find that matters smooth themselves out for you. You will not be hindered by petty regulations and bureaucrats, search teams and hunters will miraculously skip past you or arrive just after you have left, and events will occur in such a fashion that you rarely if ever suffer from major setbacks.

Be warned however, while your Fate is in your hands you must truly strive for greatness if you wish to really benefit from this. Living a life of mundanity will not accord you any benefits at all beyond protection from the manipulations of destiny that your enemies might use to find you. Finally you may use this ability to, once per jump, avoid death. Any time you would otherwise be killed this ability will activate and prevent you from dying. Your various pools of energy will be refilled, you'll be restored to full health, and any mind altering or compulsion effects you labored under will be broken. This is a perfect conceptual effect. Post-Chain this is once every ten years."
1707,,600,Revenger,Final Fantasy XVI,Benevolence,"For how petty Hugo was, it can’t be denied that he managed to cause great damage to the hideout even though their leader Cid had once managed to escape Bahamut after an unsuccesful attempt at destroying Sanbreque’s mother crystal. This offers a boost to your power and luck when opposing someone that has wronged you. It of course depends on how much they harmed you and people you care about. If someone merely passed you in a queue it would be an extremely minor boost but if they had harmed or even killed someone you considered the love of your life it would be strong enough a boost in power and luck that you could easily dismantle their operations and force them into hiding for years to come. 

Boosted: Best Served Cold

On top of greatly boosting the effects of the previous perk such that you would gain the boost for even minor slights against you. This also makes it a guarantee that you will be able to find whoever wronged you regardless of where they may hide. Perhaps a sentry managed to follow them or you manage to convince an ally of theirs to rat them out but you will find them regardless and when you do they will regret ever crossing you.

1708,,600,Protagonist Material,Final Fantasy XVI,Benevolence,You gain a growth speed similar to Clive’s such that he was able to defeat the Head Knight at 15 and was capable of slaying Benedikta as Garuda the second time he became Ifrit. This guarantees that you will be able to quickly adapt and grow into any role you choose to take. This also guarantees that you won’t die an accidental death and that your enemies will be extremely reluctant to kill you for reasons of their own even if they are much stronger than you such that you could easily grow to match them over time. This also massively boosts the power of your Eikon form if you have one such that even a weaker Eikon could throw down with the likes of Bahamut and Odin.
1709,,600,Strength of Heracles,Greek Myth,Benevolence,"Heracles is but one of the many beings famed for their strength, and now you join the ranks of these heavy hitters. Your strength is without peer on the battlefield. Your blows could cause even the god of war to be forced backwards, push away rivers, or even hold up the sky for a moment. Furthermore you can apply this strength without causing unwanted effects that would normally come from world shaking strength such as collateral damage from your attacks or large structures you pick up shattering.

Boosted: Strength of Heracles has the scope of its boost increased. No longer will your strength greatly outstrip all other aspects of your body. Now it is in proportion to both your speed and durability as well. You will be only a hare slower than Achilles himself able to kill as fast as Fate can end men and cross battlefields in between heartbeats, even quick Atalanta would be outpaced by this speed, your body hardens and becomes all but invincible to anything less than your own strength with a similar increase in vitality and endurance.

1710,,600,I will be there for you,Persona 5 Royal,Benevolence,"The butterfly effect is an interesting thing is it not? Every person you encounter on the road, every soul you meet, can have a tremendous impact on your and their lives. You are capable of bringing out new power in others. If you stand by their side, provide them support, you can bear witness to how they awaken powers they themselves didn’t think possible. Their existing abilities can be strengthened or new skills appear in their repertoire for as long as you are there for them and they are certain of your aid. Stay by their side and watch as they gain the potential to change the World."

They struggle awakening to the Power they are meant to wield. Give them a hand and this struggle won’t be present anymore. From now on the people around you can awaken to their Personas when choosing the path of Rebellion against something or someone. They start off weak but with time can grow into truly powerful individuals. This Perk allows them to awaken to a Persona without need for the Metaverse. A properly strenuous and difficult situation as well as some guidance of yourself is all they need. Said situations could be anything from imminent Death or threat to harm someone the about to be awakened cares about.

Boosted: Together the impossible can become possible. Any and all who fight by your side shall have the strength to aid you. Any of your awakened Companions is roughly on par with you, no matter how mighty you already are. They now scale to your own Power. United you stand against the Ruin. None shall fall.

1712,,600,Resurrection,Diablo 3,Benevolence,"A benevolent ability through and through. With this you can resurrect an ally from the dead. This takes no energy at all but it takes one second of concentration so you could do it in the middle of a fight if not attacked for a moment. This ability has a one day cooldown and you can only ever resurrect one ally at a time. The ally will come back with their full might. You can use this on yourself, should you be dead but your soul and consciousness still remains, but in that case the cooldown will be an entire month (this is the only thing that cannot be changed in this ability)."
1713,,600,Angelic Armaments,Diablo 3,Benevolence,"You can now summon flaming angelic swords around you to block incoming attacks. You can also let them fly at high speeds in a direction of your choosing. These swords are imbued with divine flames. If you use them to defend they will block any sort of damage, even ones that a sword not normally should block (like poison). But make no mistake. While they are quite sturdy, they can break after enough damage has been suffered. Show them the Arsenal of Heaven!"
1714,,600,The Black King,Diablo 3,Benevolence,"Fear...something the Greater Evil Diablo brings with him alot. But you are now a very close 2nd. Truly something to behold, since you are most likely Human. Your power and size now comes close to the greatest Humans that lived, second only to King Leoric. You could even compete with untrained Nephalem. Your body is something that even most Demons and Angels would envy. You can survive attacks that would cripple lesser men for years and come back from them in a few minutes to keep fighting. You don’t heal faster, just push through them and can still move. You have the courage to withstand horrors and terror that would send most men running, at least for a few minutes and can inflict fear upon lesser enemies by your sheer force of will. Only the strongest and maddest will stand against someone such as you. You gain either the Barbarian OR the Paladin Class Power for Free.

Boosted: The Mad King

Forget what I said. You are now the strongest Human that ever lived, the only Human that can prove a challenge at all to you would be King Leoric himself. You are gigantic. towering 2 or 3 heads above other men in armor, while not losing speed or agility because of your size. Your mind and soul strength now also follow suit to your physical might, warding off Corruption and attacks targeted at them (same goes for magic), at least for some time, like you would with very hard physical strikes. You could compete with multiple Nephalem at the same time, fend off even a Greater Evil in Combat, but would ultimately lose if you don’t get a lot of help. Additionally, even if something would affect your mind and your soul and overcomes your defenses somehow, your sheer power now subdues it slightly and changes it. For example: something that would make you so fearful of everything, that it would drive you to suicide, would now make you so paranoid, that you instead would suspect anyone and anything of treachery. Not the nicest twists to these curses, but if it keeps you alive...

1715,,600,Ascension,Fate/Grand Order Part 1,Benevolence,"Servants aren't static in power. Depending on their circumstances, they can be stronger or weaker. The most notable influence on this is the Servant vessel. The magical power of the Master can either limit them or allow them to show their full power as well. Outside of that, you might need potent artifacts like Holy Grails to significantly increase the power of a Servant without resummoning them in a better spiritual body. Thankfully, you've learned a few strengthening rituals utilized by Chaldea to enhance their Servants. By utilizing miscellaneous magical material or objects, such as perhaps the bones of magical beasts, Craft Essences, or Mystic Codes, you can slightly but noticeably increase the overall power of a Servant. This can only be done to a limited extent however, due to the natural limits of Saint Graphs.

This is where a second ritual comes in, ‘ascending’, so to speak, the Saint Graph of a Servant, requiring not only a magical monument aligned with the archetype of their Servant Class, but also magical items that resonate with the legend of the Servant, such as a lantern that uses souls instead of oil and a demigod heart filled with curses for a divine Servant that caused a lot of death. This ascension provides a small power boost on its own and allows you to keep strengthening them the normal way for a bit more, before you run into the limit of the Servant's Saint Graph and need to ascend them again. A Servant can only be ascended four times total.

There are a couple more rituals this perk teaches you, however. One uses the same kind of magical materials as the ascension ritual (although with a magical gem instead of a monument), and slightly improves the Skills and abilities of the Servant (which can be done up to 10 times), while another feeds them a copy of their Saint Graph to notably enhance their Noble Phantasm (which can be done up to 5 times). And finally, by performing a small quest to address and solve some personal problem the Servant has, this character development engraves itself in their Saint Graph, permanently strengthening their abilities to a noticeable degree.

All of these rituals (save the last one due to it being unique) require quite a bit of magical energy of course, not to mention the difficulty in acquiring the sheer amount of materials needed in the first place. As a bonus, with this perk you'll have an odd tendency to find sources of such materials, even if such grinding can only be done by using magical simulations to recreate old enemies of yours and kill them over and over and over again. Overall, should you manage to fully upgrade a Servant with all these rituals, they'll be at the very top of their Rank, however, this alone is not enough to bridge the gap between Ranks. The only exception to this are Low Rank Servants, who’ll at least be brought to the peak of Mid Rank.

That is where the final ritual comes in. Should you manage to get your hands on a couple of Holy Grails, you'll be able to ascend your Servant, in a manner of speaking, two more times. The magical energy and magical material requirements for even minute increases of power rise exponentially at this point, not to mention you will lose the Holy Grails you've used in the ritual. Should you manage to feed a grailed Servant to the point of reaching the limit of their supercharged Saint Graph, they will have finally ascended a Rank, letting a Mid Rank Servant achieve High Rank. Past this, you'll have to use a second Holy Grail for the sixth ascension, after which you can keep sinking exponentially greater amounts of magical energy and materials to reach the limit of the Servant's Saint Graph again.

At this point, the Servant will have been empowered to the point of having effectively climbed two (or three) Ranks, such as a Servant that began as Mid Rank becoming Top Rank by the end of this process. A limit of this entire Ascension process however, is that it cannot reach beyond the Top Rank. So perhaps it'd be wiser to focus on enhancing weaker Servants. As a final note, modifying these rituals to work on non-Servant spiritual beings is likely possible, if very difficult, but it would require a lot of magical expertise to make them work on living beings."
1716,,600,Key to Future,Final Fantasy XV Royal Edition,Benevolence,"Eh, I mean technically, although it might be literal, once per Jump, the events will unfold in such a way that an item of immense power and/or plot significance will come into your possession, similar to what happens to the Ring of the Lucii that ends up in the hands of Oracle, unfortunately, during the Jump, you will not be able to use said item, except in cases of extreme necessity, as it must be given to someone you deem worthy and as long as this is your goal, you are protected by really strong plot armor until it is handed over, but if you want to keep the item for yourself, the plot armor will disappear and if you still have the item at the end of the jump, it will receive fiat backing and can be used as you wish, without possible consequences, for example you can use full power of MCU Infinity Gem and it won't harm you.

Important detail, this is limited to only one item per Jump, not the whole set, which means that items that come in groups of two or more like Chaos Emeralds, Infinity Gems, Royal Arms and other sets will be limited to just one, one Chaos Emerald, one Infinity Gem, ditto."

And with it comes monstrous strength, of the kind ""sword fight with an Iron Giant"" strong; stamina to pull off the victory in a last man standing; agility and flexibility of someone much smaller; very keen senses even for animal levels; your mind is equally incredible, intellect unmatched; talent for developing tactics and strategies on the fly, but in the end your greatest quality is your heart, not literally, I mean your willpower you don't know the word surrender, The Six will have to come and it will be a miracle if they manage to make you tremble. But remember that you are still (maybe) just a human, you are not as tough as a Daemon, you must compensate with skill or teammates,

Boosted: True Shield 

What makes a good Shield? No, I'm not referring to the equipment, but the protector's role, more specifically the Shield of the King, this one needs to be strong, impetuous with his duty, you always had this and still continued, after all being stagnant leads to nothing, that's why you sought something beyond, reached and became the pinnacle of the martial path. Your physical power has increased to the point where you can easily overwhelm your former self with a single hand; your skill with weapons has reached a level that only Gilgamesh is your equal; with focus you can create “hardlight” weapons and limbs, in case you have ""lost"" some; your mighty soul made you ageless.

Once per jump you can launch a challenge, a series of trials in a certain area where you cannot leave. During these trials, while you remain on this ground, you can resurrect once; keep the souls of dead challengers here to raise them to serve you. Whoever wins your trial will receive a copy of your power and skill, how much power it is depends on the difficulty of this test, a trial of willpower can offer a considerable portion, a trial of ability that requires you to be defeated can provide 100% of your power and skill. If no one managed to complete your test (must be possible) your power and competence doubles.

1718,,600,Fleuret Lineage,Final Fantasy XV Royal Edition,Benevolence,"After all you really are the Oracle, unless you are not a woman (It's a female-only position), you naturally have a great power of healing and purification, such that you can even cure those infected with the Starscourge. Unfortunately, you can’t cure those who are already Daemons, at least the Long Night will take a while longer to come. A curiosity of this lineage is that its members have “superhuman physique” that makes them stronger and more resistant than is usually possible for other people, and finally you received the same training given to the Oracles and this resulted in mastery of etiquette, dance and polearms; increased your willpower and physical prowess even more; gave you great knowledge about the Astrals, the messengers and previous Oracles. You can temporarily empower others, this will give their existing powers a considerable boost and temporarily unleash their potential, however you need a magical medium like the Trident of the Oracle. Post-Jump, the purification works with any infections.

Boosted: Miracle

With the blessing of the Crystal your healing power has increased by miles and can now heal multiple infected at the same time, even making them immune to Starscourge in the process (they still need to be infected), unfortunately you are still unable to cure Daemons, but the Long Night may never come if you don't want it and dedicate yourself to this. Similar to what will happen to a certain Deputy High Commander, except for the consequences, the Crystal has increased your strength to totally supernatural levels, the kind that picks up a Royal Arm without being able to brandish it and still manages to hunt Daemons left and right as if it were normal; You no longer need to use any kind of medium to cast any magic, inclusive to empower others, but if you choose to use it, you will find that your magic will be much stronger than it should be, even if you are considering the medium's amplification.

1719,,600,Redeemer,Journey To The West,Benevolence,"The bodhisattva Guanyin converted the demons Sha Wujing, Zhu Wuneng, and Sun Wukong to Buddhism, therefore giving them a chance at redeeming their sins and achieving enlightenment. Save for Zhu Wuneng, both of the other demons did in fact become great buddhist monks. Just like the merciful bodhisattva, you’re especially able to grant evil beings redemption. Simply lay your hands on their heads after subduing them, recite a vow to make them promise to seek absolution, and they will find a spark of light within them that might not have been there before, giving them an actual genuine desire for atonement.

From there, it’ll be up to the evil being in question, as they might stop at calming down and no longer being violent but still being quite gluttonous and lustful, just like a certain Pigsy. But they will definitely be able to find true redemption should they prevail over the no doubt arduous journey, cleansing their impurity and becoming good beings, compassionate and humble. You might need to guide and help them as they seek enlightenment, should they find an obstacle that they cannot surpass on their own, but as they will still have that inextinguishable spark of will driving them forwards it’s almost inevitable that they’ll succeed eventually, after many trials. Even the most vile, cruel, and spiritually repulsive being will be able to atone this way, with your help. Truly a blessing befitting a bodhisattva."
1720,,600,Deus Ex Celestia ,Journey To The West,Benevolence,"You are now in the possession, in a manner of speaking, of three celestial boons. They normally take the form of three special but unremarkable looking hairs in the back of your head, or whatever equivalent your form might have, and their effect comes into play when you find yourself in a hopeless situation. Whenever you are faced with an issue that you cannot solve, whether through might or guile, and that you cannot avoid, one of these hairs change into something that will let you prevail. Maybe it’ll be a special treasure that will bind a particularly powerful demon, perhaps it’ll be a tool that helps you deal with a problem you can’t punch away, or maybe it’ll just become a horn that will call down an incredibly powerful Bodhisattva to solve the problem for you. As the number of hairs indicate, you only get this boon three times, and they only replenish once a jump ends. Most importantly, the help you get from these boons “don’t count” for things like tribulations that you must solve on your own, letting you benefit from them even if you’re not supposed to get help from any source. Is this sort of interference even allowed?"
1721,,600,The Blessings of Humanity,Generic Angels and Demons,Benevolence,"One fact is undeniable, by default, humans are weak and fragile, as well as lacking many of the strengths seen in other races, like the beauty and magic potential of species like the elves and angels or the raw power of spiritual beings like demons, in this world and in almost every other one around the Omniverse. Despite this, humans can still be found in almost every universe you visited or might visit in the future and, many times, they end up being the favorite species of mortals of several deities and other divine beings. Regardless if humankind is special or not, you truly are, being blessed by the four aspects that make humans special among other mortals, even if you aren’t a human yourself.

The first aspect is Freedom, which manifests as an absolute immunity to being controlled by others’ abilities, allowing you to shake off any attempt of mind control, possession, psychic manipulation or any other esoteric control abilities, even by those that are godlike in strength, with only beings like R.O.B.s having chance of controlling and/or manipulating you with their powers.

The second aspect is Hope, that not only prevents you from losing yourself in despair but also blesses you with a limitless willpower that can’t be broken regardless of which problems and opponents you face.

The third aspect is pretty easy to understand what it does, with it being the humans’ Unlimited Potential, which, as you may already imagine, removes any limit that restricts your potential, meaning that you and every one of your powers can grow stronger endlessly as long as you continue training, acquiring experience and strengthening you and your abilities.

Lastly, the fourth aspect you acquire is Adaptability, which grants you the ability to slowly adapt and acquire resistance to any type of damage you suffer. It takes hours of exposure to damage of a certain kind to gain some noticeable resistance, but, with your potential, you could even achieve feats like being able to stay comfortably inside a volcano once you develop enough resistance against heat. It’s impossible to actually gain complete immunity, but you can become resistant enough to stay unharmed from even planet-busting attacks after a few centuries of building up enough resistance. Additionally, esoteric forms of damage also take more time to adapt against.

Boosted: The spark of primordial life within you hasn't actually amplified the power of the four aspects you’ve received before, but, in turn, it granted you a new unique ability: the ability to share this perk’s four abilities with people that you consider your allies. By staying close to them, they gradually gain access to these abilities, starting far weaker initially after a few minutes but eventually becoming exactly as strong as yours after staying the equivalent of months near them. Once they develop the abilities, they don’t lose access to them even if you’re away from them but you can remove them at any time if you want. You can turn this effect on and off at will.

1722,,600,Blizzard Forgot To Nerf Jumper The Hyper-Carry Because They Were Too Busy Releasing More Ranged Assassins,Heroes of the Storm,Benevolence,"Here’s the thing about healing-when you have two groups of champions and one group can hit hard while the other can also hit hard but also has a lovely lad or lady in the back keeping the team alive, the second team tends to win. As such despite their rarity healers are greatly treasured-and you? Your power over restoration is nothing short of miraculous. The technology you build to heal others with works simply mends all ailments dozens of times more rapidly when wielded by yourself, the divine blessings you call down can whisk whole mobs from the brink of death when they would normally heal only a handful of fighters and your restorative spells can cleanse all manner of debuffs as well as the grievous wounds they were intended for. Don’t be surprised to accidentally mend a broken bone or two simply by sticking a bandaid on someone, and with study and practice you’ll find there’s no upper limit on how far you can innovate and improve your powers or processes of restoration.

Oh, and if you happen to have no skill in healing at all beyond sticking bandaids on things fret not-this perk applies equally well to repairing and restoring mechanical devices, structures and other examples of artifice. The biological structures of the Zerg, of course, count as both."
1723,,600,The Craft of War,Heroes of the Storm,Benevolence,"Gone, gone are the frailties and weaknesses that leave lesser warriors unable to match you in warfare. For where others seem sapped of their best condition in the heat of combat, you only build momentum. Every blow you throw hits harder, every step or dodge you take is quicker, and while this is no boon to frost bolts or a necromancer’s spikes of bone even effects like mystical battle rages or psionic augmentations of the body that use supernatural or technological forces to directly enhance your body’s overall deadliness seem to grow in effectiveness as the battle rages on. Any lull in continuous battle will see you return gradually to your baseline, but with a day’s continuous fighting even a humble Terran soldier could topple dragons with their bare hands and outrun a Void Speeder."
1724,,600,Exceptional Specimen,Heroes of the Storm,Benevolence,"No longer are you a common soldier of your kind, for you’ve just won the genetic lottery hard. If you are Zerg yourself, you may be a unique entity like Abathur or Dehaka with particular specialities. But if you should be some other race, you will similarly be at the top end of your species’ latent potential-never enough to outright be unidentifiable as being another species, but being on the bleeding edge of what the greatest of your kind pushed to their limits can achieve. And while this covers physical potential as well as psionic and magical power, it should go without saying that with Psionic Powerhouse as well your mental power would be unrivalled in the Nexus.

An example of this is found in Zagara, Broodmother of the Swarm-who can unleash the “meat moss” of the Zerg’s influence that let her scry across the battlefield and make her and her Zerg creatures faster upon its surface. She can create common Zerg creatures like banelings, hydralisks and Roachlings in ones and twos rapidly from surrounding biomass to support herself in battle. With more effort, she can also create larger Zerg lifeforms to deal devastating attacks to her foes, or create a Nydus Worm: A massive living orifice that when provided a second “head” on the battlefield provides Zagara with rapid transportation across the two ends, while letting her rapidly regenerate her health and reserves of psionic energy. As the Nexus empowers her Zagara can be healed by the damage her minions inflict on her enemies, augment her formidable form with deadly spikes and spawn more minions so fast that with her every third attack she spawns a new Baneling."
1725,,600,Märchen Meines Lebens,Fate/Legends - Voyage to Valhalla,Benevolence,"A simple manuscript, unpolished, raw and uncomplete. It is the records of your entire way of life, though letting you reminisce on your achievements is the weakest use possible for these stacks of paper. It takes its magic power from all the people who adore your work and love you as a writer, artist, creator. By writing on it, using it in your craft, you can make single human grow into a ‘lead character’, in the same way an author creates a story.

To use this technique, you must start again with an empty set of these papers and then write. The more you write and the more engaging the tale, the greater is the extent of growth. A few pages will only cause a few small coincidences occurring around your main character. But completing all the pages will allow for your character to become as they imagined themselves to be, growing into their highest possible form. With enough time, countless pages and superb writing and mastery, a mere therapist could grow into something entirely else.

Do keep in mind as powerful as this seems it is not as omnipotent as a writer itself is. This ideal self is not reached so easily. It requires the story itself to be of high quality, feature a truly motivated creator and of course be a satisfying path to the end."
1726,,600,Doom Driven,The Elder Scrolls: Dovah,Benevolence,"Many think of doom as something bad or disastrous, but once it meant something else, a decision determining fate or fortune, or even destiny. If we take it as the second meaning, what does it mean to be Destiny Driven? For you, it means that fortune will always be by your side, always pushing for the best probable outcome. This can come in many forms, from granting you greater opportunities than others, to stumbling upon ancient treasures that no one else has discovered, to your enemies showing off their weak points much more often, to many more. The foolish may call this luck, you call it fate."

In doing so, the Monk can directly control how Chakra affects another person, either by depriving areas of chakra, or purging the Chakra in another person. For a brief moment, you can even bestow upon another the ability to fight as a Monk does.

While the opening of a Chakra point on another person lasts a shorter period than it would if you opened the Chakra point, for the period that the Chakra point remains open, the individual’s strength in that region of the body is massively increased. You could potentially use this to reinforce a part of the body for a brief period of time."

Not to falter, not to fall, with a shield in hand you will resist whatever tide comes your way. Against normal blows, your defenses are significantly boosted, but it isn’t until a life threatening moment comes that your shield skills will really shine.

Against attacks that would normally hit an entire area around you or blow right past your shield, you can absorb all of that damage into your shield. While this completely protects the area around you, remember that you aren’t invincible, and if you bite off more than you can chew, hopefully the price won’t be your life."
1729,,600,Destinies Favor ,Mushoku Tensei ~ Jobless Reincarnation ~,Benevolence,"It appears that the universe has great plans for you, by giving you a destiny that will always seek to exalt you and will present you with constant opportunity for power and fame. Furthermore, you are now but immune to any deaths that are not glorious, meaning that no assassin will kill you ignominiously with a spiked cup of tea, and no accident will be the death of you. Those who are close friends and have prolonged contact with you would gain a fraction of your destiny, while your lovers and descendants would gain a strong destiny equal to you. This also allows you to defy destined events and predetermined actions, like saving those that are meant to die an untimely destined death or avoiding an unavoidable attack. While destiny favors you, these are not absolute as you need to do the legwork and save others yourself. Due to destiny’s favor, you are gifted with incredible luck, this greatly increases the chance of fortunate events occurring for you. Whether it is a game of chance or avoiding attacks on you, you are far more likely to succeed than anyone else."
1730,,600,Immortality ,Mushoku Tensei ~ Jobless Reincarnation ~,Benevolence,"Like those members of the demon race, you somehow managed to gain their form of immortality to yourself. This gives you agelessness allowing you to live for eternity without showing any signs of growing old past your prime. If you’re way past it then you would be returned to your prime. This also grants extremely powerful regeneration, so long as a portion of your body remains it would allow you to almost instantly regenerate in complete health and the lost parts, small cuts or fatal wounds would be healed instantly fast enough that you won’t even notice that you've been wounded. By default your children and their descendants also gain this version of Immortality and you also gain an ability to give other people this Immortality. Post-Jump should you die, whether by having your body completely vaporized or your soul being destroyed or any other way, you would be revived instantly to the nearest safest location or in your warehouse, though your age would reset to the minimum of seven years old, this only happens once per jump and every ten years post-chain."
1731,,600,Dark Fortune ,Horus Heresy: The Primarchs,Benevolence,"Chaos has appointed you in its Fates and the power of the Dark Gods is twisting destiny to ensure you will stay alive. You are blessed with unusual luck to avoid dying. Shots that would have just got you will miss. A would-be fatal blow may stop just short of slaying you, leaving you incapacitated and gasping for life. This does not prevent someone from coming in to finish the job nor anything that would be impossible to survive no matter how much fate twists in your favour. "
1732,,600,Apex Predator,Akame ga Kill!,Benevolence,"You truly are a born slaughterer, a true monster of human origin (or even a monster among monsters if you’re actually a Danger Beast instead of being human) whose physical attributes are greatly superior to that of a regular human even without some special training to attain such condition. Regardless if this monstrous power is a result of the life you had changing you or due to you naturally having an unique freak physiology, you possess several superhuman level physical attributes, all of them on par with Akame and the other members of the Elite Seven. Furthermore, your monstrous nature also grants you a secondary benefit unrelated to your enhanced physical condition, you possess a domineering primal/animalistic charisma, one comparable to the charisma of the ice commander herself.

Your great charisma, combined with treating others well or with satisfying their goals and/or desires, is capable of inspiring many, mainly those that would already have similarly monstrous nature, to fight for you with a degree of loyalty and determination that could even be considered almost unnatural, with the most loyal among your servants and allies even considering you a divine figure.

Now, as if the world itself recognized you as a threat of the highest caliber, you’ll be treated by fate itself as the “Final Boss” and it’ll treat you accordingly. What does this mean? As the “Final Boss”, you possess a “contractual boss immunity”, a peculiar type of narrative plot armor/advantage that makes it considerably harder to kill you through cheap means and similar fancy tricks, such as instant-death attacks, making them fail completely at all or only slowing down their effects to give you a chance to overcome them.

For example, instant death spells, like the Grasp Heart spell from Overlord, would always fail due to some coincidence or would be unable to target at all. Another example is, if you were to be hit by Murasame, instead of dying in a few instants, the curse would be slowed in order to give you enough time to deal with it by finding a way to remove it, like by cutting off the affected area, to avoid getting killed by it. 

In other words, a more decisive blow will be required to put you down, like facing you in an actual combat instead of relying on some cheap trick that normally would ensure an easy victory for them.

Boosted: Fate itself has already favored you as one of the greatest threats in this world, but, now, with the metaphysical value of the royal blood running in your veins, it’ll also ensure that you’ll continue being such threat in a way that represent your nature as a true hunter. This will manifest as a narrative advantage that will proportionally enhance your power and fuel your abilities the more the odds are stacked against you, either by being put against beings more powerful than you or by being greatly outnumbered by your enemies’ forces.

After all, as a hunter whose nature matches that of a true monster, the worse the odds are stacked against you, the fiercer you’ll fight, just like a cornered beast. Are you capable of devastating an entire city with a few attacks? If you’re cornered by an army of over a million soldiers and at least one being on par with Esdeath, your power would be massively enhanced to the point that you’ll be able to lay waste to an entire country and cause massive destruction on a continental scale.

Of course, this boost has its limits, as it may multiply your current power by several times and give you an absurdly giant energy reserve if you’re facing an impossible opposition, but don’t expect you to have a chance only due to this perk’s effect if you go face a godlike entity whose power dwarves yours so much that it’s basically incomparable to yours.

1733,,600,Dual-Wielding Skill ,Akame ga Kill!,Benevolence,"As a single Teigu requires a considerable amount of mental and physical strength in order to be controlled, it became widely considered that every person can wield only one Teigu, due to, if someone were bold enough to use two Teigu at the same time, they would end up being destroyed by them due to mental strain and physical toll caused by them being too great to their body to resist. However, you have the needed physical and mental strength to withstand the burden and manage to do this unprecedented feat. As long as you’re compatible with both, you can now wield two Teigu without greater issues such as potential permanent sequelae other people could suffer, but, initially, the strain caused on your body by their usage will make you feel as if you had a building falling on you. Fortunately, you can still train and get more used to them to the point that it would be no more strenuous and consuming than wielding a single Teigu over time.

Furthermore, once you reach this point, you’ll become capable of wielding a third Teigu, however with the same feeling of a building falling on you again, requiring you to continue training, until the point you might finally become able to wield as many Teigu you want to, but this is a feat that might need decades of training and hard work to achieve. Additionally, you’re also able to combine the abilities of the multiple Teigu you’re wielding in a seamless way, as if they were a single Teigu. Post-jump, it’ll also extend to other magical devices and weapons similar to the Teigu, allowing you to combine the usage of two (or more than two if you keep training to enhance your fortitude) usually incompatible devices in a seamless fashion.

Boosted: Using multiple Teigu at once is considered an impossible feat for most people not due to actually being impossible but because the strain and energy consumption caused by them is so great that, if someone were to be bold enough to merely attempt to do this, it would be enough to destroy their body quickly. However, you were already an exception to this, but, beyond this world, there are several “unique powers” that each person can only have one of them, like how each person can probably only absorb the power of a single Extract-type Teigu. Fortunately, you’re also an exception to this rule, as you’re now able to acquire multiple powers that originally would be limited to just one (or another limited number) under normal conditions. Some examples of usages of this perk in other settings are consuming multiple Devil Fruits, gaining multiple blessings by devouring Mato’s Peaches, gaining multiple Stands or having a chimera kagune composed of three or four kagune types. Additionally, you won’t need to worry about having any side effects from having multiple of said abilities, to the point you could even have a virtually unlimited number of quirks without suffering any consequence for example.

1734,,600,The True Owner,Akame ga Kill!,Benevolence,"Normally, a person’s compatibility with a specific Teigu is heavily affected by their first impression of the item in question as, for example, someone that just accidentally thought that a Teigu looks ugly will probably have a poor compatibility with it and will hardly be able to use it for more than a few minutes at best. However, you’re a special individual, as you seem to possess a naturally high compatibility with every Teigu and other similar weapons, with your first impression and opinion about them having no influence on how well you can use them. Additionally, this universally high compatibility also works for the Teigu and other weapons that also have special personality requirements they “seek” on their users to be compatible with them, even if you don’t fulfill such requirements, allowing you to even wield a weapon like Mjolnir without needing to be worthy for example.

Boosted: Maybe it’s due to the Teigu somehow sensing the First Emperor’s blood running in your veins, but, regardless of the exact reason, your compatibility with the Teigu (and other similar weapons and items post-jump) have been further enhanced to a whole new degree, as you’re now “loved” by every Teigu you wield, with them basically seeing them as their favorite user and possibly their true owner, allowing you to use their special abilities better than anyone else and even cause the Teigu to evolve within reason the more you use them. Some examples with the Teigu include: you could fully evolve Incursio into its draconic form but it wouldn’t forcefully fuse with you, the Demon’s Extract wouldn’t try to warp your mind, you would be able to partially fuse with Lionel at will, you would be able to use Murasame’s trump card, Grand Chariot could partially recover its adaptability after you use it for some time and Pumpkin would never cause you to fall into a coma due to draining all of your spiritual energy.

1735,,600,Absolute Existence ,Marvel: Age of Krakoa,Benevolence,"Moira X is an odd Mutant. Completely indistinguishable from a human by even the finest detectors, but arguably the most powerful of them all. When Moira dies, she is sent back in time in order to reincarnate as herself with full memory intact. And the timeline she left behind is erased completely. In short, Moira effectively resets the multiverse with each life. The current reality is her tenth life, and potentially her last... Wouldn’t it suck if you ceased to exist because a butterfly flapping its wings made Moira fall down some stairs? With this perk, your existence becomes an immutable fact of the Omniverse. No force in the Omniverse can erase you from existence or alter your personal history even indirectly, nor are you subject to time, reality, or narrative-manipulating effects that would alter your fundamental existence or change your mind or spirit against your will. You are still subject to more traditional attacks from such sources, however. Even if history or the world itself is rewritten, reset, destroyed, or recreated you will still exist as you are, there will be a place for you in the new reality, and you’ll never have to deal with doppelgangers created by such resets. This effect is free for the jump but costs 600 CP to keep."
1736,,600,Virtuous,Hazbin Hotel,Benevolence,"Do you want to know a secret? Not even the highest of Angels know what gets a Soul into Heaven. They simply acknowledge that a Soul must have deserved eternal Paradise when it appears in front of them. Now it seems that such systems simply adore you, as you are always considered good or worthy by them. This applies to anything, from locations to judges to artifacts testing for such things. Losing such virtue or worthiness is furthermore impossible."
1737,,600,Redemption,Hazbin Hotel,Benevolence,"If Hell is forever then Heaven must be a lie! I mean look at the hypocritical stuck up dicks they have up there! So when Angels can fall, why can’t a Demon rise? Now many sinners and even plenty of Angels don't expect this to even be possible but you know different. When you actually make an effort to improve and feel genuine regret over mistakes, you will rapidly find yourself in positions to make amends. Put in the work during these opportunities and you will be forgiven by those you wronged. But the perhaps greatest use of this Perk is on the cosmic scale, as you are able to be absolved of your sins even in the eyes of arbiters and systems of such scales. Even retroactively you could be considered pure and of virtue with all the benefits that entails. Perhaps you can even get past those pearly gates. Wouldn't that be a surprise?

Lastly, if you are willing to support others endeavors to redeem themselves, they too can benefit from this Perk. I am sure Charlie would be delighted to have you work at her Hotel."
1738,,600,Gold Orb,Devil May Cry,Benevolence,"Yellow Orbs are magical yellow stones created through an alchemical something or other. I’m not sure of how the details work, exactly, but this here is the important part—They can literally save your life.

Whenever you are struck by a killing blow, the Gold Orb on your person will shatter, bringing you back on your feet in tip-top condition, ready to keep on kicking whatever variety of ass needs to be kicked. However, do keep in mind that when your Gold Orb shatters, it’s gone for good... Well, at least for the duration of your stay in this world. Should you by some strange, mystewious, and completely unexplained reason be whisked away to another dimension, you’ll find another Gold Orb on your person."
1739,,600,Bomb Logic,The Destiny Universe,Benevolence,"Envisioned by Mara Sov as a means of countering the Taken King’s Sword Logic within the Ascendant Plane. Whereas Sword Logic is inherently egotistical—attaining success through the overwhelming power of a single individual—Bomb Logic is the opposite—achieving results through the synergistic effects of multiple parties operating in tandem. Whereas Sword Logic is simple—cut away at the universe until you are all that is left—Bomb Logic is complex—building meaning and power from otherwise meaningless and powerless pieces. Bomb Logic does not focus inward on a single individual, but rather, allows those unified in purpose to achieve that which would have been impossible for any of the individuals in question working on their own. Though the Young Wolf may have been the one to strike him down, it was the Bomb Logic of Mara Sov that ultimately defeated Oryx: demonstrating within the Taken King’s throne world that a team of Guardians could be sharper than Willbreaker’s edge. This same logic has allowed the Guardians—all of whom would be individually helpless before the greatest of their foes—to defeat opponents such as Rhulk, the first Disciple of the Witness, and Nezarec, the Final God of Pain. This perk doesn’t guarantee success, but rather, vastly increases its chances when you are working in a team. While this won’t result in any permanent boosts to your strength as with the Sword Logic, it will allow you to succeed in places where there would be no hope for you as an individual just so long as you are one piece in a greater machine devoted to that outcome.

Boosted: Nuclear Bomb Logic 

Mara Sov may have introduced humanity to the Bomb Logic by combining aspects of both the Light and the Darkness, but she was not the first to walk that path—nor is she its greatest champion. In ages past, it was the Queen of Lies, Savathûn, who first sought an answer to the inexorable fatalism of the Final Shape through means other than the sword. By her efforts—and now by yours—it is possible to turn even mortal enemies into vital cogs in your engine of warfare. So long as something remains a part of your schemes—whether that be as an ally or an enemy—you can leverage its existence to further your goals through the Bomb Logic. Yet this is not all that the Witch Queen would learn through her infiltration of the Vanguard. By putting together a team of allies who are truly loyal to each other, you can amplify the effectiveness of your Bomb Logic based on the bonds between individuals to create something even greater than what Mara Sov could have imagined when she first coined the term. While a group of Guardians that have previously never met each other could collectively destroy a Vex entity the size of a small moon, a properly assembled team of close friends could conceivably annihilate gods should they truly set their minds to the task.

1740,,600,Warlord,Magnagothica: Maleghast,Benevolence,"You are a necromancer of the Goregrinders, empowered by the strength of the Corpse Piler Devil to go forth and bring destruction. Fueled by infinite rage, your body is a sculpted masterpiece of destruction, and you can wield such weapons as superheated chainblades, burning chains or the Spine Devil Blade with alacrity. You can clear weakness and curses by slaying your enemies, empower your allies with furious roars or use your powers to turn weakness on others into blazing strength."
1741,,600,Hellbound Homecoming,Kult: Divinity Lost,Benevolence,"There are things that can scar even the dark twin of God. There are revelations that could move even him to desperation. As Astaroth now feels a great urgency to wrest control of Elysium after whatever he discovered, you are endowed with a transcendental fate to wrest away control of the world on a metaphysical level-as long as you allow yourself to be guided by one of the Death Angels’ principles, though even they are not wholly sovereign from your ambitions. Choose one principle to be bound by: Power (in the sense of ambition), Abuse, Exclusion, Fear, Torment, Compulsion (expressed as the darker side of artistic inspiration), Conflict, Vengeance, Desire and Discord. Your efforts are bolstered by circumstances, windfalls of fortune and twists of fate brought about by the pursuit of your chosen principle.

New ways to damn and imprison the human soul will reveal themselves to you in dreams, while artifacts of great danger become perfectly safe to wield in your hands so long as they meaningfully contribute to your victory. Great divine citadels have reliably convenient cracks you can sneak through, while the roles of great spirits can be supplanted if you can produce beings of similar power. This never weakens any divine or otherwise cosmic in scope beings who stand in your way in direct power, but even pious angels could be given a shade of doubt in their faith- and if an artifact existed that could defeat a certain deity, provenance would find you locating it swiftly. It is as if Astaroth himself guides your hand-though do remember, that even with the Demiurge gone and the Archons having lost three of their number Astaroth’s victory is far from decided, and that there are good reasons why he wishes to secure dominion before mankind can fully awaken-as well as that for all his power, there are beings beyond all hope of even his control.

Boosted: While some deific beings may be more well-known than others and have specialities others lack, all are considered moderately powerful for their kind-for now. You may define your divinity through the lens of certain extensive investments you have made here, gaining advantages your peers likely lack as described below:

Hellbound Homecoming: You are suffering distilled. The scalpel of Inferno drawn exquisitely to open a thin red line along the spine of the universe. When you inflict suffering in accordance with your chosen principle it lingers, persists, escalates into a cascading trend of ruination, tragic circumstances and destructive behaviour to worsen the wider world. To torture a man then let him go back to his life might blight his relationships with deepseated trauma making him lash out, continuously worsen his mental wellbeing-then attempt to kill his own family in a fit of festering madness at the back of his mind. To smash flat a stock exchange could precipitate a depression on a global scale. The harm you inflict is supernaturally incurable and unmendable, with only the greatest of restorative supernatural forces having even a hope of making right what you set wrong. And where the suffering is particularly concentrated, you may summon forth the demons of your patron’s principle to do you bidding, forgoing the usual resources or effort. Such beings will prove placated enough on the horror you have unleashed to be fairly eager to comply with you-though when you wring enough horrors to beckon the Death Angel’s Incarnates, it would still be wise to be cautious around them.

1742,,600,Points of Authority,Kult: Divinity Lost,Benevolence,"This is quite fortunate indeed! One of the Archons has found something so favourable in you, that they’ve thrown the full support of their principle behind your efforts-though likely for their own inscrutable goals. This principle will constantly assist you, though mostly in subtle and low key ways-yet on scales that would make economic crises or the flapping of a butterfly’s wings before a storm look like small potatoes. Expect all manner of fortuitous twists, circumstantial assistance and the occasional divine miracle to assist all your efforts when you somehow operate in the scope of the principle’s influence-though when you will it, the principle can abate if you wish to do something on your own effort. Supernatural effects somehow manipulating or incorporating these principles are also greatly strengthened, as if the Archon was lending you some of its power; effects that seal or restrict the powers of others are always supported by this. In future worlds the benefits of each principle bought here will follow you, though no longer will the guiding wills of the Archons promote their own agendas as they do in this world. Choose from Hierarchy, Submission, Community, Safety, Law, Allure, Victory, Honor and Avarice. Although Malkuth being a bit cheeky, she offers both Conformity and Awakening in one purchase-and can empower your abilities to liberate others as well.

You may define your divinity through the lens of certain extensive investments you have made here, gaining advantages your peers likely lack as described below:

Points of Authority: It seems your interdimensional nature had a more profound impact on the Archon than even it expected, likely to its panic. Your control over the principle of your Archon and capacity to amplify it is heightened much more- such that you could disrupt it trying to wrest control from it away from the Archon to leave it critically vulnerable to an enemy Death Angel-or empower it to stand against many of its equals in stature at once. Possibility itself bends in the face of your principle’s overwhelming primacy, and with enough skill and effort or the right resources you could do literally impossible things for the sake of promoting it. And when you are impeded in the execution of your principle, the Archon’s minions appear from nowhere in droves to support you. Though at first these are mere lictors or angels, in time you may be able to invoke the Incarnates of your Archon to lend you support; trust none of these beings fully, but know all accord you a certain formal authority for the service of spreading their principle to other worlds. Last but not least, any other summoning magic you can perform can become a beacon to your principle, spreading it from your minions like little beacons.

1743,,600,Cosmic Immortal,Scion ,Benevolence,"Certain creatures of the Titans are not just undying, but actually have their life woven into the fabric of reality. Such is the case for the Great Phoenix-the original phoenix-who stands as a symbol of death and renewal, its remains bursting into flame if slain to be reborn in an hour. Or the Great Cyclops, a mysterious being of Muspelheim whose flames regenerates any damage dealt to it so quickly as to render it indestructible. As long as it dwells in its forest of flames within the Titan of Light, anyway. Like these beings your boon is simple yet highly powerful: A form of comprehensive, true immortality that doesn’t just preserve you but encompasses a means to restore you from deleterious effects. While you have a wide discretion to define the terms of your immortality, keep in mind that the more comprehensive the terms of it are the more limitations you must accept on it. The Great Phoenix might be slain by the actions of an Avatar- level mastery of a Purview, if a god were willing to risk destabilising the basic function of all rebirth throughout the cosmos. On the other hand, Aten’s own immutability to all effects is dependent on his solipsistic belief that he is the one real being in existence-a mentality even he cannot indefinitely maintain."
1744,,600,Lord of the Gallows ,Scion ,Benevolence,"It’s never been clear why Odin and Loki were once blood brothers. Perhaps it was their shared determination in defiance of an unavoidable doom, or perhaps it was a quirk of Fate to bond those who would strive against together. Whatever the truth, there’s something of their hardscrabble rejection of predestination in you too. When you face absolute or certain forces such as a prophesised doom upon your entire pantheon, for you there will be opportunities to thwart it. The coming of Ragnarok could be avoided if you’re not quite truly Aesir in blood, or if you have an artifact to transplant your soul into one yet young enough to not have received that doom. A Titan on a rampage could be made vulnerable with the right artifact, or by carefully reading every prophecy to understand which band of Scions to send through it’s maw on a mission against all reason and logic. It’s not always immediately apparent how you can cheat Fate, but with enough might, wit and charm there’ll always be a way for you to come out ahead of the odds."

Of course, the risk that they take when they allow you to do that is that since you’re the one narrating their backstory, you can feel free to make it as dark as you wish; for instance, you can make them realise the dark truth that their dad fucked their mom. However, this is limited to granting powers on the level of what can be acquired here, and you aren’t able to narrate your own backstory."

But while there is being lucky, and there is being really lucky, there is also unbelievably lucky. Then there’s you, where the universe is blatantly on your side such that it wraps around to a new status quo.

Meteors crash land next to you, safely (for you) delivering exotic goods into your hand. Your first line of thought is often the right one “by chance”, vastly speeding up how fast you develop techniques. You’re so lucky that prayers to you by people you don’t mind are useful, with some of your luck you weren’t using sloughing off to help them, and your blessings oftentimes come true. Other people may thank you, if they survive the chaos your luck also brings with it.

You don’t need to pray to yourself to have your own wishes granted, though mentioning something you like in passing can stir things into action. And don’t worry about the chaos part. That’s other people’s problems."
1747,,600,Hero,A Wild Last Boss Appeared!,Benevolence,"The Hero class is probably the single most powerful job class created by the Goddess, and the only possibility within her system besides the naturally incredibly powerful Ouroboroses that could threaten Ruphas Mafahl. And for a great reason. Not only does the Hero’s class demonstrate incredible growth even within the constraints of the Goddess System, but its stats are the highest that the system can give. That is, if a hero managed to be on the same level as the Black Winged Overlord, they could fight her and possibly overpower her based just on their stats alone. 

Sadly, while this class provides a quite noticeable accelerated growth, unparalleled within the system of the Goddess, it still falls shortly behind the usage of the Golden Apples. What it lacks in that, it still gives it an immense amount of higher stats and skill gain, allowing even a regular teenager to become a master swordsman in some weeks with just some combat experience.

Finally, the hero has the sucide skill [Soul Succession], which after activation creates a powerful barrier that massively weakens one’s enemies and strengthens one's allies. It’s price is the user’s life, so it would only shine at their last and most dire moments. However, if someone were to discover a way to cheat death, I’m sure that it could become a powerful asset as it only requires you to ‘die’ but it doesn’t go away even after the user resurrects."

If you are aware of a fate either through prophecy, seeing into the future yourself, or some other way, you become keenly aware of how to turn Fate’s hand aside. If you do not wish it to, Fate cannot make demands of you, and it is with a touch of your own Faith that you can cut the ties that bind someone or something to a particular course. This has the odd side-effect of being able to be aware of and break cyclical time-loops without every having to worry about such petty things as paradox for any reason."

There is a caveat: Each power you have can only be shared once, meaning only one of your spouses can share that power with you. If Spouse A has Power B, then Spouse B can’t have Power B, but can have Power A, which would deny it to Spouse A as an option. You may shut off your shared powers at anytime and restart them as often as you like, but you may not reallocate which spouses can share which powers for a 1 year period after setting who gets what. For any power not set to be shared with a specific spouse, you can still share it with any and all of your spouses while denying said power to yourself (so like in the original description before the capstone).

Though your body may be cut and burned, trampled and sawed, drowned and torn, the primordial darkness that birthed you knits your body back together. Your body may be mutilated beyond recognition, yet every sunset or every midnight (your choice), your body, and thereby your mind and spiritual parts, crawl back together and are restored back to its peak for yet another attempt at swallowing the light, as long as even the tiniest pulse of life remains beating somewhere in what is left of your body.

Hence, the universes of Earth-2149 and Earth-91126 will forever be trapped in a time loop of people dying - over and over and over again. But Uatu didn’t really think an interdimensional traveler would come in and start messing around with the cycle. That’s where you come in. Time and fate are a bit more... malleable in your presence, though this isn’t flat-out chronokinesis. You’ve got an excellent understanding of time and interdimensional travel, and your knowledge of the local time-space-continuum will update from universe to universe. You could be the one to bring about the final end of the Earth-2149/91126-time loop for good or manufacture one of your own if you had the power.

Additionally, you’ve become immune to temporal meddling - no time traveler will ever be able to erase you in the past. If you’re to meet your end, they’ll have to do it in the here and now. There are no “absolute points” or “canon events” or “sacred timeline” that’ll stop you from changing things. You won’t be causing paradoxes no matter how much you screw around with the timestream.

1754,,600,Paling,Final Fantasy XII,Benevolence,"Concentrating your magickal energy, you can generate a force field that negates all attacks against you. This lasts for as long as you have energy, but it does burn out your reserves extremely quickly. While you have the Paling up, you must be actively channeling it and cannot do anything else."
1755,,600,Rebirth of Memory ,Black★Rock Shooter,Benevolence,"“We have no feelings. However, some things are important to us. The girls who are so very important to us are crying. They’re hurt. Our precious... precious... wounds. “

There are some things not even death can take away and memory... is one of them. While Bonds Beyond Even The Stars makes your friendships unbreakable with those you care about, Rebirth of Memory makes it so your memory is eternal and cannot be damage or edited by any means, including those you care about will have such a memory be considered eternal, the feelings felt by such memories can also never lose their appeal or importance unless it would be for the better.

However, as you are partly memory, it would do you no-well for death to take you away and so this perk acts as a One-UP, resurrecting you in a flash of blazing light of your choice, usually in the spot where you died but you may also automatically teleport to your warehouse or your Otherworld Territory if you have one as you resurrect. That is not all however.

All of your One-UPs, including this one have been upgraded to also do the following when you resurrect: Firstly, when you resurrect, all negative conditions placed upon you are removed and revoked, if you were insane when you died, resurrecting would restore your sanity, an infernal curse placed upon your soul would wilt into nothing, a lost arm that normally could not be healed would be restored, a forced transformation into some monstrous form would see you restored to your true self, etc.

Additionally, when you use your One-UP you can also resurrect with you all of your dead companions in this process or anyone that you consider your friend or otherwise hold strong memories of... which could potentially be a lot of people with this perk."
1756,,600,Awakening of the Soul,Black★Rock Shooter,Benevolence,"Your real self, before they left for the Otherworld, maybe they had a close family member, a single friend that kept them steady when all else scorned or belittled them, or something else. Whatever the case, just before they left, they managed to make them promise to do… something for them, and even if they didn’t truly understand, the significance of the event formed an Otherself that swore itself upon upholding that promise, a connection that the real self realized as soon as it was formed.

You too can do this, you can now artificially awaken an Otherself from a person so long as they have a soul or sapient mental-state capable of actualizing grief or trauma. While this usually requires the person to make a promise to you or an ideal, that need not be the case, a personal speech to inspire or drive one forward may also bring it about (think like awakening someone’s Aura from RWBY.) This Otherself is much more stable than their brethren and while they love their real self above all else, they’ll see you and your real self in a positive light, not attacking them outright and willing to listen to what you have to say... so long as you don’t hurt their real self afterwards. In some cases they’ll be happy to help you if they come about from a promise to protect you or something similar.

Those awakened in this way are automatically made aware of this connection between their Otherself and gain a weaker version of the Rekindling Connection perk for their Otherself only, this also tells you and them the name of the Otherself as it is ultimately required to fully form the Otherself at the end of this process.

There may be a way to make multiple Awakenings at the same time, but it would not be able to be achieved from this jump alone.

As a bonus, you may utilize this power on yourself if you somehow lost your Otherself (or real-self if they swapped places with you), or they have died to bring them back or resurrect them even if there is no connection remaining, forgetting your soul or love is not in question. Though such a thing is quite exhaustive, and not to be used lightly."
1757,,600,Invincibility,Final Fantasy XI,Benevolence,"As the party vanguard (tank) you are going to end up out front in the thick of battle most of the time. In a battle you are often the last line of defense for your party, as you cut your group a bloody path through your foes there may come a time when you just cannot continue, you are wounded or badly injured and the next few moments are what decide if your party will live or die. That is where this perk comes in, this perk is actually an ability, the ability to once a day make you and 5 other people completely invulnerable for 5 minutes. For those 5 minutes what you can accomplish is staggering and though this ability can only be used once per day its power should not be underestimated."
1758,,600,Overhealing,Final Fantasy XI,Benevolence,"There's healing and then there is what you can do. The sheer potency of your white magic is amazing and those you use it on heal sometimes even better than they were before, with this ability any time you heal someone you have a chance of overhealing them, giving them a sort of negative damage that will allow them to heal instantly from damage for a few hours. Blessed be unto the white mage."
1759,,600,Let The Gates of Valhalla Open Wide,Dies Irae,Benevolence,"The Einherjar of the Gold are those favoured warriors who have been blessed with entrance into Valhalla. Their number includes the Three Commanders that serve Reinhard Heydrich as his greatest warriors and they are immortal in almost every way. Even should their very souls be destroyed, the Einherjar will return in just a few hours to continue their ceaseless battle. Only something that could kill even the unkillable, prevent resurrection entirely or simply bypass the need for death to erase their very concepts of existence could manage to kill an Einherjar. Now you too are one of these immortal warriors, though it seems that a mysterious Benefactor has taken up the role normally filled by Reinhard. Even if your body and soul is entirely obliterated, you will return to life in just a few days. As detailed above, there are things that can kill you, certainly in this world, but they are rare and hard to come by. "
1760,,600,Myth In The Making,Dies Irae,Benevolence,"Even when a God descends on the world and your comrades are pissing themselves, you’ll be standing tall and looking at the end with a smile on your face. You have that thing called Will, on a level few to none can match. Your strength of determination transcends just allowing you to face any fear or hardship with a grin on your face, it even manifests into the physical world. Your body will hold together far more than it should, continuing to fight solely because of your will holding it together even when you have been cut into pieces. Your energies have just a little more to give than should be possible. If you were not already capable of surviving as just a soul, this sheer will would allow you to live past the point of your bodily destruction on nothing but will. Should you actually be killed, you’ll find yourself still able to fight for a few minutes more before that death finally overpowers your will, though unfortunately in this time you cannot be prevented from dying and can only struggle and fight. "
1761,,600,The Aryan Dream,Dies Irae,Benevolence,"A philosophy that many of the members of the LDO share is that they seek to eliminate their own flaws, whether by working to conquer them and turn them to strengths or just by killing absolutely everyone who even knows of the weakness’s existence. You took it more to heart in the former way and gained the ability to slowly work and train yourself to get rid of weaknesses in yourself and even in the powers that you have. The greater the weakness, the longer it will take but by constantly exposing yourself to and outmatching that weakness, you can see it disappear over time. You’ll find it much easier to train an attribute you are deficient in, possible to become immune to sunlight as a sun-fearing vampire or even able to have a fair time of riding yourself of mental flaws such as a lack of self-control."
1762,,600,Broken Chains,Dies Irae,Benevolence,"Whatever you were made for, it’s not something you’re going to lie down and accept without a fight. If you had a purpose, it’s irrelevant to the you of now. You’re your own man and not just the costumed puppet of anyone else, not even God himself. It is impossible to control you anymore, through any means. Your actions and choices are entirely your own, rendering you immune to any attempt to control your mind, body or soul and even severing you from the need to follow any instincts or automatic responses to things. Even God himself trying to force you to act according to a certain nature would fail utterly and you can ignore the most basic human reactions without thought. "
1763,,600,Bad Apple,Dies Irae,Benevolence,"You’re pretty hard to swallow and not just in terms of the boasts you make. It doesn’t seem possible for anything that eats you to actually keep you down, even if they chew up your body as they do it. In fact, when they try, you’re able to get them to chuck you back up and even bring along some souvenirs. When somebody or something eats you, so long as your soul is not destroyed in the process, you’ll be able to tear your way out of their belly a few minutes to a few hours later, killing them in the process if they aren’t a lot stronger than you, and taking most or all of their powers in the process of this. If they’re strong enough to survive you tearing your way out of them like this, you’ll only receive a portion of their powers, but you’ll be rested and ready to go once you exit, even regaining your physical body if you were reduced to a soul. "
1764,,600,Sacred Gems,80s Sword and Sorcery,Benevolence,"Lots of gems here. Though these 5 gems honestly look like the transparent stars that are sometimes put over Christmas lights more than gems. They even glow in various colors. They come with a monument or metal frame to put them into, something about the size of a large man. As long as they are in place in this structure they protect the justice, prosperity, peace, and happiness of the country whose capital building they are placed in. They effectively massively weaken hostile supernatural forces against the realm as a whole, and provide the country with a sort of plot armor as long as they are kept at its heart and safe, ensuring that natural disaster does not strike it, plagues are reduced and weak, loading the dice in their favor should they be invaded, and encouraging successions to go smoothly and without crises. Unfortunately all these things only protect the country as a whole, individual regions can suffer disaster if it can be lost in the size of the empire, it does not protect individuals unless they are being assaulted in a way that directly assaults the empire as a whole (for example it will help protect the king from being mind controlled as that would be magic to control the entire kingdom, but not from being killed as while that could weaken the kingdom their heir would be there to take their place), and the gems cannot protect themselves in this way. Thankfully they are nearly indestructible, unless you actively cooperate in their destruction."
1765,,600,Amulet of Life        ,80s Sword and Sorcery,Benevolence,"This glowing, red pendant possesses the lifeblood of generations, one of the three powers of creation. It is the key to life, and he who wears it cannot die. This will not grant total invulnerability, but while it is worn you will find that all damage and harm you’d ordinarily receive is reduced by a significant percentage, swords failing to cut as deep, and magical force doing about half the harm it normally would, and even things that should be enough to kill you multiple times over will fail to actually kill you as the amulet renders you truly immortal while worn, and will prevent the destruction of your head, upper portion of your spinal cord, ribcage, and heart while worn. This will also allow you to heal much more quickly than normal, wounds closing in mere seconds, and even being reduced to a head and upper torso while it is worn would be healed from within minutes. Finally the amulet allows you to change your shape into that of a mundane animal up to the size of an elephant or as small as a mouse. The amulet itself is indestructible, at least to the forces of this world."
1766,,600,Unscripted,80s Sword and Sorcery,Benevolence,"So many of the villains and heroes here have some well defined destiny. Only the prophesied child can kill the priest-king. The warrior shall found the greatest tribe ever known to these lands. Wouldn’t it suck if you couldn’t act because fate had already decreed who would win and how?

But you are not from this world. You are not part of its skein of fate. As an out of context situation, destiny does not bind you, and fate has no influence on your actions; you can kill the destined hero before his destiny bears fruit, or slay the overlord despite not being the chosen one. You don’t even need to shout about how you reject this reality to substitute your own, though it is encouraged. This protection from fate shields you from prophecy or precognition, and will keep you from having a specific fate written for you by others.

And it’s not just when fate is involved that this capability shows up. Whether it’s de-railing canon events, upsetting the natural order of the world, or just changing the status quo, your actions’ ability to disrupt the natural flow of the world’s events seem to be magnified, helping you to upset the events around you. You can toggle this off or on, if you decide you do not want to upset canon events, or cause social upheaval."
1767,,600,Body Forged in a Thousand Suns,80s Sword and Sorcery,Benevolence,"You are no mere ordinary mortal. Perhaps your soul and body were forged by Zeus to create a champion that would stand as the best of humanity, something more than man akin to the gods themselves. Whether it’s true or not, you possess (literally) Herculean strength, strong enough to overpower 8 strong men and crush them as a group against a wall with a massive log, or to drag 4 horses kicking and screaming and exerting all their might to move in the opposite direction simply by walking, throw a log hard enough it disappears into the distance, shatter inches thick iron chains, punch people hard enough they go flying several feet through the air, lift boulders as if they were made of styrofoam, and similar feats of superhuman strength. In fact there is something about your strength which helps you to defy physics through it, you could throw or kick objects hard enough to send them flying miles and yet by jumping on them or attaching them to something ride on or pull vehicles you are riding on, or if your size and strength were increased enough you could push apart two mountains to separate two continents; it’s a mythic quality that helps you to use your strength in ways that might be seen in the narrative of myth and legend but which do not work with our modern knowledge of physics.

You are of course tough to go with your strength. By setting yourself against steel blades you can cause them to break on your flesh, and you could grapple and wrestle someone equally strong to yourself as a normal man might another normal man. Even extremes of energy do not threaten you nearly as much as a man. You could reach your arm into a cold intense enough to instantly form ice around your flesh - similar to liquid nitrogen - and while it’d hurt you’d suffer no permanent harm. You are similarly resistant to extremes of fire and heat, able to reach into fire without harm, though sufficiently powerful magical flames could burn you or even immediately incinerate you. Your demigod nature will also help protect you from poison, disease, and magical assaults against your life force; your resilience is simply more than human in all regards."
1768,,600,Spare Lives,The God of High School,Benevolence,"You grow two new horns on your head, in whatever style you choose. Each of these horns represents an ‘extra life’ that has been imbued into your body. When an attack would normally kill you, one of these horns will break and instead the attack will not affect you. Truly powerful attacks may even take both horns breaking to negate but you can at least be assured that nothing will require more than both horns breaking to survive. These horns will only replenish themselves once every ten years and this regenerative process cannot be sped up."
1769,,600,One Hundred Times My Own Power,The God of High School,Benevolence,"The enemies of Nox are cowardly and sneaky. Rarely will they fight you straight forward as a man should, instead they’ll will scuttle along in the shadows, trying to strike where you are weak. Some of them will even try to turn you against yourself, stealing your blessed powers and using them against you. No more will they be able to commit these disgusting affronts to your being. If it originates from you, it cannot harm you. Your own powers will not scratch your skin if reflected back at you, abilities stolen from you will not work against you and energy drained from you will fail to empower foes when they use it to strike against you, leaving them with nothing but their own power. Those thieves will be unable to even use the weapons you wield if they take them from you. So long as it is yours, it will serve them not. If they want to fight you, they’ll do so honourably and with their own power.

Boosted: The foes may be cowards but your friends are not. Clearly you would never accept a craven fool as a treasured friend, correct? Your power has accepted those allies, extending your protection to work against them too. When it comes to your friends, family, lovers and allies, their powers, attacks, energies and even their items will not work against you unless you desire it, whether it be used by them or by someone who has taken those things from them. If this ally ceases to be such to you, they will be able to pierce this protection once again. Or rather, it will 24 hours after they have stopped being allied to you. You can't let such a betrayal get away unpunished.

1770,,600,To Hell with You and Your Gods,The God of High School,Benevolence,"When you’re up against all of Heaven, victory is most definitely not assured. You’re likely to face more than one big defeat on the path to liberation and it’s all too easy to lose hope. But when you’ve got a job to do like this one, you can’t let one or two losses drag you down. When you lose but manage to survive, you’ll be able to come back almost straight away to what you lost against with even greater power. Maybe you came face to face with a God and they crushed your squad but somehow managed a second wind, filling you with determination that boosts your strength higher then you thought you were capable of. Or another organisation bought you out, leaving you devoid of financial or political strength, yet you manage to find a few backers in just a couple days that let you strike right back at your foes with more money and favours then you’d ever manage to gather before you lost. This by no means makes victory a certain prospect but this second try will always have better chances then your first, even if that better chance is only a sliver above the first one. If you lose a second time, surviving will be wholly up to you.

Boosted: The second try succeeded and you won against your former rivals. But what if they rise back up against you? You'll have the reverse of your original ability too now. Not only do you find it easier to beat enemies on the second try, you'll find it much easier to defeat anyone you've already beaten if they try and fight you again. If you threw down the old regime, they'd find it almost impossible to claw their way back up, even if they'd normally have a fair chance at the act.

1771,,600,War Trophies,The God of High School,Benevolence,"You’ve been blessed with a constitution unique amongst the Three Realms, save for a certain being. When you experience and survive a supernatural attack or strange substance of some sort, such as a virulent poison or powerful acid, you will absorb part of that hostile attack into your body, forming into a mark or tattoo of some size and form. This grants you a great resistance to whatever the attack was as well as a lesser resistant to other attacks of a similar type. Surviving the bite of a mythical snake monster would make you more resistant to poison and highly resistant to the same bite from that mythical snake. Surviving the same attack multiple times will increase this resilience as well as making the representing tattoo larger or more intricate. Eventually you will have an entire tapestry denoting the many battles you have survived that covers your form.

Boosted: Got not time to build up a resistance, not when you're diving headfirst into the blades of the enemy. You don't need to anymore at least. As long as you can survive a supernatural attack or strange substance, you'll be immune to it from that point onwards. It's quite specific, being attacked with life energy in the form of an elemental fire blast will make you immune to fire attacks powered by life energy, not all fire or life energy attacks. Do note that the tattoos you get from these immunities are particularly impressive ones.

1772,,600,Its Own Equilibrium,RWBY: Ever After Gauntlet,Benevolence,"Balance is not two forces locked in an neverending batle. Balance is an ecosystem, an organism, a living breathing thing. Thus balance can not be restored by force or calculation, true balance finds its own equilibrium. And you are a walking proof of it. You are in Harmony with the World around you. Corrupting forces or powers that would clash together no longer do so when you are wielding them, allowing you to use contradicting powers or antithetical abilities without being affected yourself or one weakening the other."
1773,,600,Delayed Departures,Final Fantasy X,Benevolence,"The Church of Yevon might decree that the dead should not linger in the world of the living – but you should know that people who make decrees are often the very people who will defy them. After all – who would stand against them in opposition, who would stand against those who made the laws?

They call these people the Unsent – spirits who have decided to remain in the realm of the living though they remain dead. With the use of spirits of the dead, you can nest it within a living individual, such that when they die, so long as their willpower is strong enough, they will consume the energy that you stored within them. They may be dead...but now they will remain in the world as Unsent.

For individuals who have accepted death readily, this won’t hold them for long. Unsent remain in the world by force of will, and don’t ever let a Sender get too close to them – or they may be making that trip to the afterlife a little earlier than you planned."
1774,,600,Code of the Guardian,Final Fantasy X,Benevolence,"A Summoner’s journey only has one guarantee – it’s going to be harsh, and fraught with danger. Not every Summoner can defend themselves, but fiends and even other humans are very likely to be capable of harming them. That’s why you’re such a necessity – in order to keep them safe and make the Pilgrimage a success. So long as your Summoner is in danger, you’ll be able to fight at your peak performance, even if you take grievous wounds that would otherwise incapacitate you.

An wound that can become fatal can be ignored once – and only once, but even that is only if someone else can come to your aid in time. If the Summoner is no longer under threat, you’ll die if aid was not administered beforehand. Naturally if you’re erased entirely, you won’t be ignoring that. You won’t be alive to ignore it."
1775,,600,All Take and No Give,Chainsaw Man,Benevolence,"Between those who give and those who take, isn’t the winner clear? With this perk you won’t give an inch to the fools who would dare try and take from you. Whether they’re stealing your property or moving on your girl, it just won’t work out if they’re any weaker or less established than you. Vampires can’t suck your blood, ghosts can’t possess your body, reapers can’t take your soul and so on. Even lifesteal effects don’t work on you. The same applies to your companions and followers’ property too. Those greater than you will be able to bypass this but not without increased difficulty and massively lowered returns to the point it’s not worth it unless they just really want to spite you. The effect is reduced if you owed them the item in the first place or they have a stronger claim to it than you, as that’s more earning than taking. You can freely give/loan your things or allow others to take them. This perk is especially effective when you’re using it to set a trap."
1776,,600,Exceptional Exception,Chainsaw Man,Benevolence,"Regardless of how well you plan things out and ensure your own safety, some things just can’t be accounted for. With this perk unless you are specifically targeted in an attack or ploy you will hardly see your convenience or safety threatened by events out of your control. Even your place of work or the friends you meet with once a month will receive a degree of protection from this. Conditional attacks and effects will also often fail to include you. If a devil targets those with specific birth months it will very rarely include yours, for example. Even if they initially wanted to directly impact you they would find themselves second-guessing the value of doing so, downplaying the positives and overthinking the negatives. As long as you mind your business you’ll rarely find yourself in a pickle."
1777,,600,Coal Heart,Fate/Stay Night,Benevolence,"A parasite of sorts that has infested the innards of your body. Formed from the Black Mud of Angra Mainyu but somehow free of his mental presence, this black substance sustains your life without corrupting you. More than the original user of this trait, you can survive almost any sort of physical wound done to your body and simply have the mud replace whatever was damaged or destroyed. Whilst it confers no true regenerative ability to the user, nothing short of being ground or shredded into hand or finger sized chunks will actually cause the user to suffer a final death. Any less and more black mud simply pours forth to take place of the damaged body. This confers the defence against physical wounds, even if caused by magic, but purely magical attacks, or more esoteric things, will largely bypass this muddy defence."
1778,,600,Fragment of Paradise        ,Fate/Stay Night,Benevolence,"A single large shard of Avalon, the Noble Phantasm of King Arthur, his legendary sheath that held Excalibur. Implanted within your body is this shard, undetectable to any outside observer as it takes a purely spiritual form whilst inside your body, though you can remove the shard at any time. Whilst not near the full power of Avalon itself, thus it cannot be used in the same defensive manner, the shard does confer a vastly extended lifespan to its owner, several centuries of life in your prime at least, as well as a significant healing factor. Injuries that would take a normal human months to heal, if ever, would disappear within a week and even wounds that could not naturally heal such as severed limbs would heal eventually, given enough time."
1779,,600,I am No One's Tool,Fate/Stay Night,Benevolence,"Most people, when faced with the sorts of tortures that just hearing about would give one nightmares, simply break under the pressure and misery. A rare few with the right sort of will might bend, damaged yet not broken. You? You don't even notice it. Even if you were viciously humiliated and abused for hours every day for years on end, you wouldn't budge an inch. Not only is your willpower so great, your physical endurance matches it as well. An entire day spent being beaten and forced to do hard labour would see you as energetic and chipper the next morning as if you had a full meal and rest. Only the absolute worst of pain would cause you to cry out and you'd easily be able to power through any shame or humiliation others cause you. Finally, even if someone committed the utterly vile acts it would take to break your spirit, you will always manage to pull yourself back together on your own, though it may take a bit of time.

Boosted: I Am No One's Tool now grants the ability to deny others the chance to defile your body or soul. Whenever another being changes or permanently harms your body or soul, it will be made to not be so permanent. This is not instant nor prevents these changes from being made at all. Rather, it simply guarantees that you will always return to what you were before the change or crippling wound if that is what you desire. The more drastic the change, the longer it will take. Someone who altered your soul to simply stop you using magic rather than outright removing every magic circuit from your body would find the block only lasts a few hours but a complete removal of your ability to use magic could take months or years to recover. Likewise, being turned into a toad will take a long time to recover from but you will recover. This does apply to physical wounds, such as losing limbs or organs as long as you survive, but does not ensure you will survive any damage if it would otherwise kill you or speed up your recovery rate at all.

1780,,600,Destiny,RWBY,Benevolence,"Do You Believe in Destiny? Well it seems to believe in you Jumper. Your plots and schemes seem to be protected, improved in such a way that makes it much more harder to prevent them, and even in the face of opposition, a minor win might still remain. It is a bit more difficult to take you down than it should be. Somehow you keep living and being a pain to your opponents. Frozen and dumped into a lake inside a cave? You thaw and can punch your way out. Taking you down for good will take a good amount of effort, more than most will be capable of bringing up. Keep in mind though, this does not by any means make you invincible. You can still fail and suffer. Its only gotten more difficult to kill you for good and your enemies will have to make sure you actually bit the Dust."
1781,,600,Last One Standing,RWBY,Benevolence,"To be a Huntsman or a Huntress is to fight in an endless war. It is to face death and threats no normal man could hope to survive. In such an arduous proficiency you will be faced with severe struggles. Its good than that that is where you excel. The more dire a situation, the better you become. This Perk won’t give you inhuman power but the Power that IS there? Your Aura reserves just hold barely well enough to endure a fatal blow. Your Punches will be knockout blows even as your fists are broken and bruised. For this Perk to truly shine you must be in a dire Situation however. Faced with a powerful Grimm while your allies are all out cold? You might just claw yourself a victory from the jaws of defeat."
1782,,600,Always In Context ,Inscryption,Benevolence,"Through the power of the OLD_DATA, the world has reshaped itself time and time again. But there has always been one constant. The challenger. You are protected, to some extent, from the shifting of reality itself. You may be inconvenienced, obstructed, or have your deck altered, but unlike the denizens and Scrybes, you can never truly lose your place in the world. To be made helpless, reduced to a bit role in the fabric of the universe, trapped in a form without power, or even erased entirely? No twisting of the world can inflict these on you. After all, there is no game without someone to play it."
1783,,600,Outside The Screen,Inscryption,Benevolence,"In most games, there’s a divide between the ‘player’, who plays the game, and their ‘character’, who they control. There are differences. For one thing, the character isn’t real. For another, if the character gets hurt, the player doesn’t feel it. This divide now applies universally.

When playing a game of any kind, any negative physical consequences of the game apply to your ‘character’ instead of you. Hurt? Killed? Banished to the Shadow Realm? Maybe your character was, but once the game is over, your real self will be fine. That said, your character’s also the one who’s got your deck or other resources specific to the game in question, so if you lose them, you may have to start fresh. You’re also as vulnerable as ever if you’re targeted outside of a game–but who would go after a minor Youtube celebrity?"
1784,,600,Second Skin,Knight’s and Magic,Benevolence,"In your hands, any mecha or vehicle is just a giant version of yourself. For every 1 foot larger than your natural size, the greater the boost in control, power, special abilities and performance without pushing it past the acceptable safety limits. This also allows you to move any Mecha or drive any vehicle like an extension of yourself making it that there's no time lag in the movements and reaction of the Mecha or vehicles. Each 1 feet marker acts as a multiplier. This caps out at 1000x of the base performance of your mecha or vehicle. This perk is coming first in determining a boost before any multipliers that various mechas or vehicles can bring on their own."
1785,,600,Hellish Survival Guide        ,Hazbin Hotel/Helluva Boss Pilot,Benevolence,"Listen here, kiddo. You're going to die here if you're not prepared. Even underneath the fancy lights and “quirky” characters here in Hell, Hell is still Hell. Death roams around every corner, whether it be an angel, a hitman, or just another demon who doesn't like you, everyone is out for blood. Unless you've already amassed a good amount of skill and/or powers, you're not going to last a week down here. This perk changes that, if only in terms of defense. You now can tank multiple bullets to the chest and still fuck shit up. If you won't immediately die because of an attack, the attack won't do shit to you. This defense isn't perfect, as someone could still pop you in the head and end your chain. Your enemies also can also wear down your defenses, so you don't go abusing it. You'll have to play smart if you wanna live to see another day here, especially if you're helping run that fucking joke of a hotel."
1786,,600,Amnesia-Proof,Final Fantasy VIII,Benevolence,"It seems like a lot of people in this world have to deal with some nasty amnesia, especially SeeDs. Not you though, you're completely immune. Whether it's 1 GF or 10, they just don't effect you. Maybe it's because there's enough room in your head for them as well as your memories, or your head is made of stronger stuff, or you've figured out a special way to handle GFs, but all that matters is that you won't forget your entire childhood without questioning it. This isn't the only benefit, though, because this immunity extends beyond simple GFs and includes all forms of induced amnesia. Neither brain damage, drugs, nor magic can ever erase your memories if you don't want it to. On the other hand, this doesn't stop you from losing memories the natural way, so if it's something important, make sure to write it down."
1787,,600,Ignorant Queen: Murderous Immortal,Avesta of Black and White,Benevolence,"You have gained an immortality that stands above even that of the Einherjar of the Golden Beast, one comparable to the Arch-Demon Frederica. While you don’t need to be a Man-Eating Demon for this, you enjoy an exceptional regeneration of the same tier. Destroying your body, chopping into a rain of blood, will do nothing. Even the most powerful of magics capable of easily destroying souls, Commandments specialized in killing and the Power of Ego of Arch- Demons fail to do anything when it comes to ending your life or permanently injuring you. Even getting erased into nothingness will have you reappear an instant later. Attacks hit, but no effect manages to take on you, as your regeneration is so fast that it may as well be instant, leaving only the small feeling of having hit something.

However, you would do well not to think of yourself as completely invincible, as this effect doesn’t shield your mind from effects not considered an attack, magic will still affect you just fine when it comes to just sealing you, and other abilities will still affect you for a time at least as long as they aren’t dealing any form of damage. And the actual Gods may still be able to bypass this effect, at least if you do not possess the same form of divinity as well.

Furthermore, this protection is based on your own your own conviction to stand against any kind of attack directed at you, so the moment you decide to dodge any kind of attack your immortality will be deactivated up until your next jump, or ten years, whichever comes sooner."
1788,,600,Immutable Nothingness: Void        ,Avesta of Black and White,Benevolence,"The cycling nature of the World of Dualism has brought despair in many ways to those trapped in it. And nothing shakes more its inhabitants than the uncertainty of this ever-shifting world that seems to be trapped in an ever-spinning charade of a war, where nothing is certain but the perpetuation of a conflict that will never seem to reach a satisfactory conclusion. Thus, people seek refuge in things that they consider certain, like how the Ashavan chase after the image of a true hero that will save them, or how many Daeva pursue their own strength as their only certainty. Even those with the potential to assault the heavens and take the Divine Throne for themselves yearn for something that gives them true security, an ‘immutable’ goal.

You have rejected all these foolish notions. The Hero of the Ashavan? Nothing but an ever-shifting ideal on which people project their anxieties. The mighty warriors of the Daeva who devote their existence to chasing the throne of their strongest? If their strength was immutable, they wouldn’t need to prove anything. Greed? Beauty? or Love? All of them are nothing but trash that cannot stand even the simplest inspection, a house of cards waiting to fall.

Only you, who has realized the truth of how pathetically feeble all these ideas are, can be worthy of being called truly immutable. And your body now reflects that. What was once subjected to being changed by others, it is now something that can only be affected by your own actions, as if your flesh had been replaced by something sturdier than matter: an idea. Attacks capable of shattering galaxies, even the powers of the emerging gods, cannot affect you. They cannot even make you budge a bit. The only thing that can change your own body is you, any other actions that come from anything that isn’t yourself or your own body will simply fail to have any effect. Be warned however that the actual gods and those who are on their level of existence may still find ways to affect you.

As your immutable body is no longer bound by the changing laws of reality that move at the wills of Star Spirits and Gods, it also allows you to preform feats of unimpeded movement, such as walking and running through any medium, even air or the void, unrestrained, ignoring things such as gravity. his doesn’t give you any additional offensive strength by itself, but it’s not that you need to affect the changing universe to reaffirm your immutability."
1789,,600,Beast of Life,Fate/Grand Order,Benevolence,"It’s the duty of a child to support their mother, isn’t it? If they can give their lives so that you may continue, it would only be them being a good son. All this talk about the future generations doesn’t matter at all. So long as a single biological child of yours is within ten kilometres of your position, you cannot die. You can be beaten, broken and crippled but so long as your children remain alive and within this distance, you are simply unable to be brought to the point of actually dying and being truly destroyed. Once your biological children have been destroyed, you lose all the protections they may have given you through this perk and become able to die once more. 

Boosted: Even if they left the nest, a mother never stops loving her children. Just because your babies are far from you, doesn’t mean they won’t protect you with everything they have. Whether they like it or not. No matter where your children are or how far, they now count as protecting you via this effect. Even children currently inside you will count, needing to be cut out of you and crushed before you are able to be killed. The only limitations are that they must be within the same jump as you, at least before you end your chain, and children in a completely inaccessible space such as your warehouse cannot be used for this power.

1790,,600,I Am Here,Fate/Grand Order,Benevolence,"Do they think that just because you’re fictional, you have any less right to exist? That you’re just going to fade away once your time in the limelight is over, to be forgotten for the next big, exciting character? They’ve got a whole different thing coming if they think you’re just going to roll over and disappear. You don’t need anything or anyone else to exist and will do so no matter your state, even if the Gods themselves disapprove of you continuing to do so. You require no energy to maintain your existence, though you may still need to eat to have energy to let your body work, and you will be able to exist even if you lack supposedly necessary components to do so. A Servant would need no master, grail system and no mana to continue to exist as normal. Even if you were an entirely fictional being from a fictional world, you could live in the real world without any issues at all. And of course, it is impossible to simply negate your existence. You can be killed but if someone wants that, they’ll have to at least acknowledge your existence as they do so.

Boosted: Your utter belief in your own existence has solidified your self-image as well. You cannot be changed save for when you believe it to be right to do so. An attempt to cast a spell to turn you into a frog will fail utterly, just as any unnatural effect that warps you to fit the beliefs of another person would as well. Every aspect of your being cannot be directly changed, no matter the opponent. You can be harmed or controlled just fine but you won’t be forcibly made into another person or into a shape or nature you do not wish to be.

1791,,600,Master of the House,Fate/Grand Order,Benevolence,"Just because you’re a Master, doesn’t mean you can do nothing but supply mana. There’s a long tradition of Masters being genuinely helpful to their Servants and you’re one of the best examples yet. Even if you happen to be a below average Magus in other areas, when it comes to magic that supports your allies, you could help even some of the strongest of heroes. Your support magic, any magic that buffs or enhances one of your allies, is multiplied many times over in effectiveness as long as it is being used on an ally and not yourself. A spell to grant physical strength that might normally only put someone at the peak of human ability could now increase an EX ranked Servant’s strength by a third again. Every one of your buffs will be an invaluable boost to your team, making you just as vital a combat member as any of them.

Boosted: Your buffing ability now scales to the combat level of the ally you are using it with. The stronger they are, the better your buffs for them will be. But this is individual and specific, even buffs that affect entire areas will affect each individual ally on a different level. You may choose to purposefully not use this if you believe your own natural buffing strength, including the base perk of this perk, would be better suited.

1792,,600,Manipulator of Odds,Library of Ruina: HamHamPangPang,Benevolence,"Either by a singularity experiment, magic from the Ruins, or whatever else could have done this, you have a certain degree of control over “fate” as it were. What that really means is that if an event goes a way that you would consider below average then it’s effectively rerolled once with your previous result as the new lowest result, so you might get the same result but you will never get a worse outcome than you did the first time."
1793,,600,Pages to Burn,Bibliomania,Benevolence,"This perk is a very useful ability being that you now internally store lives for you to use should you suffer any form of death effectively you now have a series of 1-up at all times. This initially gives you exactly 431 lives to burn which each and every one is yours to use however you wish, though they can’t be used to revive people that have been dead for a year, they can be used to revive anyone who's been dead for less than 1 year. You can use these 1-ups as self sacrifices and components for willing sacrifices as well meaning you can use yourself multiple times for powerful magic and rituals without actually dying. Effectively as long as you have pages you can’t die. If you have some way to absorb souls in any way then for every soul that you absorb you will gain another additional soul on top of your base 431 pages. These soul made 1-ups are only used when you run out of the ones given to you by this perk, so you can gather more and more lives over time. Now thats not the most powerful part of this perk, what most powerful is that any time you have less that 431 lives of your base amount then you will steadily recover them at a rate of 1 page per month when you have more that 400, 3 per month when you have between 300-399, 9 per month between 200-299, 27 per month between 100-199 and 81 per month between 0-99. The lives you gain are only every 30 days if you have less than your normal base page amount and ignore the lives gained by souls. See notes for further clarification."
1794,,600,A Soul of Great Might,Bibliomania,Benevolence,"Your soul is easily 50 times stronger than it should be and as a result you are extremely resistant to any soul based effects meaning soul based effects would need to be 50 times more potent to even start to affect you if you just have this. But more importantly your soul is capable of instinctively fighting back against any effect that tries to damage, change, kill or consume it, reducing the effectiveness of any soul based negative effects 50 fold before even touching your defenses. Your soul also recovers quickly and can’t be fully killed, you could have your soul shattered into dozens of pieces and still retain who you are and with only a week's time pull yourself back together and heal your soul assuming your body isn’t dead. It's also impossible for beings that have managed to swallow your soul to digest you and with time and effort you could even fight your way out of a demon god's guts. Your will is bolstered as well meaning you have an incredibly enduring will to the point you won’t flinch in the presence of beings that would drive anyone with a strong will mad instantly. Thanks to your soul's strength your body is minorly enhanced and you and now beneficially receptive to any enhancements you gain improving any and all perks potency that you gain a further 50% of its initial potency. This perk is also special being that due to how it changes you it now counts as part of your body mod and now joins you on your Gauntlets."
1795,,600,[S]-Ranked Luck,Super Smash Bros. Brawl,Benevolence,"You have been blessed with amazing luck, as if you have been favoured by this world’s makers. Examples of this luck could be stumbling across a spare Dedede Brooch shortly before you would be hit with an unavoidable Off Wave, an unrelated infiltrator stopping to break you out of containment on their way through a facility, or arriving for battle with a dangerous foe just after they have had their best attack neutered – or just in time to neuter it yourself, if it were in your power to do so.

While this luck will never be enough to let you succeed on its own, you will regularly be given the best possible conditions to succeed if you put the effort in."
1796,,600,Calm Heart,Miraculous Ladybug,Benevolence,"In this world, akumas are sent out to prey on negative emotions. So it’s lucky that you have good control over your emotions. Not that you are a sociopath, you still feel emotions. Instead, you are always perfectly aware of your emotions, and you will be able to tone them down at will. Whether it be fear, anger, or even happiness if you wanted to. Additionally, even when you do feel emotions, they do not control your actions. This also makes you immune to outside emotional effects, as well as resistant to mind control effects."
1797,,600,Protagonist Privilege,High School DxD,Benevolence,"It’s not just about surviving through stupidity and dumb luck anymore. Your very presence seems to draw in the attention of higher powers and long-hidden conspiracies, and your luck similarly twists so that you can benefit from it. You can seamlessly place yourself into the role of ‘protagonist’, either overshadowing or working alongside any other such characters in a story - the plots waiting for a millennia-long fruition start moving and revolving around your life, and powerful figures work to recruit or mentor you for their own reasons. Powerful rivals who will challenge but not kill you will emerge from the woodwork, letting you train and further yourself even more. You will regularly run into people and beings that will aid you in some way, and when you train or work towards a goal, you will find yourself brighter and quicker to learn, and events arrange themselves to be in line with your interests and goal. Your luck also enables you to even cheat death...when heavily injured, helpful allies or sympathetic individuals will rescue you in the nick of time so long as it isn’t too improbable, and once per jump, you may cheat death outright and emerge good as new the next day only slightly injured - as opposed to erased from existence, disintegrated, or whatnot. The ‘make yourself protagonist’ and rivals effect of this perk can be toggled on and off freely. The luck and the learning? Free part of the package. This is your story, now."
1798,,600,Something Special,Jujutsu Kaisen,Benevolence,"Not all cursed spirits are made equal. This is already evident in the grading system placing them in categories according to their strength, but even in special grade there is a large variance in terms of abilities. While some are ‘merely’ strong enough to take on groups of powerful sorcerers and win, others are powerful enough that lesser special grades may well be little more than fodder. Similarly, even among those of equal power there are differences not just in cursed techniques, but the innate qualities their forms possess.

By taking this perk, one of your physical attributes has been increased to abnormal levels even without using any cursed energy to reinforce your body. If you picked strength, for instance, you’d be able punch someone hard enough to send them flying through several skyscrapers without even using your full strength. Pick durability, and you’d be able to withstand an onslaught from multiple grade 1 sorcerers attacking with more than enough force to shatter concrete with barely a scratch to show for it, and a blow from a special grade cursed tool that might obliterate a limb of one of your peers might only excise a chunk of flesh. Select speed, and you’d be able to fly through the air faster than the speed of sound, and even hit Mach 3 if using a cursed technique devoted to speed.

You may take this perk multiple times, with further purchases costing 300 CP each (undiscounted).

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
1799,,600,I Am Here.... Now,Jujutsu Kaisen,Benevolence,"There’s a lot of factors that contribute to a sorcerer’s success: their cursed technique, the finesse with which they manipulate cursed energy, their skill in hand-to-hand combat, their tactical acumen, and so on. Yet, there is one trait that stands apart from the others: luck. A sorcerer can lack other traits and still get by, but one cursed with misfortune won’t last too long, after all. It just so happens that it is this trait you possess in abundance, though in an oddly specific way.

From now on, whenever you’re in a pinch or a situation where the momentum of battle is against you, events seem to occur out of the blue with surprising frequency to turn things back in your favour. If you’re having a hard time, a building nearby might randomly explode, giving you a chance to get a sneak attack in while your opponent’s distracted. Perhaps an ally might stumble upon your plight and decide to join you, or another, entirely separate group of people fighting might interrupt things, wrapping your enemies up in their battle and giving you a chance to escape. Or maybe some random people you’ve never seen before will charge in out of the blue, teach you exactly what you need to know to defeat an otherwise insurmountable foe, then die or run off, likely never to be seen again. It won’t happen every time, so this alone can’t be relied on, but when it does happen it’ll be sure to give you just the chance you need to claim the advantage, and give you something valuable, be it knowledge or an item, in the process."
1800,,600,Just In Time ,Final Fantasy VII,Benevolence,"How does AVALANCHE survive most of the trials being thrown at them? Luck. Very, very good luck with a dash of convenience. An entire section of city is about to crash on top of your head? There happens to be a crane nearby that would let you swing to safety in the nick of time. Locked in an execution chamber and about to be gassed to death? A giant monster attack happens and causes enough chaos to let you escape. Need to revive a friend from a traumatic experience that has left them catatonic? You both happen to take a dip in the Lifestream and get a moment to put them back together with your help. Opportunities for survival or progress towards your journey tend to pop up unexpectedly, often when you need them most. Keep in mind: Success is more than a few moments of fortune. This will save your life when it's possible, but eventually, you need to either fight or figure things out on your own...don't expect this to win your battles for you."
1801,,600,Follow your Path ,Legends of Runeterra,Benevolence,"You don’t conform to any of the traditions of the Regions, and so the path you follow is your own. However, that doesn’t mean that you can’t take anything from the places you visit. With this Perk, you can have an additional number of discounts for Perks of any other Region. The number of discounted Perks you get is equal to the number of Perks you already discount, and the price of the Perks must be the same as the one you already possess. So, in this jump, you have four additional discounts to distribute among all other Regions, but only one Perks costing 100 CP, 200 CP, 400 CP and 600 CP can be discounted. You cannot discount two Perks with the same price unless using a higher cost Perk, for example sacrificing the 400 CP Perk for a 200 CP Perk. In future Jump, you’ll instead gain the ability to learn any form of magic or knowledge, bypassing limitations regarding origins or bloodlines. Just be warned that you don’t get additional CP, so if you really want those Perks you’ll have to use Drawbacks."
1802,,600,Cosmo Reactor,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Benevolence,"Saber is the centre of the Universe! The heroine the tale revolves around! The presence of the Cosmo Reactor, a shining soul within you, is proof. Sometimes confused with being a chosen one or beloved by fate, the Cosmo Reactor is responsible for the phenomenon known as ‘plot armor’ that so many Sabers benefit from. Whatever tasks they attempt, whatever their goals in life, it’ll become possible for them. Like luck on a grand scale, the impossible becomes achievable and the difficult becomes easy. 

A journey to dethrone the Golden Great Emperor would see wise teachers like Old Man Moriarty happen across your path and become quickly attached. A useful encounter with the roguish Star- Pilot Robin Hood and Furry Friend Atalanta who guide you on your journey. Discovering strange powers like the Ninja Arts to manipulate the Saberness inside you or even, somehow and kind of against any sort of reason, a final battle with Emperor Cosmo Gilgamesh that reveals he was your father all along. 

Those who hold the Cosmo Reactor, or whatever else someone wants to call it, are destined to end up doing legendary things and becoming a legendary being. Even if they get led through a lot of very strange events and meet some very weird people to get there. 

Sabers with the Reactor come from all walks of life. The one commonality is that the presence of so much ‘plot’ has quite the effect on the user’s body, inducing great amounts of ‘plot’ and ‘story’ and ‘character’ to the physical body. Such protagonist like qualities are definitely why everyone stares whenever you strip down for the beach."
1803,,600,Curse of Astarte,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Benevolence,"Not the first time you’ve been through these sectors. You’re an old hand in this universe, two thousand years old in fact. The last time the Primordial Goddess was about to awaken, a team was put together. The seven last Masters of the Servant Universe teamed up with seven great Servants. Those that survived their partial victory over the Goddess were cursed by her, to drift unchanging and immortal through the galaxy. 

You were part of that old expedition, even an additional member, and played an important role in Astarte’s forcible slumber. Your life was cursed with immortality, backed up by Astarte’s own power, preventing anything less than something of her scale from killing you. You’ll be bashed, smashed and torn apart but never die for good with this curse on you. The two thousand years of life since then have also been pretty beneficial, serving to greatly increase any skills you have in regards to combat, magic or adventuring. You might even be quite the renowned figure with all your exploits, something that might continue to grow and carry onward to new worlds. Primordial"
1804,,600,The Most Beautiful Thing In The World,Honkai Impact 3rd,Benevolence,"Is love. No matter how much they try to deny it, your burning passion and bonds will always cause you to overcome your limits and fight, no matter how much you may have to sacrifice to save those bonds. If anyone that you are emotionally close to is in danger, you may significantly strain your body to elevate all of your capabilities by a few dozen orders of magnitude (approximately 240 times) for a period of 30 minutes. This can only be used once per day without crippling or killing you, unless you possess significant regenerative capabilities.

Boosted: Your love is stronger than most. If you are possessed or killed in the process of trying to help anyone you love, they will obsessively try to bring you back to normal, no matter what the cost is. This essentially negates chain-fail once per jump, due to the methods being too costly to use more than once a decade. For longer jumps, the cooldown is only a decade, instead of taking the entire jump. Additionally, there is a small chance that – at your lowest – you may gain an entirely new power that is related to how you tried to save the people you love. This new power can be anything – from mind control, to an amalgamation of the powers of your friends. The only thing unique about it is that it will never fail to work, and cannot be interacted with in any way whatsoever, so long as the bonds between you and your loved ones stay unbroken.

1805,,600,Blessed Divinity,Library of Ruina V1.0,Benevolence,"You have something of an uncontrollable knack of luck. Fate weaves its way to ensure you survive potentially deadly situations or even completely flipping them to your advantage. A bullet aimed at your head is guaranteed to miss. A building collapsing around you will leave you unharmed and able to escape. Or perhaps offensively, your attacks might hit at just the right angle to completely knock a target unconscious. If you embrace this luck and perhaps ham it up, you could very well appear divine yourself. This ""blessed luck"" is not limitless however, as you will need to perform sermons and prayers to compensate."
1806,,600,Reflect Ring,Final Fantasy VI,Benevolence,"During the war of the three divinities, magic was the most common engine of destruction on the battlefield. Defensive spells existed but could only dampen the effects without ruining the beneficial ones cast by their allies. But where others saw an unwanted side effect, others saw an opportunity. By shielding themselves against all magic they discovered they could turn their enemy’s spells back onto their foes. This small silver band does exactly that. When worn, it offers the wearer complete protection against magic and turns any spells cast back onto those who cast them. Best of all, this protection is invisible and undetectable except for a brief moment when it turns aside a spell."
1807,,600,Zwill Crossblade,Final Fantasy VI,Benevolence,"Rumors speak of this blade as one that was forged from a midsummer’s breeze. Certainly it makes those who are lucky enough to hold it nearly as hard to hit as the ephemeral wind. Both magic spells and physical strikes seem to curve away from the holder of the knife. While not infallible, it is not a protection that can be easily overcome. Should you happen to lose, or break, or have the knife stolen, you will discover it is more loyal to you than most knives should be. It will reappear at your hip the next morning. Always with some blood on the blade."
1808,,600,Snow Scarf,Final Fantasy VI,Benevolence,"An enchanted scarf that offers supreme protection for those who disdain, or are unable to wear, other forms of armor. As soft as freshly fallen snow and weighing nearly as much, the scarf seems to always flutter into the way of attacks of all sorts. Rather than simply blunting the blow it turns them aside. Fatal blows become merely serious wounds and glancing blows miss entirely. It is not an infallible protection and can be overwhelmed, but not easily. The Snow Scarf offers the wearer a certain resistance to fire and fire magic. It also absorbs ice magic before it can harm, funneling the magic into healing those wrapped in its cool embrace."
1809,,600,Paladin Shield,Final Fantasy VI,Benevolence,"The large kite shield has the feel of one that has seen hundreds of battles, yet it shows not a single scar or scratch. It feels no more magical than any ordinary sheet of steel would. However, in practice, this can hardly be the case. Those who hold the shield will find themselves immune to damage from elemental spells of all kinds, as well as those of the holy element. Even more astounding is the punishment the shield can withstand without shattering. For all this, there is still one more secret hidden deep in the core of this artifact of the Trinity War. The knowledge of a spell whispered to be the ultimate in destructive might. Perhaps, those who use it long enough will unravel its use."
1810,,600,Runic,Final Fantasy VI,Benevolence,"A unique side-effect of having magically charged blood is the ability to restore one’s own magical stores by absorbing spells cast by enemies. Tapping into this restorative effect isn’t something one can do idly. Channeling power in this way requires concentration and focus to ensure one isn’t damaged by the very spells one is trying to absorb. Thankfully, you have already mastered the trial and error portion of this technique and learned a truly useful skill. By holding your sword aloft and charging it with a touch of magic, you can turn it into a sort of magical lightning rod. Spells cast around you will swerve to target you as long as you concentrate on this effect. Instead of damaging you, you will absorb mana proportional to how strong the spell is. There is no limit for how long you can hold this “reverse channeling” state, but you will also not be able to do anything else while you remain in it."
1811,,600,Wisdom of the Outsider,God Of War (2018),Benevolence,"You are essentially immune to being influenced by outside forces. Fate, persuasion, reality warping, instant death, unwanted body transformation, etc. Anything you don't willingly take into yourself simply does not affect you. This also boosts your willpower to be able to face any adversity, or problem, without faltering."
1812,,600,The Curse of Immortality(Perfect),God Of War (2018),Benevolence,"How did this happen? You are like Baldur now, you cannot be killed or permanently damaged by anything in the world, physically or magically. Unfortunately, you now have the same curse that plagues Baldur, being unable to feel any physical sensation at all. Pick a mundane material like mistletoe, if you are damaged by your chosen material the spell will be broken and your ability to feel returns. The magic of this spell returns in your next jump or after a decade, whichever comes first. For an extra 600 CP however you gain the Perfected Spell of Immortality. Now, unlike Baldur you can feel all physical sensations while being able to choose to feel things such as pain and temperature should you wish. You must still choose a mundane material that will dispel your immortality but the time for this spell to recover has been drastically reduced, only now requiring three days. Once you choose a material you can no longer choose another for the rest of your current Jump. Should you destroy all of the material that exists within the Jump more would appear somewhere in the world.

1813,,600,Encrusted With Diamonds,Thailand Mythology and Folklore,Benevolence,"Oh, what a curiosity. You’ve gone through an obscure and little known ritual to encrust your very skin with various gems and precious stones, such as diamonds and garnets. The exact composition of such skin jewelry is up to you, but there’s more to this than an utterly egregious show of wealth. That is, the ritual made your skin invulnerable. Sharp weapons will bounce off and chip without dealing as much as a scratch, flames or ice fail to influence your skin beyond tolerable levels, and you can generally ignore the need for armor given your skin’s toughness.

There is a catch, of course, and a fairly large one at that. This applies to your skin, and your skin only. Your eyes, your mouth, and your asshole are all vulnerable points that your enemies can use to deal damage to you, such as shoving a spear up your ass. It’s been done before, don’t think that you’ll never meet those willing to destroy your dignity in such a manner. Your physical and magical might is untouched by this, being pure defense, but as long as you protect the parts of your body where your skin has openings, you’ll likely be able to tear through armies, undaunted by any weaponry they field. Or perhaps you’ll come across someone able to bypass the invulnerability of your armor to hurt you anyway, or can simply harm you from the inside out with strange magic.

Oh, and as a final note, this invulnerability won’t help you much against most blunt weapons, because just like normal armor, it’s not very good at absorbing such force. Still, invulnerable skin is far more than most warriors in this world can claim, and with some cleverness and awareness, you could be nigh-unstoppable on the battlefield."
1814,,600,Sei Khaw Expertise,Thailand Mythology and Folklore,Benevolence,"The main reason why virtuous priests are so sought after is their ability to relieve the suffering of the people and deal with evil spirits. The greatest among them become famous for their healing magics and repulsion of great evils. Your power in the arts of Sei Khaw, essentially positive magic, is among the greatest. Not only can you remove even the most terrible of curses with enough ease to purify it from whole armies at a time, but your healing can mend essentially anything short of the soul leaving the body (which happens quite swifty mind), and barriers, charms, and other blessings of protection are well within your abilities, such as making a target’s skin invulnerable for a time. Potions of love, age old curses of cyclical doom, pests plaguing whole regions, there is little among the evil of this world that you cannot quickly deal with, and no curse that is insurmountable. Perhaps you’ll want to travel around helping those in need?"
1815,,600,Golden Body,Thailand Mythology and Folklore,Benevolence,"How fortunate you are, prince of the earth, to have obtained such a blessing. You’ve bathed in a golden pool some time in your past, and your current body is proof of the mark it has left in you. Shining a soft golden glow from your now pale yellow skin (that is considered attractive in Thailand, although other places will vary), your body has been brought to the heights of Indra, king of the gods himself. Your physical abilities are beyond that of any mortal man, with agility that almost defies what is possible with a human body, strength enough to lift and throw large sailing galleons across a river, and the endurance to compete at full effort for days.

Unfortunately you do not have the full benefits of a divine body and thus still do need to eat and sleep, but among men you shall be unmatched. You could wrestle some of the largest beasts in this world, those who are more than a dozen kilometers large, and come out on top with some difficulty even if you wrestle them unarmed and unarmored. Additionally, you’re also able to intensify the aura of your body to attract wildlife for miles around. The glow that your body radiates marks you as true royalty to anyone with sense, and simply by revealing your true face you’ll be known as a man of pure nobility and righteousness (even if you might not actually be righteous in character). Performing great deeds and spreading your legend across the lands is no longer as daunting as it would’ve been."
1816,,600,I'll Pay Any Price,DxD Universe,Benevolence,"But you can get a discount, powers or items who have drawbacks always get those drawbacks diminished with you, using something that kills you for example would just really fuck you up, this drawbacks also get smaller the longer you use this power or equipment, eventually even using demonic sword wouldn't affect your lifespan at all."
1817,,600,Living Miracle        ,DxD Universe,Benevolence,"You're just super lucky in getting power ups, it's pretty ridiculous, you could be a guy that was half devil of the Satan bloodline and half human, and still be lucky enough to get a Longinus, with this random power ups will happen all the time with you, so be sure to surprise that asshole guy when you suddenly pull a new transformation out of your ass, this also gives an incredible charisma boost, you could without much effort create a team of Ultimate level beings, but in the end it makes sense, who wouldn't want to follow a living miracle after all?"
1818,,600,Power Up Magnet ,Fate/Apocrypha V1.4,Benevolence,"While this might annoy others, they can’t deny you have a staggering amount of luck when it comes to getting useful boosts and blessings, especially when they’d be really useful to ensure your success and survival. Get your heart destroyed? A great hero sacrifices their own, giving you the ability to use their skill and power in limited bursts. Ran out of that? Well, turns out that being in the vicinity of someone using their final technique somehow empowered you with a lesser version of it, giving you the chance to defeat someone who would otherwise kick your ass.

Boosted: Yeah, you’re definitely the protagonist, even if some people don’t like you much. Why? Somehow, someway, there’s always the opportunity for the Good Ending within your grasp. Sure, it might take a lot of effort and a bit of quick thinking, but there is now the opportunity to save the world even at its bleakest. Now you could prevent humanity getting Evangelion-ed by taking the soul-warping artefact somewhere with no humanity for it to affect, or eventually meet up with your waifu even if they sacrificed themselves. Sure, it might take giving up your own humanity to turn into a dragon or waiting a ridiculous amount of time for them to reach you in a far-away place.... but now there is always the potential for a happy ending.

1819,,600,Jumper the dragonkiller,The Song of the Nibelungs,Benevolence,"You killed a mighty dragon and bathed in his blood, drank from it and ate his heart. Having bathed in the blood made your skin harden. Your skin can’t be pierced now and will absorb a huge amount of force, except for a spot on your back, above your heart, where a linden leaf fell as you were bathing in the blood. While your skin can’t be pierced, a big amount of raw force will be enough to damage your insides. Having ingested some of the dragon's blood, which made your insides tougher as well and gave you the ability to understand the language of the birds. Birds will travel far and wide and hear and see a lot of things, they will warn you of coming danger, betrayal and coming doom but also guide you to great prices and adventures to be had. Having eaten the dragon's heart made you very wise and bright."
1820,,600,Null & Void,HighSchool DxD,Benevolence,"The Sacred Gear Canceller was an unfinished but greatly useful power that Rizevim used with little sense or forethought. This one is a power similar but superior, and you are probably a way better wielder for it than that sorry excuse of a superdevil. What this does is to negate the powers born from any item or artifact, including Sacred Gears, Holy Swords, and similar. Something that might seem like a small thing, but it’s far from useless when you see how many powerful beings are only so because of the items they have on them. Imagine the face of Odin when his spear proves itself worthless in the middle of a battle, or some Longinus user being stripped from his unearned power right before victory. While there are some limits to what you can negate, both in how long you can keep it up, or how many artifacts at the same time, it will be improved over time and use of the ability."
1821,,600,Sing A Song Of Hope,HighSchool DxD,Benevolence,"It’s all about desire, willpower, the push from the bottom of your being impulsing you forward. For you, in here, it’s not only a nagging reminder of your motivation, but a constant source of power. Not only your willpower is unlimited, your motivation unrelenting, and your impetus peerless; but you are also to capitalize it in ways that few else can. Not in the sense that you can undertake any hellish training with a smile on your face, nor how you can flat out ignore any attempt to mess with your mind or perception of reality, no, you can do those, but this is far more impressive. During times of great stress both physical and mental, during the battles where your very own life or something equally important to you is on the line, you can call your willpower to increase your odds of victory – you fight harder, endure more, and can even brute force so you can access a new power up right then and there, making your Sacred Gear enter the next stage, driving your magic into evolving, or similar feats. An almost instant and extremely convenient new technique or increase in force that could leave anyone dumbfounded about its origins."
1822,,600,Not Ready To Die Yet         ,The Voynich Hotel,Benevolence,"There is a certain quality that separates the very best hitmen from those casual murderers and weirdos that are so common towards the bottom of the ranking. It could be argued that it is professionalism or a certain bloodlust, but what so often allows those at the top to stay in place is a stubborn refusal to die when they should. After all, killing people is a dangerous occupation and more often than not spots in the rankings are vacated through the hitman dying than managing to retire.

Your ability to stay alive despite your wounds borders on the comically absurd even among your fellow professionals. Shot in the neck? Put some pressure on it and you’ll be stumbling along for at least another ten minutes. Arm cut off? You’ll have time to beat the offender to death with your severed limb before you risk expiring. Your sheer determination to stay alive won’t keep you going forever though. But you can expect to last anywhere between five or maybe ten minutes past the point when your heart should have stopped or when you should have gone past the point of bleeding out. If you manage to get some serious medical attention before that happens, you stand a reasonably good chance of recovering. Even better if you happen to stumble across a Witch."
1823,,600,Power of Hope,God of War,Benevolence,"When Pandora’s Box was opened, it unleashed all the evils of the world. Pride, greed, wrath, sickness, famine, and so much more left the box. And yet, one thing stayed within. Hope. It is a tiny thing, so fragile, yet oh so powerful. It is something that has bonded to you, granting you its powers. You are protected from that immutable force known as Fate, untouched and unbound from any predetermined future beyond any that you choose. You are a force of chaos that cannot be predicted, by mortals or gods, no matter how desperately they may try."
1824,,600,Worthy of Legend,Xena - Hercules,Benevolence,"You are larger than life, a force of nature, an icon, a ideal for others to aspire to. Through time and effort, you have accomplished great things that the envious cannot grasp, no matter the method they use. Without your blessing, any attempt to copy your abilities or emulate your skills fail, no matter the method used. This effect extends even to your visage, shapeshifters, illusionists and technological trickery all failing to perfectly encapsulate your majesty. Those who persist in attempts to imitate you find that in your presence the difference is obvious between the real and the fake."
1825,,600,Empowered,Hellblazer,Benevolence,"You become more agile, faster and stronger."
1826,,600,Recurring Immortal,Fate/Strange Fake,Benevolence,"Like François Prelati and Touko Aozaki, you have developed an artificial reincarnation cycle just for yourself. This means that with time and resources, you can create artificial bodies for you to inhabit. Instead of experiencing true death when your current body is destroyed, you simply will wake up in whatever prepared body you had. Your new body will inherit all your powers and traits, but you may modify it to give yourself a new appearance, or even new abilities. Whether the process of creating new bodies is related to alchemy, puppet magecraft or some more obscure or exoteric method, such as making new bodies out of gems or origami familiars, is up to you to decide.

Your soul also seems to be especially resistant to damage and corruption now, as this reincarnation process may even bring you back from the attacks of a spiritual creature such as a powerful Dead Apostle Ancestor that should have shattered your spiritual origin, and it seems no degradation in your soul occurs during this transitions, even if you frequently change bodies.

Be aware that it may be possible for some specific ability that interrupts your reincarnation cycle, but it seems that even in the world of magecraft and even that of the phantasmal species, it would be quite hard to find someone who can reliably put you down.

As a final benefit, this false death of yours can also be convincing enough for the World itself to consider your previous identity as ‘dead’ if you wish to, even if your existence then continues on another body. This would have no effects on the continuation of your Chain, but it may be useful when dealing with certain magical effects or rituals."
1827,,600,Consolidation,Fate/Strange Fake,Benevolence,"Servants, in the simplest terms, are shadows of the true Heroic Spirit manifested through a vessel. How much power can they draw from this vessel depends on the Master’s attitude and power. But even under an exceptional Master, there is a limit to what they can manifest. But what if you could do more? Not only you are excellent as a Master, to a degree comparable to the genius Rin Tohsaka, allowing you a fantastic compatibility with any Servant you summon, you also know a process to strengthen the Spirit Origin of your Servant, as well as any other familiars you may possess.

Keep in mind that this is a quite energy intensive endeavor. To upgrade a Servant that had already an average B rank in all their stats even further would require the intervention of a few dozen powerful magi, or a source of energy comparable to that."
1828,,600,NULLed ,Katana Zero,Benevolence,"Precognition isn’t fun, especially with the NULLs. You can’t fight them on even ground, or even on odd ground if you can help it; somewhere along the line they’ll find a path that’ll perfectly take them to you without harm and next thing you know you’re already dead.

Fuck ‘em; when you’re around and can be perceived by anyone with precog powers that has hostile intent against you, said powers just...won’t work. No psychic bullshit on your watch."
1829,,600,Sage’s Staff,Final Fantasy I,Benevolence,"This fabled artifact holds great holy power contained within it, and the wielder will enjoy the boons of its light. A mage who uses this staff will find their White Magic and any similar healing magic considerably stronger, can cast the ‘Life’ spell on the recently dead, bringing them back without cost to the user. Be warned - this only works on the VERY recently dead or dying. A corpse with no heartbeat after having passed hours prior will not live again through this spell."
1830,,600,Ribbon,Final Fantasy I,Benevolence,"The body is a temple, and this simple ribbon allows you to safeguard it from those who would seek to poison it. Wearing this ribbon on your body will grant you immunity to ‘status ailments’...poison, mind control or manipulation, and so forth. So long as this is worn on your body, poisons and disease will not infect you, and the use of magic to blind, confuse, restrain, or weaken you will fail to hold you back. This does not solve the results of physical damage or already-existing conditions, but to all else, your body is an untouchable fortress."
1831,,600,Soul of Warrior ,Final Fantasy I,Benevolence,"It really is all in the mind, isn’t it? The strength of your fists and your body have been greatly increased. This isn’t a mere boost of the muscle or an increase of power - your very soul is what adds impact to your blows, letting you shatter stone or kick down a castle gate after a few, solid hits. In addition to being much stronger, you will find that your physical capabilities increase with your own willpower, or things that represent the might of your soul. Perhaps with enough time and drive, you could make even Chaos stumble or break under your knuckles...though that time may be a ways off. The only way to improve is to both train your body and your own will...are you up to the challenge?"
1832,,600,Dragon’s Skin ,Final Fantasy I,Benevolence,"There are many ways for a warrior to be struck down, and some of those things need no steel or effort to be done. The heart may be stopped with a curse, the eyes may be burned out by the sight of things that should not be, organs may be poisoned or more. You would believe that a Fighter, a mere human with but steel and grit, would be helpless in this world...but that is incorrect. Because you need no such tricks to fight, and you don’t need them to survive.

Your physical durability is greatly increased, and the more physical damage your body can sustain, the greater your resistance against magic. A bolt of lightning from a spell lightly singes you instead of burning you to a crisp, an elemental hurricane slows your approach but doesn’t stop you, and the lord of all demons wounds you, but cannot strike you down so easily. It will be a true fight to the death - not a one-sided struggle. And the greater your grit, the longer you can make that happen. More than that, your own resistances weaken the defenses of your enemies - that powerful barrier or tough hide isn’t as strong as they hoped, even against your mundane steel. A hardy enough warrior could strike down a Fiend with a rusted blade after a long and perilous battle with this ability."
1833,,600,Curious Happenstance,Disney’s Aladdin,Benevolence,"​Fate smiles upon you.The winds of fate blow in your favour, the sands of fortune... You know how it goes. You’re simply very, very lucky in all things. Going to the Prince Consort and Royal Vizier in a matter of months after starting as a street rat is entirely possible for you.

Fate and causality twist and bend to make you safe and happy, successful and powerful,and to do the same for your friends and family.They don't necessarily always succeed, but yeah."
1834,,600,The Phoenix Is Consumed By Flame And Emerges Again,Out of Context: Disney Princess Supplement,Benevolence,"You have an innate connection to the concept of rebirth allowing you to once per Jump or once every ten years burst into spiritual flames of Phoenix Fire and return to your optimal state. Mechanically this will function as a 1-UP.

Boosted: Phoenix Orbs

Your control over rebirth is no longer limited to yourself and once per day you are able to select someone who is recently dead or currently dying and engulf their body with the spiritual flames of Phoenix Fire restoring them to an optimal state.

Boosted: I can handle Flames

At the start of each jump you will gain a list of every method of rebirth and immortality native to that Jump you will also gain access to a list of every type of Spiritual Flame and how they can be integrated into your Phoenix fire.

Phoenix Orbs Boost Requires Even Miracles Take a Little Time to Activate

I can handle Flames Boost Requires I can handle this to Activate"
1835,,600,Protection of the Faith,Fate/Legends - Baba Yaga,Benevolence,"Through faith and diligence, you have been morphed into someone greater than a common man, your body and mind strengthened by years of toil. When it comes to skill, few among the Church members can claim to be your equal, being among the greatest Executors. You have over a decade worth of experience killing Magi and your physical capabilities are so enhanced you could dodge bullets and jump 10 meters in height instantly. It is to a point where you could even kill a Servant like the Omnipotent Genius Da Vinci under the right conditions.

Your faith can even have mystical effects in the form of Spiritual Healing, allowing you to cure the physical and mental states of others and even illnesses, though not your own. Even more malevolent spirits are not safe from your faith, as you also mastered the Baptism Rite, a simple ritual that is nonetheless incredible effective against spirits, attacking them directly and purifying them."
1836,,600,Sakurai Safeguard,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Benevolence,"It seems you have someone, somewhere, looking out for you. Once per jump, when you are faced with an attack or event that would result in your death, and that you cannot otherwise avoid, this perk activates.

You temporarily cease to exist, until the attack or event has passed. Anything you have set to activate on your passing (such as 1-ups) will not activate unless you want them to. You then reappear in the nearest “safe” place. For example, if you were shot at, you would appear behind nearby cover. If the planet were to explode under you, you would reappear on the nearest place you are capable of surviving (such as another habitable planet, or a space station). It wouldn’t do to dump you back into the void of space, and kill you that way, after all.

They may be a delay after the attack or event of a small amount of time before you reappear, if it would be in your interest. For example, if you were under a scry-and-die style attack, the perk may make you wait a short period of time, in order to dupe your assailant into believing they got you (since you don’t exist, you wouldn’t ping as alive), before reappearing. This aspect of the perk will automatically fail should your attacker be aware you are capable of doing this and be willing to wait for you to return. This extra delay cannot last more than a few days. 

Post-chain, this perk instead operates on a ten-year cooldown."
1837,,600,EX Mode,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Benevolence,"When you are in danger, you will enter a special state that provides you with a number of
advantages.

When you enter this state, you under a clear change in appearance. By default, you will grow a single black feathered wing, just like Sephiroth. However, if that is not to your taste, you may design a custom form upon purchase of this perk. This form must be visually distinct from your normal appearance, enough so that one who knew that you possessed this mode could tell that when you have activated it. The form cannot provide you with any advantages not included in the perk.

The trigger condition for your EX Mode is you being put in danger. You must take on some degree of damage, the amount being dependant on your circumstances. If things are truly dire, only a small amount of damage is required. Conversely, if the situation is well in hand, such as if you have ‘extra lives’ your opponent does not, it will require you to sustain a large amount of damage in order to activate. Your EX Mode lasts until you are defeated, or until you defeat an opponent. You may also deactivate it manually should it become an inconvenience. Once you have activated your EX Mode, you will not be able to activate it again until you have had time to recuperate. Being killed and then revived will also allow you to activate it again.

Whilst your EX Mode is active, you receive various benefits. First, both your strength and speed are noticeably greater. Second, you are able to perform a mid-air jump. Should you already be capable of a mid-air jump, the maximum amount of mid-air jumps you can perform before landing will increase by one. Perhaps most importantly, you can apply a ‘Super Armor’ effect to yourself when attacking, meaning any attacks you receive do not cause you to either flinch or get knocked back, though you will still be damaged as normal."
1838,,600,Usurper,Disney’s Cinderella,Benevolence,"There are many wondrous items out there, just waiting for someone to find them and put them to good use. Unfortunately a lot of them are ID-locked with the magical equivalent of a retinal scanner. It’s rather dumb to make an awesome sword or a wand and then only let one person use it. It doesn’t bother you though, because you can just ignore those conditions. The Fairy Godmother’s wand? So long as you know the magic words, you can use it just as well as she can. The sword in the stone that can only be pulled out by the rightful heir? Comes out like a hot knife through butter. You are the exception to the rule, Jumper, as is only natural."
1839,,600,The Great Kings Before Us,The Lion King,Benevolence,"If you die, you will be able to exist as a spirit in the world, often taking the form of a cloud shaped like whatever alt-form you were in when you died. You can only take on a visual form for a short time before you become fatigued. In order to continue onto your next jump, you have to guide a lost soul to their destiny. Failure to do so before the Jump has ended will result in a chain failure."
1840,,600,Elfrick’s Magic Armor,Gummi Bears,Benevolence,"This golden plate armor is utterly indestructible and immovable by outside forces, it causes “all” physical weapons that hit it to shatter (including exotic and magical weapons like ghost-swords, but does not include things like fists, hands, feet etc).

It grants the wearer superstrength on the order of about ten tons, super speed which doubles your base speed and it’s resistant to magic as well.

Unlike the original which was only suitable for someone about three feet tall this one its “you” in whatever size/shape you are in."
1841,,600,One Love Only For You ,Disney’s Snow White,Benevolence,"Life is unfair and full of tragedy. Despite how valiantly you fought, despite how desperately you searched, despite your every possible action, sometimes you lose. You get there too late to save your loved one. You get there and all you can do is say goodbye. So you lean forwards, press your lips to theirs, and tell them you love them. And then their eyes flutter and open, and suddenly they’re alive again. Through the strength of your love, your kiss can revive the recently dead (See Notes), heal any injury or illness, and break any curse, so long as you genuinely love the recipient. It does not need to be romantic love either, as familial or platonic love are just as valid."
1842,,600,The Protagonist,Blue Archive,Benevolence,"In this world, meta-narrative plot elements like protagonists and plot armor actually influence reality, at least if Golconde and Francis are to be believed. You now hold the role of protagonist, or deuteragonist if you didn’t replace the original Sensei. As fitting of such a role, you now possess a measure of plot armor, allowing you to avoid some harm and making events proceed smoother for you. And should end up in a situation where death or similar fates are certain, once per jump you can manifest a miracle to survive."
1843,,600,An Adult is One Who Takes Responsibility,Blue Archive,Benevolence,"A teacher has a responsibility to protect their students. With this, you’ll find the willpower and strength to help those under your care when they need it the most, even if you are in poor condition yourself. If you passed out from blood loss after being shot by a terrorist, you’ll be immediately ready to get back into action the moment you wake up, no matter what the pain in your chest says. Even if you fell into a deep coma, you’d find the ability to wake up in order to save your last remaining student from being twisted by eldritch forces from beyond, taking her burden onto yourself while still retaining enough of your free will to guide her to a better future. This will not heal your wounds though, merely allow you to ignore them right up until the moment your body completely gives out. But aren’t your students worth it?"
1844,,600,Not as Easy the Second Time Around,Invincible,Benevolence,"You don’t exactly know what it is, maybe the curse that empowers you doesn’t play well with others, or maybe it is the bulwark of your being? Either way you find that when faced with unwanted magic or other esoteric energies they do not find purchase with you as they do amongst others.

Curses that would cause death wash off your skin as though they were never there, constructs of energy seem to lose coherence upon contact with you if undesired. While you may not be able to wander through the flames of hell itself you will last longer than any, other than the demons that reside there.

Yet, those magics you allow are embraced and enhanced by your being, healing that would be focused to a specific area invigorating the entire body, enhancements that are limited becoming more potent and longer lasting."
1845,,600,Never Gonna Keep Me Down,Invincible,Benevolence,"You can heal from anything, anything at all. Given time and basic support your body will always regenerate to 100%. You could have your guts ripped out of your torso and all it would take would be to shove them back in, and make sure you have nutrients to survive (if you still need those sorts of things, I don’t know you), and you would be able to heal in a few months at worst without a scar to show for it.

You are never at risk of infection, never get sick and left to your own devices you could live for millennia without succumbing to old age. Luckily for you this healing works on seemingly everything, from brains to hearts, though you must remain alive (at least barely) for the healing to kick in.

The sole issue with brain damage is that when you heal, while you retain all of your previous memories, you may not make any new ones during the healing process if your brain damage remains too severe. Which means you might get injured and then suddenly come-to months later without any memory of the intervening time period while your brain was healing. This is just by default of course, if you have other powers or abilities for continuity of memory then this won’t override or stop those from working. While this does not really increase the speed of your healing it does ensure that you will heal completely and that the healing will not result in scars."
1846,,600,Self-Sacrifice,Disney Princess,Benevolence,"You are truly dedicated to your goals, and have no problem taking bullets for those you love, so fate has a way of making it all work out in the end. Once per jump when you risk your life to save someone from something that would (not could) kill you, you miraculously survive. You might need to recover for a few weeks, but the Hero always lives to see the sequel."
1847,,600,Healing Tears,Disney Princess,Benevolence,"Some say your tears can cure the very recently deceased, but while you aren't sure about that (they can, fyi), you do know that when you cry, wounds close and the blind start to see again. Even crocodile tears will work."
1848,,600,Enchant-less,Beauty and the Beast,Benevolence,"Don’t you think it’s unfair, getting turned into a teacup because of the actions of someone else? Fortunately, this is no longer something you will be put through.

You are now immune to unwanted physical transformations imposed on you by outside forces. It doesn’t matter if it is from a magic spell, some strange technology, or something even more esoteric; if you don’t want to change, you don’t have to.

This perk does not prevent mental changes. It also doesn’t prevent you taking physical damage, so if someone’s idea of taking some height off you is cutting you in half, you’ll have to look elsewhere for protection."
1849,,600,Please don't leave me! I love you!,Beauty and the Beast,Benevolence,"Imagine this: you confess your feelings to your true love, only to have him die moments later. Horrible, right? Fortunately, you have this special bit of Disney magic to help you avoid such fates.

Once per jump, by telling someone that you genuinely love “I love you”, whilst meaning to activate this effect, they will immediately be restored to a state of perfect health. This effect can even revive the dead, but only if used within a few minutes of their passing. Post-chain, this ability can be used once every ten years.

Additionally, when kissing someone that you love, you can cause “magical fireworks” to fire off above your heads. The size and distance of the effect will vary between indoor and outdoor uses of this, and these fireworks will never be truly harmful to anybody; they do not blind, and no observer will find them to be too loud. They are simply a special magical effect to make that special moment with your beloved all the more special."
1850,,600,Slaying The Dragon,Disney’s Sleeping Beauty,Benevolence,"Maleficent is the Mistress of All Evil, a wicked fairy wielding all the powers of Hell. Her dark magic is unrivaled throughout the land...but in you, the world has found someone who might finally be able to defeat her. You are a truly wonderful representation of the arch-typical hero, wielding a mix of a fit body, a clever mind, and great skill with using both sword and shield, as well as being a great horseback rider and a little luck. You would be considered one of the greatest knights in the land with all that you have! On top of all this, you shine the brightest while fighting against evil, growing mightier the more wicked the foe. Compare Prince Philip being ambushed and overwhelmed by Maleficent’s minions to him slaying the witch herself, albeit with some help from the good fairies. Let your sword of truth fly swift and sure, that evil die and good endure!"
1851,,600,Sweet Jumper…,Disney’s Sleeping Beauty,Benevolence,"Oh my, what’s this? It seems you really have a knack for attracting benefactors. Powerful beings seem to take an interest in helping and protecting you, aiding you as much as they can and even putting themselves at risk. They are happy to grant you blessings, if minor ones, and will even lower themselves if they need to. As an example, take the three good fairies and Princess Aurora. They blessed her with beauty and song, and weakened Maleficent’s curse. They took her to a small cabin in the woods, taking care of her and even stripping themselves of their supernatural powers to better protect her, coming to truly love her as family. And when she was struck by Maleficent’s curse, they aided Philip in saving her and slaying Maleficent, ensuring she would have a happy ending. You can still drive your benefactors away if you’re really nasty, and they won’t be the strongest around, but their help could help you with your own happy ending."
1852,,600,Primordial Crystal ,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Benevolence,"A treasure of the Everlasting Dragons, taken by Seath the Scaleless after he had betrayed them. When you bind yourself to it, an arcane link will form between you and the crystal, granting you the next best thing to true immortality. Not only will you cease aging, but you will be given a powerful form of regeneration, allowing you to heal wounds before the offending weapon has even left your flesh. This will also greatly increase your resistance to all non-magical damage. These effects will last so long as you are bound to the crystal, at least until it’s broken."
1853,,600,Bountiful Sunlight,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Benevolence,"The second-born child and first daughter of Lord Gwyn, Gwynevere, will become a symbol to reflect the Lord of Sunlight’s age, one of bounty and fertility. The promise of better days, where all can bask in the nourishing rays of the sun is one that you embody well, your very presence like that of the princess herself. You possess a potent aura that will heal those allies around you, mending wounds and purging illnesses, as well as making them stronger than before.

Boosted: Your presence is not merely the promise of a dream, but a fantasy made manifest, one that all would be considered lucky to fight for. Not only are those allied with you and your cause greatly empowered, but will grant them potent regeneration, capable of regenerating lost limbs in time, and limitless stamina. Your presence could even resurrect the recently deceased, should their bodies be in good enough condition.

Boost Requires Soul of a Lord to Activate"
1854,,600,Everlasting,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Benevolence,"As surely as the earth below will last well beyond the kingdoms built upon it, so too do you understand what it means to be just as timeless. You are capable of imbuing an everlasting quality into places and structures, making them immune to the passage of time. They shall never rot or fade, regardless of what they were made of and what environment they are housed in. Only violence and events like earthquakes or fires will harm them, for all the good that will do, sing as their durability has exponentially increased.

Boosted: A Lord does not rule over just the land, but all within their borders. Not only can you apply this timelessness and improved durability to structures and an environment more easily, but also to individual items and even other living beings, turning them into ageless immortals. By concentrating, though, you can reverse the effects of time and damage on non-sapient objects as well, restoring what was broken to its prime.

1855,,600,Judas Priest,Hellsing Ultimate Abridged,Benevolence,"No, not like the band. You are one of God’s chosen few, imbued with the most powerful of divine blessings. That’s right; Catholic Nanomachines, son! Using bleeding-edge science (and not a little bit of faith), your body’s cycle of regeneration has been overclocked, surpassing even the average vampire. Like Father Anderson himself, the average bullet-to-the-head would only slow you down for a few seconds. Some special weapons, like Alucard’s Jackal, can negate this regeneration, but given time to recover, all your wounds will eventually heal. Someone would have to rip out your heart, crush it, and blow off half your body to kill you. Hell, even then you could hang on for a minute and get a dramatic speech in before you croak. Your physical abilities are likewise boosted by this enhancement, giving you the speed and strength to keep up with even true vampires for a time. A body imbued with this power actually stands a chance of keeping up with the insane willpower and conviction of Saint Guillotine, giving mortals the power necessary to face down the worst nightmares imaginable. Your humanity is basically a technicality at this point, but perhaps to fight monsters we must become monsters ourselves."
1856,,600,Baby Blue,Marry Poppins Returns,Benevolence,"Nice threads, Jumper! In addition to looking incredibly stylish on you, this navy blue blazer just seems to bring out your inner child, giving you youth and vitality far beyond your actual years. But that’s just the tip of this truly wonderful iceberg. See, this jacket makes anything that touches you more “kid-friendly.” Attacks which would ordinarily mutilate and cripple become far weaker as a result of the jacket’s interference, causing just enough superficial damage to comply with the violence allowed in a rated PG film. This doesn’t just work on physical or mental trauma, however. Blood, gore, drugs, nudity, swearing - all of these things will become lessened to the extent that they might be fit for your average PG-rated film, allowing you to safely shrug off ordinarily lethal effects without a second glance. Don’t get carried away, however - sufficient quantity or quality can still overcome the reality-warping defenses provided by this handsome piece of clothing."
1857,,600,Self-Sacrificing Smith,Pocahontas,Benevolence,"It takes more than just a noble heart to save someone’s life. From now on, while someone you care about (other than yourself) is in serious danger, your reflexes and reaction time both dramatically increase, helping you get to that person in time. If you are attempting to intercept an attack, or push an ally out of the path of oncoming danger, you will also receive a temporary but significant increase to your sense of timing, ensuring that you don’t foolishly throw yourself in front of your ally too early and achieve nothing, or push your ally aside early enough that the enemy can simply readjust their aim. Finally, once per jump, when you put yourself in mortal peril in order to save someone else, this perk will ensure you are not killed for doing so. You may still be harmed from the danger you put yourself in, such as being injured when taking a bullet for a friend, but your life will be guaranteed. Post- chain, you can rely on this benefit once every ten years. You will always be aware of when you have access to this protection, and when you are actively being protected by it."
1858,,600,Extra Token ,WRECK-IT RALPH,Benevolence,"Sometimes, you’ve just got to take a few risks outside of your game, which could be bad news for you if you end up hitting a Game Over. Luckily, it seems that someone has left an extra quarter in the machine, and now you’ve gotten an extra bonus life to work with. What a once in a lifetime opportunity! Literally! Now, once per Jump (or once per decade post-Spark), if you have this token on you (being in some extra-dimensional inventory counts), you can regenerate from death, reappearing completely intact in the nearest safe location to the spot that you died. Just as a note, you’ll appear in your base state for the Jump, sans any bonuses, transformations, or power-ups you might have been sporting before your untimely demise. You can donate this token to someone else if you want, but it won’t reappear until your next Jump, and it and its power can not be duplicated by any means whatsoever."
1859,,600,Ogre Constitution,Shrek,Benevolence,"Shrug off a normal blunt damaging blows, and regenerate from minor to medium flesh wounds. This won't regrow organs or shrug off stabs to the heart and brain, but otherwise will allow a person to heal faster and without complications such as infections. When angered or in a heightened emotional state, minor flesh wounds will visibly heal before a person's eyes."
1860,,600,I Have Nine Lives,Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,Benevolence,"Like Puss in Boots you have nine lives which you can use as you see it. Should you die during this jump you will only lose one of these lives. This means that you have to be killed nine times to fail the jump with this perk. Post jump you will still have nine lives, but you will only regain one every 10 years. Just keep in mind that being careless with these lives will earn the ire of Death even if you avoid the Dead or Alive Drawback. You will be revived in a safe location nearby more than likely some sort of medical facility or doctor’s office. That way you don’t end up getting killed in the exact same situation that got you in the first place.

Cats will receive a special version of this perk for Free. They will receive nine lives, but they will not be replaced if they do not purchase the perk shown above."
1861,,600,I Love It When I Win ,Atlantis - The Lost Empire,Benevolence,"It’s a bit strange how things seem to line up for you to when- not that you’re complaining, of course. Whether it’s something big, like somehow managing to survive a disastrous encounter with the enemy that nearly wiped out your entire crew, to littler things like having your target walk right into your trap, coincidence seems to be on your side more often than not. Of course, it’s a bad idea to rely on this- flying by the seat of your pants might work out every now and again, but eventually you’ll lose that coin-flip. Except... your luck also gives you a bizarre resilience to things that would ordinarily be instantly fatal. Now, I’m not talking about getting shot in the head or crushed to death- I mean something like getting hit with instant death magic, or transmogrified into crystal. When something like that happens, your body seems to adapt to it- somehow managing to survive, even if you’re greatly weakened, with the possibility of a later recovery. Of course, if someone goes for a double-tap or you manage to shatter yourself into a million pieces, that’s another matter- but where there’s life there’s hope, and all that."
1862,,600,Bountiful Sunlight ,Dark Souls: Covenants,Benevolence,"The sun is a wonderful thing indeed, spreading its golden light and warm rays all across the land. As the guardian of the Princess of Sunlight, the very life-giving properties of the sun have imbued themselves within you. You may now emit a divine aura, one that seeks to rapidly restore the health and vitality within any whom you see as a friend or ally, as well as replenishing their stamina. Those within the aura will also find it more difficult to be affected by poisons and minor curses.

Boosted: Your aura is now truly something divine, its effects within the realm of the gods. Your mere presence is potent enough to revive the recently deceased, as well as granting such vigorous healing that lost limbs will be restored to their rightful state. It would be impossible for mundane poisons and minor curses to affect those around you.

Boost Requires Covenant Leader to Activate"
1863,,600,Toon Physicist ,Who Framed Roger Rabbit,Benevolence,"Toons play fast and loose with physics, and while you still haven’t reached their full potential, or might not necessarily even be a Toon, you’ve learned a pretty useful trick; you can selectively make objects or willing people (or people you don’t want to harm) take on the physical properties of your body, such as stretchiness or durability. Using stretchiness as an example, you could make your clothes stretch with you, or stuff someone into a glove box. While they’re under such an effect, they get a lesser form of Toon Physics that helps them survive what you put them through, and as long as you’re close by it will continue. To go with the earlier example, if you left the area where the person in the glove box was, rather than being compacted they’d pop out like a Jack-in-the-box; a little woozy and sore, but not crushed to a pulp. "
1864,,600,Immune to the Druun        ,Raya and the Last Dragon,Benevolence,"The Druun are a seemingly insurmountable foe, unable to be harmed by conventional means, and only repelled by water or a magic possessed by a select few.

Fortunately, you have gained your own advantage over the Druun, as you can no longer be turned to stone from contact with them. Not only does this protect you from them, but it also allows you to safely act as bait, drawing them away from the vulnerable.

You are also immune to other unwanted physical transformations imposed on you by outside forces. It doesn’t matter if it is from a magic spell, some strange technology, or something even more esoteric; if you don’t want to change, you don’t have to. This aspect of the perk does not prevent mental changes. It also doesn’t prevent you taking physical damage, so if someone’s idea of taking some weight off you is hacking off a limb, you’ll have to look elsewhere for protection."
1865,,600,Creating the Jumper Gem ,Raya and the Last Dragon,Benevolence,"You are now able to give away your perks and powers, creating a gem in which they are imbued. You can choose to create individual gems for each power, or a larger gem that holds multiple powers. You can even expand existing gems created by this perk The more powerful the ability, the larger the gem will be.

The last person that has touched a gem created by this perk gains access to all of the perks and powers stored within. Only one person can benefit from a gem at a time; if another person touches the gem, the first will lose access to the perks and powers. Should a power have requisite powers (such as a spell requiring access to a magic system) or physiology, that a person lacks, they cannot use that power. If a person already has an identical power or perk, they gain nothing from accessing that same power or perk.

You can regain perks and powers at any time by reabsorbing one of your gems back into your body. At the end of each jump, you can choose to reabsorb any and all gems you have made, regardless of distance or other barriers, but not across jumps. Post-chain, you get this opportunity every ten years, and are no longer prevented from reaching across jump settings to do so.

Alt-forms, being a Jumper, or this specific perk, cannot be imbued into these gems under any circumstances."
1866,,600,Magic Golden Flower        ,Tangled,Benevolence,"A magical flower, said to have been created when a drop of sunlight fell to the earth.

The flower has great healing properties. By singing a special song to the flower, one will physically de-age back to the prime of their life, and can be healed of various injuries – even mortal stab
wounds.

For serious illnesses, the flower can be brewed into a tea and drunk, completely curing the imbiber. If the imbiber is pregnant at this time, those unborn children will be empowered by the flower, granting them the benefits of the Magic Hair perk (post-jump, they will already start with the post-jump version of the perk, otherwise they receive the base version and must wait until jump’s end for the improvement).

Unlike the flower found in this world, there is no risk of ‘dependency’ on the flower; meaning you can use it as often as you like without the worry of spontaneously turning to dust if access is taken away from you. 

If your flower is lost or destroyed, a replacement will appear in your Warehouse after 24 hours. If the flower was consumed or otherwise used up, you will not receive a replacement until the start of the following jump. Post-chain, you will receive a replacement after ten years in this case."
1867,,600,My New Dream,Tangled,Benevolence,"Sometimes, it falls to a hero to take on the ultimate sacrifice. Thanks to this small bit of Disney magic, such a sacrifice will be more manageable for you.

Once per jump, when you offer your life up for a noble cause, such as saving another, or freeing them from a lifetime of servitude, this perk will take effect. Whether through an unlikely set of circumstances, or some kind of magic directly interfering, you will either be spared from death, or be revived immediately afterward (in this case chain failure will not occur). You will always be aware of when this perk has been activated; no need to risk accidentally relying on it too often.

Post-chain, there is instead a one-year cooldown between uses of this perk."
1868,,600,Magic Hair,Tangled,Benevolence,"Likely as a result of in-utero exposure to the Magic Golden Flower, you have gained this special power. You now have long, flowing golden hair, which is equivalent to Rapunzel at her eighteenth birthday in terms of length relative to the rest of the body. It will adjust as needed to maintain this proportion as your size changes.

This hair is sturdy and easy to maintain, and you already have experience using it as a tool. It can easily support the weight of a human being with being ripped out of your scalp. You can easily wrap it around objects, and yet removing it from such entanglements is also straightforward. In combination, this allows you to use your hair to swing yourself across gaps, or to pull someone up to the top of a tower.

Most importantly, it can also be used in a similar fashion to the Magic Golden Flower. Singing a special chant will cause the hair to glow, and those touching the hair (other than yourself) will be healed from even mortal injuries, and will de-age back to their prime. Unlike Rapunzel’s hair, you don’t have to worry about any kind of dependency formed from long-term use.

If a strand of your hair is cut, it will revert to original colour (or vanish entirely if your form would not normally possess hair), and it will lose its magic. If all strands of your hair are cut, you will lose access to this magic entirely. Fortunately, your hair will not naturally grow longer than Rapunzel’s (or proportional equivalent), keeping it somewhat maintainable.

Post-jump, this perk becomes a transformation you can enter and exit at will. Handy if your boyfriend prefers brunettes. As a side benefit, entering the transformation will restore any cut strands."
1869,,600,Godly Attribute,Disney’s Hercules,Benevolence,"Something about you is just... Godlike. And not just metaphorically. You have an attribute that is as strong as it would be for a god of the realm, and it provides you abilities that are quite
extraordinary. It can be your strength, allowing you to achieve mind-boggling feats as a mortal, or it could be your speed that would let you run ludicrously fast. Long story short, it’s one thing that works at the levels of a god. You can pick any and all attributes for this, and whatever you pick works perfectly without harming you in any way, even if it shouldn’t."
1870,,600,The Embers of Hope,Disney Villains Victorious,Benevolence,"A glowing ball of blue radiance, you can fit it in the palm of a normal person’s hand. While it seems meager on its own...this point of light seems to be downright anathema to even the demon Chernabog, and you’ll find Kings and Villains and Monsters alike will all feel a burning fear and pain in its light. What’s more, in the presence of something monumental like an act of true love or heroic sacrifice, it blazes with bright light that can bring a miracle forth - reviving a lost hero, or breaking a great curse...

This amazing power only works once per year, as its light dims but otherwise stays aflame until it regenerates its full potential. If you wish, you can integrate the light of the Embers of Hope into a weapon, or an accessory you own or a new one in order to act as the holder of the light. Regardless of your own alignment, it does not harm you."
1871,,600,When You Wish Upon A Star…,Disney Villains Victorious,Benevolence,"Now you...you’re something real special. Like a wishing star fell to earth. You’ve got something to you that makes you stand out no matter where you are. You’ve got some inner light that makes you immune to the laws of the land in this place - what they’d call the Rule of the villains who hold this place in their grip. Not only that, any other magic or power that’d try to change your mind or warp your body are going to find you’re a hard nut to crack in that respect. Like any star, that light of yours can shine: Freeing people from the grip of Rules and powers like it with a touch is in your hands, letting you act as a beacon of freedom in a world of shadows. Something about that seems to make it harder for you to go down as well: It seems like destiny itself wants your life to shine bright, as the little twists of fate that allow you to break through otherwise near-impossible odds just occur around you."
1872,,600,Never Felt the Need to Drink Blood,Marvel Britain,Benevolence,"Something about you makes it so that you never feel the weaknesses, hunger, or needs that come to characterize your races to a great extent. It may be a stiff upper lip, great will or simply something special about your genetic makeup. As a vampire you would not need to drink blood, could walk in the sun and would take no special damage from stakes, holy symbols or silver. This carries forward to any other race you are, removing weaknesses, and letting you replace whatever special source of food/energy you metabolize with eating normal human food in normal human amounts at no change in strength or speed of power growth."
1873,,600,Plot Armour,Black Clover,Benevolence,"To you life is merely a game, .. at least that's what everyone else thinks. You are horrifyingly lucky, bad luck seems to just ignore you entirely and everything seems to just go your way. If you have any enemies you no longer need to worry about them for everytime they seem to think of attacking you they begin to suffer tremendous bad luck, whether a squad of Magic Knights wandering into their base or hell even a boulder just drops onto their heads. However, while this gives you tremendous luck, this isn’t an automatic win if you purposely get yourself into trouble this won't help but the level of trouble you would need to get to is still incredibly high.

Boosted: Fortune Favours The Commoner:  
It would seem that the power of the stones placed a large conceptual weight upon you where before you were merely favoured by luck, now you are pulling it towards you your luck now reaches far beyond yourself to encompass everything linked to you from your deepest desires, to your day to day life to any machinations of yours and if you were actually good at plans than i would feel very sorry for your enemies.

1874,,600,Blood Saint,Bloodborne: Covenants,Benevolence,"Flowing within you is a holy power, one that has made the Healing Church name you as a true saint. Your blood shares similar qualities to the miraculous blood used by the Church, with those consuming it finding their bodies healed of all wounds and purged of all ailments such as disease and poisons. This must be willingly gifted to others on your part, though, otherwise it is only as effective as standard blood.

Boosted: You are truly blessed by the gods, for there are few equals to the potency of your healing blood. When consumed, it is capable of quickly restoring lost limbs, restoring sight to the blind, removing genetic defects, and could even be used to resurrect the recently deceased, should you get there in time. There are none who would dare proclaim you a false saint.

Boost Requires Blood of the Great Ones to Activate"
1875,,600,Lord of Blood,Bloodborne: Covenants,Benevolence,"You share a trait thought only possessed by your queen, a blessing granted to her by the storied blood that can be traced all the way back to ancient Pthumeru. Though weaker than hers, you are a true immortal, ageless and possessing a powerful regeneration that will keep you alive through all manner of hardships, even if reduced to a pile of mush. Limbs will regrow, your heart will continue to beat, and you shall never be bled dry.

Boosted: You now stand as your queen’s equal, perhaps even her superior. Your regeneration is beyond exceptional, able to fully restore you from a puddle in just a few minutes. You also find yourself possessing a sublime control over your own blood, capable of using it in the middle of combat to attack your foes. You will stand as an eternal monument to the Cainhurst legacy.

1876,,600,The Shape of a Miracle,Symphogear,Benevolence,"You’re the kind of person who comes back alive, even if it kills you, and you inspire this light in those around. The skill and luck of yourself and those around you increase tremendously in the face of great threats. This plot armour won’t make the road to the finale easy, but even so, you will make things work out in the end. Your best friend might be turned into a weapon against you, but if you had two minutes and forty seconds to save you both at the risk of dying yourself, you’d pull it off. A murderer of miracles fires seven billion swan songs at you, but you absorb that power to activate X-Drive. Your new friends sacrificed themselves to destroy a nuke, and your secret weapon has been destroyed, but now you’re literally carrying on their emotions. Your Symphogear stops working, but your everyone lends you their power so you can transmute gold. This light? It’s the shape of a miracle"
1877,,600,Eternal Priestess,Symphogear,Benevolence,"An eternal priestess that emerges at multiple points in history, accumulating power with each life she absorbs into herself. Perhaps this sounds like someone you know? You’ve inherited a less restrictive version of Finé’s endless reincarnation. Instead of only working on your descendants, you can now reincarnate into anyone weaker than you. You will remain dormant until your host is exposed to the Aufwachen waveform, but once this occurs, you may choose to hide your presence until it’s time to take over. You retain all your powers and memories, and gain the ability to swap between this body’s form and your normal appearance. You can even access all the memories of those you integrate, without compromising your own identity.

Speaking of memories and identities, instead of letting new background memories run rampant for the duration of each jump, you may treat your background for a jump as another aspect of this perk, absorbing another while protecting yourself. This also applies for any other possession-style power or perk that provides background-style memories. If your host dies, even if you are unawakened, you can choose a new host. However, soul-damaging abilities are capable of destroying you permanently, and if you are left unawakened at the end of a jump, this counts as a death for the purposes of jump failure."
1878,,600,Unstoppable Force,Marvel Magic,Benevolence,"​Do they know who you are? You’re the jumper, bitch! You are a channel for the power of some extra dimensional entity or force, granting you vast physical powers. Your strength is enough to shatter mountains and trade blows with gods of strength. You are also covered in a mystical force-field that renders you virtually immune to damage, though which can be temporarily dispelled with enough damage -- of course, even then your durability is still tremendous, leaving you unharmed by all but the most powerful of weapons, though much less resistance to magic. If something does manage to harm you, you possess a healing factor that allows you to recover from even fatal wounds extremely quickly. You also possess no need for sustenance whatsoever and you will never tire from physical activity.

However, there are a couple of catches. First, your immunity to physical damage does not extend to mental or spiritual attacks, leaving you vulnerable to abilities that target your mind or soul. Secondly, your abilities only function at the peak of their capacity when you are truly following your own desires. If you are doing something reluctantly or your heart simply isn’t in it, then your power will be reduced to a fraction of its potential -- still formidable, but no so world shaking as it could be."
1879,,600,THE POWER IS JUMPER'S​!         ,Marvel Magic,Benevolence,"Power. So many beings are born with great power and take it for granted, don’t truly appreciate what they have. But not you. Whether you were already powerful or not, you take none of it for granted. Any power you have is yours by right of birth and any power you claim is yours by right of conquest. Those who attempt to drain or steal your powers will find no purchase in their schemes. And more importantly, any powers you claim, by thievery or by being granted them or by making pacts with other beings will be yours. These will integrate into you, becoming as though they were always yours. If you drained the power from another, it would then be your power. If you were granted boons by your god, then betrayed their creed, your boons would not betray you. If you sold your soul to a demon then snubbed it, any dark powers granted would be yours to keep.

This doesn’t affect inherent limitations on abilities such as a natural time limit on how long you can utilize a power, but rather external attempts to interfere with your powers This also doesn’t remove the necessity of an actual source of power for such abilities."
1880,,600,Kinetic Kitty,Pet Avengers,Benevolence,"Like Hairball 1 you have the ability to create a field of kinetic energy around you. This field absorbs energy directed at you, allowing you to survive gunshots or explosions without any harm to yourself. It can also be used offensively, a cat with this power could knock down grown men by using this field, or stacks of boxes, and the larger and more powerful your Species from this jump is the stronger the offensive use of this field will grow; where a cat might knock down people, an Apex might be able to send elephants flying, and a Behemoth might be able to topple buildings. A Dragon will of course have stronger powers than otherwise. Be careful while this protects you from a lot, it is not limitless, an energy blast from Thanos, for example, could still kill you."
1881,,600,Immortal ,Marvel Midnight Suns,Benevolence,You are directly descended from Old Gods and must be another Caretaker as you are biologically immortal. Due to your increased age and lack of mortality your power has less restrictions on its growth and usage making you one of the strongest witches of this world. Once a jump your immortality can bring you back from death.
1882,,600,It is my Choice,Moon Knight,Benevolence,"The very thing Ammit takes away. You chose to do good and you choose to oppose this slaughter of those who haven’t done anything evil yet. You will never be unable to make a choice, be it through mind control, intimidation or fate manipulation. Your choices are your own and no one else's.

Boosted: Now the choice of others are under your protection as well. While you are around, any you wish will always be able to make their choice. You can even make it so that evil deeds they were fated to commit will not have to come to pass if you give them the choice.

Boost Requires Avatar to Activate"
1883,,600,Switching,Marvel’s Kid Heroes,Benevolence,"So apparently Kymellians can transfer their powers by touch, and now so can you. Powers and perks alike, you just have to touch someone and focus to transfer them over. You can switch one or more of your powers with someone else’s, but only with their consent. Once you have done this with a person once, you can give them powers at any time by simply willing it so, or the both of you can switch powers and/or perks by agreeing to, no touch needed. You may recall powers and perks at any time by tugging sharply on the invisible elastic tying them to your soul, in the event of a swap the original bearer will get their powers back immediately once you recall yours."
1884,,600,One More Life,Marvel Civil War,Benevolence,"Villains never die, not really at least, and now, neither do you. Once per jump, if you were to die for any reason you will be revived either through technological, magical, or super powers. Just, try to make your resurrection interesting if you will."
1885,,600,You Think I’m Unaware When the World Has Changed Around Me? ,Marvel 2099,Benevolence,"You might not be the sorcerer supreme - and given they were secretly controlled by a demon they might have been lying when they claimed it - but you are unaffected by temporal alterations. When history is altered around you, you will keep memories of both the new and the old world without difficulty telling which is which, and negative changes to your own person will be negated, merging your ‘self’ from both the original and altered timeline in whatever way is most beneficial to you. This gives you resistance to all forms of temporal manipulation as well, whether it’s someone trying to banish you through time, or to freeze you in it; you might not be wholly immune to such attempts, but you will have the means to resist or mitigate them, and with sufficient powers or capabilities to block them completely."
1886,,600,Juggernaut,Avengers Vs X-Men,Benevolence,"Cyttorak has chosen a second champion for this time, a secondary avatar to the current one. Imbued with the power of this tremendously mighty demon, you have become the Juggernaut and find that you are highly favoured as well. Cyttorak’s power enhances you with enough strength and durability to easily tangle with the Hulk or Thor and come out on top, along with the speed to keep up with them. Your magical powers ensure that you require no rest or sustenance and can continue to fight for eternity. As tough as your body is already, you have a powerful forcefield around you that is effectively invincible to physical attacks, though energy draining attacks or powerful magical attacks can get through that defence. Even should someone manage to get through both shield and skin, your body heals very quickly and even lost limbs can be restored in hours. The angrier you get, the more your various demonic powers will improve as well, mutating you into a larger and more terrifying beings as you progress in power, with an appearance much closer in resemblance to Cyttorak himself."
1887,,600,Astral Constant,Marvel Cosmic,Benevolence,"Some things just are. Some people call these things facts, those in the know tend to call them Astral Constants. Adam Warlock was once considered such a thing. You are now one as well. As an Astral Constant you are invulnerable to metaphysical destruction, a being that shouts I Am to a careless universe and is heard as such. Reality warps and cosmic undoing now simply slide off of you. You cannot be erased or undone save on the physical plane. If someone wants you out of the picture, even a nigh all powerful God, they will have to come down and do it the old fashioned way."
1888,,600,The Ultimate Outsider        ,Marvel Cosmic,Benevolence,"You are the ultimate outsider. The universe does not recognize you as part of it and thus many things that might otherwise affect people on a universal scale just ignore you. Universal threats that affect all living creatures, viruses that target all members of a certain species, and anything with a generic large scale target has no effect on you. Things that rely on chance to choose their targets, a particular finger snap for example, will always fail to pick you."
1889,,600,Empower Heralds,Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Benevolence,"TO ME, MY COMPANIONS! You’ve gained the ability to empower others, temporarily granting them some of your power(s) in exchange for you temporarily losing the powers you’re granting. You can do this with as many people as you’d like, and can even divide individual powers between multiple people, choosing how much of each power any one person gets. You can revoke your powers at any time, as well. The only limitation is that you can’t grant the ability to empower heralds to others. As an added bonus, while you’re empowering others you can grant them an aesthetic to their appearance; either"
1890,,600,Holy Sacrament ,Fate,Benevolence,"You must have proven worthy indeed for the church to grant you this boon. Your physical abilities are now improved to incredible levels, enough for you to stand a chance of surviving in a fight against a servant, if only briefly. You can run at 50km per hour, break through steel with your fists and withstand horrific injuries for a while longer then any human could hope to survive, though you will eventually die without aid. As a side effect of this, you body will be imbued with holy magic, allowing you to use your body as an effective weapon against the creatures of the night. "
1891,,600,Weapon Reflection,Toaruverse,Benevolence,Using a weapon to defeat or kill an enemy is nice but your enemy using a weapon to fight you is a nightmare especially something that you don’t have a defense for. You now have a preternatural ability to passively reflect any weapon used against you back to the user no matter how small or large it is so long it can be classified as a weapon along with magics or abilities that use a weapon as a form of delivery or medium. Anything that cannot be classified as a weapon is less effective on you as you form a resistance to damage in general. You also gain a minor telekinetic ability to control any form of weapon in a distance either using it to control hundred of swords and form it into a sword formation to fight an army like those xianxia protagonist do or use it to fire senbon or nails even like a bullet even use it to catch bullets midair or a certain railgun from a certain someone.
1892,,600,Rebirth from the Ashes,Toaruverse,Benevolence,It is very annoying and inconvenient to receive a wound in the middle of combat while decreasing your performance and preventing you from fighting at your peak. But not anymore you now gain a preternatural ability of regeneration that allows you to heal any wounds that you receive immediately; small wounds and bruises would close and heal instantly; lost limbs or organs would take minutes to regenerate and complete vaporization would take a few hours. So long you have a drop of blood left you can regenerate your whole body from it without suffering any problems like losing your memories due to your brain being blasted to pieces and due to your regeneration your lifespan also increased by a few centuries along with you being stock in your prime while at it. This also prevents you from bleeding to death and suffering from any poison as it eliminates it along with the ability resistant to abilities and powers that prevents regeneration or healing. Normally when someone is killed they stay dead but this ability gives you an extra life should you be truly killed you would be revived once per jump or once every ten years post-chain.
1893,,600,Hands of a Healer,Toaruverse,Benevolence,"Like many doctors who gain experience through many trial and errors to heal others and you seem to be different compared to them you did it through sheer talent alone. You gain a preternatural ability to heal practically any injury and sickness even if it is terminal or a genetic defect along those on the brink of death so long their still breathing, preserving a brain and restoring lost limbs. Unlike a certain doctor you can also fix your brain or memory along with spiritual related injuries even if it's caused by supernatural or natural means. You can also give someone eternal youth and restore an old person into their prime or fixing someone’s youthful appearance due to eternal youth to an adult along with extending a person’s life-span this even applies to clones, homunculus and those that are artificially made. This also allows you to undo and heal someone from the effects of any curse or supernatural powers no matter how powerful it is and you can also recognize the signs of someone who has been cursed or been affected by supernatural powers."
1894,,600,Imagine Resistance,Toaruverse,Benevolence,"Unlike the certain protagonist whose powers is uncontrollable and also negates his own luck, yours is different. You gained a controllable version of Imagine Breaker that doesn’t negate positive things for you like luck or someone healing through magic or abilities. This power emits a skintight barrier around you that protects you from internal and external harmful effects and damage from all supernatural powers like magic, esper, and divine powers. It can also be weaponize to dispel or negate powers and abilities which can be applied to any weapon that is connected to you or things that you are holding. While it can be applied to weapons that you’re holding or connected to you but this is not passive and you have to actively apply it to your weapons. At the start it can dispel or negate abilities and powers equal to a level five Esper and reduce the damage and effects that you would receive from higher and more powerful ones and the ability to dispel or negate abilities and powers would grow stronger as your overall power grow, as powers with the same origin as original Imagine Breaker it won’t affect or cancel out each other."
1895,,600,Saint ,A Certain Magical Index,Benevolence,"So, apparently you’re a slightly higher human form. Who knew? Anyway, you now have incredible speed, superhuman strength, better mana channelling, superhuman senses and increased durability. Though you’re really not all that strong now, at just the very peak of human ability, you do have potential for growth. You might just be able to fly or even run at supersonic speeds in time. Just note that you aren’t in a position to fight any magic gods. After all, you’re no Kanzaki Kaori (or William Orwell), and probably never will be. Also, you should know that you’re more vulnerable to attacks that resemble the way Jesus died, a spell that deactivate your Saint abilities temporarily exists, and you run the risk of hurting yourself badly should you push your new awesome body too far. Nevertheless, you have the potential to put most skilled magicians to shame."
1896,,600,Keeper of the Flame ,Darkest Dungeon,Benevolence,"“Compassion is a rarity in the fevered pitch of battle.” Healing. The simplest of the Light’s promises, and yet one of the most effective for prolonged campaigns and short fights alike. Imbued with this power by the Holy Flame, you now have the ability to spread this gift to others- knitting their wounds even as they are split open and making even grievous wounds disappear with sustained channeling. Although this won’t do much more than heal some of the blood loss for especially nasty cuts- and nor will it neutralize poison- it will keep these things from pushing someone over the edge, allowing the wound to clot and the poison to metabolize. Your powers are such that they can be extended to a small group of people- including yourself- allowing you to keep an entire group from the boatman’s clutches, so long as luck and speed is still on your side. "
1897,,600,Revisionism,Bayonetta,Benevolence,"The energy of chaos and creation course through you, and it is unlike you to forget this nature, this duality that continues in an endless cycle. After all, chaos is harnessed for creation, but eventually all creation must give way and erode into chaos, to be used once more. Why not fiddle with that cycle, then? It takes much out of you, but using your energy you can focus on a shattered item up to the size of a small statue to make it repair itself to a pristine state. Naturally it's harder if it's a magical or esoteric material, and it's MUCH more difficult if you're missing pieces (or even half of it)... but it takes patience to see Creation and Chaos work. Should you not be patient as well?"
1898,,600,Gift of the Self ,Shovel Knight,Benevolence,"You are your own master, body and soul. You are able to use your body to its tip top ability and then some. You can move faster than physically possible, lift more than physically possible, hold your breath for more than physically possible, etc. These will still hold the same negative consequences, but you will be able to do them in a pinch. In addition, your body operates at max efficiency. Also, you will be much harder to manipulate."
1899,,600,Resolve,League of Legends ,Benevolence,"You're really, really hard to keep down. So long as you're not dead, you can come back from just about anything. So long as you stay out of combat and don't exert yourself, your natural regeneration speeds up to the point where you can be in fighting shape only an hour after crawling away from a battle near the brink of death. You cannot regenerate severed limbs or lost organs this way, but other wounds like cuts, gashes, and broken bones will heal themselves in minutes when it should take weeks."
1900,,600,Health Bar,League of Legends ,Benevolence,"You don't get hurt the same way everyone else does. When you're wounded by an attack, instead of an actual wound, the damage goes to an abstract ""Health Bar"". This Health Bar is a measure of your durability, and instead of having your arm cut off or your ribs smashed, your health bar simply decreases by an amount proportionate to how devastating that wound would have been- But you don't actually suffer that injury, meaning you're running at peak condition right up to the moment you die. When your health bar runs empty, you die, but things like medicines or healing magic can restore your health bar, and it regenerates over time in accord with your body's natural healing. You can check how full your health bar is whenever you want."
1901,,600,Riposte,League of Legends ,Benevolence,"Skill with a weapon doesn't merely mean attacking. Defense is also important - and your defenses are impregnable. In your hands, a weapon is as good as a shield, and you can use one to block just about anything. Enemy blades, Enemy arrows and bullets- With supreme skill and timing, you could even block magical attacks. Explosions, lightning bolts, charm magic, disintegration lasers... With enough skill, you can deflect any impact that won't also break your weapon. However, this merely means it won't effect you, and it's entirely possible to block the initial impact of something that can still kill you in other ways."
1902,,600,Touched by Silba – Healing Magic ,A Throne of Glass,Benevolence,"Touched by the goddess Silba, you have gained a well of potent healing magic within you, along with the skills to use it. Silba’s touch infuses your healing magic with a golden glow and potency that even Raw magic can’t copy. Your magic is unnaturally potent at purging beings that possess people, able to treat even the greatest of them as just another parasite to be fought, able to purge anything from ghosts, to Valg demons, and beyond. In fact it is especially potent at purging beings of darkness and shadow. Beyond this potency your reserves are deep enough that while exhausting you would be able to heal grievous battlefield wounds from dawn till dusk and still have a bit of power left over. In fact, you have enough magic that if you ever learned how, you could turn your gift of healing and life into a skill for Un-Making, able to break the gates of the world and fashion Wyrdkeys that allow beings to travel between different realities and gain immense power over reality. While the knowledge of Un-Making is beyond you as of yet, you are still an immense repository of healing knowledge both magical and non-magical, of herbs, physical therapy, and surgery, easily on par for the greatest healers in the world. Specifically with enough skill and knowledge that you could be the Healer on High, the leader of the Torre Cesme, the greatest healing institute outside of the greatest of the Fae. For you wasting sicknesses, massive infections, cancer, shattered spines, and destructive brain injuries are things that you can heal perfectly and permanently. So long as you arrive before the bearer of the wounds dies and have a few days to put everything in its proper place you can heal everything. Just don’t forget to teach the patient the physical therapy they will need to recover."
1903,,600,Photonic Armor,Super Dragon Sword,Benevolence,"You have reached the apex of Photonic Power. You are capable of shaping it in physical forms around yourself, creating constructs that can even operate as “armor” made of pure photonic energy. These Photonic Constructs rely on your control and willpower to stay stable, with attacks meant to destroy them taking their toll on your ability to focus - even being capable of knocking you unconscious if the stress on your mind is too much. Even so, a strong willpower will allow these photonic armors to withstand absolutely devastating attacks."
1904,,600,Old Anon,Ben 10,Benevolence,"You are no mere squire, no hollow successor to the name of the Forever Knights. Born in the days of ancient Rome, you unlocked the secrets of immortality and likely founded the order alongside your comrade (or at least ally of convenience) Sir George. The Forever Knights have fallen far from their original purpose into nothing but squabbling sects vying for control of Earth, but perhaps with you at the helm they will remember their true purpose? As said before you are ageless and at your discretion, you may appear as either a fairly healthy senior or in the prime of your youth...regardless of which, you have much greater strength than an ordinary human, as well as thousands of years of experience in any commonly available weapon in Earth’s history. Your age shows in how you speak and carry yourself, a magnetic charisma surrounding your personality that draws those faithful to your cause to you and ignites unwavering loyalty within them. In future worlds, this experience updates to include two thousand years of skill in combat and weaponry that existed within that timeframe, though you may not necessarily have it on hand by the time the jump begins."
1905,,600,Right When I Needed It ,Ben 10,Benevolence,"Okay, so MAYBE things can be a little tougher than they look. Stuff happens! But a real hero is always ready to deal with trouble and so is their luck! You’re never gonna be down for the count because of something like a stray laser or because you tripped and fell down a chasm and broke a few bones, accidents always missing you or just causing some harmless inconvenience. Even better, this luck extends to surviving when people are trying hurt you on purpose too. Villain has you cornered while your hero gadget is bugging out? Here comes the cavalry! Someone sends a super alien specially designed to kill you? Good thing it just stepped on something its weak to, giving you an idea of how to beat it! No matter what you do or what you’re up against, you’ll always have a chance to turn things around and win or at least fight another day, victory never being a zero percent shot. 

Just, uh...bad odds are still bad odds, okay? Don’t fight something way out of your weight class while blindfolded and expect to be anything except toast."
1906,,600,Dragon Armor  ,Dracula Untold,Benevolence,"This is full-body plate armor, decorated with a dragon on the front. The default is black and the dragon in red, but you can change that. This is, quite simply, the finest set or armor in the world for you.

What this does is that it’s always, without fail, at least an order of magnitude more durable than your skin. Not only does it grow in physical durability, it flawlessly adapts any resistances or immunities you may have, and amplifies them to an equal degree upon itself. Not only this, but it can adapt to any and all forms you take. As long as you remain in one piece, and not, say, a cloud of bats, it protects you just as well.

And yeah, no matter what you may look like, this armor always looks the epitome of badass and cool."
1907,,600,Ring Giver,Dresden Files,Benevolence,"Is an ancient and archaic way of referring to overlords, such as kings or emperors.

It’s also what you are, now. You have the ability to empower others in your name, or the name of your faction. Much as the Fae have the Summer and Winter Knights, and how gods can have champions, you have the power to bundle off your powers, perks, abilities, skills, or whatever parts or combinations of them you want and gift them to others.

This can be anything, from mundane skills to talents in a specific field, specific perks, the ability to cast branches of magic, or sheer raw power, but you can parcel it out of yourself, and grant it upon people. If you want you could even make a Mantle out of it much like the Winter/Summer mantles. You can give these to someone specific or set conditions for it to find a suitable wielder, and it can be ethereal and impossible to pin down, a fae/divine mantle or physical objects, it’s all up to you.

You lose whatever you give away to a major degree. Not completely, of course, and if you grant someone abilities that have simple ‘Yes/No’ effects the reduction might not even be noticeable. But for things that are measurable, the less there is remaining in you, the slower it grows back… barring the effect of other perks/objects. 

The power you grant can have various effects on the bearers, be they cleansing or corruptive, but the one clause you can’t violate is that the bearer must be willing. That is, when they first take on the power. What happens after is entirely between them and you."
1908,,600,Starborn,Dresden Files,Benevolence,"You were born on Halloween! Well, even if you weren’t, somehow you have all the benefits of someone who was anyway. That is, you happen to be a Starborn. Born with the ability to interact with Outsiders without getting corrupted in body or mind... and other mysterious things not yet revealed.

For the purposes of this perk you have the ability to interact with Outsiders and the Outside without needing to be concerned in any way. It includes a flat immunity to Nemesis and others like it, along with quite a lot of their powers that work by controlling or corrupting you in any way. Firstly this takes the form of a protagonist’s role in the story, complete with plot armor and all the rest.

You find that your enemies forget half their powers when fighting you, or just make mistakes it doesn’t really make much sense for them to be making. People who should be impossible, terrifying monsters... aren’t. This doesn’t mean that you can expect to just win everything, but it does mean that so long as you don’t pick some kind of impossible fight or stupid enmity, you will probably survive 99.9% of the scrapes you get into.

And of those, if you’re really clever and really capable, you can probably win most of them. Again, this won’t do anything truly impossible. But you find yourself getting second, third and fourth winds, making leaps of logic when figuring out plans that are all improbably correct, and all other kinds of things that almost make it seem like your life is a novel being written for entertainment instead of reality."
1909,,600,Tiger's Soul ,The Dresden Files,Benevolence,"You're the kind of person who knows what they want, knows the most efficient way to get it, and know you're going to get it and nothing will stand in your way. Against anything less than the psychic equivalent of a hurricane, your mind will neither bend nor break, and even the biggest, scariest monsters aren't capable of making you blink. Best of all, you don't have to waste your time proving this to people, because on some innate level, they get it. They might oppose you, or snark at you out of principle, but they'll respect you while they do."
1910,,600,Serendipity,The Dresden Files,Benevolence,"Spend some time around a Knight of the Cross, and you stop believing in coincidences. Well, it seems like you're drawing from the same benefit package, because things just happen in a way that works for you. Let's get one thing straight, though - this isn't luck. It won't win you the lottery, and it won't stop a bullet. But when someone needs you, you'll arrive just in the nick of time, when you're stuck without any leads you'll somehow come across just what you needed, and when you're going out on a dangerous trip you'll always be able to find a babysitter."
1911,,600,True Love’s Kiss,Frozen,Benevolence,"Every fairy tale princess is saved by the kiss of their true love. But no one ever said that true love had to be a prince charming as well. If they did, they’re totally an idiot. What is real however is the power of a kiss from someone you love. Even the worst of curses and magical maladies can be cleansed with the power of love in this way and this is a rule that applies to you and all those you love now too. With just a kiss from someone who truly loves you or giving a kiss to someone you truly love, you can heal them of even the worst wounds. Any curses disappear, wounds will heal almost faster than you can watch and even madness is cleared away from their mind. While True Love is a powerful force for good, it needs a little bit of time to work the magic. If you pepper your love with kisses, don’t expect them to be healed unless the first kiss’s magic has worked its way out of their system already. Once every ten years per person, you may even use this to bring someone back from death if you are there shortly after they died. This may also be used on you, though only once per jump total, no matter who kisses you."
1912,,600,"""Dark Sigil""",Dark Souls 3,Benevolence,"In much of the world, to be hollow is to live an accursed existence, but Londor accepts and grants salvation to hollows. The Sable Church teaches that hollows have nothing to feel shame or despair over, quite the opposite in fact. This perk grants you a more formal form of one of the greatest blessings that comes with being a Hollow. This perk makes you excruciatingly hard to kill. Stabbed, smashed, shocked, burnt, as long as you're mostly whole then you won't die. It would take mulching you, disintegrating you, burning you into a pile of ash or some other form of bodily destruction to finally put you down. This doesn't make you heal any faster or make you more durable, but it's really, really hard to kill you. Additionally, upon purchase you will find five Dark Sigils scattered about your body, gaping black holes dripping dark humanity. Whenever you survive what would ordinarily be a near death experience, these Dark Sigils will cause you to hollow a bit more, making you appear more like an emaciated corpse. Place the Dark Sigils wherever you like."
1913,,600,Set in Stone,Dark Souls 2,Benevolence ,"“Long, long ago when the Giant Lord came to deliver vengeance to the kingdom that had wronged his people, he brought ruin and mayhem along with him. What stopped him was a strange, unknown warrior that disappeared as quickly as they appeared. A traveler from across space, or time, perhaps both? Whatever the case may be, the meddling of someone uninvolved with the conflict turned the tides, and though the kingdom was ruined, so too did the giants fall with it. This, you cannot allow. This power aggressively fights off any attempts to undue your victories, whether through mundane strategy or more esoteric means like time travel. It will not stop the attempts outright, instead it makes such attempts more dangerous and disadvantageous than they should be. An enemy army attempting to retake a fortress will simply find that the weather doesn’t favor them, or the walls sturdier than they built them. Unnatural means like trying to change events before they happened will see the entire world attempting to rebel against the interloper however.”"
1914,,600,Mountains out of Mounds ,Dark Souls 2,Benevolence ,"“As unrelenting as a mountain, that’s what the king was like. Chopped, stabbed, and left to die in a hole and he stilled lives. What about you? Are you like a mountain, solid and unbreakable? Even for a giant, a race of beings with bodies of stone, you are absurdly tough. It would take a concerted effort to smash your form apart, and as long as you’re mostly whole then no amount of loss of limb or destroyed organ will put you down. In fact, in times of desperation you have the capacity to dismember yourself, ripping off an arm or leg to use as a weapon, a very dangerous weapon thanks to your resilience and oddly high level of skill. When the fight is finished, you may also reattach it just as easily, like two pieces of a puzzle.”"
1915,,600,Curse Breaker,Dark Souls 2,Benevolence ,"“Aldia, brother to the king, once sought the secrets to eternal life. With mad obsession he pushed himself into his own research, to learn and study the past and the nature of man, of undead. What he learned, the first sin as he called it, enraged every fiber of his being. You now know the truth of man’s fleeting form and the undead curse placed upon man by the Lord of Light. More than that, you know how to break it, small pieces of it at least. Although it must be done on an individual basis, you may break the undead curse, and allow ‘undead’ to keep their sanity. Man may return to its nigh immortal ancient self, hideous as it may be to the god tainted sensibilities of humanity as it exists now. When performed on yourself, you will gain great power over wood and flame, strange as that may be. In the future, you will be able to continue breaking curses no matter how strange, esoteric and powerful, at least in some measure. Allowed to observe a curse, you will learn its inner workings, the reason it was applied, and the ability scrape away at its existence, how quickly based on its strength.”"
1916,,600,Wrath Undying ,Dark Souls 2,Benevolence ,"“A kind paragon among undead, or perhaps a nightmare incarnate? Bloodied body, rusted armor, looking like you’ve stepped from the grave or belong in one, will nothing crush your ability to keep getting back up and fighting? You are possessed by an immeasurable will to claim the battlefield, marching on where others would be slain. If beheaded, your body will only be invigorated to hack the enemy into bits in turn. Cut in half? Your legs will make sure to stomp the life out of the one who did it. You’d need to be completely broken to be stopped, and only bodily destruction could actually put you and your assorted parts down for real. That’s easier said than done however given your absurd resilience. Bombs are just heat followed by a bone chilling breeze, a layman’s sword like a paper cut.”"
1917,,600,“Allfather’s Hand”,Dark Souls 1,Benevolence ,"Most capable member of the Way of White, a Paladin blessed by he our father and leader who art wise and good in all he does, Allfather Lloyd himself. Your body has been bestowed with powers of divinity. You have passive regeneration slowly mending your body as you trudge through these forsaken lands. You have been granted inhuman strength allowing you to pick up and swing weapons resembling hunks of stone or metal more than implements of man with unsettling ease. Finally, through the divine blessings coursing through your body and equipment makes you especially lethal against the dead and undead. Necromantic constructs and those afflicted by the undead curse tear against your attacks like wet tissue paper. If taken with Resonance Rings, your blessed constitution grows empowered. Even around a single resonance rings, wounds start healing before your eyes and undead fall like dominos. Around three or more though, and all the previous benefits of this perk double in potency."
1918,,600,“Praise the Sun”,Dark Souls 1,Benevolence ,"The Lord of Sunlight’s divine grace shines upon thee and through thee. It is under the sun in which you receive his blessing and become a knight most fearsome. Whenever you stand in light of the sun, its warmth will surge through you, invigorating body, mind and soul. This enhances your will and morale while bringing out the best in your physique. While others would cook from its exposure, your body will instead mend itself. While others would grow fatigued, the sun’s heat is like a refreshing breeze aiding in stamina recovery. You are as a golden god to those who behold you. The effects are stronger with more direct exposure, and will linger even after leaving the light of the sun, fading away over time. When taken with Gross Incandescence, Gross Incandescence will become many times more potent as long as you stand in the sun. You are like a golden god, putting off tremendous heat and bright light that makes you a brilliant albeit difficult sight to behold."
1919,,600,Healing Gourd,Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,Benevolence ,"A miraculous gourd full of healing water. It seems to spring from the mystical seeds within. This gourd is constantly refilling so you can take as many sips from it as you want. Drinking from the gourd heals all your wounds and clears any sort of poison, curse, or similar afflictions from your body. On top of that, it makes you resistant to all those effects as well for a time."
1920,,600,Mibu Pilgrimage Balloon ,Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,Benevolence ,"Once a week, you will receive a multi-colored balloon with glowing water in it. It was made for the Dragonspring Pilgrimage to hope for a healthy upbringing. When you clasp your hands to pop the balloon in prayer, you will feel much luckier for the rest of the day. In fact, in situations where someone would suddenly stumble upon a coin fallen on the ground, you would instead find an entire chest full of valuable treasures."
1921,,600,Unseen Aid,Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,Benevolence ,"Someone is watching over you, Jumper. It could be anyone really. The more people that see you as friends or allies, the more likely you will find help from nowhere. Perhaps you find yourself in a corner and suddenly an arrow flies and hits the enemy right between the eyes, giving you a good enough break to turn the tides. Perhaps one day you’re face first onto the floor passing out from your wounds or being black out drunk, but then you wake up back in a safe place with your wounds dressed and tended to. Perhaps a dealing with bureaucracy might end up with you being taken away to never be seen again, but then they tell you that your papers are all in order. Whenever you find yourself in a difficult situation, there is a chance someone will eventually bail you out, and you’ll never see who it is. The chance bonus is accumulative across Jumps, so the more people you have positive relationships with in total in your Jumpchain, the higher the chance you’ll receive Unseen Aid."
1922,,600,Vileblood ,Bloodborne,Benevolence ,"“Years ago, Castle Cainhurst was visited by a scholar of Byrgenwerth, one who had smuggled something most forbidden into the hands of the nobles there. Blood that Byrgenwerth found beneath Yharnam, but not the kind the Healing Church held up on a pedestal, it was forbidden blood. 

Descending from these decadent lunatics, who have been nearly wiped out in retaliation for their grisly hunting of man, you have qualities reminiscent of the forbidden blood that flowed through their veins. Curious, most curious, at first glance it is simply decent for blood ministration. 

Continued research shows that it behaves as a stimulant however, rapidly recovering the stamina of yourself, and those it’s administered. The true nature of your blood is what it does to Great Ones, their kin, and other beings of an eldritch nature, causing them to take a keen interest in you. 

Most will be more receptive to your calls for aid, and protective of you. It is as if you inspire a kind of parental urge, most likely due to the fact that so many Great Ones lose their children. 

Beware, for certain beings of this persuasion cannot be influenced from their true nature, and their interest can be more threatening than desired. Great Ones are notably sympathetic, others not.”

Boosted: Bloodborne + Vileblood: “You've been gifted with two very strange abilities. The first allows you to make functional clones of yourself out of blood, though the amount of blood this costs means you should only be able to make one or two at a time. These can use any of your blood related abilities, but are much less sturdy compared to yourself.  

The other allows you to summon giant spears of your blood via self-inflicted damage, causing them to shoot up from the ground somewhere nearby at the location of your choosing as a means of attack. 

The more visceral the damage you inflict on yourself the bigger, faster, and stronger the spear summoned will be. Gutting yourself would produce a stronger spear compared to slicing your wrist, as an example. Spears recede into the ground and dissipate after a few seconds after doing their job.”

1923,,600,Blood Saint ,Bloodborne,Benevolence ,"“Blood Ministration is a sacred art of the Healing Church, and yet in its most basic sense it is just simple, sometimes much too simple, blood transfusion. The trick of its miraculous healing is the kind of blood transfused into a patient, and you have some of the best around. 

Like the Healing Church’s nuns, your blood has miraculous of healing properties. When given to others, imbibed through some means, your blood is able to heal minor and middling injuries or diseases within seconds. Major ones could be healed in hours, like severed limbs, but would require many doses. 

Of course, you don’t have to be so charitable, and will benefit from this healing passively, no ministration required since it already exists in your veins. Blood loss shouldn’t be an issue unless you’re bled in seconds, and blood bullets are almost free. Beware though, fatal injuries stay quite fatal.”

Boosted: Bloodborne + Blood Saint: “A side effect of possessing both perks allows you to generate truly incredible amounts of blood. Providing you don't run into an enemy that stabs a few straws into your veins and vacuums it out or something, there is very little chance of you ever dying from blood loss. 

Additionally, you may manipulate any of your spilled blood in the area, moving and shaping it as desired. Make puddles of your blood sweep an enemy’s feet from beneath you, or harden it into a crystalline form for spontaneous blunt and edged attacks alike. 

The more you manipulate and more complex movements you want to make, the harder this will be. You can improve your ability to command blood in both volume and complexity with practice, and steady focus might even allow you to make blood gems with the right help.”

1924,,600,Shield of Leyndell,Elden Ring,Benevolence ,"From the mighty stone walls formed by dragons in ages past to the unfading lustre of the Leyndell knights, it seems those who stand for the Erdtree become seen as symbols of guardianship. It seems the Erdtree favours you more than its other guardians, for you have been endowed with many golden blessings that empower you to both erect barriers or seals-and to break them. At will, you can erect a shimmering barrier of the Erdtree’s golden energy that casts aside arrows, blunts blows, stills sorcery, cleanses plague-and so deflects all but the most esoteric forms of harm, though rival divine forces are more effective. The protection is tied to and scales with your lifeforce; while a mundane man could safely walk through rains of arrows for hours at a time, a single blow from a giant would likely leave him exhausted. A demigod could stride through dragonfire unharmed for a few hours. It is further empowered when others recognise you as their guardian, be it as a liege or a champion. Fight in defence of a city’s population while recognised by most of it, and at will you can instantly expand the scale of this barrier to cover the city as a whole.

The blessings also provide the wisdom and sanctity to construct powerful tools that let you block or seal powerful forces-such as the shackles that restrained the demigods Omens Mohg and Morgott, and yet still hold power over them. Last but not least, they grant great resistance to both similar effects that would seal you or removing undesirable traits in yourself. Should you truly despise being born an Omen or the Deathblight wracking you, the condition will be curable with enough experimentation-and one seeking to chain you down in the mire will find that your devotion to duty shall set you free.

These are only the most basic application of the Erdtree’s endowment. With months of study, you may discover how to both cleanse impurities such as those left by the Primordial Crucible and mobilise entire villages to reject them socially. With diligent years of study perhaps you’ll rediscover how to forge the flowing sword that sealed away an Outer God, and with that as well as the might of a demigod or Elden Lord recreate the barrier of thorns that the Erdtree protects itself with in the most dire of circumstances."
1925,,600,Venerable of the Dusk,MtG - Ixalan,Benevolence ,"A little known fact is that those who are considered truly holy, Saints and Deacons of the faith of the Dusk, are so infused with blood and light magic that their very body parts are capable of miraculous feats. You are, in that sense, a saint: you are able to share out portions of your magical and physical strength by venerating and blessing pieces of yourself or items deeply significant to you. Preserved and anointed teeth, bones, blood and fingernails all hold potential power, and items such as your oldest clothes or weapons that have seen a hundred battles all are valid sacrifices to make, to create empowering relics."
1926,,600,Silver Torch,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Benevolence ,"The Circle of Loyalty’s silver flame is said to be carried in the hearts of all those who are deemed worthy of it, but this small trinket goes a bit further. This torch carries some of the essence of the Circle of Loyalty, allowing it to act as a mobile, miniature version - while its power cannot match the Circle right away, as more people carry the silver flame in their heart, the stronger the power of it becomes. This allows you to grant the power of “Knight of Ardenvale” to those who demonstrate loyalty and strength of heart. "
1927,,600,Adamant,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Benevolence,"Make no mistake. You are a hero. Within you is the potential to etch your name into the legends of Eldraine, alongside the men and women who carved the Realm from the Wilds and won the throne from the elven princes of eld. Ancient artifacts call for you, generational feuds mend under your hand, and winning the trust of fae, knight, and commoner alike comes naturally to you. The strength of your heart improves and empowers whatever amazing feats you’ve accomplished in your travels here in the following ways:

Giant Killer - > Resolute Rider
It is no longer just the tall and mighty that fail to shake you - you are able to withstand the twisting, corrupting nature of the Wilds with the light of your soul, and in fact by summoning forth great righteousness you can create a wreath of power that actively causes further damage to mystical beings. In addition, you are capable of using the light of your soul to create a shield against the claws and spell of those very same beings. 

Requires Giant Killer(MtG - Throne of Eldraine) 

Loremage - > Arcanist of the Loch
Your special expertise in both the history of Eldraine and the nature of the Fae has allowed you to go beyond mere gathering of knowledge - discovering ancient spells to add to your repertoire, utilizing natural ambient magic of an area to enhance your own capabilities, and discovering artifacts of power hidden from the past are all within your realm of expertise, allowing you to transform your knowledge into powerful magical capability.  

Requires Loremage(MtG - Throne of Eldraine)

Oathsworn - > Deathless Knight
Now this is just ridiculous. Simply put, your stores of vitality are genuinely through the roof. If Oathsworn were difficult to put down, you are (barring the use of annihilating flame or being reduced to nothing but pieces and paste) downright impossible to kill with mere blade and bow. You can heal from nearly any wound within a few moments, and your durability is such that the easiest and quickest way to kill you would have to be decapitation followed by the destruction of the head afterwards - one or the other would merely give you a chance to recover your head and place it back on.  

Requires Oathsworn(MtG - Throne of Eldraine)

Irencrag Feat - > Fireborn Knight
Beyond flame and light, you have tapped into a power of the heart that grants you the power of the heavens itself - you can call down lightning with similar capabilities as the Silverflame, and wreathe your weapon in the same - in turn, enhancing the speed and power of your strikes to resemble that of the very electricity you call upon.  

Requires Irencrag Feat(MtG - Throne of Eldraine)

Tall as a Beanstalk - > Rampart Smasher
If your strength was prodigious before, it’s outright inane now. As a human, you’re large enough to hold a horse beneath each arm, as well as capable of wielding ballista as a handheld weapon, shoulder tackling through solid stone walls, and breaking the necks of castle-destroying dragons with a twist of your wrist.

Requires Tall as a Beanstalk(MtG - Throne of Eldraine)"
1928,,600,Rally,MtG - Zendikar,Benevolence ,"In the din of a chaotic battlefield, you cut an awe-inspiring figure, as though born to lead. While this means each person under your command looks up to you, the members of your army also look up to the others in your force who might be called 'heroes'. A soldier may die for a cause, but when their inspiration is fighting shoulder-to-shoulder alongside them, then a mere footsoldier becomes heroic, and the heroic become truly legendary as they become impassioned by their comrades-in-arms, and they in turn incite yet others alongside them to feats of incredible prowess. Morale becomes an almost tangible force; as the army grows in number so does it grow in quality, each individual growing a little stronger for each other standing at their side."
1929,,600,The Relentless,MtG - Homelands,Benevolence ,"After performing a dangerous journey into the wastelands for a long-dead Wizard Savant, you were granted a wish of eternal life. Now made into an immortal thanks to a powerful and forbidden spellbook, no assassin’s blade will ever be able to kill you. Nor will most any other method of execution work, as you miraculously recover and regenerate all damage.

As long as the spell cast upon you is intact, you can’t die by any means. And as long as you are alive, the magic that sustains you cannot be permanently broken. While the enchantment could still be disrupted by a skilled enough wizard (though the number of mages capable of that feat in this world can be counted on one hand), the magic simply reinstates itself after a short period of recovery if you aren’t slain during this moment of vulnerability. You also lack the drawbacks of Eron’s own spell, not scarring or degenerating after your regenerations. 

Further, you have a talent for leveraging your immortality to gain positions of power. The simple fact that you’re immortal is often enough to get your foot in the door, and actually removing you from power becomes practically impossible. As your fellow immortal Eron experienced when he declared himself king of the goblins, the simple fact that you cannot be put to death would eventually see you put on the throne is such societies, and keep you there by virtue of surviving any assassination attempts seeking to remove you."
1930,,600,Grand Host,MtG - Shandalar,Benevolence ,"White mages draw upon the power of light and virtue to burn away all those who would threaten their servants, conjuring vast armies of noble warriors and exalted beasts to serve them. But more than that, White magic is one of the most effective styles when it comes to augmenting large numbers of units into an even more potent fighting force, as seen in enchantments such as ‘Crusade’. But you... you are truly a commander of legend. Those who follow your leadership will find their morale soaring, their combat prowess strengthened, and every ally that fights by their side will infuse them with greater power. The greater your army, the mightier each soldier and knight within it becomes, though each must still fight in the same battle - or at least the same battlefield. Though the effect does not grow linearly (adding a single soldier to a thousand-strong legion is not going to make as much of a difference as increasing a squad from two to three knights), there is no upper limit to the effect. "
1931,,600,Purity,MtG - New Phyrexia,Benevolence ,"Your body curiously lacks the metal growths of the inhabitants of Mirrodin, even if you’re a native. While this might have made you an outcast in the plane before the Phyrexian invasion,much like Melira, you are now poised to be an important figure in the reclamation of the plane. You have a simple ability- total immunity to the effects of the Glistening Oil, and any other effects that would corrupt your body or mind, an ability you can grant to others, healing those whose phyresis (or in other jumps, any sort of corruption) hasn’t been fully realized, and making them immune to further infection."
1932,,600,Perfection through Order,MtG - New Phyrexia,Benevolence ,"​You’ve attained perfection out of a desire to control all, and have become a master at manipulating the little people- molding their beliefs and ideals to better suit yourself, able to place yourself as the leader of a grand, wide-spanning religious system through guile and charisma. You carry yourself with a elegance befitting of your status, and your allies are emboldened by your presence, becoming stronger and more durable, while your enemies are struck by awe, being similarly weakened. The effects of “A faith of flesh and steel”, should you have it, are enhanced, being able to sway large crowds with your words, as long as they listen- or are forced to listen- they will find themselves believing in whatever ideals you peddle, given enough time, no matter their mental resistance."
1933,,600,Emperor With Eight Tails,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Benevolence ,"Rulers who claim that they have a right to be queen, to be king, to be emperor are a dime a dozen. Most of them are wrong. Most of them think that they were born for their positions, and that taking it from them is a crime. The emperor of Kamigawa on the other hand, does in fact have a divine right to rule from Kyodai, the mightiest Kami on the plane and representatives of the world's soul. And now, so do you. As you rise in position and power, your spiritual might will rise with you. Becoming the commander of an army would see various Kami of war and battle feed extra strength into your blows, or shave off the force of ones you take using the bones of mountains as your shield. If you were to somehow make your way all the way up to the rank of emperor, ruler of this entire plane? You would have the capacity to directly invoke the world’s power in the name of doing your job as ruler as best you could. Do keep in mind, though you have the right, the various Kami you would be blessed by and even the worldsoul have their own opinions - and you must keep the balance before all else."
1934,,600,Divine Right,MtG - Kamigawa,Benevolence ,"Somehow, you've gained similar protections to those of the greatest of the Kami, whether this power was given or you stole it like Konda did is up to you. Common dangers that threaten most men such as old age or disease no longer affect you but that is simply a side effect to a much greater prize. You are invulnerable, conventional damage simply slides from you like water across a duck's feathers and as such you'll know no harm on most battlefields in Kamigawa.

Be warned, that this protection only wards you against being harmed in the conventional sense. A clever foe could take advantage of powers that do things beyond simple damage, which certainly exist, as well as those who can remove such blessings or harm even those with the divine invulnerability of the Myojin. Should it be removed, it would take a day to return.

You can pass this power off to another, but you do not benefit from it for that time. You may shift your blessings through an act of will, of course.

Boosted: When taken with Jumper of Spirit and Flesh this perk evolves into a greater divinity, allowing you to pass off this power up to eight times without lessening your own. In addition, you can pass out a lesser blessing that will increase the targets defenses to ‘merely’ the level of extraordinarily hard armour so outfitting an army with this might still be a good idea if you happen to be fighting a war with Kami.

Boost Requires Jumper of Spirit and Flesh(MtG-Kamigawa)"
1935,,600,Crescent of Morningtide,MtG - Lorwyn,Benevolence ,"This piece of jewelry might look like nothing more than an unassuming piece of flat, carved bone. Closer inspection, and perhaps a great knowledge of merrow traditions, would reveal it is anything but. The polished bone of this small crescent is adorned with silver inscriptions, and hangs on a cord thick, woven gold, ready to slip over your head when needed. 

It marks the wearer as the heir of Morningtide, a title inherited though usually highly contested by the heir’s siblings. Thus, the right to wear the crescent is earned by every one of their siblings. Your siblings, now, as you carry both the pendant and the inheritance it signifies. Bearing the crescent marks one as important enough both to command the respect of all other merrows and grants the privilege (and ability) to speak to the great elemental known as the Source of the Wanderwine, the Father-Lane whom the merrow revere as their true father, mother, and creator. Assuming you can swim up to the river’s source. 

More importantly, the crescent is far more than a simple trinket of authority, being an artifact steeped in the source’s unyielding elemental power. The Crescent of Morningtide preserves your self, guarding you from even such far-reaching and powerful transformations as the Great Aurora. Bearing it allows the heir to strike a light within the darkened lanes, until the long night passes."
1936,,600,Oona’s Spare,MtG - Lorwyn,Benevolence ,"You’re not quite what you seem. Faintly alien in appearance, like someone wearing a faulty glamer of what you’re supposed to be. You don’t smell quite right either. Nevertheless, your strong grasp of magic leaves you an expert in the weaving of glamer, which makes it obvious your appearance is no half-baked illusion. Probably.

In truth, you are an avatar of Oona crafted in the image of another, a failsafe created just in case the Great Aurora could affect the Queen of all Fae herself. The only problem is that you became aware of this and realised you need not follow her orders. And while you might not be the Great Mother herself, you do retain some measure of power beyond the weaving of common glamers. With smoke and fog and the rustling of a hundred brittle wings you could mire your enemies in sluggish magic or cast them into arcane mists to vanish and reappear somewhere in the forest far away from yourself.

But perhaps most impressive is your mind, which is structured such that it would seem impossible, unacceptable, and inconceivable to all of Oona's many children. If someone were to be rude enough to try crawling around your thoughts they would be in for an equally rude surprise, as you would be aware of it immediately, even if you have been lulled to sleep by powerful magic. Not that they would be able to glean much, even if you didn’t defend yourself. Your thoughts are like a great dark sphere, featureless and impenetrable. Not the absence of a dreamscape, but rather a very large and very well-protected fortress, a round, dense monolith that shall prove impervious to faerie magic."
1937,,600,Take Shelter Beneath My Wings ,MtG - Innistrad,Benevolence ,"Like the archangel herself, you may hear the calls of those under your protection. Their prayers, their hopes and dreams, their cries for help. At first this will be overwhelming. So many to save and there is only one of you. But as Avacyn did so too will you learn how to help the flock, should that be your wish, acting as a symbol rallying those under your protection to better save themselves. If you took this perk with Blessing you may divert some of your energies to those that pray for your assistance. You cannot send much energy, but you can shape it in response to their plea. You could, for example, send a spell to strengthen them if they pray for the power to defend others, or a burst of healing magic if they or those near them were injured."
1938,,600,Rest In Peace ,MtG - Innistrad,Benevolence ,"Bless your soul for the gift you have given us, an uninterrupted blessed sleep. With your holy magic, you prevent those that would disturb the dead from raising them. Keeping any you bless in the sweet reprieve of rest, without worry of being raised as an abomination in either body or spirit. Again I say it, bless you."
1939,,600,"I Am What I Am, And Always Will Be",MtG - Innistrad,Benevolence ,"No matter the change in form, so long as the change was external and not of your accord, you will be able to reconcile yourself and remain true to who you are. You are able to reconcile things like the second soul of lycanthropes with who you are, and come out no less yourself. But with added abilities from whatever you have incorporated. If you were a werewolf, you would be able to seamlessly transition between wolf and man at will, and retain your mind in both forms. This can be applied to other similar circumstances outside Innistrad just as well."
1940,,600,Soul of Sacrifice,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Benevolence ,"The triumph of those Planeswalker’s who embrace White. Is not their uniting conquests or their victories which instill order, but the lives they helped and saved along the way. No matter what battle you win, you need to make sure there is something left after the battle is over. Accepting this truth, once per jump, when you give your life for such a selfless cause then it will not truly be lost. You shall rise from the ashes with those you saved behind you. This miracle can’t truly be fulfilled over a selfish cause like personal power or self preservation it must be for others.

If you choose to forsake this miracle you can instead produce another. As replacement for the revival of self, you may instead use that power to instill prosperity in the lives of others. Blessing a nation either of your creation or for whom you fight for, granting it a Golden Age that even the greatest of rulers would have trouble replicating, accelerating its development, lowering its crime rate, and turning the lives of inhabitants into one of grace and humble fulfillment."
1941,,600,RUN FREE,Wolfwalkers,Benevolence ,"As a Wolfwalker you represent that part of nature that will not, cannot, be tamed. You cannot be corrupted or controlled, you cannot be imprisoned or restrained more than a minute or two before finding the strength to burst free."
1942,,600,Fortunes Favor,Sinbad Legend of the Seven Seas,Benevolence ,"Lucky doesn’t even begin to describe the things around you. It wouldn’t be a stretch to say that the Goddess of Fortune herself has blessed your journey. Things, even if they look bleak, just end up going your way. If your drowning you’ll almost always have just enough air to make it back to the surface. However, if a goddess or a being of similar or even greater power tries to ruin your day then don’t expect luck alone to save you. This isn’t perfect as bad things can still happen to you. This just makes those things have a greater chance to have a happier ending than they otherwise should have had."
1943,,600,Shonen Power-Ups,Magi: The Adventure of Sinbad,Benevolence ,"When the going gets rough, when the hero’s beaten down by an insurmountable foe and on their last legs, there’s only one thing that’s certain – the hero will suddenly pull a new power out of their ass to claim victory. And well, what do you know, you seem to be a hero, at least for the purposes of this perk. During actual battle, your abilities and skills you use progress far faster than they otherwise would. This boost increases the more challenging the battle is for you – a fight you could win in your sleep, for example, would barely give you any improvement, if at all. But a fight that you actually struggle during or, better yet, are almost guaranteed to die in? Those are the kinds that cause your abilities to advance of prodigious paces, often unlocking new abilities or superior versions of your existing powers in the middle of battle. There doesn’t seem to be any real limit to how powerful your abilities can become using this, though expect diminishing returns each time an ability has been empowered."
1944,,600,First-Class Singularity,Magi: The Adventure of Sinbad,Benevolence ,"In this world, fate is a very real thing, guiding people along their destiny according to the will of Solomon. However, very few people are as beloved by destiny as you are, and this manifests in the extraordinary luck you have in all things you do, almost as if you’re the protagonist of a story. If exploring a labyrinthine Dungeon, you’ll somehow walk down all the right passageways and avoid those that are trapped, and if pursuing a foe, the wheels on his carriage will miraculously fall off, causing him to crash and giving you enough time to catch up. Similarly, attacks that really should kill you outright may end up doing far less damage than they should, allowing you to live another day.

Do not become arrogant, however. Though you are greatly favoured by fate, its blessings can be rather fickle and by no means render you invincible. Your luck may falter if you solely rely on it too much, as merely having good fortune is no replacement for actual skill or talent."
1945,,600,Top Servant,Fate/Extella,Benevolence ,"In the Moon Cell, each Class of Servant has at least one Heroic Spirit who is known as a Top Servant. The greatest example of that Class, or one with very few peers to challenge their title. Scathach, Karna, Iskandar; all examples of famous and mighty people. One Class of your choice, almost certainly what you chose as a Servant, now counts you as a Top Servant as well. Any abilities or items that fit into your chosen Servant Class receive a very large boost in power. Class Skills, suitable Noble Phantasms or Personal Skills, even normal abilities and skills that all fit within the role a Class is meant to play receives these boosts. A Top Servant isn’t impossible for a normal Servant to beat but these boosts will make it very difficult to do so if they have the same kinds of abilities as you. Beyond that mere power boost, you also find yourself with an advantage when fighting against anyone that also fits within your chosen Class, finding battle to be easier through good fortune when fighting such opponents. Only the seven original Servant Classes can be chosen, as well as Ruler. "
1946,,600,Long Live The King,Fate/Extra CCC,Benevolence,"The craftsmanship of the gods is a sight to behold. Like a certain golden king, you’re just built different than other people. You might not have all of Gilgamesh’s abilities, but you certainly share his sheer robustness of spirit, being completely incorruptible in mind, body, and soul, for better and worse. You could simply sleep in the reverse side of the moon, that horrible place filled with evil things, and be completely fine where most other heroes would risk great danger even when fully alert. No corrupting influence will be able to take its hold on you, unless you let it. Additionally, you’re surprisingly competent at navigating alien environments, such as the aforementioned reverse side of the moon. Things like space and time being twisted and inconsistent won’t prove to be particularly difficult obstacles, although such things might remain tricky to get around. Truly the mark of a superior being. Perhaps you should try to not let this get to your head? One smug golden bastard is more than enough already."
1947,,600,Staff of the Ten Crowns,FateExtra CCC,Benevolence,"How did you get your hands on this? You really shouldn’t have it, there’s not supposed to be two of this particular stick. Looking like a simple metallic retractable stick, this thing is in truth the Authority of the Ten Crowns, in an unassuming shape. Don’t get too excited though, as you might not have the power to use it properly. If you’re on the level of a Master, even merely using its most basic hacking functions would risk lethal damage to your soul, and if you are at the level of a Servant you could use it as a very effective hacking tool, bypassing the need for actual hacking skill yourself, and could use a mere fraction of its abilities in combat, mostly just designed around buffing yourself and dealing damage. It is when you start reaching beyond the power normally available to even high ranking Servants that this begins to show its true power.

After finally surpassing that wall of high rank Servant power, you’ll find the power of the abilities this stick grants you start to skyrocket, and you’ll start to gain limited access to the true power of the Ten Crowns; Domina Coronam, the ability to reject events forced on you by those born of Earth. Invincibility, in other words, as long as your opponent’s origins are related to the planet that the Moon Cell revolves around and records, Earth. That said, should your opponent have unlocked the power of their Origin, connected to the cause behind their existence and the ultimate source of their being, the Domina Coronam will be unable to reject them. To use it for more than mere seconds without seriously straining your soul and risking damage to it, you’ll have to grow further and further. Perhaps if you match the Moon Cell, the scale of your soul would be enough to fully wield this Authority?"
1948,,600,Andreias Amarantos,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Benevolence ,"Having been bathed in holy flames blessed by the Gods of Olympus when you were younger, you
share a similar blessing as Achilles. Your body has become invincible, at least in regards to those that
lack the divine. Any attack, no matter the power or nature, will fail to harm your body should it not
be delivered by a divine weapon or a divine being, even magic or powerful conceptual weapons. To
truly pass this defense, the divinity must be equal to that of at least a demigod with one powerful
parent or the equivalent, and lesser amounts of divinity will result in only a small percentage of the
incoming attack being able to affect you. It is also possible for enemies to trick their way past this
blessing, by attacking with an ‘act of friendship’, such as being bitten by a vampire who intends to
turn you into a vampire like them. Finally, your one true weakness that all can strike at, is that one of
your heels were unable to be covered in the fires and not only does that heel lack your invincibility, specifically striking it with enough power to damage the heel will result in your invincibility being
deactivated for a full day."
1949,,600,Thrice Setting Sun,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Benevolence ,"True majesty never really passes. Not while their loyal citizens still call out for help. Even should you
be killed, it’s very hard to make you actually die. You’re able to revive yourself from death, up to
three times per week before your ability runs dry, and find yourself quickly healing and restoring
your energy back to full health once you do, though it takes you a few minutes to get back on your
feet. These extra lives do recharge each week but sufficiently powerful attacks, ones more powerful
than your own usual level of power, can take more than a single life from you through this and
potentially knock out all three, though you can at least be sure it won’t take that final one unless
they wait around and hurt you again. Should you ever truly reach your final death that ends your
chain or your journey after that, from which you can’t return, you’ll be given one last reward as part
of your Roman heritage. It’ll allow you to ascend as a special Divine Spirit capable of watching over
and guiding any empire that you have built across all of your time, eternally acting as a honored
ancestor to your people in their times of need."
1950,,600,The Hero of Charity,Fate/Legends - Nirvana Yuga,Benevolence ,"In a time when feuds have lasted generations and terrible wars raged for years over the problems of
a meagre few, it must be something special to be someone that the enemy cannot deny. Yours is the
soul of a gallant hero, a mien of such intensity that all who see you are forced to acknowledge that
you are someone important in this world. Whatever impression you leave on people, whatever
effects you have, they are magnified enormously. What might be a normal rivalry between young
men could develop into a tale remembered in legends for millennia to come, a god who might feel
respect for your humility in obeying his wishes normally would feel himself so filled with shame for
taking advantage of you that he would force himself to grant his finest weapon in recompense. 

A stature as what you have, as a hero or an antagonist, is certain to gather many allies around you. When a few words of friendship and a battle at each others side is enough to become life long
friends, you are sure to become an icon to those around you. Indeed, your very nature is that of one
to whom friendship results in far greater results than normal. That which you receive from your dear
friends willingly becomes vastly greater in scope. Fighting alongside your brothers in arms would see
you defeat foes thrice your might in normally impossible battles. A weapon received from a dying
friend would ignite with a hundred times it’s normal shine, bolstered to incredible levels by the
bonds you share. If you found yourself fighting the heavens themselves, with only the gifted power
of two gods that have declared themselves your friends, you might yet succeed. For what could even
an entire pantheon hope to achieve against the power of friendship?
"
1951,,600,The Awarded Hero,Fate/Legends - Nirvana Yuga,Benevolence ,"When your first cries were heard as a child, the stars shone in anticipation. Your life from the very
first breath was blessed beyond measure. It would not be wrong to say that you were born to be
loved by everyone. As you grew up, you found that life naturally guided you to success. You were
born with the quality of being the protagonist of the story, not just your own tale but the story of
the world around you. Your incredible fortune heaps blessings on you at every opportunity, ensuring
that you are never lacking except in the most extreme of cases. One born a pauper would find
himself part of the richest, noblest and most mighty family in the kingdom before he reached
maturity. At times, you will find things gifted to you as soon as the thought crosses your mind that
you have need or desire of them. Perhaps the gods themselves watch over you, eager to shower you
in gifts, manifesting food before you when you feel hunger or magical tools in your hands when you
seek to engage in a task. Your luck might not accomplish everything on it’s own but just that fortune would render you enormously gifted and capable, something only further added to if you have other
gifts already.

But in some ways, your fortune is also cruel. There can only be one hero, one to whom all the
fortune is awarded, and he must have his villains to conquer. The antagonists of your destined story
are heaped with as many misfortunes as you are blessings. Curses and poor luck rain on your
enemies heads, even those who would only be minor obstacles to you find themselves blocked at
every path. The famous story of Karna’s efforts against the perfect Arjuna are an ideal example, the
charitable Karna cursed and sapped of strength and stripped of his finest tools and betrayed by his
most loyal aides. Those who are truly great can ascend beyond this bad luck and challenge or even
defeat you in spite of it all, despite the wailing of the heavens above at them daring to stand in the
way of the chosen hero. But all too often, you’ll do as everyone expects. Prove victorious as the hero
of the story must, even if that hero might sometimes feel doubts about how much his own efforts
matter when fate favours him so much."
1952,,600,Goddess of War,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Benevolence ,"Divine is your presence when you ride out onto the battlefield, in how your soldiers see your shining
aura and how your foes crumble before your wrath. With sword and spear few but the gods
themselves can match your skill, even wielding eight of your favoured weapons at once becomes
somehow a deadly style. Even more such when you split your being into eight clones, each as
capable as the original and sharing your mind and presence between them. Fight and command in
eight places at once or force your hated enemies to duel one on eight. 

Your skill and numerous bodies are backed by enough raw power to contend with most of the
heroes and monsters that walk these lands. Most men believe that your powers are granted by the
gods of war, some that you are yourself such a being, and they’re not far from the truth. You have a
measure of divinity already, which grows as your feats in battle and war do. Winning impossible
sieges, conquering great empires and slaying famous swordsmen in duels will all improve your divine
power. Your physical strength mainly at first but should it grow great enough, you may find yourself
turning into a true divine spirit of war as a result, with all the abilities natural to such things. 

The advancement of the modern age won’t prove a threat either, as firearms find reality itself
warping their arcs away from you. Even a bullet guided by magic would curve it’s trajectory away
from your body, so long as you can keep clear in your mind the idea that mere bullets could never
hit or stop you. Slipping in this surety can reduce the protection, making it possible for enough
massed fire to still hit you. 

Finally, that divine nature has a intense effect on those that fight with you. When you personally
fight alongside allies or loyal servants, you’ll inspire an intense, eventually fanatical, devotion to your
ideals. A few battles side by side and most men would die to protect your honour. Something of the
opposite applies to your enemies, awakening intense terror in those that defy you, growing the
longer they directly challenge you while in your presence. It would be difficult to not end a campaign
with an army of men who truly believe that you are their Goddess of War."
1953,,600,Immortal,Fate/Legends - Land of Shadows,Benevolence ,"A goal of so very many, yet you appear to have simply stumbled into attaining it in the course of
your other adventures, perhaps even in an unwelcome manner. Immortality has been attained for
you, the seemingly perfect immunity to time, weakness and even death itself, preventing you from
being aged or erased from time, from having your body degraded or weakened and from being slain, even from powerful conceptual weapons or abilities. Any wounds dealt to you heal in moments. This
is due to your own connection to the world that you call home. Through your deeds, you have
become such an integral part of the world, even against the wishes of the world, that your life will
exist so long as it does. The planet you begin on, in each universe you find yourself in, will maintain
this lack of frailty or death, provided it has not been made inaccessible totally to any enemies you
might have. Hiding away your home world somehow, even behind nearly impregnable defences, would still see you retain your immortality but making it completely impossible to reach or harm
would sever your own connection for a time. If your home world should be hostile to you in some
manner, it will be unable to remove your link to it, even if it wants so very much to do so. Godslayer- 600

1954,,600,Avalon,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Benevolence ,"For any who dream of worthy King Arthur, the question of sword or sheathe is well known. The
sword may be mighty but the scabbard is all the more valuable and to lay hands on it would be any
admirers dream. Wherever you found the artefact, it shines proudly before you and seems to judge
you as worthy of it’s use, this Avalon. When worn, or hidden within your spirit with a push, the
scabbard grants extremely potent regenerative abilities. Severe wounds, even to the point of lost
limbs, replenish themselves in minutes unless barred by powerful curses. Diseases and poison largely
cease to be a threat. Even if you body is broken to almost unrecognisable levels, Avalon can allow
survival and rapid return to battle as long as both heart and brain remain mostly intact. A side effect
of this regeneration is ageless immortality, the user ceasing to progress in years while they hold the
scabbard in their possession.

The unique power of the sheath is a temporary transference to Avalon itself, the isle of the fairies
rather than the name of this item. This acts as a nigh-perfect defence, as only a handful of the
greatest and most powerful supernatural beings can travel to this realm without the permission of
the fae. This travel is only partial, allowing you to still move and act in the original world, yet
guarded by an absolute shield as you do. The downside is that the shield is merely temporary, requiring a heavy drain on your spirit to maintain. In bursts however, it can turn one into an
indomitable juggernaut against whom no attack seems effective."
1955,,600,Divine Protection,Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Benevolence ,"A Messiah in the making. You’re the sort of person they’re going to have a whole lot of arguments
over if you’re not careful with your gifts. You see, God has a fondness for you. Or at least the force
that some might associate with God. It sees you as something similar to a child even and favors you
thusly. The laws of what is possible and what is not hang loosely in your presence, allowing you to
accomplish literally impossible things with enough skill, effort or luck. Miracles, they’re apparently
called, and even beyond that you seem able to effect minor acts of God just by willing it. Walking on
water or parting a sea, turning water to wine or healing the sick, even bringing back those who have
passed on recently to life.

Of course, this favour manifests in more than just magic tricks. With the Counter Force that supports
those chosen by God, you find that you are rarely alone when opposed. Guardians appear to aid you
when you are attacked, massive amounts of energy can appear within you even when you believe
you have emptied all you have to give and there are certain places that are no longer guarded to
your movements."
1956,,600,Saint,Fate/Legends - Vive la France,Benevolence ,"The final step you take to go from a holy woman and a true saint of the church. The heavens have
chosen you as a true avatar of their presence on earth, filling you with holy might. The holy power
within you greatly increased your physical power, to the point of comparing the results to artillery
strikes. The same force that empowers your body renders it nearly totally immune to magic, your
resistance boosted so high that even magic from back in the Age of Gods struggles to scratch you. Outside of combat, the energy grants numerous additional abilities. You are able to heal both
yourself and others with a touch, crippling wounds closing in seconds once you lay your hands on
them, as well as perform a variety of minor to moderate miracles relating to your own religion, similar to other saints. Perhaps the most powerful ability is that you can make potent holy objects,
imbuing anything you personally create with great amounts of sacred power, making it both much
greater in general and holding immense lethality against the forces of evil and darkness. It is well
known that you are a saint or similar figure of your religion in this world, for all the good and ill that
can do. Part of that knowledge will benefit you at least, as you received much more training in
combat than most saintly figures do, due to the charity of crusading knights you once met. You’re no
legend on the battlefield but a sword and shield is more than enough for you to kill handfuls of
knights with skill alone."
1957,,600,Worthy Luck,Fate/Legends - Vive la France,Benevolence ,"Charlemagne’s paladins would not have survived even a half of their adventures without the luck of
heroes, particularly that seemingly inept young man called Astolfo. Luck takes a special form for the
heroes like these, not solving issues for you but providing to you the tools that let you solve things
yourself. At least, most of the time. Your great amount of fortune focuses on this, ensuring that
enemies accidentally leave behind their magical blades for you to use, friends loan you just the
obscure trinket you need before you go on an adventure that reveals a desperate need for it or you
‘accidentally’ seduce a village girl who turns out to be a noblewoman that can get you out of trouble
later, should you prove your affections again in the jail cell you’ve been held in. The greater the danger, the greater the benefit your luck will bring to you, though these uses must
remain in the realm of what could be possible, and even in truly dire situations, where just an added
tool or ally might not help, your luck can even temporarily bend what is possible. A sword strike
might suddenly skip your neck instead of cutting it off, an ally moves faster than should be possible
or you seem to have just enough energy for one last attack even after you already did your one last
attack. These sudden surges of fortune are a staple of heroes when pushed to the edge but appear infrequently, no more than a handful of times each adventure. A hero relies on themselves after all, the luck is just an added bonus to smooth the edges over."
1958,,600,Luminosite Eternelle,Fate/Legends - Vive la France,Benevolence ,"A holy symbol if there ever was one, a flag to guide the path of the righteous to victory through
battle. This flag, tipped with a terribly sharp spear, is by itself a steadfast weapon. The shaft can
block the blows of powerful magical swords and the spear blade is more than enough to slice
through the skin of a demon or a paladin’s armor. But it’s use as a melee weapon is the most minor. The flag endows the one that holds it with the power to summon dragon flames, terrible fire that
can easily spread across an entire battlefield and melt steel to sludge in moments. Drawing on the
user’s magical energy, as well as allowing them to convert the hateful feelings and grudges of
themselves or any around them to even more energy. In a similar fashion of spending energy, metal
stakes can be summoned from the air or ground in a large radius, acting as weapon and hinderance. But the purest use of the flag is not for offense, despite it’s varied powers. It is to protect. By
planting the flag into the ground and calling upon the divine power held within, a light will appear in
the form of a shield that isolates the user and everyone else within up to ten meters of the flag. This
light takes the user’s own durability and magical resistance, turning both into a protection against
any and all physical and magical damage that touches the light. The protections of a Saint could ward
of an attack able to vaporise entire mountain fortresses and should it be wished, the shield can then
reflect whatever attack it has stopped back at an enemy. Like the fires of the dragon, the user can
empower these reflected attacks with grudges freely. The light the flag summons cannot hold
forever, damage it blocks will degrade the flag and eventually break it. The flag will slowly heal, even
from destruction, but not until you let it rest."
1959,,600,Humanity’s Offer,Fate/Legends - Garden of Avalon,Benevolence ,"Even a King can be laid low at times. They suffer failure as any one else does, the consequences are
merely much greater for a ruler that governs so many people. But just as the cost of failure is so
much higher, so are there many more who seek to take advantage of that to gain your favour. When
you are in need or desire, you will find powerful forces and beings offer deals for you. These beings
can range from simple hermit magi that happen upon you to grand embodiments of cosmic forces, depending on your own power and importance. You can gain power and influence by accepting
these deals, often enough to greatly help you achieve success where you failed before or fix your
mistakes, but the deals will come at a cost. These beings will ask tasks of you, some before giving
their rewards to you and some may simply take a price from you to grant new power. It is not
impossible to worm your way out of the contracts after you have made them, but it would take
great luck and cunning to do so."
1960,,600,Holy Grail,Fate/Legends - Garden of Avalon,Benevolence ,"The holy grail, at times, is a device capable of granting any wish. This is not always the case and over
the years, what the holy grail is exactly has taken many forms. There have even been many different
grails. What is held common between them is that they all represent a miracle. A miracle you now
find yourself in possession of. The miracle you hold, taking the form of a simple object like a cup, allows you to sacrifice the object once per jump to achieve a miracle capable of saving someone or a
group of people from any one thing. This can be up to as many as one entire country, like Britain, worth of people. It could cause the partial defeat of a terrible dragon, forcing them out of the limits
of the country and preventing them from returning. Perhaps it might bless someone with protection
against an attack that might be otherwise fated to kill them. It could even save someone from a
terrible corruption, cleansing them entirely. The miracle will become available to use once more in
your next world. You cannot import into this."
1961,,600,Barrier ,Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline,Benevolence,"Do you want to keep others away? T​he older sister of Weapon Summoning, you can call gigantic versions of your Magical Weapon out from the ground or the walls. This not only enables you to hit with bigger, stronger attacks, but it also lets you form a protective ‘field’ around any wall of weapons that you summon with this ability, which can shield you or others from strong attacks.
"
1962,,600,Shard of a Heartbroken Wish ,Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline,Benevolence,"This glowing blue shard carries a deep regret with it...spurned affections, forgotten friends, unspoken cruelty and despair. Despite this, it seems to have some kind of resolve behind it...corruptive and influences that seek to control the mind and heart are banished from your presence, unable to affect you so long as this shard is held close to you. You may ‘burn’ the shard, destroying it until the following month, to completely exorcise a location and all those within it of such influences and infections, and they will be unable to return or affect anyone within that radius for the next day.
"
1963,,600,Blast Shield ,Sonny,Benevolence,"Good lord, what madman designed this thing? The blast shield looks like a typical steel kite shield, but that belies a powerful artifact. To begin with, the Blast Shield massively bumps up your vitality and durability. You’ll have the stamina to run for hours, and if you were naked with nothing but the Blast Shield you could still bounce a cannon round off your skin with only a small scratch. To say nothing of the shield itself; between a tactical missile and this shield, the shield would win. Though, the user might still hurt quite a bit from the explosion so don’t actually try blocking a tactical missile unless you need to.
"
1964,,600,Magical Purification Blast ,Generic Magical Girl,Benevolence,"Purge the evil and/or mind control from your enemies with a massive burst. Turn enemies into allies! Purge possessing demons! Turn sentient concentrations of evil into a bad memory! Make sure you only use it to end the whole fight, because it will wear you out so badly you'll usually pass out and sleep in late the next morning the first time you use it, but that bad guy definitely won't be bad anymore. With a lot of practice, you'll be able to stay awake after using it, but it will still wear you out.
"
1965,,600,Untouchable​ ,Sailor Moon,Benevolence,"You did not originate from a world where magic existed. There was only physics in your world. It is for this reason you are aware that magic and physics are just two different forces at work in this reality. Magic may manipulate physics, but it is a separate force entirely. This power erases magic in a small zone around you, leaving only the presence of physics. You can outright nullify all supernatural forces around you in a three meter radius for ten minutes once a day. Anyone slinging magic at will find their blasts fizzling when they enter this zone. Your powers, however, are not affected.
"
1966,,600,Starseed​ ​Awakening​ ​,Sailor Moon,Benevolence,"Within you is a great power. The power to take an ordinary Star Seed and blossom it into a flower of glory just below that of a Sailor Crystal’s. You have a supernaturally powerful ability to bring out anyone’s potential with a reasonable amount of personal magic-assisted teaching. This act allows them to gain powers based on their personality and who they are. A fiery person could gain fire powers, a statistician gains the power to manipulate probability, a cat gains the ability to defy physics, ect ect. It is up to you to define the limits of these powers, but these awakened powers are initially weak. Training can help someone increase in power. This power also grants the recipient a human form, if they lack one. Or, if you wish, you may instead wish to help add to the glory of a Sailor Crystal. You may grant a one-time power-up to someone with powers other than the ones granted by this perk, but if you use this ability, you cannot grant them the powers this perk gives someone. This power cannot be copied without a means to emulate parts of the Awakened Person’s soul you wish to copy.

You may not steal an Awakened Person’s power without their full consent, and threatening or coercing or mind controlling them into having them give you their power does not count as consent. Eating a person or ripping out their soul does not count as consent.

A person can only be Awakened once. Comes with optional magical girl transformation sequence if you wish.
"
1967,,600,Look​ ​Out!​ ​,Sailor Moon,Benevolence,"You are a walking miracle for the vulnerable. You’d rather let yourself get hurt than anyone else. That’s the job of a guardian. You won’t let those you protect become harmed. No matter what. You can pull the entire force of a blast towards you, no matter how many people would get hit.

However, the consequences could be dire for bigger blasts. Can your body really handle the full, concentrated force of a world-shattering blast? You can pull it all into you...but can you really survive that? Take caution with this ability. The power of friendship and love can mitigate the damage to a degree but...do you really want to risk it? You have some value in this world, too. It would be a shame if you died through self-sacrifice.
"
1968,,600,Thirteen ,DC Occult,Benevolence,"Your nature has given you an incredible resistance to magic. Normal magicians would be completely unable to affect you, and the magic of more powerful beings would be greatly weakened when used against you. You have complete control over this ability, allowing you to be affected by any magic you choose. You can not be compelled to lower your resistance unwillingly, even if under mind control or enchanted by someone else. Only a conscious choice made with free will on your part can lower it, unless it would explicitly be to your benefit, such as an allied spellcaster attempting to dispel a mind control spell or curse affecting you.

Just, you know, this won't do much of anything if someone uses magic to levitate a huge boulder above your head and drop it on you or uses magically enhanced strength to snap your neck.
"
1969,,600,Beautiful Blood,Tsukihime,Benevolence,"You’re not a Dead Apostle, but that doesn’t seem to matter anymore, does it? The World itself cannot seem to process the idea of the Jumper dying...and is quick to correct that error. Through an act of paradox or supreme blasphemy, your body has achieved physical immortality that puts even vampires to shame. Your body will almost instantly heal from injuries - cuts disappears in seconds, missing limbs replaced in minutes. Even if you were reduced to a puddle of meat, you would still be good as new just a few minutes later...though you would be fully conscious throughout the pain and the regeneration. It isn’t so much that your cells are repairing themselves, but that your injuries are ‘rewound’ back to their original shape as though nothing happened. Though you can survive just about any sort of physical destruction this way, your mind and soul do not share this eternity, and can still be damaged by other means. It is also possible for someone to force the concept of ‘death’ onto your body, though the list of people capable of that here...well, it’s just one, really."
1970,,600,True Apocrypha ,Tsukihime,Benevolence,"The Spear Key and Gun Shield, also known as the Holy Shield Gamaliel.It is a Conceptual Weapon that resembles a violin, a spear, and a shield merged together. While A little bit unwieldy, it is nonetheless a potent weapon against both Dead Apostles and similarities, its true power is how it defends the wielder. The person holding this weapon would be protected from alterations in the world’s ‘rules’, making them immune to being influenced by a Reality Marble or similar outside forces, and the shield is also a potent defense against both Magic and Mystery, supernatural attacks unable to shatter or dent the shield - though the force and heat of attacks could still harm the user. Your mind and existence are protected by holy light, Jumper - use it well.
"
1971,,600,The Path of Magic ,Justice League Dark,Benevolence,"The choice to walk the road of magic is not one to be made lightly. It is fraught with danger and terrible costs... but it is also one of magic and wonder. May just be worth it, yeah? If you wish, you may initiate someone into the world of the arcane. Doing so will awaken their potential to wield magic. How you accomplish this is largely up to you – it could be anything from formally accepting them as your student to a ritualistic sharing of blood.

Most people won’t have more than average mystical potential and will require lots of time and effort to see noticeable gains in ability. But given time and proper training, they could still be able to accomplish a great deal. Even a little magic, applied correctly, is a powerful and dangerous thing.
"
1972,,600,I Am ,Justice League Dark,Benevolence,"In your time, you have seen things beyond imagining, stared into the heart of the abyss and watched it blink first. Your willpower is enormous, your mind impregnable, and your sense of self inviolable. Nothing that walks upon this world or any other can truly break your mind or shatter your will. Attempts to possess you simply fail – and often backfire, for the things that attempt it can even be trapped within your own mind.
"
1973,,600,Magic Damper ,Libriomancer,Benevolence,"Any hostile magic used against you will likely be dispelled or suppressed as if by reflex, and you may in turn extend your will out into the world. By concentrating on an active spell or magical object you can will it to unravel. Weak magical objects may be outright destroyed by your ability while stronger ones will be suppressed. Magical creatures may have their individual abilities suppressed but cannot be outright destroyed by this.
"
1974,,600,Jumper Does Not Serve ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Benevolence,"The kings of Nehekhara were prideful, one and all. Even the wisest and most skilled would brook no insult to their personage or their kingdom. For the many who tried to invade Nehekhara and sought to take advantage of this pride, they soon found it every bit justified, as the foul invaders were repelled again and again. It was only a man born in Nehekhara who could bring it down as no outsider could ever make the desert kingdom bow its head. You felt this pressure on you many times, the pressure to hold yourself upright no matter what confronts you. If you were unsuited for ruling, you would have broken. But were you ever suited. No matter what confronts you or what is laid before you as temptation, you cannot be controlled by another. No matter how the attempt is carried out, it simply fails against you. Mental domination, trickery with words or bribes, attempts to puppet your physical form with magic or wires. They may smash your bones and leave you as naught but a chattering skull but you remain a King and a King does not serve any but himself.
"
1975,,600,Perfect Partner ,Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline,Benevolence,"It can be tough, going alone for a long time. Even if you’re as self-sufficient as you can possibly get, you may want someone to share forever with - a rival, a best friend, even a significant other. But now, you have someone who will always be by your side - not behind you, not ahead of you, by. Your. Side. If you’ve managed to achieve a significant emotional bond with someone (preferably a positive one), you may choose to be ‘in sync’ with them, which they will have to voluntarily agree to. A declaration of protection, a confession of love, even a simple handshake will do. You will always know where this person is and how they currently feel, and they will likewise sense the same from you without fear of your abilities shutting them out or striking back at the reading (unless you want to - doesn’t that cheapen the bond, though?). In addition, when fighting or teaming up, you both count as one entity when working together, and their competence in any mundane skills you have soar to your equal level, able to work perfectly as a duo for teamwork purposes.

This may even work for magical powers, though they have to be capable of it and already know enough to use it on their own for that to work, and nothing unique or ‘just you’ will carry over. You will understand and know each other better than anyone else in the world, and if you maintain this bond, it may last forever. That said, breaking it off with them or losing this bond to begin with will make all the associated benefits disappear. You may also only share this with one individual at a time - it’s perfect partner, not partners, after all.
"
1976,,600,Rewind ,Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline,Benevolence,"Do you want to set something right?​ Sometimes, we wish we could do things over again. You can, now. Once per jump, you may reverse time up to 24 hours, undoing all events leading up to that point. However, do note that fate is difficult to change - events will conspire to unfold in a similar if not identical way, with the sole exception of what you reversed time for. Struggling against this for long can lead to unforeseen consequences, as one Homura Akemi can attest. This power activates automatically if you are struck down by a fatal blow, undoing the events leading up to your death...but this power can still be only used once per jump. It will not save you again. Post-Chain, this power can be used as many times as you wish.
"
1977,,600,Soul Guard ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Benevolence,"The bond between yourself and your King is even closer than with most Heralds and their Kings. The two of you enacted a ritual of sorts under the eyes of the High Priest of your Kingdom, binding your souls together for all eternity. Even in the next life, you would be drawn to one another and be able to share your thoughts and life. For as long as one of you lived, so would the other, albeit just barely on the edge of life unless brought back with other means. The High Priest, as they are wont to do, hid that the procedure had never been done to this extent and thus an unpredictable element was introduced. You are not limited with this bond to merely your King. Though you may only link your soul with one other willing being at a time, you may change this target freely and as many times as you wish.
"
1978,,600,Incorruptible,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Benevolence,Something about the nature of your existence is different. You can draw on powers that would corrupt others instantly with no negative repercussions. Your mind is your own and no powers you use will alter it in any manner without your agreement.
1979,,600,Amulet of the Great Toad ,Warhammer Fantasy: Amazons,Benevolence,"An amulet made of pure gold, shaped like one of the Great Toads of the lizardmen. A powerful mystic object, one whose powers were only unlocked by you and not the other holder of this sort of artefact. Originally just granting a degree of protection against magic, you are now in possession of an amulet that automatically dispels all but the most powerful magic that is targeted at you, even from those as great as the Slann themselves. You are also able to use the amulet and focus it on something in close range to you, letting you remove magic from objects or unleash a burst that dispels any magic within close range to you.
"
1980,,600,The Silver Mirror ,Warhammer Fantasy: Bretonnia,Benevolence,"A simple vanity mirror, made from pure silver and glass. It’s a powerful weapon in the right hands, as by pointing it at any spell caster or spell, the user can reflect any spell back at them, no matter how powerful, vile or large the spell in question may be. So long as the user is even one of the targets, the entire thing may be reflected back entirely upon the original caster. The mirror will crack after doing this, slowly repairing itself over the course of a day, before being ready for use once again. Otherwise, the glass in the mirror will never break.
"
1981,,600,Holy Icon ,Warhammer Fantasy: Bretonnia,Benevolence,"A small but exquisitely crafted triptych, a 3 sided painting that can fold away for safety and storage. It may perhaps seem a strange thing to imbue such powerful enchantments but it is an icon of faith for the nobility of Bretonnia. The faith of the Bretonnian people bound into this artefact make it so any who hold it, excluding those who have unjustly stolen it, will be rendered almost totally immune to magic. All but the most powerful spells will be negated entirely by the aura of faith and even those that do get through will find their power reduced massively from their normal level.
"
1982,,600,The Power of Holding Hands ,Senki Zesshou Symphogear,Benevolence,"You bear no weapon so that you might reach out to both your allies and enemies. This perk grants two benefits, firstly you may apply the enchantments and other benefits of a weapon you could be wielding to your body, be it a flaming sword left in its sheath at your waist or an Armed Gear you don't form. Secondly, you may take the costs of an ally's powers upon yourself in place of them, applying any cost reductions you may have in place of theirs – although you may use theirs if you wish. Bear the burdens of your friends so that they don't have to.
"
1983,,600,Juggernaut of Light ,Generic MG,Benevolence,"Stopping you is extremely difficult. Up to three times, you may keep going after being otherwise taken out of the fight.

Magic depleted? Actually, your tank is suddenly full.

Spine broken? Just pop it back in place.

Decapitated? Well, it’ll leave a scar, but that’s fine.

This takes a moment to kick in, with lethal blows taking several critical moments. Using a charge will, in addition to reversing whatever took you out of the fight, partly replenish your other combat resources. (Such as magical energy, physical and mental stamina, and health.)

You can recover charges at one every week (if from nonlethal K.O.s) or one every year (if from lethal K.O.s). Charges used for nonlethal K.O.s will recover first. If you use a charge, you’ll be exhausted the next day as your system recovers from the strain, but this has no long-term consequences. Charges also recover at the end of a Jump.

(CG Note: The remainder of this perk requires The Power of Friendship - Generic MG first.)

The Light In All Of Us (The Power Of Friendship)

When your allies fall in battle, you can bring them back. Whether it’s non-lethal or lethal, you can get them back in the fight, applying the effects of a charge of Juggernaut of Light on them without using up one of their own. It takes a moment for nonlethal K.O.s and several moments for lethal K.O.s.

In addition, your allies can also do this on their own, so if you get downed they can get you up. You maintain awareness of the battlefield even while “K.O.ed,” and if you want, you can delay using Juggernaut of Light to let your allies get you back up.
"
1984,,600,Corruption Resistance ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Benevolence,"You are seemingly immune to the corruptive effects of dark powers, unless you deliberately embrace them. You could keep a notoriously potent, corruptive youkai text unprotected inside a library for years and not be affected by it right up until you deliberately give in to it. You will not be twisted into a new form or mentally affected by the powerful and dangerous powers that you flirt with, again unless you deliberately embrace them."
1985,,600,Fairy Immortality,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Benevolence,"You can’t die when you’re surrounded by nature. Any attempt to kill you results in you quickly regenerating and resurrecting. Killing you away from nature makes you float away insubstantially on the wind to the next nearest strip of nature. However, if you cannot return to a place of nature by the next sunrise, you will die."
1986,,600,Elder Youkai,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Benevolence,"You aren’t a new kid on the block, no ma’am. You’re likely more than a thousand years old and all your innate racial abilities have reached their peak. A kitsune youkai will have a full nine tails. So strong, in fact, you could easily win battles by complete accident, let alone seriously trying to fight. Furthermore, if your race has a natural weakness, you’ve come to suppress it. For example, an oni would no longer suffer a psychological compulsion to avoid roasted soybeans or be blistered by them and could happily snack on some without ill effects. As you are blatantly stronger than your peers, you will receive the respect-slash-fear your nature fully deserves by your fellow youkai. As a side benefit, the oldest youkai are universally incredibly polite, and you are always capable of couching anything from death threats to idle conversation in the politest possible terms without obscuring your meaning."
1987,,600,Fantasy Nature ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Benevolence,"You have the ability to float away from reality itself, a power truly suited for one who lives idly and drifts around. When you activate this power, you become intangible indefinitely, with nothing mundane or magical able to directly affect you, and you can simply phase through anything or float around to wherever you desire. The one disadvantage of this power is in your total intangibility, as being intangible means that you cannot interact with the world even to attack without returning to reality.
"
1988,,600,Clap If You Believe ,Peter Pan,Benevolence,"Belief in magic is the lifeblood of fairies, and when enough people believe, miracles can happen. Your life energy is strengthened by how many people believe in you. Furthermore, if you are on the verge of death, someone clapping and expressing his or her faith in you will restore a tiny amount of your health; with enough believers (at least a thousand) clapping, you can fully come back to life with more vitality than ever before. In such emergencies, people who believe in you will sense something wrong, and what they need to do to save you. You can only call on people once per jump for this perk. Also, your ability to call on believers depends on not only their belief, but also their amount of care for you; if they don’t really care about you, it’s less likely that they will be reached by you in this manner.
"
1989,,600,Night-Lights ,Peter Pan,Benevolence,"Night-lights are a “mother’s eyes” when she is away from these children, and this set of three special nightlights helps protect you as you sleep. Their magic keeps unwanted spirits, nightmares, and other magical things from coming near you as long as you sleep. The defenses are enhanced when they are watching over children. However, familiarity has made the night lights much like children themselves, so it is possible to trick them into falling asleep themselves, thus negating their shields.
"
1990,,600,Rose ~ Embodiment of Spirit* ,Ib,Benevolence,"Since the Fabricated World is meant for artwork and not real humans, you would normally be unable to exist in that other world, except as an imaginary thing yourself. Fortunately, you don’t need to worry about that. Your life force has been transferred to a special rose of a color that resonates with you. As long as your soul is tied to the rose, you can exist in world that would otherwise forcibly change the very nature of your body and soul without facing negative consequences; any changes to your mind or body to suit the requirements of that world are neutralized with the flower’s presence. The rose does not need to be kept near you, and as long as it is kept fresh you will be protected from the distorted reality’s changes even if you are far away from it. The rose’s petals vary depending on your age and health, but do not pluck them, as they literally symbolize your life. Whenever a petal is plucked, you gain cuts and sharp internal pains. In turn, whenever your body is hurt, your rose loses a petal; on the bright side, as long as the attack would not have been instantly fatal, you only lose a single petal each time. When they all disappear, not only do you face imminent death, but you lose your protection from the gallery’s imposed fantasy, and must face the consequences; normally, that would mean you become part of the gallery, but in the context of the jump it constitutes a game over. However, there are some benefits. The rose is eternally fresh, and whenever it is immersed in water (there must be at least a vaseful for there to be any effect, it rejuvenates, and its petals (along with your health) are restored; the water is absorbed into the rose in the process. Please note that the rose only affects the health of your physical body for better or worse; it has no effect on magic and other energies you might use. Also, if you have any special powers with flowers and plants, you might want to experiment and see what happens. Once you leave the gallery, the rose vanishes, as you do not need it in the real world, but you can summon it again if you feel the need. On flipside, if you could not normally exist in the real world, the rose might be able to have the reverse effect and allow you to go there without needing to make additional sacrifices. If you choose the Local Human background, you’re stuck with the rose during the jump even if you don’t buy the perk, but you will not get the extra benefits outside the jump unless you take the perk. In the case that you purchase the perk but did not choose the Local Human background, you can freely summon and dismiss it as you please. Please keep in mind that since the rose’s purpose is to keep you in existence in the world you are in, the rose must stay in the same overall reality/dimension you are in; if you move between dimensions without it, the rose will either appear before you or be dismissed until you activate the perk again.
"
1991,,600,Ethereal ,Dogs of War: Warhammer Fantasy,Benevolence,"By divine providence or unholy magics you are now invulnerable to mundane weapons. They either bounce off or simply pass right through your ghostly form, though even the weakest enchantments will render weapons once again able to harm you.
"
1992,,600,Time’s Up ,Neverland: The RPG,Benevolence,"Many of the creatures of the island like the Crocodile are from long-lost ages, and they’ve lived long enough to no longer fear time. You (this includes all body parts) are now immune to all time-based magic and effects as long as this perk is active. Furthermore, nothing, whether physical or magical, can slow you down – this accounts for not only time magic that might slow your speed, but physical things that slow down your speed like mud, ice, breaking through barricades, etc. Please note, however, that this perk only eliminates things that reduce your speed; it does not actually increase your speed beyond what your speed would be without things to slow you down. In addition, you can cause a ticking clock sound to echo from your body, which triggers deafness in nearby listeners and lowers their overall stats. Plus, you are able to keep perfect time.
"
1993,,600,Mending ,Wonderland No More,Benevolence,"This perk allows you to essentially “heal” inanimate objects or constructs (chess pieces, living cards, robots, etc.) through magic. More than that, though, it also lets any healing powers you have that would heal living things have equivalent repair/mending effects on inanimate objects/constructs; the stronger the healing, the stronger the equivalent repair – if you have a resurrection spell, perhaps it could even bring destroyed/killed items “back to life” (something impossible for the normal Mending edge in-game). Buying this perk also grants you the Greater Mending edge from the game.
"
1994,,600,Heroic Spirit,Danmachi,Benevolence,"Significantly increase your resistance to mental attacks and abnormalities along with boosting all of your abilities when facing a great adversity and it further improves the greater the adversity and the more disadvantage you are. This also boost your willpower, determination and heightens your concentration to prevent you from faltering against you adversity. These benefits are all only temporary that slowly restores you back to your base abilities after the battle."
1995,,600,Guardian Child,Danmachi,Benevolence,"Through this your patron god or goddess gains an invulnerable status preventing others from harming, poisoning or even forcing them back to Tenkai as long as you exist and a member of your patron god or goddess. This also in exchange grants you a two way direct communication with your patron god or goddess telepathically through vast distance. The effect of this skill would be gone should you die or converted to other Famlia though your new Familia patron god or goddess would gained the invulnerable status."
1996,,600,Fleeing Party,Danmachi,Benevolence,"When you or your companions are fleeing something or someone, bindings loosen, traps failing to activate, impediments, and doors cannot slow you or your companions down whether mundane, magical, real, imagined, illusion, or otherwise. As long as you are trying to escape, flee, or disengage all of your abilities are improved to allow you to do so. This only applies to the members of your Familia or companions that you brought in your jumps."
1997,,600,A Falna’s Blessing,Danmachi,Benevolence,"As a god you have the ability to grant Falna to others individuals that you want with a short ritual allowing them to improve their basic abilities, gain developmental ability and skills like any other adventurer. Though the rate of their improvement depends on how diligent and dictated they are. If you are a god your imported companions may start as members of your familia and gained their Falna from you but you must personally update their status if they want to rise up in abilities as they lack the ability to update the Falna themselves during this jump and anyone given a Falna in the future has the ability to automatically updates itself. If you are not a god you still have the ability to grant Falna to others though the gods would question on how you can do it if they catch a wind of it. You can also give yourself a Falna if you want to be an adventurer yourself even you are a god. The Falna that you bestow others and yourself automatically integrates any existing System that you have access gained all of the advantages and discarding as much weakness and drawbacks as possible."
1998,,600,Da Once 'n' Future Git ,Warhammer Fantasy: Orcs & Goblins,Benevolence,"Once there was a Prophet and he announced that he was seeking the Once ‘n’ Future Git and with that he became one of the most well respected of his kind. You too can seek out the most worthy of a race/society to rule, within the boundaries of the race/society, over said race/society. This ability allows you to see the ‘worthiness’ of individuals which in turn will allow you to find the most worthy and grant a boon that empowers them by enhancing their positive traits and mitigating their negative traits. Once that is done once you can’t do it again for the same race/society until the current chosen has died.

By announcing you are doing this you will be treated with a large helping of respect from the Race/Society in question whilst you’re on the quest no matter where you are, though what counts as respect in some Races/Societies is different from time to time.

In addition to all of this your mastery of the magic you have grows to the point that you can get stuck into the battles and cast even in the thick of combat.
"
1999,,600,Wildheart ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Benevolence,"The Lore of Beasts is, of course, best at affecting beasts. Their wild, savage souls easily accept the brutish powers of Ghur. This creates an opportunity for you, Amber Wizard. With but an arcane growl from you, a Reiksguard’s horse might become the equal of an Elven steed, or a simple doe strong enough to kick aside a Norscan marauder. Even a tiny rabbit would gain the strength to kill a man, and a bear would become the equal of a rampaging Giant. Of course, should you choose to weaken the bestial with your spells, this too would pass. Bretonnian chargers under your curse will lose even the strength to so much as bear their riders, and the Bestigors of the foul Cloven Ones would pose as much threat as a child. By your hand, beasts may become legends or be reduced to laughing-stocks. The spells which allow such things are known to many, but only in your hands are the effects so pronounced as this. You decide who is the fittest, and shall therefore survive.
"
2000,,600,Lifebloom ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Benevolence,"Ghyran is the Jade Wind of Life, and thus life flows freely from its Wizards. This is why your Order is tasked with such things as providing medicine for troops in wartime, or preserving the harvest in times of peace. Plague and ruin flee before your touch, for you are an agent of Life, and Life always finds a way. Now, you are practically an avatar of Ghyran’s life-giving energies. Whenever you cast a spell pertaining to healing or plant life, the Jade Wind flows freely from you, restoring further health to yourself and any ally within ten meters of you. Broken bones knit themselves back together, crushed arteries renew themselves, diseases burn out before their course has run, parasites are purged from flesh and blood, and even burn scars fade away. Heroes never die, when you are among them.
"
2001,,600,Scion of Corruption ,Warhammer Fantasy: Skaven,Benevolence,"So favored by The Great Horned Rat are you, brother of Pestilens. Favored indeed that his aspect as The Harbinger of Plagues has blessed the upper echelons of your clan. Figures such as Skrolk and whoever holds the title of Nurglitch may be hammered by plague, disease, infection, and cancer; But no matter how afflicted, rotten, or pustulous their body, these priests of the Pestilent Brotherhood still stand tall and strong. Would that if they knew this blessing of yours, they would accept you there in a heartbeat.

Like Skrolk, your body is a container for all things that ravage and wear at the flesh and spirit, such that you are also immune to the slow degeneration and death that one who practices the Lore of Plague suffers. You may feel the bite and tear of Bone Ague, but it will never leave your body a bone-splintered, bent corpse. The sores of Red Pox will weep and bleed, but you will never die from excessive internal bleeding. All this comes to a head in the most terrifying aspect of this blessing: Every disease and affliction that gathers within your body mingles, mixes, breeds with each other, creating hybrid plagues and cancers that can spread from your body. As new sicknesses are created from this method, new spells for the Lore of Plague are developed to spread them. Like your god, you too shall be the Harbinger.
"
2002,,600,Pillar of Commandments ,Warhammer Fantasy: Skaven,Benevolence,"At the center of Skavenblight, in the stronghold where the Council of Thirteen gathers, stands the Black Pillar of Commandments, carved with the edicts of rulership following the Horned Rat’s ideals. Those who fit these edicts and seek to rise, become fueled with the power of the verminous realm of ruin - becoming a Lord of Decay. From there, they fight one of the existing Lords in a duel to supplant them.

In your possession is a similar pillar, made of pitch-black warpstone and, carved in Queekish, the Horned Rat’s law. This is not the Pillar that the Horned Rat slammed into Skavenblight during the great Civil War, but a copy for one’s own personal council and servitors. Those whom you find worthy, and match the edicts and laws carved into the Pillar, will find their bodies and spirits empowered by the dark magicks overflowing from the Pillar, becoming the utmost peak of what their species is capable of in both physical and magical capacities. As well, after your duration in this world, the pillar of black warpstone will be wiped clean of the Horned Rat’s etchings - allowing you to print into it your own edicts and laws, and creating the guidelines for those who are worthy to be bolstered.

It should not go without saying that if one is not worthy, or does not have your consent, will more than likely die horribly to the corrupting warpstone.
"
2003,,600,Dragon Armor of Aenarion ,Warhammer Fantasy: High Elves,Benevolence,"Yes, yes indeed, the armor of the first Phoenix King himself. He who slew daemons by the droves and fought personal avatars of all four Chaos Gods, before killing them as well. It took the combined forces of these four godly daemons to take this suit apart. It took Tzeentch’s Lord Of Change to unravel the protective enchantments, a gout of purifying dragonfire, and millennia of neglect for the armor to slightly degrade. This was an armor forged for the champion of the elves when gods walked the world, and its overwhelming defensive capacity proves this. As a last note, the helmet allows you to speak clearly to whomever you please over a battlefield, no matter the din.
"
2004,,600,Wholesome Knowledge ,Generic Minecraft,Benevolence,"Sometimes when dabbling in the arcane or in esoteric technology, there might be certain consequences that are perhaps unwanted for. Yet they can themselves be the necessary price paid to access even more power. With this Perk you can avoid paying such prices and harness the true power of the arcane and technology. Mind-bending effects that would cause you to see things that aren’t there and generally become less sane are nullified while any info that could be garnered from such states are written down in a notebook in your pocket. Thus you can be assured that no matter what happens in your quest for knowledge, you’ll remain whole and sane while reaping all the rewards that might be locked behind anyway.

(CG Note: The remainder of this Perk requires Minecraft - Generic Minecraft first.)

--(Capstone Boosted) With such deep knowledge, it becomes possible for you to harmoniously merge various facets of reality together into a whole. Whether that be merging magic and tech, or combining different technologies together to create a new whole, You’ll be able to do it if you just put your mind to it. And remove any anti-synergies in the process."
2005,,600,Ancient Stone Monoliths ,Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past,Benevolence,"In the land of Hyrule, there stand two monoliths, carved with a language most no longer remember. If you could read it, then it would be a simple set of instructions to obtain a pair of magical medallions. There also exists a third one in the Dark World, hidden deep underwater and guarded by a Catfish. However, these monoliths are not what truly matters. Instead, it is the medallions they contain - Quake, Ether, and Bombos - that have been gifted unto you. More importantly however, is the fact that you can take these three monoliths and three medallions and change them. Three spells of your choosing, set to be granted only to those who meet your criteria. Perhaps you would replace the fire creating Bombos with a healing spell? Or the earth moving Quake with a magical shield? The only real drawback is that whoever wields the medallions will also be paying the cost of the spell, and might be incapable of doing just that.
"
2006,,600,A Set of Keys ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventure,Benevolence,"Fairies hate being in debt and love when you are indebted to them. It doesn’t show up very often because of how rarely they interact with ordinary Hylians, but it is there. In the case you ever find yourself in debt, perhaps some hero dumped a few thousand Rupees into your pond, these keys are a quick and easy way to get out. Or to get them into debt if you wanted to, but that’s another story. The Silver key is both a blessing and a curse - it dampens dark magics, saps strength from foes, generally makes things easier, but comes at the cost of sapping away at the users fate and destiny, thus reducing the reward they would normally receive for their heroic actions. On the other hand, the Hero Key is both a curse and a blessing, because it does the exact opposite. Your foes become stronger, but so will the reward they recieve. As for the Golden Key? Well, it does nothing. Maybe it amps things up or down by a little bit, but maybe that’s just their motivation after you praise or criticise them in the process of giving this to them.
"
2007,,600,Tempered by Light ,Hyrule Warriors,Benevolence,"The conflict between good and evil, light and darkness, seems to wage without end. Still, few can say they are wholly aligned with one side or the other. Even the hero of legend must be tempered before he may eradicate the darkness within his soul. 

On purchase, you become a being wholly aligned with light, in both a metaphorical and conceptual sense. Emotions or mentalities steeped in darkness such as arrogance or hatred are purged from your soul, preventing others from using them against you. 

The corruptive influences of darkness gain no purchase on your mind, body or soul leaving you pure and pristine. Most importantly however, you gain the remarkable power of cleansing, purifying light. It is this light that keeps your soul pure, and it is this light that allows you to combat the darkness. 

The light may be harnessed in a variety of ways to imbue objects with darkness banishing properties, infuse attacks with the powers of light, or simply empower your body to allow you to move and act faster than you naturally could. You stand now as a paragon of the forces of light. 

(CG Note: The rest of this perk requires Lord of Darkness - Hyrule Warriors first.)

Purchasing both “Tempered by Light” and “Lord of Darkness” together will transform you into epitomized Twilight. A perfect balance of Light and Darkness with all that brings with it. Light and darkness, positivity and negativity, altruism and ambition, love and hate. You will be able to blend the light and dark powers you get from these perks into twilight energy, like a Twili Sorcerer.
"
2008,,600,Purveyor of Unusual Goods ,Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask,Benevolence,"The Happy Mask Salesman is currently seeking out Majora’s Mask after the Skull Kid stole it. He seeks to prevent something terrible from happening... Like the moon falling out of the sky. Bit late for that. In truth, he probably should have left it where it lay, inside the tomb it was buried by the ancient tribe that guarded it. That said, he seemingly did an excellent job of guarding it during his time owning it. When a cursed artifact is in your possession, it’s not quite so cursed. Anyone seeking to track it’s dark aura would have a harder time, the curse’s effects would be weakened, and the evil permating it’s very nature would not whisper so loudly in your ear. Just be warned - you may be able to carry it safely, but the curse is by no means gone. If it should leave your hands, it would be restored to full power.
"
2009,,600,The Mask ,Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask,Benevolence,"Skull Kids are an interesting race. Simply put, they do not have a face - or at least, they are dissatisfied with their natural wooden complexion - and as a result, have a minor obsession with masks. It’s somewhat fitting then, that Majora’s Mask paired with the Skull Kid so well, a child without a face and a face without a body. Yours is a bit better than that. You see, you have an affinity for cursed objects now. Not enough to use them and remain completely fine, but a resistance of sorts. Able to use some of its power before being corrupted, using more power than it wanted to give you, even forcing the artifact to act towards your own goals instead of being forced to act towards its - but again, only for a time. On the other hand, if the curse was weak enough to begin with, you could probably use it safely indefinitely. Just se wary of how long you hold onto such a cursed item, lest it become part of you, or you a part of it.
"
2010,,600,Song of Healing ,Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask,Benevolence,"Strictly speaking, this is something that the hero leaned here in Termina and not something he brought with him, but who cares? You now know a very special song, the song of healing. No, it doesn’t heal you when you play it, though quite frankly that would be nice. Instead, this song eases the mental wounds of any who hear it. From simply the sad or broken, to those who still wander this earth long after their time has ended. If you’re willing to suffer yourself, then instead of simply curing these ailments, you’ll find you can instead eject them from the listeners... And into the form of a mask. Be careful with those drawn from the souls of the dead, Jumper, because those are the ones that hurt the most.
"
2011,,600,To Protect the Light ,Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,Benevolence,"The Wise are needed to safeguard the power of the world - and the fruits of their own knowledge from the short sighted and greedy. You have mastered the ways of “protection”, which manifests in a few ways. First, you now know a form of protective magic similar to Nayru's Love which can protect others from all harm- as long as they do not raise a hand to defend themselves or fight their attackers.

Similarly, you have learned how to create extremely powerful barriers and enchantments - so strong that once created you couldn’t even remove them without risking your life with the amount of power needed to break them. These barriers can be given magical “locks” and “keys” to ensure that they are not infiltrated by some petty thieves with lockpicks - utilizing irreplaceable and mystical things such as a certain song or special magical stones - or both if the need arises. These very same barriers can be also shifted to instead sense the contents of one’s heart - allowing only the truly noble or wicked to pass, and warding off all those who do not pass the test. There are some things in this world that must be guarded at all costs - and the heroes of courage only last so long. The walls raised by your hands could stand for thousands of years, in comparison.
"
2012,,600,Soul of Light,Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap,Benevolence,"One of the two gifts of the Picori shines brightly within your soul. A powerful magic known as the Light Force which can shield you from harm by projecting a sphere of golden light around you. Whilst the shimmering field of Light Force is active it consumes magic at a gluttonous rate and you must stay in place, however this field of energy is completely invincible, capable of blocking everything from magical to physical attacks with equal ease. In addition to this power you have a vast well of mystical energies to draw upon, though no training in its use. Prophecies are clearer and with time you can push events into fulfilling those visions or avoid them with great ease.
"
2013,,600,Magic Armor ,Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess,Benevolence,"This suit of heavy golden armor has an incredibly powerful- and costly- enchantment. When it is worn, it will start to consume the Rupees on its wearer’s person; in exchange, the armor will protect them from all damage, while becoming light enough to maneuver in as easily as one would regular clothes or chain mail. One Rupee equals one second of protection; once the wearer’s wallet is emptied, the armor will take on a duller color, and become about as heavy as one would expect golden armor to be. Post-Jump, the armor will convert the native currencies of whatever worlds you find yourself in, so long as they are on your person, in addition to Rupees.
"
2014,,600,Dragon Priest Masks ,The Elder Scrolls,Benevolence,"Crafted in ancient times by dragons for their priests, these eight masks are powerful artifacts. Each will never fall off the face of the wielder without their consent, and each has powerful but differing enchantments. These effects can range from empowering your destructive spells to greatly resisting the three destructive elements to infinite stamina and no need for sleep."
2015,,600,Morrowind Signet Ring ,The Elder Scrolls,Benevolence,"This gold emerald ring is almost always found in the possession of the King of Morrowind. It's enchantment allows the wearer's skin to be as durable as ebony with no loss of movement, offers extremely potent magic resistance and high-speed regeneration, and makes them immune to paralysis."
2016,,600,Relics of the Crusader ,The Elder Scrolls,Benevolence,"The weapons and armor of Pelinal Whitestrake, the Star-Made Knight and Champion of the Slave-Queen Alessia. Donning this divine set of armor will make the wearer more personable and skilled in the Restoration school of magic. It is much more durable and resistant to unenchanted weapons than any other armor, and grants the wearer immunity to disease. The shield will reflect any spells it blocks back at the caster. The sword burns with a holy fire that also damages their pool of magicka, while the mace burns with holy fire that is extremely potent against the undead."
2017,,600,A Flourishing Land,Genshin Impact,Benevolence,"After the events of the Archon War much of the land was torn up, and ravaged with disasters and plagues. The ordinary folk were at the mercy of these horrors, trying desperately to just survive having lost home and hearth. The people of Liyue were saved from this when the God of the Stove put his power into the land to stabilise it, leaving him greatly weakened. The Dendro Archon Rukkhadevata did the same to quell a calamity in her own lands caused by Forbidden Knowledge. To an extent you are able to do something similar. By channelling your power into the land itself, you can revitalise it and calm any plagues or calamities that may be affecting it. Greater calamities will require more of your power to quell."
2018,,600,Cheat Weapon ,Konosuba,Benevolence,"Usually this is the only thing a plucky new world traveler might get, coming to this world. I guess your point system has some benefits after all. A Cheat Weapon is an incredibly powerful weapon and the one you have at hand is particularly potent. Whatever shape it takes on, as decided by you, it will be a suitably strong weapon for you, no matter how strong you are. It will continue to grow in power to remain suitable. At low levels, someone wielding this blade could kill a dragon in a single strike, though they’d not have much protection against the Dragons’ blows themselves. That said, wielding this weapon does confer a protection against all curses and status effects. A treasure like this will ward them away no matter how good they are, though it won’t protect against other kinds of magic."
2019,,700,Upgraded Firewall ,Drakengard and Nier,Benevolence,"Let’s be honest. Getting hacked? Sucks. Having logic viruses infect your think-space? Sucks. Being unable to control your own body while some jackass pilots your body to kill your friends? Sucks. So let’s put a stop to that right here and now. Your CPU has been granted an upgraded firewall to protect you from all those nasty computer bugs. Anything that attempts to access your mind without your consent will be not only denied, but deleted. More powerful data entities might come out of the deal with just some damage and data corruption, rather than full deletion, but it’ll still hurt like a bitch. And they’re not getting in no matter what. 

If you’re taking this perk and you're not an android, instead of a firewall you have a literal psychic wall of fire in your mind to protect you. Madness effect, psychic attacks, possession magic, it works on anything that affects your mind, just like if you were a robot and not a disgusting meatsack.

Note that this only protects against mental/software hacks. If something manages to physically puppet your body, you need to find your own solution.
"
2020,,700,Blessing of the Lady - Full,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Benevolence,"You bear the Blessing of the Lady of the Lake, the Goddess of Bretonnia. An unseen but incredibly powerful enchantment you are greatly resistant to magic. Should you be a knight errant and in your travels find the Lady and be granted a sip from the Holy Grail you will find that you become almost completely immune to hostile magic, the power of enemy mages and sorcerors simply washing harmlessly over you.

This represents a 30% and 70% resistance to hostile magic respectively, and becoming a Grail Knight is no easy feat, something less than a handful of the most selfless, purehearted knights of Bretonnia ever manage. The quest itself will take most, if not all of your ten years here.
"
2021,,800,Well of Light,The Silmarillion,Benevolence,"Such a thing has not been seen since Ungoliant drank the Two Trees dry: A pool of the mingled dews of Telperion and Laurelin; liquid light that shimmers in countless shades of silver and gold, and sheds a holy radiance far beyond where it should reach. These sacred waters have many virtues, of which perhaps the least are their healing properties. To drink but a mouthful from this well of light is to banish all disease and weariness, and to set all wounds on a road to swift and sure healing without any lingering harm or pain.

A plant watered with a few drops of this sacred dew will grow sure and strong and bear fruits or seeds with healing virtues of their own, while a beast allowed to drink will grow wise and strong according to its kind, and sire children with similar strengths. If a sapient being drinks from the Well, they and their children shall have the light of Aman in their face; they will have something of the reflected radiance of the Two Trees, and will be blessed with beauty, longevity and great spiritual strength, though not necessarily with wisdom.

Even simply bathing in their light will help bring healing and respite from mental and spiritual pains, and ensure that disease and decay do not come near, and all but the mightiest of evil things will flee its radiance. The reflected glimmer of the light captured in a Silmaril was enough to empower the Phial of Galadriel, after all, when this is pure from the source.

Beyond these blessed qualities, however, the dews of the well are potent magical substances. It is said that Varda made the very stars from the nectar of the Two Trees - and even if you lack the power of the Valar to shape the world in such a grand fashion, these waters are nothing less than a divine reagent for light, healing and blessing, allowing for creations fit to match those of the Ainur. A blade quenched in these waters would be a bane to all evil things, and a crown anointed with them might impart to the wearer great beauty and radiance, as of the light of Aman. Perhaps one day you might even capture their light anew, and forge new Silmarils - if you have the skill, and can discover a substance fit to contain their light as a body would a spirit.

Your well of light is composed of two outer pools where the gold and silver dews slowly gather, and an inner where they mingle. They are not large, each the size of a medium-sized pond, but will slowly re-fill over time. If entirely emptied, they would re-fill over the course of a year."
2022,,800,The Blessing of Blessing,The Silmarillion,Benevolence,"The treasures of the Numenoreans were granted in gift from the Valar and the elves of the West, in recognition of their resolve in the war against the first Dark Lord. From the Palantíri to the land of Elenna itself, they are a blessed people - but why should these be the only blessings you hold? With this perk, your ability to earn blessings and gifts from others in recognition of duty, service or resolve is greatly increased. This can happen on a mundane level, where those you serve faithfully are inclined to give you gifts in recognition of that service. On a grander scale, however, spirits, gods and other divine beings you encounter on your travels are often inclined to reward similar service with blessings of their own. If you risked your life to defend a god’s temple, they might anoint you as their champion - and as a result of this perk, this blessing would become a part of you. It might weaken and diminish if you broke faith with the god, and nothing prevents them from smiting you, but the blessing itself would never leave. If you lead a group in such service, they may also partake of this perk’s effects - they will be more likely to be rewarded, and mystical blessings become a part of their very being.

Apart from this, however, there is one blessing you can carry with you. If others live in accordance with the ideals of the Valar - confronting evil even at great risk to themselves, living peacefully and with goodwill towards one another - you may cause the blessing of the Numenoreans to spread to these people as well. They shall grow resilient to disease and harm, their children shall grow greater and more noble than their parents, their lands shall be enriched, and their lifespans shall increase to equal those of the Men of the West."
2023,,800,Spirit of Fire ,The Silmarillion,Benevolence,"In you is come again the might of Fëanor son of Finwë, for better and worse. Your charisma and oratory skills are legendary, sufficient to convince an entire people to follow you out of paradise in pursuit of glory and vengeance, and this same strength of spirit fortifies your body and mind as well. You are, in short, a genius capable of mastering many skills at a great pace, and of bringing them to heights beyond what even masters of their craft would think possible. Meanwhile, your spirit burns through your flesh, allowing you to go beyond the conventional limits of your body to leap great chasms, match trolls for strength, endure great torments or lengthy exertions, and run at speeds matching a mighty horse - though sustaining such feats at the limits of your ability will drain your spirit and require recovery time in the aftermath. If you were to attain the heights of martial skill and armour yourself in the best crafts of the Noldor, it would take a small army of balrogs to slay you, and even then you would be able to land blows to remember you by.

Furthermore, once per jump (no matter how long the jump is!) you may stoke your spirit to its very height, in order to achieve something that can truly be termed a miracle. As Yavanna shaped the Two Trees of Valinor, and Fëanor wrought the Silmarils from their mingled lights, so you too may bring forth all your strength, skill, knowledge, magic and powers, no matter how disparate or normally-incompatible they may be, to achieve some truly incredible feat. This might be an object forged with transcendent enchantments that even the greatest wizards find impossible to understand, or a feat of might like defeating a god through force of arms. Whatever it is, it will be a feat the likes of which has never been seen before, and will not be seen again.
 
Post-Spark, you may accomplish such feats once per decade."
2024,,800,Glory to... ,Percy Jackson,Benevolence,"Pick one

Me: Your divinely related abilities are all massively enhanced to the point that you could fight on par with some mid-tier gods. Using your powers is instinctual and nearly as easy as breathing. Also you gain benefits from your divine parent’s more obscure domains. A child of Hades might find themselves able to call up wealth and ghosts interchangeably while one of Apollo could burn his foes and heal his allies with his mere presence. Using your abilities extensively is tiring though and you should be careful not to wear yourself out too much by summoning a natural disaster where something smaller would’ve worked just as well. Generally the stronger your parent or other source of abilities the more you will get to work with, a child of a minor deity will probably get less but get some additional ways to interact with their parent’s domain. Generally a demigod can fight on par with a non combat focused god of a rank equivalent to their parents with this.

Or

The Legion: Through a quick ceremony of sharing blood and declaring yourself blood brothers with a friend you may grant them a portion of your powers from this jump, you may selectively grant them some of your powers or all of them. Each bond formed dilutes the powers slightly, while it won’t be too noticeable with just you and a couple friends you probably shouldn’t try for an entire army unless you’re willing to deal with the powers being very weak in individuals. Those bonded with you also gain flawless teamwork and the ability to share senses with eachother. You may renounce any of these bonds with a moment’s concentration."
2025,,800,Fate’s Chosen,Percy Jackson,Benevolence,"Whereas the other origins will generally have a great and terrible Fate ahead of them (in varying degrees of both) you will generally come off fairly decently in matters of Fate, and your interpretations of prophecies and other Fates tends to be the correct one, with you able to shift around some details if you feel necessary and have your changes turn out to have been the correct interpretation of the prophecy. More than that you may see what Fate has in store for you or a friend and actively defy it and succeed, don’t defy Fate too often as Fate still doesn’t take kindly to such things and you tend to have a notable drop in your fortune for few weeks after you do this with multiple attempts stacking, alternatively you may get rid of the bad luck early by consulting an oracle (yes you can consult yourself if you’re an oracle) for a task to appease Fate. These tasks will generally be difficult but doable, and involve setting the stage for a new prophecy."
2026,,800,Grand Jumper,Kill Six Billion Demons,Benevolence,"Servants are immortal, and they can live so long as no one kills them. And some, like Mammon, grow with age. The longer you live, you grow smarter and wiser. You also never grow weaker from age, only stronger.

Boosted: Not only do you grow wiser and smarter, but also physically. Your physical, and magic passively increase over time, and they increase at a faster rate than normal.

2027,,800,POWER OF FRIENDSHIP YOU B^*%$ ,Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Benevolence,YOU ARE FRIENDSHIP ITSELF. WHEN ALL HOPE SEEMS LOST YOU SOMEHOW PULL OUT THE MOVES TO ABSOLUTELY BEAT DOWN YOUR ENEMIES. YOUR BONDS FROM THE FRIENDS YOU MADE HAVE SUDDENLY BECOME YOUR PWOER INCREASING IT EXPONENTIALLY. LET THE POWER OF FRIENDSHIP BLOOM. LET FAMILIAL LOVE SHOOT LIKE A CANNON UPON YOUR FOES. LET THE LOVE OF YOUR PARTNER SLICE APART THE BEASTS THAT DARE TO HARM YYYYYYYOUUUUUUUUUUUUUU...Now let's actually describe the perk. If you are about to lose a battle you can pull upon the bonds you have made from your past in every jump. Pulling together the true might of the power of friendship that you have had for so long. This manifests as a giant boost in energy healing you of your wounds and also somehow having you evolve yourself into becoming stronger. Maybe your friends use techniques that you replicate to beat the breaks off your opponent. Maybe you launch all that energy at them in a final bid to defeat them. This power would effectively boost you with a 10x multiplier. You also do not run out of this power until you have somehow died even with this incredible boost or your opponent decides this isn't worth the hassle and runs away.
2028,,800,LUCKY LUCKY RRRRROOOOOLLLLLL,Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Benevolence,"You are incredibly lucky. Impossibly so. In a fight perhaps your opponent is just as burnt out as you. You also seem to just get that jackpot in the final moments of a fight. Perhaps you activate your domain .01 seconds faster than your opponent. Maybe you got lucky and found a great weapon that is just what you need to beat your opponent. Or maybe you won the lottery. Just as this works for fighting it works in a normal mundane life. Maybe you accidentally took a wrong turn and ended up dodging a cursed spirit attack. Maybe you decided to just buy that donut and end up being the millionth customer who wins donuts for a year. You are great in all aspects that concern luck. Gambling, Fighting, the World itself bends so that you come out on top."
2029,,800,"A Body, Tempered And Refined",Journey To The West,Benevolence,"Sun Wukong learned the Way under a Taoist monk, scrubbed his name from the Book of the Dead, ate Heaven’s peaches of immortality, drank from its heavenly wine, consumed four gourds of pills of immortality, and was refined in an alchemical cauldron for 49 days. All this resulted in him gaining a body as long-lasting as Heaven and Earth itself. Now, whether or not you’ve gone through a similar process, you’ve somehow obtained a body as tempered and refined as the Monkey King’s.

Your durability and endurance are incredible, far and above the strength you can exert, and your body is as hard as it is tough, turning away sharp blades as easily as blunt staffs, and able to exert itself fully for days on end without even being winded. Exactly how tough you are depends on your own might, someone as strong as Sun Wukong matching him in durability, but no matter your strength you will always be so durable that you would not be able to harm yourself without treasures or techniques vastly exceeding you in power. Additionally, this durability applies to things stranger than simple force and blade, resisting corrosion, flame, and cold as easily as you resist weapons.

Of course, should you wish for it, you’re able to tune down your hardiness somehow. Which leads into yet another boon you now have, that you are now able to survive grievous wounds just fine, such as a beheading. Interestingly, you will retain control of your body, not your head, should your neck be severed. The wound wouldn’t even bleed if you don’t wish it to, and with a simple shapeshifting trick you’d be able to grow a new head. Your resistance to mere damage is such that you could tear open your stomach, inspect each of your innards thoroughly, put your innards back into your body, and seal the wound with simple shapeshifting with no issue whatsoever. To actually die, you’d have to be turned to pulp, or fall victim to stranger powers such as your spirit being taken from your body outright. What will you do now, that your flesh is no longer weaker than your spirit?"
2030,,800,Perpetual,Horus Heresy: The Primarchs,Benevolence,"You are now a Perpetual, a kind of immortal regenerator who is very difficult to put down permanently. You can regenerate from any mundane injury, from being torn to bloody shreds to atomization. Your healing is extremely fast – if you were decapitated and the head thrown off a cliff you can reasonably expect to grow a new body by the time you hit the ground – and it will grow faster the more you grow accustomed to it and are able to focus on healing. Only a few weapons, psychic powers and abilities could truly kill a Perpetual, especially a Perpetual Primarch, outside those you can reasonable assume that you will simply rapidly regenerate back to full health no matter how serious or fatal your wounds are. Do note however that this does not inherently protect you against mental degradation stemming from repeated deaths and resurrections, and even a Primarch can go a little crazy from dying over and over again. "
2031,,800,Immortality ,Marvel: Age of Krakoa,Benevolence,"If an Eternal’s body is destroyed, they will be recreated by The Machine That is Earth. If a Mutant dies, they can be resurrected by The Five. Post-Humans are revived by the networks of The Vault. And that’s just what happens on purpose. Simply put, death is cheap. Free for everyone, if there is any possibility that you could be resurrected then death does not count as the end of a jump or your chain as long as you are in some way active at the time a jump ends.

For 800 CP, you have priority in either the resurrection queue of your race or by some other, similar means of revival. Jumpchain fiat guarantees that you will still be you after your revival, your soul intact, and that any mental or biological backups used in your revival are 100% tamper-proof, cannot be used without your consent, and will always by sheer coincidence be fully updated to the exact yocto-instant that brain function ceased ensuring no loss of memory or enhancements you may have picked up. You will be revived within an hour of your death, tops, in a state of perfect health and fitness, at either the age you died or the prime of your youth, whichever is preferable. Post Jump, or if your means of resurrection becomes unavailable to you, you will instead respawn in the appropriate manner in your warehouse, a property you own, or if all else fails somewhere safe. You may optionally make changes to your body upon revival, with the only limitation being that you can’t make any changes that alter your fundamental identity. Mutants, Eternals, and Post-Humans get the 800-point version for free during the duration of the Jump but must pay to keep it permanently. Eternals must take the free temporary upgrade unless they took the “No Backups” drawback."
2032,,800,The Undefeatable Jumper,Epic of Leviathan,Benevolence,"Squirrel Girl is a hero belonging to the Marvel universe who is often treated as a joke. Despite her silly demeanor she is actually one of the most powerful beings in all of Marvel who has bested many of its most horrifying villains earning her the moniker the Undefeatable Squirrel Girl. Two of her abilities that allow her to do this are her immeasurable empathy and her ability to pull off the impossible. You may acquire both of these characteristics by purchasing this perk. For the empathy power an example of this is when Squirrel Girl managed to convince Galactus to leave earth alone by sitting down and talking to him. You will be able to reach the heart of even the darkest and most evil beings simply by being kind. Regarding the ability to pull off the impossible it’s never been explained. It is believed to be a combination of good luck, common sense, and sheer determination though. Regardless of the reason you will gain the ability to perform similar feats. This will include the ability to defeat beings far more powerful than you and the potential to pull off equally ridiculous feats."
2033,,800,The Arch-Enemy,A Wild Last Boss Appeared!,Benevolence,"Certainly this is a skill that would bring the Goddess to tears and make her despair at the sight of your person. After all, she already has enough bugs in the system to also need to pay attention to you. But she probably should, seeing how dangerous you are to her and beings like her.

The Arch-Enemy is the name of the class that represents the one who stands against the “perfect” script that directs the world of Midgard. Its bearer is one that has the ability to surpass and destroy any predetermined fates, regardless of the deity or entity that is enforcing them, with their mere presence. Any forms of destiny manipulation fail, requiring a way more direct action to be taken in order to take someone like you out.

It is also the culmination of the Overlord archetype, as it is a class that fills its skills slots with the skills and powers of one’s subordinates. A true cheat that concentrates the power of one’s closest aides into a single monster. The number of skills that can be accumulated into this skill depends on the number of levels that it has, with 1000 levels being enough to accumulate the powers of 13 people.

Not only that, but fitting to the one that would dare to spit in the face of the most perfect Goddess of Creation, you have quite an obstinate will. One that could be considered a cheat in itself. Your willpower is basically unlimited, and once you have decided to do something, you can keep going no matter what. It doesn’t stop you from reevaluating your course of action if some new perspective, information or point of view actually guarantees it, but your heart is not one that will easily be swayed by self-doubts, anger or any other factor. Yours is a resolution that could be terrifying in the Realm of Gods, so the Goddess would be really thankful if you didn’t come near it.

And fitting for such a stubborn person, your mind seems to be specially naturally resistant to all kinds of mental or memory manipulations, regardless of their potency or origin, as you can shrug off those attempts even without realizing it, to the point that it is basically an immunity to such effects, even to those casted by the almighty Goddess of Creation herself or her avatars.

A skill that makes you the worst kind of piece in a stage, one that vehemently refuses to listen to the director. One who may even grow to smack them if they start abusing their position too much."
2034,,800,Living Saint,Asura’s Wrath,Benevolence,"You are so pious, your presence enriches local flows of Mantra. As a base effect, you are, in a way, holy, as regarded by the spirits of the world. Hostile spirits, souls burdened by emotions of the base and impure, and similar beings will be wracked with discomfort by your humble glory. Such is your piety that those beings and souls gripped in madness will have trouble attacking you, stumbling and fighting themselves as you walk amongst them.

Prayer lead by you doubles the amount of Mantra or faith generated, as long as people can see and follow your ritual performance. If not utilized by something, the surge of Mantra or energized faith saturates the surroundings, miraculously repairing the broken, healing the sick and purifying the land of taint, including that of Gohma."
2035,,800,Arcane Nullification ,Dial,Benevolence,"With the Arcane Nullification perk, you possess unparalleled resistance and immunity to all forms of magic, just like the legendary Rakshasas. Your very presence disrupts and nullifies the mystical forces that others wield, rendering them ineffective against you. No matter the source or nature of the magic, whether it be spells, enchantments, curses, or supernatural abilities, they have no power over you. Your immunity extends to all aspects of magic, including elemental manipulation, telekinesis, illusions, mind control, and even reality-altering spells. This extraordinary resistance to magic grants you the ability to confront and defy even the most powerful sorcerers, witches, or entities who rely on mystical forces.

Their spells and incantations will simply wash over you, leaving you untouched and unharmed. Furthermore, your immunity to magic allows you to navigate and explore magical realms, dimensions, or enchanted locations without being subject to their mystical effects. You can traverse through magical barriers, resist the influence of magical beings, and maintain your independence and free will. Embrace the power of Arcane Nullification and become an impervious force against magic. No longer shall sorcery be a threat to you, as you stand resolute and unyielding in the face of mystic forces that would otherwise manipulate or harm others."
2036,,800,Comic Book Quality,Dr Strange Multiverse of Madness,Benevolence,While they do share the same source there is a large discrepancy in the power levels of the MCU and the comics. What if you could remove this gap or at least the limit on yourself. This option allows you to buff all of your abilities and powers to their comic book equivalent. An example of this would be Wanda. Her greatest feat in the MCU is probably her killing the entire Illuminati team. Her greatest comic feat however is depowering all of the mutants on earth. Your abilities will be buffed on this scale. This will include skills and your technological capabilities. This perk will also amplify all of your abilities by the gap between the MCU and Marvel Comics.
2037,,800,Avatar Cycle,Avatar: The Last Airbender,Benevolence,"Like the legendary Avatar, you have been blessed with a unique cycle of reincarnation, connecting your lives from one to the next. From this point on, upon your final death, your spirit will be reborn into a new body, conceived shortly after your death in the world you call home. The newborn will retain all of your abilities, though they will have to re-learn how to use each ability one-by-one, and they will be born with an innate talent for the next element in the Cycle (Air-Water-Earth-Fire) rather than the element you chose. They will also have the ability to call upon you, primarily as a spiritual adviser, but also as a source of power should they so require. However, they will have their own mind, which you cannot directly influence - your role in their life will be a mentor, and though their personality is guaranteed to not be on you disapprove of, in the end they will make their own choices. When they die, they will also take on the same role as you have, and will in turn be reincarnated, each life becoming a link in an endless chain far greater than the whole."
2038,,800,Empty Night ,The Dresden Files,Benevolence,"There are a lot of creatures out there that resist magic. Try to hit them with a spell, and it feels like it's being ground out. When someone uses magic against you, though, all they hit is a hungry void - a void that devours any spell cast on you, leaving nothing behind. Doesn't matter if it's thaumaturgy, evocation, or some other kind of magic entirely, the moment it hits you, it's gone. One catch - it only protects you from direct magical effects, which means a smart wizard can get around it indirectly. Seems obvious enough, but you'd be surprised what counts as indirect - Lord Raith sure was."
2039,,800,Blood of the Unnamed ,Skulduggery Pleasant,Benevolence,"The power of The Unnamed. Grants vastly accelerated healing, the power of flight, the power to summon and manipulate black flames that burn through anything, and the power to heal others who are on the brink of death, returning them to full strength. You can siphon the lifeforce of others around you (touch-range) to revitalize yourself or further enhance your strength. Your vitality is such that you are functionally immortal, and can only be killed by high-grade godkiller weapons like the Obsidian Sword. You are capable of granting your powers to others, though this will deprive you of the ability to use them yourself until you take them back, which you can do at any time. Finally, once per Jump (or once every ten years), upon your death, you may transfer your spirit into the corpse of a suitable host, claiming it as your own to revive yourself.

Boosted: Unnamed Jumper: The power in your veins has been augmented, placing you above even the Unnamed. Where before you merely healed at an accelerated rate, now you can even survive and regenerate so long as your head remains somewhat intact. Your power to heal and transfer lifeforce has been augmented as well, allowing you to even bring the dead back to life, similar to Richard Mellior. However, the longer the target has been deceased, the greater the lifeforce required, though it doesn’t have to be yours. The range at which you can absorb lifeforce has also been enhanced, allowing you to perform it at a range of ten metres. Due to your power, your spirit can now be transferred twice every ten years (twice per jump). Barring the spirit transfer, what you can do will improve in time.

2040,,800,Worthy,Fate/Legends - Garden of Avalon,Benevolence ,"Once every few centuries, someone special is born. The sort of person that you just know will be
something great as soon as you see them, even as a child. In these times, that person is Arturia
Pendragon, the future king of Britain. But what if there was another like her? You’ve been found
worthy of the favour of the World now and been blessed for it. Your path is one of great destiny, paved with many gifts and prizes, leading to truly incredible feats. And all it takes from you is to take
the first step to adventure. So long as you pursue great feats and pursuits, you’ll find yourself surrounded by advantages. Mentors and teachers of incredible skill and fame appear to teach you
skills, spells and abilities. You’ll find yourself involved in many stories in favourable ways, gathering
friends, allies and resources without even trying to gain them. As you attempt to improve yourself, so long as it is in the aim of accomplishing great things later on, you’ll find no end to the
breakthroughs and leaps of progress you achieve. While on this golden path, you’ll be protected
from many minor dangers and risks, never needing to fear dying or failing because of accidents or
the threat of unimportant foes in your story. Finally, this blessing of the World has ensured your
natural charisma has skyrocketed to immense heights. Even if you act as an emotionless robot, you
could gather a small army of devoted and powerful retainers over just a few years. It has it’s limits
though, don’t expect people to stick around forever if you never show them a smile. Whatever path
you take, it is one where you are assured to reach the centre stage of the story."
2041,,800,Revival ,Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline,Benevolence,"Do you want to be a hero?​ Even among other Magical Girls, you are very good at healing from injuries. You will be able to heal bruises in seconds, cuts in minutes, and deeper wounds within hours instead of days or months. You can even ‘share’ this ability with allies, letting them heal quickly along with you. Be warned - healing yourself is a passive effect that costs no energy, but healing others will take more and more out of you. You can’t save everyone, after all.
"
2042,,800,Wishing ,Dragon Ball Super,Benevolence,"Your species possess quite miraculous powers of wish granting, similar or perhaps even the same as the Eternal Dragons. The power of Wishing is one that can accomplish anything at all, should the holder of that power have enough power. But it comes with many limitations to match that peerless potential. A Wish cannot be made by any user of the power, only another beseeching them can allow the Wish to be granted. It is limited by the power of the user, unable to do anything beyond the scope, scale and target range of it's user, such as affect an area beyond the power of the user or a being stronger than the wielder. Finally, wishes must be made at least a year apart from each other or else negative energy will begin to build up in the user, eventually creating powerful but usually evil alternate versions of the user that spread chaos and mayhem.
"
2043,,1000,The Last Moment,Warhammer 40K: The Warp,Benevolence,"Some Daemons and Warp entities are particularly hard to kill, due to the stories and narratives they are shaped by. Qaramar, a Great Unclean One of Nurgle, was particularly troublesome, for he was fated to be at the last moment of existence. This condition made him immensely difficult to kill without meeting this particular condition to his end, but he came close to true death nonetheless. The same cannot be said for you. The condition that must be met before the possibility of true death is absolute. You may choose a condition that must be met before another has the possibility to kill you permanently. This condition, however, must not be truly impossible to meet and must be theoretically possible in some way, and not expire nor have a time limit placed upon it. If the condition does become completely impossible to fulfill in a future jump, then the protection granted by this perk is forfeit for as long as that remains true. In this event, you may choose a new condition for this perk."
2044,,1000,Adaptability ,Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Benevolence,Yeah this isn’t the technique of a human or a cursed spirit but a shikigami. But it’s cool so I’m putting it here. This is the ability to adapt to all phenomena such as attacks and how you fight. Each time the eight handled wheel behind you turns you become more and more resistant to a type of attack. Not just the specific one but in general. This adaptation works after a single attack but will speed up after each strike of the same technique. Such as if you were hit by a flame attack repeatedly you would become immune to it and flames in general. You also adapt as you fight. Your blows become able to injure your opponent even if they were previously invincible. Such as an opponent being weak to fire your blows will become wreathed in flames. This does take time though as the wheel must finish spinning four times. Also it can only adapt to one thing at a time. So if you are being hit with both ice and fire you can choose which to adapt to at the time. This effect is nullified when you remove the wheel and stop using the technique.
2045,,1000,Of Destiny Born,Viking Saga,Benevolence,"Your physical and mental prowess increases by half again and your body and mind get faster, stronger, and more durable. No longer are you held down by the petty strings of fate unless you like where they lead you. You are your own jumper and shall hear your song spread across all lands. This power over fate may be used selectively, thought the more you wish to keep of a fate the less you have to change. You gain no additional perception over what your fate will be other than that from other abilities."
2046,,1000,Omnipotent Orb,Persona 5 Royal,Benevolence,This game-breaking Orb has a pretty powerful effect. It doesn’t grant you real Omnipotence but for all accounts... you’re pretty much invincible with it. Only attacks that would qualify as almighty in nature or bypass all defences could still damage you. Anything else will be nullified by the Orb instantly. It also is bound to you alone and can’t be stolen or used against you. Oh well if you really want it that much go ahead. But seriously this thing is like a Cheat Code.
2047,,1000,Nirvana,Chinese Mythology,Benevolence,"The state of Nirvana entails an escape from the wheel of Samsara, where they no longer become subjected to death and reincarnation. Your soul has achieved complete liberation from the cycle of death and rebirth. Indeed, with your mind and soul free of such constraints, your spirit has become truly immortal. No harm nor death will come to your spirit from anything that befalls it, nor shall the same be done to your mind. Your will is likewise unbreakable, and can endure any adversity. This same transcendent state also marks any prison you are trapped in moot, for you can instantly escape their confines. Your body is granted no such protection, however, and this by itself will not prevent the death of the body."
2048,,1000,Holding up Heaven,Chinese Mythology,Benevolence,"The primordial human Pangu was a being of immense strength. After separating the metaphysical forces of Yin and Yang, he kept them apart by holding Heaven aloft and the Earth down for 18 000 years. You have a measure of the same strength as him, able to hold up Heaven itself. Your strength extends well into the supernatural, able to resist and push back against metaphysical forces and concepts through pure physical might."
2049,,1000,Born of Fate,Scion ,Benevolence,"...you’ve got to be joking. Even by the standards set by myth and legend, this makes the likes of Diomedes and Indrajit look downright mundane. To put it mildly, not only do you have a great knack for taking on insurmountable odds and coming out on top, but virtually all your Fatebound relationships have nothing but positive outcomes for you in the long run and the few negative results are absurdly mild by the standards of myth. With this, a gaggle of misfit and newly minted Scions could blunder straight through the plans of far more experienced Scions and the machinations of a trickster god-and take them to the giddy heights of mastered apotheosis that some Scions have failed to achieve over many millennia. It’s almost as though the mortal concept of a hero is steering Fate to smile down on you harder than it has on nearly every hero of the past.

Make no mistake, your plot arm-ahem, Legend makes you no more formidable to the enemies of the gods on its own, but somehow their best laid plans seem to sunder before your interference and even when driven into retreat you frequently find new, grateful allies pledging their support with a modicum of assistance or discover that greater powers like your divine parents have coordinated to defeat your enemies for you. Insurmountable hurdles are made uncertain by your involvement, such that a giant who theoretically is your better in absolutely every relevant Purview and attribute could be made a fool of by the cheating terms of his contest with you. And when you succeed in Legend-worthy feats, the rewards are proportionately grand to their achievement. Even in times of peace, the world- shaking thunder of your Legend levies few consequences greater than having less time to spend with your old comrades or feeling a little patronised by your pantheon rather than, say-the insanity and agonising death that Hercules had to endure before his ascent to Olympus. This bizarrely unfair narrative momentum is intrinsic to your Legend, to the extent that while it won’t be easy, or clear-cut, or certain by any measure there is a CHANCE that at the pinnacle of apotheosis, you could somehow bring about an end to the Titanomachy at great effort and with the support of the other pantheons. Or at least bind enough of the Titans to make victory a long shot for the remaining escapees. If this carries on, expect your divine family to be split between joking about you having discovered the Purview of Providence or seething in envy-only to find the winds of fortune preemptively turn against them."
2050,,1000,Touched by Life,RWBY: Age of the Gods,Benevolence,"You were thrown into the crystal clear waters of the God of Light’s domain. The energy of life now courses through you and you possess the same curse that plagued Salem. Though if you want to purchase this I assume this is not something you mind, seeing only the benefits. You are immortal. You will no longer age and any damage taken by you will eventually regenerate, at most taking a few hours to come back from the most severe of wounds. You could take complete obliteration with raw kinetic energy collected over lifetimes and even be the sole survivor of a wave that wiped out all life on the Planet you’re on. There is simply no killing you... as of now it’s a mystery if there is even something in this World capable of putting an end to you, even Jinn stating you can’t be destroyed when asked. But in essence ‘so long as this world turns, you shall walk its face’. In future Jumps you may select one Planetary body. Killing you will only be possible by destroying said planetary body."
2051,,1000,Barbadium Body,The God of High School,Benevolence,"Your body is no longer of flesh and blood. Instead, it is entirely composed of Barbadium, a supernatural metal from the other Realms that surpasses anything else in existence. Every single bit of your body, from your skin to your eyes to your hair is now composed of Barbadium, somehow retaining all the comforts of living whilst enhancing your durability to awe-inspiring heights. Even the Monkey King with his Yeoui, a man who could destroy whole planets with his magical staff, could barely open up more than a tiny gap in the skin of one with a body formed of this metal. Beware though, as the innards of your body, though still formed of Barbadium, and are slightly less durable than your outer shell.

Boosted: Your original form, made from Barbadium, was in truth a crude thing. The Barbadium was just shaped into your body and then your soul was poured in. The metal was not prepared or enhanced beyond that. That was changed. Now your Barbadium body has gone through the full, proper forging processes. Heated, folded, concentrated, mixed with other supernaturally tough materials to make something truly special. While the material itself has become significantly tougher, a blow that might have pierced your skin entirely will only give you a bad bruise now, it's’ supernatural enhancements are what make it truly special. The Barbadium will become more concentrated as your supernatural energies grow, life energy and otherwise, retaining its immense durability no matter how far you grow. It will remain far tougher than you so long as your energies continue to increase. Given your newfound power, at least in your transformed state, it's likely that there are less than a dozen beings in this world that can hope to harm you even with repeated blows, most of which have not even reached that level of power yet.

2052,,1000,Salems Curse ,RWBY,Benevolence,"And on the other hand there is the Immortal Witch. The one in eternal opposition to all life. Salem was cursed with Immortality after trying to trick the Gods into giving her back her husband. The same kind of Immortality is now yours. You will no longer age and any damage taken by you will eventually regenerate, at most taking a few hours to come back from the most severe of wounds. You could take complete obliteration with raw kinetic energy collected over lifetimes and even be the sole survivor of a wave that wiped out all life on the Planet you’re on. There is simply no killing you... as of now it’s a mystery if there is even something in this World capable of putting an end to you, even Jinn stating you can’t be destroyed when asked. But in essence ‘so long as this world turns, you shall walk its face’. In future Jumps you may select one Planetary body. Killing you will only be possible by destroying said planetary body.

...Are you sure you want this? I have to warn you the two immortals that are currently on Remnant really don’t enjoy having it."
2053,,1000,Juggernaut,World War Hulk,Benevolence,"You have become an unstoppable force and everyone better get out of your way. Imbued with the power of Cyttorak your speed, strength, and durability have increased to allow you to match the Green Scar and has the capability to further grow, you also lose the need for both sleep and sustenance enabling you to fight forever. You also possess a powerful forcefield that renders you immune to physical attacks and if somehow broken will regenerate in time. And if by some measure of luck your opponent wounds you then you’ll heal nigh-instantly. Your mental defenses have been bolstered by a huge margin to the point that even Omega-level telepaths will have difficulty reading your mind. However, your greatest ability is that you cannot be stopped once you start moving and any fool who tries will find themselves crushed by your might. Let no one stop you Jumper."
2054,,1000,Death Itself ,Ragna Crimson,Benevolence,"The power of The Severing Dragon, which allows the user to manipulate Causality itself. By reversing cause and effect, any attacks dealt on the user may be redirected into the attack. If the user were to be cut, the attacker would be instead cut by the user.

The only weakness of this ability is that the user needs to be able to perceive the attack in order for the inversion to take place, albeit if it is an attack that falls under what the user would perceive, it is instantly reversed whether it is intended as a surprise attack or not. Only an attack faster than the user’s senses can penetrate this defense."
2055,,1000,Dragon’s Heritage,Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,Benevolence,"Although, the immortality does come at a cost. In order to facilitate your immortality, you passively draw life energy from others, keeping you at your prime and instantly heal any wound that would be inflicted upon you. This only happens in small amounts so the signs of missing life energy, known as dragonrot, will only show during old age. A single fatal wound will be healed instantly. You can also restore your resurrective energy by killing other living beings. The stronger the living being’s life force, the more resurrective energy is extracted. Resurrective energy is automatically restored by resting for the day. But if you happen to receive a second fatal wound or lose a limb or an organ before you can restore your resurrective energy? You must draw in large amounts of life energy all those around you in the range of a large city, thus it will share the burden with all living things, but it will still draw strongly from those who are nearby, quickly inflicting the rot. You can even share this blood with others, giving them a mark of stagnation, which appears to turn a part of their skin ashen-colored and turn a streak of their hair grey. But now, they are immortal much like you, while they can’t heal instantly like you, they can instantly heal a fatal wound using their own life force, but should they die once more after, they will draw upon the life force around them much like you and spread the dragonrot.

Cannot be Taken with The Rejuvenating Waters "
2056,,1000,Synchronicity Wave Travelling ,DC Occult,Benevolence,"You have a rare and dangerous talent. An ability possessed only by a select few of the Constantine bloodline. Synchronicity, in magic, is the belief that the universe is guiding you. For one such as you, the reverse is true. The Synchronicity Wave is your plaything and you may use it to instead guide the universe. To your whims, fate and chance bend. Coincidences pile up to make even your shallowest of plans succeed even as the complex and masterful plans of your enemies fall to pieces around them.

You have preternaturally good luck, bullets fly around you, people trip and fall on their own swords, and the cosmic dice are weighted in your favor. Fate cannot touch you as you make your own way, but the very same Fate will bend to make your plans come to fruition, even as it guides your hand into the heart of your enemies.

When you actively ride the Wave -- which requires only that you focus and will yourself to do so -- these effects are amplified drastically. You can stand against beings of immense power and watch as it almost seems as though a writer changes the story to allow you much greater odds of coming out on top. Facing down the ultimate embodiment of evil would spell doom for most any man, but your chances of pulling the wool over the devil’s eyes and walking away with the last laugh are much higher than they would be for just any common schmuck, even if you were just an otherwise common schmuck – but we both know you’re already much more than that, don’t we?

Although, you should be aware that while this greatly shifts the odds in your favor, it does not guarantee victory, nor does it allow you to win in a truly impossible situation. Don’t get too cocky.

Even above this, once your chain is over you will gain mystical significance as ""The Laughing Magician"", who thumbs his nose at the gods of man's own creation and upsets the balance of all, the greatest trickster, who spits in the face of God and the Devil alike. By using that title, you will be able to gain near godlike power, controlling fate, magic, and even bending the fabric of reality.

2057,,1000,Hourai Elixir ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Benevolence,"One dose, three sips, of Hourai elixir per-jump or every ten years, whichever one comes first. You may drink it yourself or give it to others. The first sip prevents you from aging, the second sip makes you immune to illness, and the third makes you deathless. Your soul is preserved for eternity at the moment of the third sip, and no ordinary force is capable of affecting it. Even abilities to kill anything simply slide off you, as the wielder finds they can neither target you nor cause you to die. Your body is like a temporary vessel for your soul; if it is harmed or destroyed utterly your soul shall simply instantly regenerate a new one. Your body does not lose any sensation though, and you may find being repeatedly killed and returned to be extremely painful for you. The elixir lingers on in the liver of the person who drank it, should their raw liver be taken and eaten it will render the eater deathless too though the original person does not lose their immortality either.

As the elixir was made in part through Kaguya’s manipulation of eternity, nothing short of powers that can affect eternity itself can affect the deathless nature of one who has taken the Hourai Elixir. This is not complete and total immortality. Be additionally warned that while it renders you nigh-unkillable it offers no inherent protection against other creative ways to remove you permanently, such as sealing you away permanently, which does exist here and has been used before to lock Hourai immortals away for centuries. Sentencing you to a far, far worse than death where you are unable to die is entirely within the realm of possibility. Nor does it make your body inherently more durable than before beyond being immune to illness; if you are a fragile human you will remain so.
