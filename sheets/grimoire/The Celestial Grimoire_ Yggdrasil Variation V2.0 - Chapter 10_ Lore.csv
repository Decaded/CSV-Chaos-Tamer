1,,Free,Character Sheet,Baldur's Gate 3,Lore,"You get a multiple page journal that is in the format of D&D 5e character sheets that is in any style of design you want. This sheet is magical, and it displays all your stats, skills, abilities and your personal information in an easy-to-read manner. It updates with any new powers you gain over the courses of your adventure, and it even records your significant deeds. Only people you get permission can access this character sheet."
2,,Free,Combat Basics,Anima Ark Of Sinners,Lore,"As the city is filled with hostile shadows it would be no good for you to be unable to defend yourself. This grants an expert level of skill in a weapon type of your choice such as swords, spears, bows, etc... along with skill at unarmed combat. You are good enough to handle the mid bosses around here."
3,,Free,All communication,Final Fantasy XVI,Lore,"Isn’t it odd that regardless of where you go in this world everyone seems to be speaking the same language ? Well with this perk you get to benefit from that in both this jump and future jumps. From now on, you will be fully fluent in all of a setting’s language and capable of communicating with anyone regardless of nationality."
4,,Free,Fighting basics ,Final Fantasy XVI,Lore,"Valishtea is a very dangerous place with anything from soldiers,monsters and rampaging behemoths prowling the Land. As such, you have been granted proficiency in a weapon type of your choice such as swords, spears, daggers, the cannons used by some imperial soldiers, unarmed combat etc.. as well as physical conditioning fit for military service. This also makes you grow stronger from battle and slightly increases your rate of growth in areas related to combat. The abilities that you gain can indeed correspond to a past final fantasy job such as monk, dark knight, dragoon etc..."
5,,Free,Soft Echo,Final Fantasy XIV,Lore,"The blessing of the mother crystal, the power of the echo shows up from time to time in different individuals all over Hydaelyn. Many see this as a “gift”, as the powers of the Echo are very distinctive even in a world with such vibrant magic. However, there are those who view the bearers of the Echo as abominations. The Garlean Empire is an example of one such society where the Echo is not tolerated.

In this initial state, should you choose to take it, the Echo’s strength will allow you to understand the basic fundamentals of foreign languages, and with time, you’ll be able to pick up those languages faster as well. As a side effect of bearing the Echo, you grow more resistant to the effects of Tempering and similar mind control."
6,,Free,Language Comprehension ,Mushoku Tensei ~ Jobless Reincarnation ~,Lore,"The Six-Faced World has many languages and going from one continent to another without learning the language there would make you unable to communicate with other people. This grants you an ability to understand, speak and read any language that you heard people speak and seen its words in hours. When speaking to someone with a different language that you didn’t learn, you can instinctively guess the general meaning of their words and slowly piece them together to form words allowing you to speak the said language down to their accent with enough time. Seeing written words of an unknown language constant exposure or trying would allow you to slowly piece it together allowing you to read the written words with enough time. This also allows you to invent your language or decryption to prevent others from knowing your secrets that you wrote in books that you don’t want others to find out about."
7,,Free,Primarch Mentality,Horus Heresy: The Primarchs,Lore,"Your mind is every bit as honed as your body. Your towering intellect would be considered genius among the greatest of men, though naturally inferior to the Emperor Himself. At the least, you have perfect eidetic memory (though there are ways to make you forget) and can memorise vast quantities of information far faster than any living human has or ever will. Furthermore, all Primarchs seem remarkably resistant to Chaos corruption and possession; short of directly clutching a Daemon weapon, being wounded by a specific weapon meant to corrupt you personally, or willingly letting the power of Chaos into you, you do not fear the gradual insanity and corruption into darkness lesser men might face. A Primarch naturally has the kind of towering willpower to resist Chaos in general, even the Ruinous Powers must put some serious effort and elaborate plans into luring one over to their side. "
8,,Free,General Class Potential,Akame ga Kill!,Lore,"Without considering your choices below, you’ll usually start as strong as the average captain, as well as already having a similar level of skill with one weapon type in particular. However, despite your initial strength, you also possess a deep well of untapped potential, enough to allow you to reach the level of physical and spiritual ability needed to become one of the generals of the Empire as long as you put in the necessary effort in training and fulfilling your potential, as well as gaining enough experience to fight at their level. Of course, while this perk alone does not grant you the potential on par with the most powerful people in this world, such as the likes of Esdeath and the Great General for example, it can still bring you to a level of power where they can't instantly and effortlessly kill you."
9,,Free,Contemplate Eternity,Marvel: Age of Krakoa,Lore,"Eternals and Sentinels don’t age. Mutants and Post-Humans are effectively immortal due to their access to easy resurrection, and humans and Deviants sometimes stumble into eternal youth due to mutation. Even without considering your potential as a Jumper, coming to this world gives you the capacity to live for a long, long time. Given what happened with the Eternal Sprite a few years ago, it’s a bit prudent to give you some immortality insurance: First, you gain perfect, fully retroactive memory with total recall, perfect indexing, protection from harmful memories or external tampering, and the ability to repress and restore unwanted memories at will. When memory is repressed it has no effect on your conscious mind but any important effects on your subconscious that influence your identity are retained. You always remember that you repressed a memory and why you repressed it. Additionally, you are immune to ennui. No matter how many times you experience something it will never become stale and you will never become too jaded, too traumatized, too experienced, too powerful, or simply too old to relate to others. Conversely, you will never go insane or suffer degradation of mental or social faculties or other negative effects from prolonged isolation and do not suffer from loneliness. Finally, you have the patience to last an eternity and complete immunity to boredom and demotivation."
10,,Free,Cuh-Ray-Zee!,Devil May Cry,Lore,"The moment you step into the world of Devil May Cry, you, and anyone you brought with you, will have the innate potential to do incredibly amazing stuff all day long, pal. However, it will take great skill and effort to pull off anything like blocking attacks with the back of your hand, or playing an air guitar that actually produces audible sound for others to hear. But never fear, if you train hard enough, and git gud enough, you too will be able to deflect bullets with other bullets, destroy buildings by spouting out innuendos, and become a worthy disciple of my ways. And yes, you totally get to see your rank whenever you're doing anything."
11,,Free,Scholar,Final Fantasy XI,Lore,"During the Crystal War, these military tacticians often served as high-ranking officers in allied forces across Vana'diel. Extensive knowledge of ancient martial theory granted Scholars the ability to wield dual schools of magic, between which they would alternate depending on the situation at hand."
12,,Free,Common tongue,The Song of the Nibelungs,Lore,"Wherever you are in Europe or the world at large and wherever you travel you will have no problem speaking with the locals. This may be because all of you speak an unidentified lingua franca, a common language, or because you instinctively know all the different languages spoken around the continent by heart. In future worlds you may be able to understand and speak most common languages you may come in contact with."
13,,Free,Divinity,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Lore,"It was the light of Flame that drew those hollow beings in, giving them the opportunity to become something great enough to challenge the everlasting. Your soul was bound to light, marking you as one of the gods who follow the Great Lord Gwyn. Not only is your form as captivating as light itself is, rarely muddied or marred, but your mind has been illuminated, allowing you to learn and master whatever skill you desire faster than most."
14,,Free,Words of Magic,Marvel Midnight Suns,Lore,"Magic is the catch all term for energies that specific people can manipulate. This is usually done through spells and phrases that have mystical meaning. Now as a child of Lilith who can be conferred was a powerful witch before being corrupted you can use magic. There is a wide range of spells but you don’t have the expertise and specialty of other users like Doctor Strange or Magik.

Magic users have a niche of abilities and yours through this perk is Witchcraft. Witchcraft is heavily connected to the energies of the earth and usually comes from the goddess of Witchcraft but yours is fate-backed."
15,,Free,Magic        ,Dr Strange Multiverse of Madness,Lore,Given how important Dr. Strange and the other practitioners of the mystical arts are here it would be a shame if you couldn’t learn magic. This perk will grant you an average affinity with the various types of magic used here and skill equal to the average member of Kamar-Taj.
16,,Free,The Basics,Generic Alchemist ,Lore,"You have the minimum knowledge to be considered an alchemist. You know how to perform the seven alchemical processes (Calcination, Dissolution, Separation, Conjunction, Fermentation, Distillation, and Coagulation), what the five elements are (Air, Earth, Fire, Water, and Aether), and you know the three reagents (Mercury, Sulfur, and Salt). You also know the interplay of Mind, Spirit, and Body."
17,,Free,Beginner's spellbooks,Generic Dungeon Crawler,Lore,You receive a satchel of books that hold the simplest spells for each of the three spellcasting classes. They are very straightforward in application and offer little outside combat applications. 
18,,Free,Eureka Moment,Bloodborne,Lore,"“It seems to occur so often, a sudden breakthrough that comes from agonizing work and failure. It’s never quite the way you expect, just a dawning realization, a new way of looking things. For some, it comes much too late, hopefully that’s not the case for you. 

As you work on perfecting some new scientific procedure, replicating a phenomenon from the world around you, or discover some hidden truth, signs seem to crop up around you. These signs can come in any form, but always inspire sudden awareness or point you in the right direction to hasten progress.”"
19,,Free,Basic Deck ,MtG - Shandalar,Lore,"All mages start with the basics, no matter how... lacking in spectacle they might be. You receive a collection of moderately useful spells suitable for your magical specialization and purchases in this jump. Including a variety of summoned creatures, enchantments, sorceries and other such temporary effects, as well as a number of mana bonds to lands rich in mana, it’s everything you need to get started and sufficient to have at least a beginner’s chance in any mage-duels you might find yourself in. That said, you may wish to look for better spells and other improvements, as this collection on its own won’t be enough to excel."
20,,Free,IS MAITH SIN! ,Wolfwalkers,Lore,"You are fluent in Irish Gaelige, and in future Jumps in all languages present in the setting. It’s flippin’ great."
21,,Free,Fairy Fluent ,Peter Pan,Lore,"You can naturally understand the tinkling, bell-like language of fairies, and also know how to teach people to understand the language. It is the most wonderful of tongues, sounding like the sweetest, most innocent bells whether you are professing love and rudely insulting somebody. However, unless you are a Fairy, you cannot speak it in turn, unless you pay 100 CP extra.
"
22,,Free,Elementary Thaumaturgy,Lord El-Melloi Case Files,Lore,"You know the most basic levels of magecraft. You can
use the most basic forms of Structural Analysis, Gradation Air, Reinforcement, and
Alteration. You have the beginnings of an understanding of the laws of magic in general,
but don’t expect to outclass anyone but Shirou Emiya. Some of the more haughty mages
will resent referring to you as a mage at all."
23,,Free,Family Research,Lord El-Melloi Case Files,Lore,"Every magus lineage has some focus, some subject they’re
studying, such as the biology of a specific Phantasmal Species, mystical archeology, the
human genome, the interaction between Paracalus’s alchemy and the Periodic Table,
astronomy, or the inner workings of Mystic Eyes. Whether you inherited it or stole it, you may pick one such focus here, and gain a vast well of knowledge pertaining to it -
enough to rival an accredited doctor if there is such a thing. At base there is little
mystical benefit to this knowledge, but as your magical skills improve it will grant you
access to numerous mysteries that are either unusually powerful or extremely difficult to
replicate using modern thaumaturgy. Some of those shall be the fruit of your family’s
research, some will be the tools necessary to continue it. It’s nowhere near enough to
reach the Root, but maybe someday, if you keep at it. Additionally, some Thaumaturgic
Attribute - probably one that resonates with your family research - has been passed
down your bloodline, like any magus lineage, which adds “meaning” to elemental
magecraft, making it many times more effective and versatile, and may even open up
otherwise-impossible options, though you cannot claim the most impressive canonical
examples such as Tradition Carriers and Wish-granting with this perk alone. Like
elements, these can be changed, but never casually. Known attributes include swords,
sisters, opening wounds, the flow and transfer of power, and absorption, so you can pick
just about anything you can imagine. Just remember that having “almighty” as your
Sorcery Trait won’t actually make you almighty, though the Queen of the Clocktower
might have something to say on the subject."
24,,Free,Mark of Tzeentch ,Warhammer Fantasy: Warriors of Chaos,Lore,"Either on your body or permanently upon your soul, Tzeentch leaves a mark of his claim on your service. The Mark of Tzeentch causes your intellect to swell massively, and you’ll find that even the most difficult mental tasks are child’s play to you. You can easily translate languages that are completely new to you with even a small amount of information on the language itself, and information that would threaten the sanity of a stern mind is easily accepted by you as a simple truth, nothing more. Lastly, you have the basic capacity to utilize the Winds of Magic, and you are a decent sorcerer currently.
"
25,,Free,The Learner​ ,Persona 4,Lore,"Well, as you're certainly the newcomer here in this world, you've got a lot to learn. You learn new things 10 times as fast until you reach what would be considered an average level of proficiency. You also get a flat ×2 multiplier to any form of learning or training that you do. You can also learn innate traits of other beings, although it will be harder to do so than normal."
26,,Free,That Who Records​ ,Persona 4,Lore,"You now have the ability to summon your own compendium at will. As long as you are helping someone grow, you can record a copy of any of their powers at will. You may only use these when you are directly fighting against them in order to test them or help them grow (unless you have Wielder of Power), but these can be used to restore their power if they ever lose it or it lessens below the level you have recorded. This applies for any powers they may have, including physical abilities, skills, and supernatural powers like personas. Furthermore, as long as you have one example of a specific skill in your compendium, you or anyone you are helping will learn that skill at ten times the normal rate until you reach the level your recorded power is at."
27,,25,An Affinity with Royal Blood,Final Fantasy XV Kingsglaive,Lore,"It’s a well-known fact that the Kingsglaive were specifically chosen due to their affinity with the Crystal and their ability to handle the strains of utilizing magic. But even amongst the Glaives, there are some who are more adept at the craft than others. With each time this modification is taken, your own magical prowess is improved – for every skill in your repertoire, not just that which was granted to you by the King.

28,,50,Black Book,Anima Beyond Fantasy,Lore,"A simple tome of the arcane, written within it are notes upon notes, enough that, with work, you could learn the basic spells of whichever path you wish, or a weak summon from each of the elements. Unfortunately, it possesses no inherent power; this is no grimoire."
29,,50,Chronicle of a Hero,Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous,Lore,"Each night, you hear a calm voice in your head, speaking of your struggles and adventures for the day. It’s unknown to whom they speak but they attempt to recite your journey as an epic story, a tale mythic in scope. Each morning, you awake to find a well drawn sketch of an event from the previous day, seemingly by the hand of the narrator. This narrator might, some even say by default, be a version of Areelu Vorlesh herself, architect of the worldwound. Or maybe it’s someone else from the world of Golarion. Even one of the Gods might be your personal storyteller each night."
30,,50,Slightly Meta​ ,Generic Exalted,Lore,"At any time you can call up a purely mental ‘statistics sheet’ that will faithfully represent your various attributes, abilities, specialties, charms known, sorcery or necromancy known, and so forth. Almost as if you were looking at an Exalted character sheet of yourself. Translates out of jump abilities, perks, and such as well, though it’s not quite as precise about it, to allow you to keep an accurate and objective running tally of your progress. As a side benefit you will never be lost when people start using metaphor or meta-references. You will always understand what they are talking about when they say ‘we need to go deeper’. This doesn’t give you fourth wall awareness of course, but you’ll know when that crazy guy is actually crazy or just using meta-speak."
31,,50,Hah,The Elder Scrolls: Dovah,Lore,"Mind. For creatures as long-lived as the dragons, sometimes the days and decades start to meld into each over, the fog of ages seeping in. Not so for you, you whose mind is clear as a crystal lake. Your memory is perfect, able to recall events millennia ago with such clarity that it may as well have happened five minutes ago."
32,,50,Heroic Histories,Fate/Stay Night,Lore,"You received a small but thick book, detailing the true history of either your chosen Servant or one of the many other Heroic Spirits that exist in this universe. It will tell every story, myth, tale and legends that is true about your chosen character, in an entertaining and easy to digest manner. It holds no knowledge of magical secrets or advantages and is simply a surprisingly knowledgeable story book. Perhaps you could embarrass your new friend with some of the less flattering tales about them. "
33,,50,An Ancient Language Dictionary,Inheritance Cycle,Lore,"At the beginning, the endless pages of this book are empty but as you learn more of the Ancient Language, it will fill up with the knowledge of that word including proper grammar and such. Post-Jump, this book will act as a true Dictionary and Encyclopedia that fills itself as your adventures continue on. The book itself will always open directly to the page you desire to read, and is never larger than an ordinary dictionary."

44,,50,The Jumper Files,The Dresden Files,Lore,"It's a box of empty file folders. Didn't see that one coming, did you? Of course, that's not how it's going to stay forever. Any time you do something majorly noteworthy, one of these folders will start to fill itself in, generally with pages written in your own hand but sometimes scraps, photographs, and other interesting things. It's nothing you couldn't have filled in yourself, but when it's done, it'll be a complete record of your cases, start to finish.

The relationship of teacher and pupil is an old one in the Great Swamp, but not all can teach. For people who have the desire to follow the lead of their predecessors, there's this tome."

With each purchase here you may collect a small shelf’s worth of notable mystic tomes from this land, your choice of those concerning incantations and those detailing the principles of sorcery. It may still take a learned cleric to fully elucidate the lightning incantations from that ancient dragon prayerbook or a skilled sorcerer to teach you the spells stored on a scroll written by the Carian royal family, but the knowledge here still represents an extremely valuable commodity given how far civilisation has fallen in the Lands Between.

Instead of needing to take it off the bodies of the fallen or hunt through treacherous dungeons for it, you now own a sizeable collection of such knowledge-enough to fully stock a small shelf.

48,,50,Knowledgeable ,MtG - Shandalar,Lore,"The number of spells known in the multiverse is beyond count, and new ones are discovered (or recovered) on a daily basis. But finding the more rare or powerful effects can be difficult - many mages guard their mightiest magics with fevered dedication, and long-lost arcane lore is often only found at the bottom of dangerous magical ruins and tombs. But that doesn’t mean such knowledge is entirely unavailable. With each purchase of this Perk, you may gain mastery of a single spell seen in the Shandalar game, from the most common sorcery to the most rare arcane ritual. You can initially memorize and prepare a single copy of this spell, and do not need to use talismans, runes, or other such methods to re-memorize it, being able to do so through sheer mental ability. You are not forced to keep it memorized, nor are you forbidden from expanding the number of times you can do so with whatever methods you have available to you."

It’s a well-written guide on how a human may best convince weak to moderately powerful Demons on their side even if they’re not too strong themselves, or how a Demon might easily trick otherwise paranoid and wary humans to do their bidding.

While there’s little potential in you now for the blasting magics an adventurer might wield, you have great things ahead in the field of rituals and more in depth workings of magic. Things that take a great deal more time and preparation than a pouch of components and a word of power. But such rituals are the key to enacting longer term and wider reaching changes in the world. Perhaps even on yourself."
61,,100,Worlds Unlimited,The Free Universe,Lore,"The gates of the universe are open in this era are open - if you can’t be flexible and adjust to the kaleidoscope of vistas, it’s going to be hard to get anything done further than your slice of the cosmos. That’d be a waste of potential, so you’ve learned how to adapt to entirely new locales, even new dimensions and worlds. This is both how to survive as well as how to adventure there! While you might not become fireproof in a realm of heat and flames, you’ll know the local tricks to surviving the infernos as well as how to converse and make peace with the ones who do live there!"
62,,100,Wordsmith,The Silmarillion,Lore,"It was Rúmil of the Noldor who first devised the skill of writing, and Fëanor who further created the system of Tengwar runes. You share this affinity for language and wordcraft, able both to quickly learn new languages and writing-systems, even when you share no language with the ones from which you are learning, and to devise your own languages and cunning scripts. Perhaps you might do so for the sake of keeping your messages secret, to describe things for which existing languages have no terms or simply for the joy of creation. Whatever the case, you have a talent for languages and writing - learning them, creating them, or weaving clever words - that cannot be denied. This perk even applies to magical languages, and although by itself it won’t allow you to create new magical languages, it might allow you to cleverly make use of existing ones."
63,,100,Path of The Gods,Kane Chronicles,Lore,Pick an Egyptian god. You are connected to your chosen deity and are able to learn the magic they are connected to easier than others.
64,,100,Book of Spirits,Castlevania - Order of Ecclesia,Lore,"A book that seems to be almost as old as the legend of Dracula himself and rumored to have been written by fairies, this tome is... empty? How strange. But, when you fight against creatures of darkness, you’ll quickly discover that the book seems to magically record any information you gather. Perhaps that’s where it gained the name Faery’s Journal from? On top of this collection of knowledge, you’ll also find that reading it even once makes it incredibly difficult to forget, with basic information about the foes in front of you simply springing into your mind as though the spirits were reading it out to you. More detailed explanations would require both research on your part to test the limits of your foes and study of the books recordings, but that I leave up to you."
65,,100,Warriors Instincts,Castlevania - Order of Ecclesia,Lore,"Though Ecclesia is a scholar’s organization, they are still dedicated to the destruction of Lord Dracula. As such, none within their ranks lack at least a minimal level of fighting prowess. Though you are no expert in this field, you possess a passing familiarity with many weapons, from broadswords and rapiers to spear and the bow. Not enough to dominate a fight, but enough to not embarrass or hurt yourself. If you like, you can trade in your knowledge of all but one of these blunt instruments to hone your mind even further, granting you a set of simple but robust magical spells to use in combat as well as a number of lesser but useful techniques. The elements of fire, water, wind, and lightning may not leap at your call, but they will certainly answer you if you so wish."
66,,100,Book of Spells ,Disney’s American Dragon: Jake Long,Lore,This book is full of information on just how to use your magic to the fullest. No need to fumble around like a newbie when you are clearly a powerful Dark Wizard or Witch. You just need to read up a bit to get past the Beginners section.
67,,100,Dragon Training Book,Disney’s American Dragon: Jake Long,Lore,This is a book of all the known abilities of Dragons as well as Lesser Known ones. This includes tips for how to train your abilities. This is very helpful if you do not have a teacher.
68,,100,Game Books ,Vampire: The Masquerade,Lore,"Black Dog Game Factory is a controversial RPG developer, responsible for such game as Zombie: The Putrescence and Lycanthrope: The Rapture, the books of which are secretly possessed by evil spirits that corrupt those who read them. These books seem to be some off brand knockoff called Vampire: The Masquerade. You have a full collection of them, and they fully describe not only the workings of the Kindred but biographical information about many of them. You could use these books to play a game about your own life, or you could use the terrible secrets inside to blackmail many prominent figures. Or just hand the Gehenna sourcebook to a local Malkavian and dare her to read it out loud in Elysium."
69,,100,Game Books,Mage: The Ascension,Lore,"Black Dog Game Factory is a controversial RPG developer, responsible for such game as Zombie: The Putrescence and Lycanthrope: The Rapture, the books of which are secretly possessed by evil spirits that corrupt those who read them. These books seem to be some off brand knockoff called Mage: the Ascension. You have a full collection of them, and they contain deadly secrets about the inner workings of many Awakened factions. They also provide a full description of exactly how magick functions. Probably. Maybe. If you can make sense of the ever changing and contradictory list of rules and examples, there’s probably something useful about magick in there somewhere."
70,,100,A Collection of Journals,Cereza and the Stray Demon,Lore,"This pile of journals represents the notes and observations of various academics documenting different areas of knowledge about Avalon Forest. A biologist’s observations of the local fauna and flora. The Wisp Weekly, a set of missives about the hidden wisp village’s observations of events in the forest. Research logs somehow taken from Puca’s own private notes, or diary pages from fallen Umbran apprentices. And many more. A treasure trove of knowledge that could help you survive here.

After this jump, in future worlds you’ll acquire a similar collection of knowledge about other key places in your life."
71,,100,The Basics,The Owl House V1,Lore,"There are no shortage of fantasy stories focused on a school environment, this setting being no exception, since after a few episodes Hexside becomes an important location in which Luz spends a lot of time as a student. But getting to a new school without already knowing what you should know doesn't sound like a desirable situation to be put in, with that in mind, you might want to take this Perk. This gives you basic knowledge in all areas of knowledge in your current setting, being updated in every new jump, or every 10 years."
72,,100,Tomes of Furion,Warhammer Fantasy: Dark Elves,Lore,"Few tomes can withstand Dhar even in written form, it’s basic precepts smouldering to naught within decades of being inked with its sigils. This large shelf of books made of flayed orc-side and blessed with enchantments is an exception to the rule. You have a collection of such dark lore, warm to the touch even in the dead of winter and full of inscriptions that write and shift like living creatures, which can teach you much of Dhar and other mystic arts favoured by the Dark Elves which they do not care to keep in their minds alone for too long.

You also know the techniques used to make them, even if you are otherwise not particularly gifted in magic, allowing you to reproduce them-and even innovate a more humane binding material than orc hide in worlds where orcs aren’t as plentiful."
73,,100,A Journal Stained with Oil ,Final Fantasy Tactics,Lore,"A strange sight but this small book is filled with an incredible understanding and comprehension of the unusual devices and artifice that was used in the times long since gone. Whilst it has little use beyond this world in the way of reverse engineering technology the insights within are able to open the mind to a Job not usually seen among the people of Ivalice, the skillset of a sniper and explorer often called Machinist."
74,,100,The Gray Lion is Scared ,Final Fantasy Tactics,Lore,"You’ve been in war, or more depending on your previous actions, and may have collected few signs of your previous battles and experiences. You seem to age well, no matter what, and retain a certain level of skill no matter how many years you’ve put on in addition to wounds that were not significant to you, personally, show no scars and those that do only do so at your bidding and they tend to only accentuate your frame. However it is not this that makes you unique, it is the age in which you grew to find out these things. You start with an incredible amount of experience, where most would be neophytes at the sword you come with the skill of a person who lives and dies by the sword, and this extends to all of your worldly experiences allowing you to have a much more potent start than others in skills that you pick up making you seem to at least have proficiency in the skills beyond what would normally been given. If this is taken and has no real ‘past’ to lean on it is often taken for raw talent beyond that of even the most ingenious."
75,,100,Shonen Jumper,Jump Force,Lore,"You are not a normal combatant. You garner power from those around you, soaking it in and becoming an amalgam of the most powerful and/or useful techniques you can find! But when you're not just being a normal Jumper, this helps too. This Perk unlocks the ability to learn anything. Anything. All you need is the appropriate time to learn and train, and someone to teach you, and you can make use of their abilities. You could learn how to harness Chakra from Kakashi, then go next door and convince Sanji to teach you both his cooking and combat styles, and cap it off with a bit of ki exercise from Goku. Even abilities that should be locked behind specific bloodlines or unique and personal transformations can be taught, if the would-be teacher is willing. This won't make the learning easy, just possible. Time to make some powerful friends, Jumper."
76,,100,Asuran Compendium,Guild Wars 2,Lore,A large collection of scientific books regarding all the disciplines taught in the Colleges of Rata Sum.
77,,100,Echo of Memory,Guild Wars 2,Lore,"You can contemplate and review memories from people who had a large impact upon the world, learning their secrets, skills and histories. The more important and world-shaking the person, the easier it is to access."
78,,100,Skilled Hands ,Guild Wars 2,Lore,"Most races have something they focus on, that gives them a distinct advantage. Norns have their overwhelming physical strength, Charr have pack tactics, Asura are technological geniuses and Sylvari have a deep bond with nature. Humans, on the other hand, have none of these things, forcing them to innovate and adapt in order to simply stand among the other races. Your proficiency at any skill you train at will grow at five times the speed it otherwise would."
79,,100,Grimoire,Beast: The Primordial,Lore,"Contained within the pages of this book are a record of notable supernatural creatures and the things they've done. Think of it as a cross between a family tree and a local history book. While this information is not all that relevant outside your starting location, you find it surprisingly easy to write down anything you learn into this book, making it a breeze to keep up to date for even the crummiest writers as long as you're diligent. It will also update to include the supernatural history of whatever location you start at in future jumps, ensuring that you're never completely out of the loop. Not only is this an invaluable resource for any Heroes and hunters who may get a hold of it, but Beasts who incorporate a grimiore of the local hive into their Obcasus Rites will find them a bit easier to pull off."
80,,100,Alchemical Texts,Fullmetal Alchemist,Lore,"These books are a primer to the art and science of alchemy. Anyone, even a child could get a good foundation just through these books alone. They also seem to grow more complex, varied, and complicated as you grow more and more skilled and learned in the art. Your origin has a great many memories of reading these books to get started(assuming you’re an alchemist)."
81,,100,Seated,Bleach,Lore,"There are many paths to take within the Gotei. Divided into thirteen primary divisions, each with a unique focus or purpose as part of the organisation, they seek to make best use of every Shinigami’s unique talents. Whatever you were before, it appears to have prepared you quite well for one of these divisions or a similar group such as the Kido Corps or the Onmitsukido’s divisions. You have an existing skillset that makes you a desirable recruit for your chosen section. 

A member of the 12th Division may have a natural leaning for scientific learning and often gain small but useful sparks of innovation. They’ll have a basic understanding of the sciences used by the Shinigami and some talent to help improve further. Whereas the 11 th Division would find attractive a recruit with quite a bit of experience in brawling and zanjutsu, a short lifetime of street fights as well as a natural killer instinct preparing you well. Less orthodox choices are also possible. A skillset suitable for the 5th division may instead prepare you well for politics, an easy understanding of the games of nobles and statesmen making you a valuable addition. Or the Jailer squad of the Onmitsukido, who seek someone who has a mind suited for designing impressive prisons and wards. Whatever your choice, it will provide you with several skills suited to your destination and talent to aid their further improvement."
82,,100,Academic Foundation        ,Bleach,Lore,"Clever girl, aren’t you? It’s no real surprise you took the path of the scientist, with everything there is to discover. In one world alone, there are endless wonders, but in all three? Marvels are waiting to be made. A rookie still but not one without potential, you’ve got moderate experience in a wide range of scientific disciplines. Biology, physics, engineering and a particular education in spiritual theories unique to the afterlives. Reishi doesn’t always work like atoms do but you know the differences and even have a few lessons on how exactly you go about making use of them all. You’ve got an adept mind for science and it comes easier to you but there’s a long road ahead."
83,,100,The Hero’s Journal,A Mage Of Sorothustra,Lore,"This is a simple, handy enchanted item. This journal is bound to your soul and is perpetually scribbling down your journey from your perspective, with an occasional perspective shift to some omnipresent narrator who knows more than you do and occasionally dispenses some wisdom. If you read this journal and study it you will learn of new adventures you could go on, as well as, from time to time, gain a vital clue regarding where to go next."
84,,100,In Three Months Time,Dragon Ball Super,Lore,"With all these strong heroes opposing you, you need power of your own if you want a chance of your evil schemes going ahead unopposed. But power takes time to accumulate and you may not have all the time in the world, either from being a filthy mortal or from having some time sensitive plans in place. With this, you’ll at least know what the most efficient ways of gaining power will be. You always know exactly how long it will take you to reach a certain level of power or skill in something, such as how long it’d take for you to train your power level to surpass a certain opponent or how long it’d take for you to become a master in a certain skill. This only takes into account what you currently have available in terms of talent and abilities, so gaining new benefits may adjust the time to reach certain levels."
85,,100,Goddess’ Scriptures,Frieren - Beyond Journey's End,Lore,"You have a copy of the Goddess’ Scriptures. While these serve as a religious text, the words in here conceal a great power: the verses in this book are actually encoded spells that allow the caster to use a portion of the power of the Omnipotent Goddess. However, the vast majority of the book is yet still to be decoded by humanity, with some chapters still being entirely undecoded. They are also a focus item needed for most to cast the miracles of the Goddess."
86,,100,Grimoire Collection,Frieren - Beyond Journey's End,Lore,"You get a collection of several dozens of spellbooks that allow others to learn the magics contained in them with a bit of effort. This is mostly utility magic with very specific applications, such as magic for making your clothes clean instantly, or magic to make a flower bed bloom around you."
87,,100,Ancient Elvish,Frieren - Beyond Journey's End,Lore,"The vast majority of the grimoires in this world are written in ancient elvish, thus it makes sense for any aspiring mage to know the language. You are capable of reading and even speaking it fluently. In future worlds, you may choose an ancient language that is not innately magical or supernatural and know it at the same level."
88,,100,Past Lives​,Generic Exalted,Lore,"You've got memories of your past lives! This gives you tremendous insight into the workings of the First Age as well as an incredible leg up in regards to the development of charms (magic abilities), sorcery (magic spells), and the culture, language, and devices of the First Age. This could be really helpful for a starting Exalt. Purchasing this here makes your memories so clear it's as if they just happened. Normally this would be dangerous and you could risk getting lost in the memories or having the personality of your previous life interfere with your own. You're a Jumper though and this sort of thing is old hat to you, so unlike everyone else with Past Lives you are in no danger of such issues."
89,,100,Shin,Shin Megami Tensei V,Lore,"Knowledge... a gift many Demon would kill to regain. To reclaim their forms as TRUE Gods. However even small bits of knowledge not leading to great power can be important. You gain a basic understanding of any World you’re in. This doesn’t extend to full on omniscience, or let you know everyone’s motives and secrets, but the rules of Magic, the state of the World and any known threats are yours to have."
90,,100,Discourse Amaranthine,The Elder Scrolls - Online,Lore,"Well, the good news is, you now have a legendary tome of impossible lore, granted to you personally by Hermaus Mora, Daedric Prince of Forbidden Knowledge. Even better, it won't make tentacles grow out of your eyes or fill your mind with horrific visions, unlike most of his boons. Unfortunately, it's also completely illegible, even more so than a normal tome of Apocrypha. It's still a lovely conversation piece though, possibly useful in rituals. May cause headaches."
91,,100,Shalidor's Eidetic Memory,The Elder Scrolls - Online,Lore,"The favorite of students and scholars everywhere, this boon, bestowed on you by the spirit of Arch-Mage Shalidor himself, allows you to perfectly recall every text you've ever read with only a moment’s concentration. Covers textbooks, journals, bedtime stories, and even just old notes and scratch paper. Never spend more than a few hours studying again!"
92,,100,It's Not a Hate Crime if they're Already Dead ,The Elder Scrolls - Online,Lore,"As a result of the Planemeld, the Soulburst, the Llodos Plague, the Gravesinger Uprising, Faolchu's rebirth, the mass resurrections in the mass graves of the Bosmer and well... everything else, the Fighter's Guild is now closer to a monster hunting cabal than a mercenary guild, and it shows. As a new recruit, you receive specialized training in hunting and dispatching undead, Daedra, and werewolves of all kinds. While this isn't much beyond theoretical knowledge of combat with such enemies and a few footnotes of the prominent vampire and werewolf clans of your starting region, it's still far more than most outside the guild will ever know. Go forth and banish the wicked!"
93,,100,Clerical Work ,The Elder Scrolls - Online,Lore,"Consider this the polar opposite of the Sorcerer's Forbidden Knowledge perk. Rather than being an expert on dark forces and secret lore, you're a master priest, educated in the rites and rituals of almost every faith in Tamriel. You can list all the deeds of the Dunmer Saints, recite all eight volumes of the Song of Pelinal from memory, quote the Scroll of Praxis better than half the Kinlords and Ladies of Alinor, and even perform a traditional Argonian wedding ceremony if you had to. Aside from the minor benefits that blessings can bestow, assuming the receiver is pious enough, this is a great perk for smoothing over relations and avoiding cultural faux pas."
94,,100,Forbidden Knowledge ,The Elder Scrolls - Online,Lore,"Unlike the superstitious commoners and uneducated masses, you have a formal schooling in the obscure realms of mysticism and conjuration. For you, the reign of the Black Drake was not a time of terror, but a period of quiet enlightenment where you could finally work in peace. You can name the Seventeen Princes and all of their realms, outline the finer points of etiquette with Daedric entities, construct your various ritual sites in a professional, and quote the Art of War Magic and similar tomes from memory. You can also read and write in daedric script, which is important for crafting Rune Traps and enchanted scrolls."
95,,100,From Zero to Hero ,Greek Myth,Lore,"While this is called training this is a far more comprehensive education than merely skills for battle, although they are certainly included. You have received education from Chiron himself. This includes extensive education in all the things a man of noble status would be expected to know such as medicine, music, literature, mathematics, governing, hospitality, social skills, hunting, and prophecy. It also includes training that has honed your skill in battle to the levels of legendary heroes. You are highly skilled in effectively all contemporary weapons and have mastered one. You are also either already in or will be able to have a friendship between teacher and student with Chiron."
96,,100,Genius of the Art,Greek Myth,Lore,"You may be mortal but in some particular art or craft you are no one's lesser. In your particular form of art or craft you will be like Daedalus in his own. Amongst mortals you will at best be matched and will not be surpassed. Even the smiths who work Hephaestus forges would be forced to recognize your talent if you are a smith, or Apollo himself would be impressed by your voice as a singer, even if it does not surpass his own."
97,,100,[Cosmogony],Final Fantasy XV Kingsglaive,Lore,"A relatively small book that is introduced to children as a means to teach them the history of Eos, Cosmogony goes more in depth regarding the early relationship between the Astrals and man, though exactly how much of it is truth and how much is fiction remains unknown to this day. Of course, the shopkeeper wouldn’t be selling you a book that you can find from a bookstore. This book here is meant to serve as a guide for you, in the event that you happen to be wandering Eos...and get lost.

To begin with the book, like its basis, is filled with details regarding the Astral – and it can warn you to some degree if an Astral or one related to an Astral is near. The book likely comes in handy more so for one who is venturing outside of civilization’s boundaries however, as it can point out details regarding beasts and Daemons alike – everything from their peculiarities to their habits. The process of information collection is quick and doesn’t have any distinctive requirements. 

It’ll continue to function even as you travel away from Eos, though it’ll probably be a fair bit slower at acquiring information on foreign creatures and foreign locales. As the book was written to document history, collecting information about local history tends to be its strong suit."
98,,100,Rites of Initiation,Final Fantasy XV Kingsglaive,Lore,"Every Glaive has to go through basic training, and unlike the Crownsguard, the training they receive isn’t just a matter of physical drills or attaining weapons proficiency. Adapting to the gift of the King is a necessity if one wishes to survive as a Glaive, on top of the skills that a soldier should expect to have. A weapon, for a Glaive, can be anything from a firearm to magic, and as such each Glaive is expected to at least have a basic proficiency with each of these. The same goes for a wide variety of battlefield equipment not related to weapons, like vehicle handling and communication devices.

Fighting with the King’s gift can be unpredictable, but with enough practice you can control the chaos to some degree. There’s one particular trick in utilizing the King’s magic that involves the use of throwing weapons in order to manipulate the Crystal’s warping magic, and by the end of basic training, you’ll find that the speed, range and accuracy of your throws will improve to phenomenal levels. 

Once you’ve gotten the hang of warping, you’ll be relying on that throwing technique, so don’t let it get rusty."
99,,100,A certain Skill ,Persona 5 Royal,Lore,"No human is ever truly the same as another, never. The masses that give birth to the Gods and Demons of the Metaverse have all their unique skills. Be it Shogi, Gymnastics, Videogames, psychology or anything else. Choose one such skill a human being could have. You now become a Master at it, able to compete with the best of said skill. You can choose additional skills for another 100 CP.

Boosted: The skill you have mastered has a... unique application in the Metaverse. Makes sense doesn’t it? After all it is a World of the human mind. Depending on what skill you may have mastered this could be represented very differently. Being a Master at a shooting game might allow you to almost never miss a shot and gain unique Gun attacks. A Master at strategy games could find themselves a strategical Mastermind in the Metaverse, able to skilfully lead and strategize. After this Jump you can use these unique applications in the real world as well.

102,,100,Engrave,GrimGrimoire,Lore,"This manuscript expounds upon the alchemical methods that can be applied to the art of war. In contrast to previous alchemical practices, where the creation of lifelike entities was the goal, this work aims to imbue inorganic matter with supernatural properties and transform them into familiars to be used for the purpose of destruction.

Among the familiars, the gargoyle is a prevalent form of protective construct. Albeit motionless, its attacks are physical with an added explosion of flames that ravishes the targeted areas. The golem, on the other hand, though being humanoid shaped, is finicky in nature, difficult to direct, and its every action consumes a prodigious amount of magic. However, it does possess the longest range of all familiars and attack with destructive magic, making it akin to artillery on the battlefield.

103,,100,Gehenna,GrimGrimoire,Lore,"This grimoire of the dark abyss, Awaits the brave, the damned, the fierce, Teaches secrets of the sorcerer's race, From imps that summon spirits to plague a place.

The vermin of hell upon their call, Empower attacks beneath the fireball, Of demonic guardians, fierce and bold, Whose wrathful strike will make foes fold.

But the sorcerer's sight does not end there, For foul wisdom does its pages bare, Revealing secrets beyond the veil, To see the world through a darker tale.

So heed this tome with caution and care, Lest ye fall to the grasp of despair, For the power it holds is not for the weak, But for those who dare to delve in the bleak.

104,,100,Purgatory,GrimGrimoire,Lore,"Within this tome of ancient lore, The spirits of sinners doth adore. Dark power flows through ev'ry page, Strengthening the dead in their dark cage.

The Skullmage is a fearsome sight, Able to smite astrals with his might. With ghostly blessing or damning curse, He grants the gift of the immaterial verse.

Obelisks stand tall and proud, Alone the ghosts can join their crowd. With powers to heal and grant respite, They keep astral spirits in their sight.

105,,100,Wicca,GrimGrimoire,Lore,"The tome speaks of holy power, That nature wields in every hour. A mage can learn to harness this might, Through witchcraft and natural sight. 

Elves know the art of talisman, To guard the grimoire in their clan. With runes that glimmer in holy light, Protecting knowledge, dark as the night.

And then we have the Unicorns, With barriers strong, they sound the horns. To charge as one, with power untold, Their might and strength, a force of gold.

Against spirits, they defend with grace, Wielding holy light to protect their space. Summon their power, and you'll behold, The secrets they hide, in stories untold.

106,,100,Exorcist’s Bible,Generic Angels and Demons,Lore,"Regardless if you’re one of Heaven's followers, one of their enemies or even someone neutral in their conflict, you received a special bible, one that counts with God’s teachings mixed with instructions of how to lead with supernatural beings. Alternatively, if you aren’t of the religious type or just want to be more practical, this can be just a guide to the supernatural instead, without the bible part, if you prefer this way."
107,,100,Blessing of the Messenger,Generic Angels and Demons,Lore,"Angels are the messengers of the Lord and thus they’re blessed to better perform their duty. You’re no exception, as you’re able to understand and speak any language spoken by any being with human-like intelligence, as well as also granting that your words (in any language) won’t be misunderstood by anyone hearing them."

Whatever uses do you have for the remains of a dragon?"
109,,100,Mad Scholar,D.Y.N. Freaks,Lore,"The first step to becoming a magician is to know what you’re dealing with. Be it magic or monsters or the occult in general, you’ve become a learned master at dealing with most of it. While you do not know any specific spells with this, you do have a deep and broad knowledge on magical things, artefacts, monsters, locations and gods. You can identify the species and even weaknesses of all but the rarest monsters you might encounter, know the details of many types of magic you might find, the dangers of certain locations or the way to properly worship certain gods. While the extent of this lore is great, without a way to cast spells or enhance your power, you would likely be relegated to be just an advisor. This knowledge will update in future worlds to match the local varieties of monsters and so on."

This elevates your physical abilities to be roughly equal to an Advance-Rank Warrior or Peak Human without Battle Aura and you can maintain this peak form without further training and can only improve from there. Your mind has also improved, granting you an eidetic memory with perfect recall and indexing and you can also process a lot more information faster and seal away any undesirable memories. This also stops any of your physical, mental and magical energy and skills along with any other aspect of yourself from degrading or atrophying due to lack of use or time."

For 600 CP your range is several meters and you're restricted to one “category” of superhumans, such as copying biological powers or technological enhancements. You start only being able to copy the one, but with practice will eventually reach the point where you can hold an arbitrary number of powers at a time. However, you can only hold power while the person you copied it from is in range. For a separate additional 100 CP, you intuitively and instinctively know how to use your copied powers and can synchronize them together with each other and your own abilities, as well as helping those you are copying the powers of to synchronize amongst each other.

Learning's as easy as breathing for you now, and you can retain that information a lot easier than normal. You can walk into an Advanced Calculus classroom and then walk out with the professor whimpering on the floor ten minutes later. I'm pretty sure you'll be showing up other scientists in no time! But, uh, do try to go out more, alright? All that textbook reading isn't gonna do wonders for your eyesight."
123,,100,Striker(Martial Artist),The Destiny Universe,Lore,"It may be a stereotype, one you may or may not be very fond of, but the simple fact of the matter is: Above all else, you find it easier to channel your Light into raw physical strength, and there is a surprising number of problems in this universe that can be solved with a straight punch. In both respects, you outclass the vast majority of your fellow Titans - your strength is enough that you lift jumpships for light workouts, and your punching power is such that few mundane enemies in the solar system can survive you barreling down on them with a reared fist. For an extra 100 CP, you’ve found both the perfect balance between increasing paracausal and physical strength, as well as an adept skill in martial arts: The more you fight, and the more you exercise and maintain your body, the higher and faster your physical might will grow, with zero diminishing returns.

124,,100,Strand(Mastery),The Destiny Universe,Lore,"The newest element of Darkness, discovered first by the Young Wolf, Strand is the element of the mind, the elemental manifestation of the psychic connection between all life. As learned by the pioneers that first made use of it, all minds are connected to each other through an extra-dimensional space known as ‘the weave’, and learning to use Strand involves pulling on the threads connecting each mind to the weave, and to each other, and using these threads to create, manipulate, and unravel.

The true use of it comes from the fact that it is written in such a way that anyone using it could easily explain the knowledge contained within to anyone, even someone with no exposure to spirituality of any kind, though this is no guarantee they will believe what is being revealed to them.

150,,100,Revival of X,The God of High School,Lore,"It is the belief of some that you cannot be a true master of the Martial Arts until you have contributed a creation of your own, instead of just learning from others. Whether you believe it or not, you have an inborn talent and ability to create a martial art, one that will perfectly fit you.

Your mind is now boosted to the limits of humanity making you always experimenting, considering and wondering along with giving you a very imaginative or creative mind about a topic of your choice.

This knowledge may not be too helpful if you’re not in a position to decide such matters but to make up for that, this knowledge will also make you a much more skilful negotiator in hopes that you will be able to put yourself in such a position. You could do a lot of good with this good judgement."
157,,100,Book of Jumper,Library of Ruina: HamHamPangPang,Lore,"Now turning yourself into a book is a pretty bad idea, you can’t defend yourself, if a librarian gets their hands on your book then they have your powers, and all your secrets are open to whoever reads you. But this is not really your book, it’s more like a fancy autobiography than something made from dying in the Library, it’s indestructible by normal means and if damaged anyway you get it back in a week. If any companions have the Book Smarts perk then they can equip it like any other book to get a copy of your abilities, though you can choose if anything you have is not in the book."
158,,100,Body of Control,Bibliomania,Lore,"Your body and mind are now flawlessly connected allowing you full awareness of you physical bodies condition and capabilities but more importantly is your full control over your body to the point that if you are physically capable of an action you can do so effortlessly with 100% action even if normally such action would be involuntary(Controlling your heart beat), normally impossible to do on its own(flexing individual muscles rather than muscle groups) or simply something your body isn’t normally capable of(completely relaxing every muscle of the body). This makes training physical skills much quicker, roughly 5 times faster, though just because you have conscious control doesn't mean you have the training or skill to do something without training.

It should also be noted that this is focused on the body but your control does bleed over slightly to any supernatural powers and abilities you have allowing you to train the control of them 3 fold as well as makes supernatural abilities grow twice as fast as before."
159,,100,All Myths Are True,High School DxD,Lore,"Well, not necessarily, but in a world where Angels, Demons, Norse Deities, Youkai, and even more absurd creatures co-exist in the same setting, it pays to know what’s what. You have an encyclopedic knowledge of all myths and religious texts that exist on present-day Earth, and how to quickly draw connections between them and the ‘real deal’ in this world and beyond. This won’t teach you about any unique mythologies in other worlds, but it will let you draw connections and learn about them quickly so long as you have a way to research them. Never mistake a Reincarnated Devil for a Pure-Blood ever again!"
160,,100,You Can Talk?,Final Fantasy VII,Lore,"You sure can, even if logic or even basic biology would dictate otherwise. Regardless of what species or physical form you're in, you are miraculously capable of human speech as well as clear verbal communication. Don't think too hard about it."

165,,100,All Speak,God Of War (2018),Lore,"Like Atreus you have a preternatural talent for languages. You can now understand and speak any non-magical language. For instance if you want to have a conversation with Jormungandr you can, but if you wanted to speak in the Thu'um from the Elder Scrolls universe you would have to learn the hard way. However, you also gain a resistance to the downsides of certain language based magics. No tearing apart your vocal cords from overusing the Thu’um, instead you may get a really sore throat. "
166,,100,Ancestral Language,Thailand Mythology and Folklore,Lore,"There is more to one’s blood than simple genetics. It carries a spiritual and esoteric connection to one’s own species, especially if you’re a hybrid. The results of this aren't as impressive as you might think, however, or perhaps it is. What does this do then? One simple thing. It lets you communicate with any member of your species without any issues such as language barriers getting in the way. A half-human half-merman person would be able to speak with any human and any merman without having to worry about learning specific languages, for example.

This doesn’t help you if you don’t know any language at all, of course, you still have to know how to speak at all to be able to speak with others. This might be quite useful in certain situations, but for the most part it’s unlikely to see much use. Still, it can be interesting to be capable of it, no?"
167,,100,Un-princely Education,Thailand Mythology and Folklore,Lore,"Please don’t slack off. As royalty, you have a responsibility to your nation. Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem like you’ve listened, or perhaps you have but managed to make time for other things, as now you are an expert at some mundane skill not normally associated with kingship. Combat with any form of weapon (specialized on a specific one like a cudgel), artistry weaved with musical instruments, sailing seafaring ships, anything that wouldn’t normally be part of directly ruling a kingdom is valid here. You’re not going to be a master at this skill, not with just this, but you’re very much above most. Learning combat will let you fight against even hardened soldiers and have the upper edge in the fight, musical skill could let your name echo across history, and if you learned how to sail you’d be able to contend with all but the most violent storms with minimal issue. But, as a prince or princess, what use could this possibly be? Surely you aren’t planning on eloping?"
168,,100,History Book?,Fate/Apocrypha V1.4,Lore,"Curious. While scouring the land for the oddly absent copies of Dracula, you seem to have found a peculiar combination of a set of presumably fictional stories of notable figures, the sort that would be summoned in Grail Wars, with what appear to be more factual additions contradicting or correcting what is deemed to be historically or mythologically correct with what is actually the case. Handy little thing, if where you are has actual events being a bit different from mythology and history you are aware of through other means. Of course, some of this may seem a bit unbelievable to some – Frankenstein’s Monster, King Arthur and Jack The Ripper all being female, for instance. There are even pictures. You’ll get a new copy of this for each world where historical and recorded events don’t necessarily match up."
169,,100,Freelancer,Final Fantasy V,Lore,"You don’t really have a ‘Job’ per se. You’re fairly talented all around. Nothing extreme, but you find that you can pick up most tasks in a relatively short amount of time, just by figuring out how it should be done. Granted, you tend to plateau just as quickly, but when you can learn a trade in a few hours when it takes someone else a few months or even a few years, that’s not so bad, is it?"
170,,100,Weapon Training,Final Fantasy IV,Lore,"A knight wields many weapons, from sword and shield, to axe and lance. Melee weapons in general are second-nature to you. Even ones that are unwieldy or poorly balanced feel natural in your hands, and it takes less than a minute for you to become familiar with its use."
171,,100,Worldly,Final Fantasy IV,Lore,"You’ve been at this awhile, and have been around a great deal. Due to this, you know a lot about a few things, and a little about everything. Obscure facts, ancient legends, and rumors of powerful artifacts linger at the edges of your mind at all times. Even as a Drop-In, you will know things about the worlds you jump into, this one and beyond."
172,,100,Genius        ,Final Fantasy IV,Lore,"There is no doubt that you’re exceptionally skilled in one aspect, but the hallmark of the Prodigy is that you’re gifted in a single area. You may take only a single Class, but you gain its 200CP perk for free. You may still take Advanced Classes. Also you’re far more skilled in your chosen Class, often outperforming adults with years of experience who lack your natural genius."
173,,100,Restless Hearts,HighSchool DxD,Lore,"A bunch of papers, more than enough to make even the most seasoned of bureaucrats sigh in resignation. These papers are blackmail, the result of being alive as much as you have been. Here are many names from prominent, influential, and even dangerous individuals of power. Knowing the secrets written here is enough to force their hand to move at your tune, or just become a card in negotiation. Naturally, how this blackmail material ends up is completely up to you."
174,,100,Total Slaughter,The Voynich Hotel,Lore,"Most people think that this magazine, prominently featuring guns and all sorts of killing devices up for sale, is a joke put together by some cosplayers who like to pretend to be hardcore assassins. Few realize that it truly is what most people mock it for. A twice monthly magazine that ranks the top one hundred assassins currently working in the business as well as a one-stop shop for hitmen who want to buy implements of death. This special subscription will find you no matter where you head to in the multiverse and will give you a list of the top local assassins. Sadly, you won’t be qualified for ranking because we are told you would hog the number one spot for some time to come. The magazine will also feature a number of exciting stories about spectacular jobs pulled off by the local assassins on the list."
175,,100,Heroine's Great Principals EX,Fate/Csjete Halloween Trilogy,Lore,Small booklet detailing (Brave) Elizabeth's views on what exactly it means to be a Hero. Oddly following the rules inside can cause you (and others) to slowly develop powers appropriate for a Hero in the current world (nothing you get to keep when you leave but you get them back if you ever visit another form of said world).
176,,100,...And the Scholarly One ,Final Fantasy III,Lore,"Maybe you aren’t as outgoing as some of your peers, but you make up for it through your scholarly nature. You know many of the common stories of this world, and your reading speed and comprehension has been greatly improved."
177,,100,Two Types Of Genius,Fate/Apocrypha,Lore,"There are two types of genius in this world. There’s the jack of all trades, those who are impressive at anything they do, and become omnidisciplinaries even if they don’t reach truly legendary heights at anything. And there’s the specialists, those who focus exclusively on one thing and take it to unprecedented heights. With this purchase, you may choose to be a genius of either type. The former of course requires no further thought, but for the latter you must of course choose your specialization. In case it needs to be said, it has to actually be a specific thing, such as a narrow form of magecraft, or perhaps even a single spell. The more narrow your focus, the better, and if you don’t pick something that is actually specific, well, you may as well just choose to be a jack of all trades at that point. As perks can only be taken once unless otherwise specified, you may only choose one of the two options."
178,,100,Balanced Aptitude,Final Fantasy II,Lore,"Jumpers have the ability to learn many things in any discipline, but primarily do so through Perks. There are natural inclinations to be had that can interfere with learning through practice. With this Perk, that limitation is removed. While this doesn’t increase one’s learning speed, there is no longer anything blocking your ability to learn any trade or talent, given the time and inclination to learn it."
179,,100,Ancient Books,Hellblazer,Lore,A handful of rare tomes. Take twice for a shelf. Take a third time for a small library. These tomes are expensive and rare.
180,,100,Encyclopedic,Hellblazer,Lore,"You gain a radically improved memory, and a broad knowledge base of the occult."
181,,100,Of Course I Know How To Drive ,Fate/Strange Fake,Lore,"A common trait also shared among all Servants. It seems that regardless of the era you find yourself in, you have a great knowledge of the customs of your current time, as well as being able to understand and communicate with all humans regardless of your original language. Finally, the Holy Grail also imprints in you a great knowledge of the legends of other heroes. You may not be able to identify anyone with just a glance like a Ruler or a powerful clairvoyant would, but hearing the True Name Release of an Heroic Spirit’s Noble Phantasm or laying eyes on a specially significant weapon like Excalibur will allow you to connect the dots quite easily. If this were taken by a human, you would be seen as quite an oddball."
182,,100,Quest Log,Out of Context: Gamer System Supplement,Lore,"Your system will now dynamically bestow you with a quest, or mission whenever you are given a task, something important happens or something relevant to you personally occurs. The Quest Log will show you what actions you have taken so far, what information is relevant to the Quest and it will bestow you some form of reward upon the Quests completion such as points."
183,,100,Magic Mirror,Out of Context: Disney Princess Supplement,Lore,This magic mirror can perfectly reflect your opinions with it answering any questions you ask it honestly without personal bios. The mirror can also switch between a hand mirror and a full length wall mirror.
184,,100,Arcane Grimoire,Godbound,Lore,"A theurgic invocation is inscribed in this precious tome, a piece of wisdom lost since the days of the Former Empire. Such is the value of what this represents, that the alternative you could purchase is an entire set of instructional materials on a lost form of low magic. This item may be repurchased, at half price if discounted, for additional such shards of wisdom."
185,,100,Gunner,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Lore,"You are now a great shot, proficient in the use of all mundane projectile weapons, as well as arm cannons. You are also an expert in the properties and usage of explosives. Finally, you understand how to use personal shield deflectors."
186,,100,Swordfighter,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Lore,"You are now a master of the blade, proficient in the use of most swords, as well as the shuriken and the chakram. You can also adapt to using other ‘unconventional’ weapons (such as sticks, clubs, or even brooms) in the same manner as a one-handed sword, provided you are capable of wielding them one-handed.

Alternatively, if your preferred blade is a bit ‘special’, such as being excessively large, or possessing unique functions, there is another option. You may choose a single specific sword wielded by a Super Smash Bros. Fighter to gain mastery of. In the case of particularly large or heavy swords, such as the Buster Sword, you will gain the necessary strength to wield it, should you lack it, but this additional strength will only apply for the purposes of wielding this type of sword. For swords with additional forms, such as the Sword of the Creator, you will also gain a mastery of their alternate form (in this case you would gain a mastery of whips). Such mastery will also translate over to similar swords, for example mastering the Buster Sword will allow you to wield other similarly sized swords. However, choosing to master a sword will not enable you to wield it if it is the ‘choosy’ type, that only works for a select few.

You may purchase this perk as many times as you like, each time choosing a new sword to gain a mastery of, or to gain the effects of the first option. You may only gain the effects of the first option once.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
187,,100,Brawler,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Lore,"You are now an expert in punches, kicks, grapples, and feints. If you prefer, you may instead gain mastery of a form of martial arts style demonstrated in Super Smash Bros., such as boxing, pro wrestling, or Shotokan. However, if you choose to do this, you will not gain any spiritual or supernatural abilities associated with the chosen martial art. You will not be learning the Hadoken by purchasing this perk alone.

For some reason, taking this perk also gives you a talent for Shot Put. Maybe you can find a use for this?

You may purchase this perk as many times as you like, each time choosing a new form of martial arts to gain mastery in, or to gain the effects of the first option. You may only gain the effects of the first option once.

188,,100,Wizarding News,Wizarding World,Lore,"Given someone in your position, it pays to be kept well-informed of the comings and goings of the world, wherever you may be. Which is why you have these two. The first thing you have now is a daily subscription to the Daily Prophet. While people’s opinions on the paper may vary, you cannot deny that it will be rather useful to read about whatever might be going on in the world. Even if the sources can be rather biased, there will always be useful bits of information within, if you know what you’re looking for.

The second thing you have is a special radio, one that is by default, connected to the Wizarding Wireless Network, a wizarding radio station. Like the Daily Prophet, the WWN can help keep you up-to-date with the coming and goings of the world and you don’t need to wait a day for more news to come through. Of course, if the WWN isn’t to your liking, the radio is capable of picking up other wireless airwaves, letting you listen to other radio broadcasts, including ones that are not necessarily meant to be heard.

Beyond this world, the Daily Prophet will display appropriate and fitting news for you, no matter how different that world may be."
189,,100,On the Job Education,Wizarding World,Lore,"Curse-breaking is a rather dangerous profession given that it entails a person diving into ancient and secret tombs, all loaded to brim with protective curses and enchantments. It doesn’t help that training programs for curse-breakers are, for all intents and purposes, non-existent. But given how prestigious the job is, it only makes sense that so many witches and wizards would try their hand at it. So, let’s give you a leg up against the competition.

Whenever you find yourself in a new profession, you will quickly be able to pick up on the basics of said profession, even without going through any basic or specialized training. For example, as a curse-breaker, you’ll quickly be able to learn how to determine any traps or curses within your area. For something more normal, like accounting, you’ll be able to serve as a good enough accountant to not get fired.

Still, this only gets you to the bare minimum. All you’ll be with this alone is someone good enough to not get fired or someone who isn’t going to get themselves killed with their own stupidity. If you want to do more than that, you’re on your own."
190,,100,Charta Opus Coepi,Wizarding World,Lore,"Paperwork is the bane of many of a desk jockey. Piles of paper reaching the ceiling stacked on top of one’s desk almost makes you want to just jump and end it all. And even magic can only help so much, especially if you want it done right. But then again, you have your own special brand of magic, don’t you?

And so, you have no need to fear! For you, paperwork is now done all on their own. And you don’t even need to worry about any mistakes here. The paperwork will be done as if you yourself did them. If need be, you can also set a few conditions regarding the paperwork so that they won’t be done if you really need to take a look and make sure on what’s written in them."
191,,100,Knowing the Book,Wizarding World,Lore,"Ah, the law. It’s a bane and a boon for so many people of the law. You are no different. But unlike many fools, you’ve made it your mission to be well aware of it. From now on, regardless of when or where you are, the laws of the land shall be made known to you. You will know what acts are legal, what acts are illegal, and what acts merely frowned upon. Even something as confusing and dense as Wizarding law are all too clear to your mind’s eye.

Of course, such a wealth of knowledge is remarkably easy to abuse for one such as you. Given how in-depth your understanding on the law can be, you could make for a very fine lawyer. That is, if you don’t abuse your newfound expertise on it for your own personal welfare. After all, few systems are perfect and there will no doubt be many such loopholes you could scurry your way through, no matter how iron tight they are."
192,,100,Lingua Franca,Wizarding World,Lore,"There are thousands of languages spoken throughout the world and that only includes the Muggle world. The magical side of things has even more languages to offer such as Mermish and Gobbledegook. It can all make things very confusing but luckily for you, you have a knack for linguistics. Regardless of the language, you can pick it up very well, enough that you could learn the basics of a language by the end of a day and speak it fluently by the week’s end. If you do this right, you could even gain a bit of respect from the notoriously stingy Goblins of Gringotts."
193,,100,A Scrapbook Of Memories,Disney’s Cinderella,Lore,"A simple, leather bound book of blank pages. Once you touch it, it automatically fills itself with your memories and allows you to play them like a dream/vision so that you can re-experience them. It sorts itself chronologically and cannot be read by anyone else without permission."
194,,100,Penny Dreadful’s Homework,Wizard 101,Lore,A loose leaf collection of notes on the Undead. Provides an in-depth primer on any kind of undead you encounter in the wild. Please ignore any cooking instructions.

198,,100,Sun School,Wizard 101,Lore,Initiates of the School of Solamancy have all the skills necessary to craft and cast all spell cards of the school of power enduring.
199,,100,School of Death,Wizard 101,Lore,"You know and have the skills necessary to craft and cast all of the spell cards found within the school of Death, finding that they hit harder and cast faster than they would for those whose soul is not shrouded in the tattered remnants of a reapers cloak, as yours is."
200,,100,School of Life,Wizard 101,Lore,"You know and have the skills necessary to craft and cast all of the spell cards found within the school of life, finding that they hit harder and cast faster than they would for those whose heads are not crowned in fae flowers, as yours is."
201,,100,School of Myth,Wizard 101,Lore,"You know and have the skills necessary to craft and cast all of the spell cards found within the school of myth, finding them to hit harder and cast faster than they would for those whose minds gaze not upon mist-wreathed Avalon, as yours does."
202,,100,School of Balance,Wizard 101,Lore,"You know and have the skills necessary to craft and cast all of the spell cards found in the school of balance, finding them to hit harder and cast faster than they would for someone not otherwise attuned to the school that lies between all elements."
203,,100,School of Storm,Wizard 101,Lore,"You know and have the skills necessary to craft and cast all of the spell cards found within the school of storm, finding that they hit harder and cast faster than they would for those not so attuned to the hidden depths found in the darkened skies."
204,,100,School of Ice,Wizard 101,Lore,"You know and have the skills necessary to craft and cast all of the spell cards found within the school of ice, finding that they hit harder and cast faster than they would for those not dusted with the eternal frost found at the heart of winter."
205,,100,School of Fire,Wizard 101,Lore,"You know and have the skills necessary to craft and cast all of the spell cards found within the school of fire, finding that they hit harder and cast faster for you than they would for those whose hearts do not burn with the sparks of the everflame as yours does."
206,,100,Apprentice ,The Owl House,Lore,"Magic users at this skill level have already received some basic instruction and have started to specialize, putting them on par with Hexside students in their first or second years. An apprentice of the Construction Coven would be able to craft simplistic dwellings or enhance their physical prowess to twice their normal strength.

207,,100,Proficient ,The Owl House,Lore,"Magic users at this skill level have mastered the fundamentals and can manage most spells within their specialty. You could easily use your magical talents to make a living, like how Morton crafts specialty potions for the citizens of Bonesborough.

Requires Apprentice to Purchase"
208,,100,Standardized Education,The Owl House,Lore,"Rote memorization? Pointless busywork? Sounds like public education to me! Whether you attended Hexide, Glandus, or another of the Boiling Isles’ approved magical institutes, you’ve received a basic education in the magic systems of this world. You were taught to cast spells as well as any witch or demon, which grants you some basic command of elemental magic and telekinesis, which will expand as you grow in skill and strength. This also comes with a foundation in one Coven specialty of your choice, preparing you for the rest of your magical schooling. This doesn’t grant any esoteric knowledge, and this won’t give non-natives the innate ability to cast magic, but you’ll start with the same information as everyone else."
209,,100,Old Witch's Ring,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Lore,"Old ring from an old witch. Engraved minutely with indecipherable script, but seemingly useless, at least until you speak to others. While wearing this ring, not only will you be able to understand any spoken language you hear as though you were a native speaker, but you will be understood by them in turn."
210,,100,Gravelord Miracles,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Lore,"Much like the tales that will be told of Lord Gwyn and his pantheon, there will one day be stories based around the concept of Death, the faith in their truth manifesting as tangible miracles. You are capable of casting these miracles, as well as creating new ones based upon Death and all that stems from it. For now, you can merely summon crimson blades from the earth to impale your enemies, but more is sure to follow, as surely as all that lives shall one day perish."
211,,100,Divine Miracles,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Lore,"In the ages to come, miracles would be performed by reading tales that bring about a revelation, yet is your very existence in these times not one in and of itself? You are capable of casting these miracles through the use of a talisman, all connected to the concept of light and what it represents. Healing yourself, reducing the effects of incoming magic, slowing nearby enemies, and many more."
212,,100,Minstrel,Walt Disney’s Robin Hood,Lore,"The stories of heroes and villains and underdogs of medieval times were the work of traveling bards. You have a gift with storytelling through music. Moreover, you automatically receive accurate information about the stories you are telling. For instance, you can perfectly recall how a couple do-gooder-thieves outwitted the Sheriff’s soldiers in the forest, even if you were nowhere in the area. However, your ability to fill in the blanks depends on both the artistic level of your narrative and how much information you have about the story; if you don’t give enough musical flair to your storytelling, for instance, or only have minimal information about the scenario you’re retelling, the more likely it will be that you will fail to acquire the extra info, or even come to false conclusions. The perk also gives you insights on how to use musical instruments as defensive tools in combat."
213,,100,Flash Cards,Wizards of Waverly Place,Lore,"Justin Russo has been taking notes on every school subject since he was in kindergarten. And now, you have a copy of all the notes he has taken up to his graduation from high school. These include English, Spanish, geometry, algebra, calculus, biology, chemistry, physics, history, geography, politics, general knowledge, and even wizardry."
214,,100,Feel It In My Code,WRECK-IT RALPH,Lore,"You have good instincts, especially when it comes to learning new things. It almost seems like you are simply relearning things that you already knew, with insights and skills coming quickly to you. This also has the effect of weakening any amnesia effects on you, allowing you to recover lost or hidden memories faster than before."
215,,100,Bending Scrolls,Avatar: The Legend Of Korra,Lore,"Instructions on different forms of bending and how they’re executed. These scrolls can teach you a number of offensive, defensive, and utilitarian moves, but they’re no replacement for a real teacher. You’ll receive a dozen scrolls for your nation’s element, and you may purchase additional scrolls for any element at a discounted price.

216,,100,Spellbooks,Marvel Magic,Lore,"These musty old tomes contain enough occult knowledge and basic spells to start one down the path of the Mystic Arts. Just the basics, mind you. But you will do well to never forget your basics, no matter how wise or powerful you may become. And perhaps an apprentice of your own may have use for these, some day?"
217,,100,Arcane Asgardian,Loki,Lore,"While others might rely on a mighty hammer or swords, you can cope without such tools thanks to possessing some degree of talent with magic. You’re not any sort of supreme sorcerer, more of a magician, this being more of the capability to use this talent rather than any sort of mastery or extensive knowledge. You know how to do basic illusion projection, duplication casting, minor conjuration, pull small objects towards you and unleash some relatively weak blasts of energy."
218,,100,All-Speak,Marvel Primal,Lore,"You speak the All-Tongue, which all men hear as their native language. Also, you can understand all speakers. Doesn’t help much with reading though."
219,,100,Mystic Arts Lore ,Ultimate Marvel,Lore,"You have knowledge of most Mystic Lore, allowing you to recognize most demons, gods, magic items, rituals, and various other things related to the mystic arts."
220,,100,Training ,Marvel Midnight Suns,Lore,Power is not a stationary point nor can it be numerically valued so to live another day warriors must train. This perk gives you the ability to train with any weapon – both physical and magic – and also be able to teach another if they have experience of capabilities. You can always find growth even if it is miniscule. This can’t give people magic or force a paraplegic to dodge with a roll.
221,,100,Artefact Expert ,Marvel Midnight Suns,Lore,Artefacts can be great channels of magic and hold many secrets. By separating the different pieces and studying them you can unlock new lore and ideas. This can lead to new spells or weapons. Beginners must be wary though to put all the pieces back together. These can’t be more powerful than you. An example of this is if you separated the Eye of Agamotto you could create an event revealer spell and the Ebony Blade could help you figure out umbrakinesis but to do so you must be a Sorcerer Supreme.
222,,100,Mystical Instruction,Marvel: What If...?,Lore,"Now we’ve solidly left the realm of mundane thinking. Whether you trained at Kamar-Taj or found another master to study under, you have achieved a basic proficiency in drawing energy from the multiverse to shape the source code of reality. These programs or spells may be small at first, but practice and training will reward your effort."
223,,100,Occultist,Avengers-Thunderbolts,Lore,"You possess a basic knowledge of magic and the occult. You are familiar with the concepts, and have some recognition of the various occult elements that exist in the world; you know what a Sorcerer Supreme is and what their duties are, know about how Hell is divvied up between Mephisto, Satanish, Hades, Hela, and Hellstrom, and the basic principles which govern magic in this universe. This only gives you a very basic knowledge of how to cast spells yourself, but you are guaranteed to have at least enough talent in this world’s magic to make some use of it (even in future worlds), even if this perk alone won’t guarantee you more than the bare minimal capability.

In future worlds this won’t grant you any guarantees to be able to use their magical systems, but the information will update to give you the basic knowledge that a low end individual in the know of its occult systems would know."
224,,100,Old Witch's Ring ,Dark Souls: Covenants,Lore,"Old ring from an old witch. Engraved minutely with indecipherable script, but seemingly useless, at least until you speak to others. While wearing this ring, not only will you be able to understand any spoken language you hear as though you were a native speaker, but you will be understood by them in turn."
225,,100,Miracles,Dark Souls: Covenants,Lore,"Members of the Way of White are typically seen utilizing miracles, a type of holy magic that is granted to one by reading tales that bring about a revelation. You are quite experienced with the usage of these, being able to perform such acts like healing yourself, reduce the effects of incoming magic, slow nearby enemies, and teleport yourself back to a previously located Bonfire."
226,,100,Academia ,Fate,Lore,"You've spent your whole life learning and helping out your teachers, and those benefits have stuck with you. You'll find it much easier to teach others, as well as understand new knowledge a fair bit quicker."
227,,100,Weapon Specialist ,Toaruverse ,Lore,Humans created weapons to help them fight to make them a better killer; this is especially for magicians and their spiritual items. Choose any weapon that you like from the most common to exotic ones and you become a master at wielding that said weapon making you capable of fighting and defeating several skilled opponents without breaking a sweat. You also gain a preternatural ability at combining or synergizing your spells or abilities with your weapon style allowing you to create your own deadly style of fighting.
228,,100,Hearth of a Teacher ,Toaruverse ,Lore,"Others like to teach children while some are forced in that role but unlike the latter you have the passion to teach the younger generations to guide them to their future. You are able to connect and form a bond with any student that you have and these students of yours always retain and understand anything that you teach them. Students that formed a bond with you always looks up to you as their parents, especially those that don’t have one and would go through hell together with you if they have nothing to lose. This also makes you incredible and creative at creating teaching materials to teach your students that none of them are bored when you are teaching them."
229,,100,Sorcerer,A Certain Magical Index,Lore,"You’re a magician with a purpose. It isn’t just enough to get good, oh no. You have to give back. You’re a sorcerer, or a magician that seeks to and is perfectly qualified to train the next generation of mages. You have a great grasp of magical theory & practical application, and have no problems with passing it down. You’re strong enough to handle the power of a grimoire easily, and can use one to teach your apprentices magic. Yes, even if you can’t demonstrate it to your students. You’re that good."
230,,100,Speculative Spectacles,Bayonetta,Lore,"What a nice pair of glasses! Stylish, yet effective in what they do. Even if you already have perfect eyesight, this pair of glasses assists you with memory retention when you're reading various writings and documents, ensuring you will always be a repository of knowledge. You'll even find that while wearing them, you can read significantly faster than normal with no loss of study effectiveness!"
231,,100,Prior Findings,Bayonetta,Lore,"Obscure knowledge of myth and legend are your forte, and if you don't know it yet you'll learn it soon. After all, that's why you got into this job, right? To learn about this kind of thing? You have a knack of picking up information, learning it faster and retaining it much easier than normal. Expect to match other intellectuals quite soon, if not baffle them with your wealth of knowledge. You could have nerd wars!"
232,,100,Master Swordsman,Ragna Crimson,Lore,"What’s power without some skill? Unlike the more brutish dragon hunters, you are actually skilled in the use of a weapon of your choosing, having several years of experience behind you and a particular talent for it. Not that skill alone would let you defeat the powerhouses of this world, but with a strong weapon in your hands and provided they didn’t use any strong magics, you could give a good battle to even the middle dragons and even hold the weakest Seija for a time. You are also able to recognize the talent or experience in others by exchanging just a single blow with them."
233,,100,Linguistically Talented,Trinity Wonder,Lore,"Among other things, different worlds have different languages. Given that they are completely separate universes, there is no guarantee that these languages will share any kinds of roots or have similarities. This doesn’t matter so much for you. Much like Emily and Wujin, you are shockingly talented when it comes to picking up new languages that you’ve never encountered before. With a guide to help, you would be able to speak in broken form of that language within a day. Within a week you would only have a faint accent."
234,,100,Symbology,Generic Alchemist,Lore,"You have in depth knowledge of the symbols, pictographs, shapes, and patterns that carry some measure of meaning and power as well as how they can be used in the process of alchemy or magic. While it is possible to learn them and figure out how to put them together as you go, it is a time consuming process that requires a lot of trial and error, where an error can have severe side effects. You gain an increased skill in drawing and have an eye for measurements in terms of length and angles that would allow you to draw a complex alchemical circle without any tools other than your own hands, eyes, and a drawing implement."
235,,100,Pen & Paper,Generic Alchemist,Lore,"You are a skilled writer, both in terms of creating manuscripts detailing your alchemical findings and pursuits, but also in the writing of fictional stories. You never suffer from writer's block and can ensure that what you write is evocative and easily understood, relatively speaking, by the targeted demographic. Finally, your books can teach in your stead, adding about a third of your skills as a teacher (and any boosts to teaching speed) to the rate at which one can learn something from your books."
236,,100,Nose for Secrets,Generic Alchemist,Lore,"You have a knack for ferreting out lost, hidden, forbidden, forgotten, and/or useful information and artifacts during your travels. This makes you an exceptional archaeologist and detective as well as giving you a fair bit of skill in stealth and trapfinding."
237,,100,Academic,Generic Alchemist,Lore,"You are a skilled researcher, able to read quickly, organize information you’ve gained, and extrapolate from that data more readily, with fewer mistakes and false leads. You also find that books are nearly as good a teacher as having an actual person there to aid you."
238,,100,Scholar ,Generic Alchemist,Lore,"You have a perfect memory, with unlimited storage, the ability to instantly recall any information, and an immunity to outside tampering. You also possess an enhanced ability to visualize things within your mind and can create mental constructs or formulas at will to simulate simple devices and processes."
239,,100,Magic Theory,League of Legends,Lore,"You've spent your whole life around magic, and it'd be a darn shame if you hadn't learned a thing about it. Whether through formal education or through trial and error, you know the basics of how magic works on Runeterra, and how to apply it towards various minor cantrips that make life just a little bit easier."
240,,100,Basic Theory,Super Dragon Sword ,Lore,"You are capable of using Force 1, a weak offensive spell that deals approximately the damage of Fire 1, while having no elemental strength or weakness attached to it. You are also capable of casting Shield 1, a defensive spell that increases your evasive abilities. They’re not much, but they’re a key part of your studies. In addition, you are capable of shaping these magics and any others you know as areas-of-effect, be they “Force beams” or “Shield balls.”"
241,,100,Tale of Terror,Super Dragon Sword ,Lore,"While you may not be as capable of transforming into a beast as the Blue Mages of the stories, you do have a talent for retelling their beastly exploits. You are capable of entering a state of Recording for one minute, during which you may “Archive” any spell or ability used by a monster or other non-sapient creature during this state. You are able to analyze the properties of Archived spells or abilities to be better informed of how to avoid them."
242,,100,Basic Spellbook,Ben 10,Lore,"Every spellcaster worth their salt has to start somewhere and this is no exception. This is a collection of several basic spells and the essentials of how to use magic, enough that someone with no talent for the mystical arts could become a decent practitioner in a few months. This gets your foot in the door but anything more than simple mana constructs and blasts will take further study. Post-jump, this book functions as a ‘beginner’s guide’ to any sort of magic in future settings you jump to, though it may not necessarily mean you’re able to use it."
243,,100,Wizard Brain,Ben 10,Lore,"Magic involves a lot of book learning and memorizing things, so this gives you photographic memory and an extremely quick recall, letting you remember things like spells and incantations on the fly and react quickly. You’re also one heck of a speed reader!"
244,,100,Four Dimensional Wit ,Ben 10,Lore,"When you’re a time traveler, something you have to get used to is how confusing things are when they don’t happen in a linear fashion. Meeting your past or future self, people you haven’t met yet acting familiar to you, or things you’re destined to do in your own future. Thankfully you’re able to comprehend this sort of thing easily and have excellent guesswork on things having to do with your own future, able to comprehend events happening out of order without getting much of a headache. That might not be true for anyone accompanying you, though. Remember: Spoilers."
245,,100,Advanced spellbooks ,Generic Dungeon Crawler,Lore,"These books offer stronger spells with more varied effects, and even a small degree of utility. These are a necessity for spellcasters to survive the mid-dungeon. "
246,,100,Council Trained,Dresden Files,Lore,"You have all the power, talent and training to make you a full Wizard of the White Council. Your specialty and specific skills are left to you to decide, but you are extraordinarily skilled in at least one field. You may choose to be a Warden for free if you want.

This perk can be bought multiple times for additional skills and knowledge, either general or specializing in certain fields of magic.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
247,,100,Clued In,The Dresden Files,Lore,"Rather than walking around with your blinders on, you've dived into the supernatural world headfirst, and you've picked up a lot of useful information on the way down. You don't know everything, of course, but if it's common or even uncommon supernatural knowledge, you've probably picked up on it. You can tell the difference between demons, ugly faeries, and things that aren't either, and know their common weaknesses, behaviors, and will provoke them into killing you. It's also easier for you to learn new information about the supernatural, or call it to mind when being chased by something ravenous."
248,,100,Sign Language,Dark Souls 2,Lore,"“Stemming from nonverbal communication built up with compatriots with discretion was the better part of valor, you know sign language. . .of a sort. First of all, you’re quite gifted at understanding the intent behind whatever gestures or silent modes of communication others might be directing at you or someone else in sight. More importantly, you’ve become far more capable of reading context clues to decipher nearby threats. A freshly charred corpse means the threat of fire is nearby. A broken note left by a dead warrior could be a treasure trove of information based on location alone. Sometimes even markings on a doorframe could tell you a trap is waiting, and how to trip it safely.”"
249,,100,Ashina Arts ,Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,Lore,"You are trained in the ways of the sword. Perhaps not in the Ashina school, but none the less, you were trained in a similar principle where with the clash of blades is less of a clash but more the dancing of a carp. You were taught to replicate the movement of fountainheads and incorporate the mannerisms of rivers and waves into your swordplay. The end result is a free- flowing style of swordsmanship that can easily change from attack to defense to counterattack seamlessly like the constant uninterrupted flow of water. This also affords you training in archery. When paired with Shadow Style, you effectively become a master swordsman who can augment their swordsmanship with the ninja’s knowledge of balance and windows of opportunity. So long as you have a blade in hand in close combat, it’s difficult for any weapon to reach you and it’s equally difficult to defend against you."
250,,100,Introduced Instincts,Bloodborne,Lore,"“Reduced cognitive abilities, a new body, and unleashed aggression seems like a recipe for awkwardness. However, mysterious as it is, even the freshly turned are able to exhibit seamless movement and fluid aggression, as fluid as any beast could be anyways. 

This enigmatic quality goes on to benefit you with your bestial skills, a background awareness of just how such things work even if you haven’t been fully transformed. You’ll get an idea of what your body is capable of, its limitations, what it’s designed for, and a comfortable familiarity with using it.  

Additionally, should you ever find yourself taking on new form in other ways, your instincts will likewise cover for those forms as well.”"
251,,100,Heightened Capacity,Demon's Souls,Lore,"​Magic requires those that use it to be more than just dumb brutes. This is reflected in you improving your intelligence and as a direct result your mana capacity. You can cast some basic spells(Flame Toss, Soul Arrow, and Water Veil) without them failing on you."
252,,100,Move Set,Demon's Souls,Lore,"You understand how to hold and use many weapons: halberds, swords, spears ,bows, crossbows, and et cetera. However it’s all rigid as if you're following from a book. With time you can innovate them into a fluid combat style."
253,,100,Astrologer,Elden Ring,Lore,"From divining the fate of things to come in the heavens above to invoking and calling forth the glintstone that is the amber of those that dwell among the heavens, the work of an astrologer is the lifeblood of Raya Lucaria. You have the training and knowledge deemed acceptable to be a scholar at the academy-not that which is needed to be proficient in battle, but rather the theories underlying your magical practices and the nuances of spell formation. It was minds like yours that innovated the Shard Spiral spell in order to emulate a comet; even failures of your insight into the heavens can result in useful magical effects. You’re also a very gifted teacher, capable even of teaching a loutish brute how to imbue magic in his weapons."
254,,100,Dark Arts Cache,Harry Potter,Lore,A cache of around 10 ancient books of the Dark Arts. Each one restricted by both Hogwarts and the Ministry. The contents are disturbing but interesting. There are some especially unpleasant curses in these books.
255,,100,Dedicated,Harry Potter,Lore,You find it much easier to study for a long period of time without getting bored. You can do a few hours of reading of even the driest material a day without ever losing focus and retain more information.
256,,100,Spellcaster ,MtG - Amonkhet,Lore,"By default, you are a cleric wielding your faith as magical power, though you could just as easily be a wizard commanding mana through knowledge and training, or even a druid exploding a deeply spiritual connection to the natural world, if you so chose. Regardless of your exact method of doing so, you have the ability and knowledge necessary to draw upon magical energy and weave it into spells. You are not a particularly knowledgeable or powerful mage, only reaching basic proficiency, but even at this level you are a resource to be cherished and a power to be reckoned with."
257,,100,Battle Trained,MtG - Amonkhet,Lore,"The Trials are primarily martial endeavours, so of course every child learns how to fight. You took to it like a fish to water. Regardless of whether you’re fighting with archery, a khopesh, a spear, a bolas, or even your bare hands, you are one of the best combatants your crop has to offer. You can fight in formation or alone, armored or otherwise, with or without a shield, if need be. In the future, your natural talent for violence will allow you to pick up any form of violent skill with incredible speed."
258,,100,The Song of All ,MtG - Homelands,Lore,"When the planeswalker Serra codified her religion, she did so in the form of a song to be expressed through her angels. The Song of All chronicles the beliefs, worldview, and wisdom of Serra, divided in exactly one thousand cantos of varying lengths. The whole song would take a choir of angels many days, perhaps over a week, to sing from start to finish.

What you have now is a complete version of the Song of All, in the form of a book containing all of Serra’s teachings. A perfect tool for promoting peace and harmony. It also comes with a couple of extra props to go with it, white robes and little idols carved in her likeness. 

Or if you’d prefer, you could instead get a different book with a Song of roughly equal length that instead contains all of your own beliefs, worldview, and wisdom. Just in case you wanted to codify your own religion in the form of an (angelic) song."
259,,100,Second Master ,MtG - Homelands,Lore,"The wizards’ school was largely founded through the efforts of a single man, the mysterious and enigmatic First Master who taught the first wizards as his personal apprentices. While he never revealed his identity to his apprentices, Feroz gave them much in just the few short years he was with them, left behind a large number of magical tomes, and most importantly taught them enough to learn and discover more for themselves.

While you’d need to bring in the knowledge yourself, this gives you more than enough skill at teaching to perform similar feats. Training a core of wizards who will go on to research and discover more magic for centuries afterwards is the work of a few years, bolstering a nation can be done by teaching a secret society a single spell, and with enough knowledge to pass on you could single-handedly start schools that can compete with nations."
260,,100,Tome Of Knowledge ,MtG - Shandalar,Lore,"This large, iron-bound spellbook is a repository of knowledge unmatched on Shandalar. When attuned to a user, the tome will form an exact copy of the user’s sum knowledge, made avaiable with great ease. Though the most immediately beneficial use of this tome is in the fact it allows a user to more effectively organize their thoughts and, hence, expanding how many near-identical copies of spells they can keep track of, it also provides lesser boons. After all, as a repository of knowledge, it would not do to remain out-of-date. The book automatically updates itself as you learn new things or simply experience life, and unless the Tome Of Knowledge is later attuned to a different user, it will never lose any of its knowledge. Should you fall victim to a mind-rending spell or experience an unfortunate bout of amnesia, you may be able to use this book to restore that which you have lost - and the transfer of knowledge is instant in both directions.

The tome cannot be used by others without your agreement, so you need not fear your secrets being revealed within its pages... unless you wish it, at any rate."
261,,100,Whispers,MtG - Shandalar,Lore,"The knowledge of man can fill a thousand books... but the knowledge of those beyond the veil can fill a thousand more. From ancient tombs to binding spirits from the afterlife, from demonic contracts to vile experimentation, you have a knack for finding usable knowledge... especially the kind of knowledge that more weak-willed or hypocritical people might consider ‘forbidden’. As a side-effect, you are also quite accustomed to protecting yourself during such risky endeavors, and while there’s no guarantee the reward is worth the risk, you’ll usually survive to enjoy the spoils… or at least get away before things get too dicey."
262,,100,Valorous,MtG - Shandalar,Lore,"‘Know Thy Enemy’ is an important principle in combat, and you exemplify the teaching in all that you do. You are an expert at countering a single, specific strategy or style of magic at a time, and this focus allows you to gain a sizable advantage... but only against those who meet your expectations. A well-timed Circle Of Protection attuned to your foe’s main source of magical power can provide protection against even the mightiest monsters they might call to battle, but it is wholly useless against a spell of the wrong ‘color’, after all."
263,,100,Spell Mastery ,MtG - Shandalar,Lore,"Representing a level of insight and competence in a specific spell surpassing that of even other mages, each purchase of this Perk allows you to maintain one spell acquired through ‘Knowledgeable’ within your mental focus regardless of any other limitations you might otherwise have, including the minimum amount of magical power needed to manifest it. Essentially, this ensures you always have your first copy of this spell ready at the start of a battle. This means you’ll be able to manifest it within a moment’s notice, eliminating any potential difficulties with the semi-random process of acquiring spells in your mental focus and the need to draw mana from lands or other sources to fuel this spell’s casting.

This spell does not interfere with any other spells you might try to bring into focus, and while an enemy’s spells might disrupt the necessary focus for lesser magics, your mastered spell cannot be ‘discarded’ in such a way unless you permit it.

In addition, you receive an additional three copies of this spell as if you gained them through ‘Knowledgeable’, though these copies do not gain the same benefits and must be ‘drawn’ and used normally.

Requires Knowledgeable(MtG - Shandalar) "
264,,100,GOLGARI GUILDMAGE ,MtG - Ravnica,Lore,"As a member of the Golgari, you’re going to be dealing with a lot of dead stuff, so if you’re squeamish, it’s going to be difficult. Luckily, this perk ensures that even if you’re up to your elbows in body parts, you’re fine with it. Not only that, but you have a much deeper understanding of the Golgari beliefs of nature as a cycle, where death is a natural and necessary part of life, making your magic concerning areas like these a little stronger."
265,,100,AZORIUS GUILDMAGE,MtG - Ravnica,Lore,"An Azorius guildmage is expected to know the rules of Ravnica inside out, both those intended to guarantee safety for the citizens, and those intended for more... selfish purposes. You have an encyclopaedic knowledge of the laws in the setting you’re in, and you get a slight boost to intelligence as well, to help you understand these laws."
266,,100,Infallible Metric,MtG - New Phyrexia,Lore,"Even mistakes are not hated if they are recorded- And you record everything! Blood loss from the operation, the angles at which the body can ́t bend further without breaking, the amount of oil you can pump into a human before they dissolve... When you ́re operating or researching, you take notice of even the smallest details, and can accurately measure any of the (quantifiable) details. Your reports are thorough, but they might be a bit boring to read. Never again will you miss anything potentially important in your research."
267,,100,Don’t Leave Matters Incompleat ,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Lore,"As one might expect, each of the major factions has a philosophy that guides them both in battle and in peace, a style of magic that they favor, perhaps even an environment or a terrain their skills work best in. The gleaming white Samurai work best in wide open streets, brightly lit by the promise of a better tomorrow, while a Reckoner who stands in those same streets knows without question that they dun goofed. You are something of a master at adapting to these tactics, easily making minor changes to your stance and combat philosophy to better blend into and take advantage of your environment. Similarly, any experience you may have using or fighting these drastically different styles means that it’s much harder to catch you off guard - having fought something vaguely similar in the past, it becomes easier to predict the next actions of your foes even if they’re style is mostly completely new to you. "
268,,100,Information Security Is Key,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Lore,"A sad but important fact of life is that among those constantly seeking to push the boundaries of scientific advancement, resources, information, and even more ephemeral things like insight or motivation, are always at a premium. To that end, you have learned to ward off attempts at stealing your research, whether it’s by less upstanding scientists who think that you hold the key to their success, or by the Imperials checking to make sure that you’re actually doing what you’re supposed to be doing. As a side note, while this is more of a social skill that allows you to use your intelligence to intuit weak points, it also extends to programming knowledge, allowing you to set up a simple firewall around your machine's cores to prevent just anyone from using them"
269,,100,Depths of the Mind,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Lore,"The path of a Wizard is study, rote memorization and learning. These qualities are innate to those who wish to practice magic. Being infused with the cooling touch of Blue Mana, your intelligence has boosted along with your memory and ability to learn. Put simply, you are quite the savant, easily worth three of your peers when looking towards solving a problem, learning three times faster than normal, and having a perfect memory barring magical interference."
270,,100,Lawmaker ,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Lore,"Rules keep society together and following them is of the utmost importance. Put simply, you have an intuitive understanding of the most basic rules when entering a new place allowing you to blend in with the crowd and avoid getting into trouble unintentionally. With just some minor study of a law book, it would not be difficult for you to be able to serve as a lawyer ensuring an understanding of even some byzantine law codes. This likewise also helps you when writing laws, helping you close loopholes in the law, prevent the creation of laws that are impossible to enforce or that contradict, and make it so that the spirit of the law comes first."
271,,100,"Encantus, Pocket Edition",The Sorcerer's Apprentice,Lore,"Sorcerer's bible, it serves as a combination of textbook and historical document, detailing the art, science and history of magic. Essentially every Encantus ever created is patterned after Merlin's original text, although this means that most modern copies of the Encantus are missing several chunks after damage incurred during his fall – such as a copy of The Rising spell. It also details the history of previous owner of the Encantus or the original it was copied from, and as such you can trace your sorcerous lineage back to Merlin through this. Your copy is a modern copy of the Encantus, which means while it lacks spells such as The Rising, it does have many more modern spells that have been invented since his time. For an additional 100cp, the Encantus will continue to update itself in future worlds to include the basic relevant skills of magic, as well as tracing your magical ancestry, if applicable."
272,,100,Multilingual,Skulduggery Pleasant,Lore,"Who doesn’t want to speak another language to know another culture? You won't meet a sorcerer who doesn’t know at least one extra language. It's part of their way to hide among the mortals to live among them to immerse themselves in the world. That, and the fact that after a few decades, people can get incredibly bored and start learning anything to keep themselves entertained. But let's go with the former, since it’s more dramatic. By purchasing this, you gain mastery in speaking, reading, and writing a language of your choice, as well as gaining in-depth knowledge of the culture your chosen language is local to. This perk may be purchased multiple times."
273,,100,Combat Training,Skulduggery Pleasant,Lore,"This world isn’t like Harry Potter where fighting is always done at a distance and only with magic. Here, sorcerers use every advantage they have to fight, win, and survive. All origins receive training in a single form of combat equal to that of a master of said discipline. The definition of combat training is rather broad, and can cover anything from a specific martial art to swordsmanship to the use of firearms. Now before you get a big head, I should remind you that the majority of the main characters are masters of several martial arts, so do try to be careful. This perk may be purchased multiple times."
274,,100,Common Tongue ,Magi: The Adventure of Sinbad,Lore,"It’s pretty convenient that, thanks to the meddling of a certain special Djinn, almost everyone in this world speaks the same language, the Torran people being the only exception. While it would be a bit unusual for this universal monolingualism to follow you into future worlds, you’re fortunately blessed with the next best thing – in every setting you travel to, you’ll automatically be completely fluent in the dozen or so most commonly-spoken languages, as if you’d been a native speaker of them your whole life. While you’ll have to put in the time yourself to learn any dead or rarer languages, it’s still pretty handy to be able to communicate with a good majority of the world’s people in their own tongue."
275,,100,Library of Babel,Campione,Lore ,"Perhaps a name too big for what it is, but its usefulness can’t be denied. This is a large library is a collection of myths, legends, fables and records about gods, angels, demons, heroes and other fantastical beings. It also recorded the cults for each and their transition in time and geography. As expected, it would take a long time to memorize it all, but is a good source of information if you happen to need it. It updates every jump."
276,,100,Modern Myth,Campione,Lore ,"This is a world were all myths and legends hold some truth to them, as such, you have been studying them from as far as you remember. Researching Gods, heroes, and esoteric matters in detail left you with a wide arrange of knowledge about them, their cults and related trivia. From the origins of certain heroes, association between gods and festivities, evolution of cults and which ones still remain in some form. This knowledge will update each world you visit, provided they had a similar cultural progression. Also, that historical and myth trivia may be a nice way to make small talk with others"
277,,100,Philosopher Kings,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Lore ,"The greatest kings and military leaders were more than just warriors and tacticians. They were men
of incredible fortitude beyond the simple body, with wills to push forward against the impossible for
years at a time, so that they could grasp victory. They were more than fighters, with experience as
philosophers or explorers that they bent towards their goals of conquest. You’re not a great king yet
but you share those beginnings. You’ve got a will like a wall of diamond, incredible hard and near
impossible to break or bend. You might not last forever against everything but it’ll take a damn lot to
make you bend the knee by choice. Your childhood, where you found that will, was spent not just on
military training but also in another field of life of your choice, such as exploring distant lands for
years to experience new cultures or spending time as a notable teacher of the arts at home, which
has given you a wide array of minor skills and experiences that aid you in finding creative solutions
to your enemies."
278,,100,Let’s Go Hero,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Lore,"To be a hero, you need to be a complete package. Fighting? It’s useful. You’re good at it too, enough
to handle ordinary soldiers in small groups on your own well enough or take down a minor magical
beast or five at once, but that’s not enough. Being a hero is about adventure and that’s where you’re
shining. You’ve got a wide array of skills when it comes to exploring and adventuring, from
acrobatics and navigation of land and sea to organising expeditions and how to sell off all the
treasure you find. In later times, you could definitely make a name for yourself as a great discoverer. Helps that you’re an able seaman, horseman and can handle weeks or months long travels without a
problem. You’re great at adapting to the strange things you’re likely to encounter on your journeys
as well, since thinking outside of the box, particularly when it comes to using magical or superhuman
solutions to things, comes naturally to you. Some people might not think of rerouting an entire river
just to clean some stables but you? You’re the smart cookie that can figure out how. "
279,,100,Witch In Training,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Lore,"Magic is at once both plentiful and rare in these times. The world itself is abundant with magic, in
the land and in the beasts, but humanity itself has far less access to it than in modern times. While
magicians and witches are known factors, they are not things everyone can be. You have the luck to
be one of the special few with the potential and the training to start making use of your power. You’re still a novice, with a few years training in a handful of straightforward magical disciplines, but
you’re quite capable with your power, utilising the energy in your body and the world around you
with significant skill. An elemental mage would at least be able to destroy small buildings without
much effort and would be a highly desired force for any practical king’s army. If you have a special
talent, strange as it may be, it’s your ability to cook pancakes. Apparently, you have the skill to make
anything into a delicious pancake. Even say, a demon god, should you have it restrained, beaten and
unable to resist. The pancakes might look weird and have weird effects but gosh darn, they’ll be
tasty."
280,,100,Once Every Century,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Lore,"Talent that comes only once in a hundred years might stand out at the time but against the expanse
of history? It just means there’s been a dozen or two others like that already. World class talent
might be the peak of what normal human’s can do but it’s just the start for those in the magical
world. Like the famed Salieri and his music, you have that world class talent in one art form of your
choosing. Singing, the piano, painting, architectural design, acting or some other method. With just
this and the right connections, you could certainly go down in the history of the mundane as one of
the greatest performers of your art to ever live. But you’ve got the potential to go further, as you
find yourself having a moderately easier time learning magical spells and abilities closely associated
with your chosen art, as well as such things becoming easier to use and somewhat more powerful as
well. Magic cast through a special instrument of the musical art you’ve mastered would be stronger, whereas a great painter would find magic relating to manipulating paintings and drawn images to be
significantly better for them than any others."
281,,100,Magician’s Tome,Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Lore,"Magicians are ill-prepared without their tools. Not that you’d ever be found without your trusty
tome. This book is a powerful grimoire, a magical tool that not only stores a enormous variety and
depth of magical knowledge, but also a tool with which your magical power can be significantly
increased when you use it. Your grimoire is quite old and stores spells that master magicians have
created and encoded, across three or four fields of magical knowledge that you have an interest in.
It does not contain any world-changing magic but would be quite useful to any young mage wishing
to have a guide towards becoming a master. It’s notable for how efficient it is as a magic tool as well,
increasing your power by almost half again when you hold it as you cast spells, and the book has
several minor demons bound to it that will attack any but you that try to force the book to open to
them. You may import a book or casting implement into this role."
282,,100,Prodigious,Fate/Legends - Vive la France,Lore,"The core of an artist is their art. One can hardly claim to matter in the art world if you’re not at least
proficient in some form of art, so you’ll have at least a little talent to get by on. A little, of course, being relative. Whether it be a kind of music, a form of visual expression, a manner of writing or
some strange way to create art, you’ll find you have quite the talent at one such thing. You’d be a
noted prodigy in any of the artistic schools around Europe and with years of effort, might one day be
able to claw your way up to the world stage. Your impressive talents do, one must admit, lie more
outside just performance. However it takes form, you have even more talent at turning your art to
combat than you do making beauty with it. A violin that somehow becomes a lethal sword, songs
that can be used to transmit magical spells to many targets at once. You have a talent for taking art
to a deadly and/or magical level, both what you already specialise in and what else you might learn
in the future."
283,,100,Mind of a Beast Man,Angel Notes,Lore,"Being born from the mix of an animal and a human, you’ve got some traits left over from your less
intelligent side. We don’t mean the humans either! The instincts of your animal form teach you how
to move your body right, how to fight well and other useful things but they also make it hard to act
rationally at times and your fight or flight response is really just too extreme. You won’t find yourself
dealing with any of that. You’ll still get all the useful knowledge from instincts like this but you’ll
always remain totally in control of yourself, at least when it comes to biological impulses like this."
284,,100,Arcane Tricks,Fate/Legends - Garden of Avalon,Lore,"You were apprenticed to a master magus as a child, one that took a liking to you and taught you well. Out of that training you came armed with knowledge of all kinds of magic and how best to use it too. You have a fair degree of skill in over half a dozen magical disciplines, such as Alteration or the
summoning of spirits, and significantly better and more magical circuits as any ordinary warrior or
witch around these parts. If you were in the modern world, you’d be a fair bit beyond the Tohsaka
heir in power and well beyond her in versatility. Perhaps due to your rather quirky teacher, you also
picked up skills on how to really mess with other people. You can get all but the most stoic people to
snarl in anger at you and provoke a good laugh from an entire troupe of soldiers with little effort."
285,,100,Student’s Lifestyle ,Lord El-Melloi Case Files,Lore,"Being a student’s harder than it looks. You’ve got to manage
your time, take good notes, listen to boring lectures, read boring textbooks, search
through a library for references, and write papers that actually make sense. Fortunately,
you’re perfectly adapted for academic life, and have all those skills. You also have a deep seated love for discovery and learning, in general but especially when it comes to the
supernatural, which will carry you through even the most unengaging classes."
286,,100,Teaching Aid ,Lord El-Melloi Case Files,Lore,"You might not have a teaching degree, but frankly you deserve one.
You know exactly how to organize a syllabus, grade papers, lecture effectively, and keep
a classroom full of rowdy teenagers in line. Er, mostly in line."
287,,100,Experimentation and Papers,Lord El-Melloi Case Files,Lore,"You are at home in a lab. When it comes to
experimentation, you know all the procedures, can keep detailed and accurate notes, and will never accidentally violate a safety protocol. You also have the ability to compose
your findings in ways that are elegant, informative, and understandable even to the less
educated. You also have a knack for correctly connecting cause to effect, which would
make you a half-decent detective, though it is nowhere near infallible."
288,,100,Family Library,Lord El-Melloi Case Files,Lore,"A collection of several dozen mystical texts and hundreds of
notebooks which contain all the information necessary to learn common magecraft, and
a great deal of information about your family’s magic and research in particular."
289,,100,Waltzing with the Reaper ,Kara no Kyokai,Lore,"To be a Magus is to walk with death. The very act of using what we call magic, of mixing the Mana of the air with the Od of your body to create Prana and circulate it into your Magic Circuits, is something that has inherent danger. To accept that knowledge and revel in it is to take on the air of something more than human. The petty concerns of human life fade somewhat, making it so much easier to retain the sophistication and grace expected of a refined member of the Association. It requires a will stronger than normal people to brush up against death and that same will, in a rather less dramatic application, is something that allows most Magi to withstand the long hours of study, research and constant requirement for creative thinking when it comes to learning magecraft. Exam hell doesn’t even begin to describe it, when you’re studying to make sure you don’t incinerate yourself from the inside out!
"
290,,100,Magus Education ,Kara no Kyokai,Lore,"An official education! The proper way for a magus to learn his arts, to travel to the famed Clocktower institution and learn from the greatest, and most egotistical, minds of the Mages’ Association. Even if you’re some country bumpkin from the Far East, you’ve had the chance to get a formalized education and degree at the Clocktower over the course of four to eight years. It taught you all the basics of being a Magus, such as decent capability with Formalcraft, Reinforcement, Gradation Air, and Hypnotism. The core arts of any magus, as well as a general familiarity with the supernatural world. You also took on something of a specialty, possibly even a family legacy you inherited, in magecraft. In a field of modern magecraft, you’ve made a name as having decent potential. An amateur to any professional but in your chosen field, from a rookie Alchemist to a burgeoning Elementalist to a spirit user or something more specific, you’ve got a few years training on the other students with no ability at all. Your time there also lets you gain a few friends and contacts at the Association, mostly classmates and perhaps a faculty member or two. You can buy this perk multiple times, gaining another specialization of the same level each time.
"
291,,100,Basic Magecraft - Formal Craft,Tsukihime,Lore,"The standard four practices of Magecraft: Reinforcement, Gradation Air, Hypnosis and Formalcraft. This is the foundation of the modern systems used by Magi in this day and age. You do not start with any of these - The Mage’s Association is largely uninvolved with events and Misaki, and Atlas is more concerned with Alchemy and Mystic Codes than the modern Magecraft systems. You must purchase each one for 100 points, which makes you adept in that particular field - not total mastery, but enough to be a threat against something unprepared for it. Lastly, Formalcraft is enhancing similar magecraft through a long process of ritual and ceremonial sacrifice, which is time consuming but rewarding if you have the patience for it. "
292,,100,Model Student ,Tsukihime,Lore,"If you find yourself regularly skipping class to go on nighttime hunts for vampires or just general adventure, then it pays to be a good student on paper if nothing else. You're a model student, soaking up what teachers say like a dry sponge and speed reading your required studies in but an hour. You learn about twice as quickly as other top students, absorbing academic and mundane skills with very little trouble, even on a time crunch. Supernatural teachings or things like complicated science takemore time, but you’re still an excellent learner as long as you have a good teacher - whether an actual mentor or a very informative book.
"
293,,100,A Rarefied Mind ,Cultist Simulator,Lore,"It would be a shame that in your quest for enlightenment you suffered a lapse of memory. It’s not like some of these secret teachings can be found in the local library. This simple perk makes your memory perfect, limitless, and retroactive, while also allowing for instant recall and perfect indexing. You’ll never forget any moment of your life, no matter how small, and you’ll be able to recall those moments as if you were currently standing there again. As a retroactive effect, your past memories will also be affected, even if you’ve somehow managed to forget them.
"
294,,100,Erudition ,Cultist Simulator,Lore,"The acquisition of knowledge is more than just the senseless hoarding of information. With this purchase you now excel at predicting, interpolating, and connecting information, and can easily cross reference your knowledge with external information, making studying a relatively painless endeavor. Combined, these benefits will allow you to triple (3x) the rate at which you study and convert conscious knowledge into instinctive understanding.
"
295,,100,Textbook ,Sailor Moon,Lore,"Using this textbook, filled with information about any one field of knowledge, ranging from tactics to the curriculum of a high school science class to astrophysics, you can study up on subjects and learn things quickly. You find that studying from these books helps you understand and retain concepts much easier compared to a normal textbook. They have an almost magical quality to them that can help you get an intuitive feel for the book’s subject. You may purchase this item multiple times for different subjects.
"
296,,100,Book​ ​of​ ​Curses​ ​,Sailor Moon,Lore,"This is a standard book of curses, meant to inflict minor things like nightmares, bad luck, and other kinds of evil magic. The curses aren’t very strong, and can be easily resisted, but they sure are annoying.
"
297,,100,Shrine of [Insert Patron Name Here],DC Occult,Lore,"Your power comes from an outside source, and some such sources demand attention, whether through prayer or rituals performed in their names. This is a special shrine, a few feet tall, and made of wood. The drawers at the bottom contain a range of eclectic and occult tools and accoutrements, from sticks of incense to bowels and blood letting knives. All of these are marked with the symbol of your patron of choice, which can be changed with a quick chant... Maybe don’t tell them about that bit, they may not appreciate how quickly your devotion can change targets. It comes pre-devoted to the being of your choice, which can freely change once per jump. Devoting it to other beings will be far easier than it would normally be.
"
298,,100,The Lost Tongues ,Stardew Valley,Lore,"The languages of the magicals creatures of this world used to be far more widely known than they are now. People used to entreat earth spirits in their own tongue for a bountiful harvest or negotiate with dwarves for their solid steel tools. But now only the mages and the intensely curious know them. You’re one of those who can speak to dwarves and earth spirits in their own language. You can also make yourself understood in shadow brute, but most of their kind are through listening to humanity. You will also have a small talent for picking up other mystical languages.
"
299,,100,Esoteric Lore ,Libriomancy,Lore,"You have a body of esoteric lore embedded in your mind. From ancient legends of buried treasure to what really happened to Atlantis, you know all of the old secrets and just how the secret supernatural wars shaped history into what it is today. This knowledge is updated whenever you move to a new world and while not granting you any particularly germane knowledge to your current situation, perhaps you might devise a unique insight or solution based on knowledge that no one else is privy to. (Imagine if you were the only one who knew the story of the trojan horse)"
300,,100,Family Tree ,DC Occult,Lore,"​It can be hard, sometimes, to track down ancestors when one side of the family can live for centuries, but now it’s just a little bit easier. With a drop of blood on this large scroll the names of your ancestors will be filled in - provided their identity isn’t being supernaturally concealed. This only provides the name they would be most commonly known by, which may unfortunately be a title for some beings, but hey - it’s a start."
301,,100,Fluency ,Justice League Dark,Lore,"Magical spells can be a real tongue twister, you know? Luckily for you, that’s not a problem. Whether it’s speaking in ancient Latin, backwards English, or ţ͢h̛̕e̕ ̴̧͡ ̧ş̢̛́͞ ̧ ̛p ̛e ̴̧͡ è̀͜ c̛͟h̀̀͜ ̶̷̡ ǫ̢̨̧̢̛́͟͞͞ ̨̢̨͟͟͞f ̶̷̡̕ ţ̴͡ h ̶̷̡ǫ̢̨͟͞ ̶̷̡s҉ę̸̧̨̢̨̧̀͢͢͟͞ ̧̀̀͜ ̸̨̢̨̨̧̀͟͢͞o ͢ u ̀̀͜ t̛̕͟s ̨̢̨̕͟͞ ì̀͜ ̴̧͡ d ̀̀͜ ę̢̨͟͞ , you’ll never trip over your words or mispronounce a spell. Rather handy to make sure you never summon a demon when you’re trying to wash the dishes.
"
302,,100,Supernaturally Streetwise ,Libriomancer,Lore,"You are familiar with the magical underground, the major players in your area and rumors of all supernatural goings on that travels through the inhuman grape­vine. Wherever the supernatural exists you are able to find it, drawn inexorably to stories, legends and myths which are more often than not true. No matter what world you go to, so long as there is a secret supernatural world you will almost certainly find it with only a modicum of effort."
303,,100,Play Along With Me ,Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline,Lore,"Music is the soul of mankind… and, well, your soul isn’t in your body anymore so it makes perfect sense you’d be good at it, right? What? That doesn’t make any sense? Well, who cares! Pick a single mundane musical instrument. You are now amazingly talented at playing said instrument. You can, if you wish, give magical abilities you have a ‘musical’ aesthetic by having the sounds of your chosen instrument play along with whatever sounds your magic makes...though this won’t add anything except a personal touch to it, mind you. Go forth, Jumper. And play.
"
304,,100,Genius,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Lore,"Maybe you had information implanted into your head. Maybe you had a childhood locked away where the only thing to do was study. Either way you are a genius for your age and have university level knowledge on a number of topics. You excel at mathematics, physics, cooking, athletics and a number of art styles."
305,,100,Perfect Memory ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Lore,"You have a perfect memory, able to remember knowledge of magic that you haven’t thought of in over a decade as if it was minutes ago."
306,,100,Amezaiku Crafting Anthology ,Golden SKy Stories,Lore,"Amezaiku is typically viewed as more of an art form than an expression of culinary ability, though kids might argue that there is no shortage of the latter. Essentially the art of moulding candy into specific shapes, like animals or symbols, this crafting practice originally had religious implications, but has since become an artistic demonstration.

This book teaches you this craft, and as you get more practice you’ll be able to craft them more proficiently. With sufficient magic, you might even be able to awaken the spirit within them – and bring these living taffy sculptures to life.
"
307,,100,Magician’s Mind ,Touhou Project: Parasol Paradise,Lore,"Magic does not come naturally for some, but by taking this perk, you will gain the potential of shattering the barrier to perform magic that many fail to overcome. Even for those already proficient in magic, your own magical be polished as well, allowing you to learn new kinds of magics and special abilities with far greater ease. Additionally, once you do learn a new skill or ability, you will never forget how to perform it.
"
308,,100,I Read About Them Before ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Lore,"Your knowledge of youkai is vast, from all the books on youkai you’ve read. You have a general grasp of all youkai except the most exceedingly unknown ones who have faded out of memory. From your long studies you understand their psychologies, such as how to chase them away and keep yourself safe from their attacks.
"
309,,100,Bibliophile’s Discerning Eyes,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Lore,"You can read anything no matter what language it’s written in. This does not come with the ability to write in that language, but you can read it if it’s a language at all. Including dead and forgotten languages – an invaluable skill if you wish to do serious historical research – but not encoded texts."
310,,100,Real and Fake ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Lore,"You’ve steeped yourself in supernatural energies for so long you can, at a glance, tell the difference between real supernatural texts and fake ones as well as read the energies and emotions in a text, learning exactly how someone was feeling when they wrote something. You could, for instance, tell from a stack of letters which ones were written with love, growing desperation or despair.
"
311,,100,Fairy Fluent - Boosted,Peter Pan,Lore,"You can naturally understand the tinkling, bell-like language of fairies, and also know how to teach people to understand the language. It is the most wonderful of tongues, sounding like the sweetest, most innocent bells whether you are professing love and rudely insulting somebody. However, unless you are a Fairy, you cannot speak it in turn, unless you pay 100 CP extra. (CG Note: requires base Fairy Fluent first.)
"
312,,100,Porcelain Bowl ,Neverland: The RPG,Lore,"A huge porcelain bowl with paintings of violent monsters, humanoids, and other creatures (whatever beings/creatures most frightened you as a child) on the side. The bowl is filled with whatever drink you disliked the most as a child, and drinking the liquid from the bowl lets you understand (but not necessarily speak) any language for an hour. You can bottle the liquid, but the bottled liquid will turn poisonous after several days. The bowl remains constantly full but never overflowing – except in the case that the bowl is destroyed, in which case everyone within range is at risk of being hit by the liquid and in this scenario taking damage from contact with the liquid; if destroyed, the bowl repairs itself and refills in a week.
"
313,,100,Know the Rules ,Wonderland No More,Lore,"The various scriptures for the different faiths in Wonderland can be quite complex – especially the code of honor for the Spirit of Conflict – and that can create a problem when breaking one of said rules can make you lose your spiritual power as a cleric. This perk lets you easily memorize all the various rules and expectations for whatever faith, group, organization, or culture you’re following. You’ll also know what the general costs will be for breaking any of those rules, and how you can properly atone for committing those sins.
"
314,,100,The Articles of Imperial Magic: Pocket Edition ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Lore,"It would appear that one of your colleagues has reproduced the entire contents of the Articles of Imperial Magic in a small, portable volume, with footnotes explaining the more arcane fine print (pun intended). Not only is this tome easy to carry, but an enchantment placed by said colleague will update the book to contain the full text of any code of laws applying to wizards and other law-bound magicians in your future destinations. Note that these laws do not concern the workings of magic, but rather concern the extent of its legal uses and restrictions."
315,,100,Beginner’s Luck ,Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds,Lore,"“What happened, buddy? My bracelet did what now? Huh. Who knew?”

You have a great talent for making use of new weaponry and tools. With just a few swings of a sword, you’d be able to figure out how to effectively wield it even if you had no prior experience with fighting. Whilst it’s a long way from mastery, this instant intuition applies even to more complex weapons like bows, magical rods and hookshots, which would typically require hours of research before you could otherwise hope to use them competently in a fight.
"
316,,100,Treasure Map ,Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker,Lore,"A red scroll, opening to reveal a random location with a single red X located on it. And I do mean random, as it could be pretty much anywhere. The only real guarantee is that it’s going to be somewhere in the ocean. Find where the X is in real life, and you’ll find some treasure. Might be a neat magical artifact, or just some rupees. The map changes a few days after you find each treasure.
"
317,,100,Basic Books ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Lore,"You’re going to need these as a drop-in. These books will provide you with knowledge of up to four paths of linear magic. They’ll get you on your feet, magically speaking."

319,,100,Psychic Abilities - Channeling (One Dot) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Lore,"In the World of Darkness, psychic abilities and mythic sorcery are, at first glance, completely different. However, both manipulate the same powers, albeit in very different ways, and are both considered forms of linear magic. While a sorcerer utilizes numerous tools and ceremonies to harness supernatural powers, a psychic makes do with lots, and lots, of willpower. Furthermore, the majority of psychic powers are innate, and can be improved, but not gained, without outside interference, in stark contrast to sorcery.

The psychic world’s answer to the Path of Ephemera, channeling is sometimes called Necro-Psi, and often confused with the aforementioned Path. It allows the psychic to interact with the spirits of the dead, but not other forms of spiritual beings, perceiving their presence and even drawing upon their skills and experiences.

[1] The channeler may sense nearby ghosts in a vague sense, and channel the skills and knowledge of one ghost of choice, once per day."

324,,100,Clever Craft ,The Elder Scrolls,Lore,"Having been trained as a mage, you know basic spells from each of the schools of magic, and can easily learn new spells."
325,,100,Artist’s Eye ,The Dragon Prince,Lore,"Part of Primal Magic is being able to sketch runes in the air. You, fortunately, have a great eye and memory for detail, and can replicate a rune after seeing it once. Of course, this also helps you be better at drawing in general."
326,,100,Lore ,Terraria,Lore,"You are a seeker of mysteries, wishing to understand this strange world that you are now a part of. As you enter a new location or interact with a new individual, you will gain snippets of understanding about history, lore, mythology, and other information associated with the target of your focus. The more you study them and interact with an area, the more these pieces of understanding will pile up."
327,,100,The Rune is Mightier than the Sword ,World Seed,Lore,"The one thing putting people off the runic language is its sheer volume. Considering that there are ninety-nine million, two hundred and thirty thousand, seven hundred and sixty nine of them, representing every single word and concept in all known languages, even things such as “watering the grass every week”, that’s no surprise. Because of that, even learning the runic language can be a challenge, requiring either a brain implant or some other form of perfect memory.

Anyone who doesn’t have access to these things needs to spend time and effort to search for those runes they’ll actually use and transcribe them into a book or save them to their computer. Luckily, you won’t have to do with such shortcuts: as of now, you are fluent in the entirety of the runic language, and will never forget it. Furthermore, as you will undoubtedly encounter words and concepts foreign to the people in this universe throughout your travels, it will update itself to include runes for anything you might come upon in the future."
328,,100,Eternal Perspective,Danmachi,Lore,"Having potentially lived in Orario for centuries and in Tenkai for millennia. You’re emotionally adjusted to living vastly longer than mortals. You may lose friends and family to age while you live on, you may find cultures changing around you to the point it’s hard to relate it to that you grew up in but you’ll adjust and be able to value the people and era you’re with even more for the fact that you know they may not be around forever. Also your memory for events long ago won’t be any worse than that for more recent long-term memories."
329,,100,Linguistic Talent ,Danmachi,Lore,There are many types of language existed in this world. This grants supernatural insight and comprehension at learning new languages as this allows you to learn dead or magical languages with just hearing someone talking in that language over a prolonged time or staring at an inscribed word for a long time. Potentially you can even create your own language to prevent others from reading your notes.
330,,100,Abstract and Decoder Ring,Marvel’s Kid Heroes,Lore,"A book which contains the past, present and future of the Gibborim and their servants, the Pride, as well as the rites of sacrifice that bind the two.

338,,200,Dabaling,Kate Daniel ,Lore,You have a talent for learning the lower-level powers of any style of magic.

340,,200,Grandmaster,Anima Beyond Fantasy,Lore,"The skills of men are no small things. Though not nearly as spectacular as the arts of combat, or the supernatural, they are never to be underestimated. Your proficiency in a single skill is extraordinary even among those of the masters, and even beyond the limits of mortality; your competence in that skill is such that not even the walls of impossibility stand before you. If the skill were riding, you would be able to ride a beam of light, while skill in climbing would permit you to walk up a wall, skill in Style would make it so that the very world would bend so as to enhance your words as best they can, skill in occultism would have you spitting out ancient rituals with nary a thought, and skill in hiding would let you act right in front of the average man, in a well lit and empty room, and not be spotted."
341,,200,Unfocused,Anima Beyond Fantasy,Lore,"Many psychics are limited. They learn but one or two disciplines, then stop there. Not you. Every discipline is within your grasp, taking no additional effort to learn."

This option essentially allows you to skip ahead through the usual process of studying, training and going on adventures to improve yourself as a hero here. It won’t affect your race nor any Mythic options you choose to pick, as you’ll only have come into Mythic power recently.

For 200CP, you’ve got at least a few years experience with it all. You’re capable and ready for battle but would not be considered a rare sight. The best warrior of a small army, the court mage of a moderately successful kingdom, an important cleric for a regional section of your faith. You’d be more than a match for most common soldiers, even those of the demon hordes. Casters will find their spell selection significantly expanded while martial or skill-focused types are much more adept with their specialties. This experience might give you a more detailed history with the crusades as well, with a reputation based on numerous engagements already being built up. Allies and enemies have already been made, unless you choose to still be a new arrival. "

For 400CP, you can become a major player in the crusades from the start. Your skills in your Class are already the stuff of fables, though not yet enough to shake the world itself. Casters can fling around dozens of mighty spells before tiring, whereas warriors cut through even elite demons like Glabrezu or Nalfeshnee with ease. You’re an elite even in the grandest kingdoms and only the most powerful mortals would be above you. There’s a few steps left between your current progress and true mastery however. This experience almost certainly results in plenty of existing connections in this world, particularly in Mendev itself. Unless you have no presence here at all, you’re likely to be a commander of either the crusade or the abyssal armies that pour forth. A close friend to Queen Galfrey or one of the peers to Xanthir and Areelu in status here.

In this World at least, when a God dies they can not go to any afterlife. They simply will be replaced by some other entity at some point. For you though you WILL be that replacement.

Pick a particular concept, from craftsmanship to light to fire to plants to animals to the sky. Concepts should have more a mythic resonance than precise materialism; a concept of ‘spacetime’ or ‘atomic bonds’ doesn’t fit thematically with Tolkien’s work.

Whatever your chosen concept is, you have deep knowledge and understanding of things relating to that concept. A Maia who chose animals intuitively understands the behaviour of beasts, birds, fish and more, while one who chose craftsmanship is a master of everything from architecture to smithcraft to basket-weaving. Additionally, any magical or spiritual abilities you use related to this concept are uplifted in profundity and strength. Exactly what this means in any given case is fluid, but broadly speaking a Maia will have an easier time and get greater results from doing things with their chosen concept.

This perk may be purchased up to 3 times total. If you have the Arisen in Might perk, you may purchase this perk as many times as you wish. If you are not a Maia, this perk instead represents deep tutelage from a Maia, or one of their students in turn.

347,,200,Stature of Body and Mind,The Silmarillion,Lore,"The men of the West are a blessed people, and you share in that blessing more than most. At a baseline, without significant training, you would be the equal of a notably athletic person in strength, speed and stamina. With a reasonably dedicated training regimen you could equal and maintain Olympic-level strength, stamina and speed, and with true dedication you could go beyond that, achieving feats more on par with Captain America or similar comic-book humans. You may optionally choose to be noticeably taller than most Numenoreans.

Beyond simply your physical abilities, however, your skill can reach beyond the normal limits of mortal craft. This does not increase the speed at which you gain new skills or abilities, but time will only ever serve to increase your skill. If you neglect your skills they will remain without atrophy until you take them up again. So long as you practise a skill, you will slowly find more ways to advance it, even into the realms of what other men might call magic. This advancement is slow, such that it would require a century or more of regular use to achieve this ‘magical’ degree of skill, but it is without limit. Should you somehow overcome mortality, there is not telling the heights to which you could rise."
348,,200,"I’m A Lot Cooler, Now! ",Castlevania - Aria of Sorrow,Lore,"So what if you’re wielding fantastic and even malevolent powers you never knew about until now? They make you pretty awesome! You no longer suffer from angst or existential horror at supernatural or amazing abilities you wield, able to accept who and what you are without denial or fear. This acceptance of your true nature gives you a natural talent in developing or growing in supernatural abilities you can practise with, letting you bypass mental blocks caused by anxiety and fear, as well as allowing you to learn and train more efficiently."
349,,200,Domains and Rights,Grant Morrison’s 18 Days,Lore,"Beyond matters of mere flesh and power, you are a being tied to Concepts, a being such as a God. You have a fundamental understanding of every aspect of this Concept, as in you understand every potential aspect of it and every permutation of it... but have a care, because such things may have meanings different from what you think. After all, it was Krishna (God of Compassion, Tenderness & Love) who understood the need for and triggered the Mahabharata. Effectively, you become a part of the Concept, a living embodiment of it.

You have a philosophical and practical understanding of whatever notion you pick, that transcends reason or possibility. Your ability to expound upon the intricacies of this Concept is so complete that a casual conversation with you on the matter could become holy text read by millions or billions for eons to come.

This works better the narrower your concept. Picking ‘War’ would make you a better general than all the generals ever put together, but picking ‘Everything’ would only make you the ideal Jack of all Trades. Well, more like a Doctorate of all Trades, but you get the idea.

350,,200,Unnatural Skill,Percy Jackson,Lore,"Whether from your heritage or just being that good you've got one particular mundane skill that your feats with border on supernatural. Whether you're a smith on the level of the Cyclopses, a near prescient tactician or a swordsman who is ny unstoppable with a blade your feats will be legendary. You are on a level within your skill such that only other beings of legend can hope to match you. This may be taken multiple times. You may not choose magic but you may choose a particular application of magic if you have it already (so curses, enchanting might work, more specific gets a bigger boost)."
351,,200,Fast Learner,Changeling The Dreaming,Lore,"In many tales and legends, the protagonist is often the best and greatest, a master of dozens of skills far beyond what one would ordinarily expect. Like those beloved heroes and paragons of human excellence, you are a natural born prodigy in just about anything, capable of quickly learning and mastering any abilities you possess or skills you try your hand at. Be it driving, melee weaponry, or one of the many Arts, you’ll become a master in no time."
352,,200,Research Born Of Obsession,Castlevania - Lament of Innocence,Lore,"To be perfectly honest, this probably isn't the most useful thing in the world. Sure, it's a list of all the monsters Rinaldo has seen in his life, with special emphasis on the ones found in Walter's castle, but it's not the kind of thing a hunter would be able to make use of. You see, it's a list of failures. Of combinations of gems and monster parts that don't make anything useful, of how NOT to enchant armor to resist magical effects, and of the things that ultimately killed everyone who went in there before Leon. It's a wealth of knowledge, but there are very few things that can actually be done with it."
353,,200,It Fits Better In Your Hand,Castlevania - Lament of Innocence,Lore,"Though Rinaldo was a scholar, he was also powerful and skilled enough at alchemy to create a number of weapons and armors that allowed him to fight on par with Walter’s minions. Or perhaps it would be better to say that he knew enough of war to actually use those creations competently. Luckily for you, you have a similar twist of fate. Whenever you create something, such as a sword or a spear, if you are not already well versed in its use then you’ll find that using your creations comes naturally to you, allowing you to become reasonably skilled in their use in a fairly short amount of time. ...Sadly, Rinaldo failed to see Walter’s trap, and for all his amazing creations, he was the loser in the end."
354,,200,Supernatural skill(Gain) ,Grimms’ Fairy Tales,Lore,"You have trained for years under a great master and as a result you’ve gained such a skill in a single craft of your choosing that it breaks all logic. Examples:
-become such a good physician that you can cut out your own and others body parts, including the heart, leave them overnight and put them back without issue the next day. Using animal parts as a supplement will cause animal abilities to emerge and even result in changes of character.
-become such a good marksman that you can shoot out the eye of a fly at 2 miles distance and hit targets around corners
-become such a good swordsman that you can fight so quickly and skillfully that you don’t get wet in the rain.
-become such a great tailor that you can stitch together living beings and knit anything back together even broken eggs (baby birds inside included) with them still able to hatch just fine

For an additional -200 cp you will gain the ability to master any skill or trade, art or craft to such a supernatural degree. As long as you train and try to master something with actual effort and discipline you will eventually reach this level within at maximum ten years. In any case the learning curve for new skills will be much lower and your growth much faster.

355,,200,And Knowing Is Half The Battle,Princess The Hopeful,Lore,"Force applied without foresight is meaningless, which is why you’ve developed a unique ability to look before you leap. At will, all your magical abilities can project a magical holographic HUD near you conveying neatly organised and instantly scanned information regarding the parameters and data of your magical abilities-which can limited to your perception, or projected for others to share your insight as you wish. This covers all data you could have reasonably learned with several hours’ study in the background, and continuously updates as you focus. A ritual to summon a demon’s holographic dataslate won’t tell you it’s true name or the nature of it’s Hell if you did not already know it for example-but it would tell you how much mouse blood you still need to spill, how long until the ritual completes, what ambient effects it has on the environment and where the weakest point of the ritual’s disruption lies. Your existing powers to tell the future, see into other minds and otherwise magically gather information are also improved substantively."
356,,200,Tapestry of Ages,MTG - Tarkir                                ,Lore,"A tapestry laid with shifting images of the past, this will always display the true history of any world you find yourself within - though precisely interpreting its twisting images and poetic allusions will take some work, it will serve as an excellent guide to sieve truth from falsehood."
357,,200,Scroll of Mastery,MTG - Tarkir                                ,Lore,"Seemingly-innocuous, this scroll of notes has a peculiar relationship with time, seeming to represent the reader’s own notes on any magical or martial styles they practise - from some evolving period in a possible future or futures, providing hints at ways to improve or develop further."
358,,200,Another Journey,MTG - Tarkir                                ,Lore,"Each of the clans teach their own ways - but those ways are not always the best for all born beneath them. This perk comes with two gifts. Firstly, you will find that societies foreign to your own are more accepting of you, and more willing to teach you their ways - so long as you accept them and are willing to join them in turn. Secondly, you will be able to learn the ways and even magic of other cultures more readily.

Finally, you will find that almost any curse, trauma, injury, fate, negative way of life or other harm can be cured, recovered from or changed, if you are willing to travel far enough and accept other ways of being. As the Abzan adopt orphans of other clans as ‘krumar’, the Jeskai Way can allow even the most violent to find a different path and the Temur care for mad wanderers like Sarkhan Vol, so shall it be with you."
359,,200,Fu Dog’s Book on Magic,Disney’s American Dragon: Jake Long,Lore,You happened across a crazy book Jumper. If you look deep enough you can find out almost anything about magical history and the past. It will even show images of what it is talking about using magic as you read through to help visualize what is going on.
360,,200,The Pop-Up Book of the Paranormal,The Ghost and Molly McGee,Lore,This is a handy guide for all supernatural beings in the world. Comes with detailed pop-up illustrations of their known abilities and weaknesses. Updates every Jump for the setting’s common knowledge of the paranormal.
361,,200,Lucky Card,Wild Arms 2,Lore,"This card holds an enchantment, triggering is as simple as holding in your person. The effect of the card doubles the speed of growth and learning for as long as you hold the card. Unlike the other cards found in this world, this one does not lose power after use."
362,,200,Forbidden Knowledge,Wild Arms 2,Lore,"Some avenues of research are very difficult to study, without experimentation and practice you can’t confirm theories and fully internalize certain knowledge. This is where this perk comes in, you can have a few years of theoretical and practical knowledge about a subject others would frown upon you practicing, all without having to “dirty” your hands. Unless you want to, for some reason.

At a start, you know everything you need to know about how to perform a demon summoning, which is basically magic about transportation and embodiment of dimensional creatures. You have the relevant knowledge to create, alter or improve these rituals or any kind of dimensional ceremony. You can also use this knowledge to exploit weaknesses of these rituals to stop them or at least slow them down. Every new jump or every ten years you can pick another “Forbidden” knowledge to obtain."
363,,200,Development Guide,Wild Arms 2,Lore,"The basics of survival are well and good, but there’s a difference between just surviving and thriving, in order to have a life worth living in this world you need that extra determination. You have an ambition or dream that fuels your willpower and lets you tackle every difficult situation you encounter and lets you succeed where any other would give up.

Also, everytime you look into improving yourself, you will quickly find ways to train your body. You will get an almost instinctual knowledge of how to increase your resistances against harm. Poisons, diseases, forgetfulness, feeling downhearted, being confused, paralysis, petrification and others. You know the best way to increase your defenses against any harmful effect that could hit you in combat. In time you will learn how to mitigate all these ailments."
364,,200,Demonic Trainer,I’m The Grim Reaper,Lore,"It’s boring to see that many powerful beings have in truth little combat expertise, relying only on their own power to fight their battles. This arrogance most times is completely destroyed when they fight someone equal in strength or even stronger than them and, at this moment, they perceive they’re just amateurs that fought just weaklings in the past and now are trying to fight professionals. During these moments, they tend to search for people like us, those that can train them to fight better and help them to become stronger. You’re one of these trainers, but just teaching them at a calm pace and starting with just the theoretical part don’t match your style. You prefer to teach and train them in practice, directly fighting them at the same time that you show their flaws and weakness so they have the opportunity to change their combat style and learn from this experience. The stronger you’re in comparison to your apprentices, the more efficient the training is, to the point a single fight could be enough to match an entire month of dedicated regular training if your power truly eclipses theirs. After all, the more difficult the opponent is, the faster someone’ll improve."
365,,200,Mystical,Mummy: The Curse,Lore,No one among the Arisen is as attuned to the mysteries of death and magic as one of the Jackal-headed. You are acutely aware of supernatural happenings and posses a deep knowledge of occult lore.
366,,200,Guildmaster ,Mummy: The Curse,Lore,"Arisen are all equally old, but not equally competent. There were both luminaries and rank and file members among those chosen for the Rite. Complicating things even further are the vagaries of memory and the fact that some mummies were awoken far more often then their brethren, giving them more time to explore their powers. You are on the high end of this scale, having much more experience with your powers than the average mummy and holding the highest of ranks in your Guild."
367,,200,Memory Unclouded,Mummy: The Curse,Lore,"The Arisen struggle to retain their memories. The Rite of Return grinds away identity to try to make them perfect unthinking servants unless they can find situations that remind them of their mortal lives or better yet relics they themselves crafted in fallen Irem. You, who receive a refresher on your memories at the start of each jump and who are probably surrounded by objects and even people from your time before the Rite, are unlikely to have much of a problem with it.

But just in case you want more protection, for 100 CP you can gain complete immunity to any effect that would cloud, distort, or destroy your memories. You’ll also get permanent perfect recall with unlimited “storage” space so that you can always remember your unending journey through the ages."
368,,200,Eastern Sage,Fullmetal Alchemist,Lore,"Legends tell that Amestris learned the art of Alchemy from a philosopher who told the tale of Xerxes’ destruction in a single night. You too share something with this man in that you can teach even the most untalented and thick people arts that should be beyond them considering their knowledge base. You could single handedly bring Alchemy to other worlds, while creating a new era based on its use, and that’s literally too. All you need to do is teach it as if it was a normal subject and a possibility there, and people will develop the capability in other worlds even if they really shouldn’t. You find you can do much the same for your other mystical abilities."
369,,200,Student Of The Supernatural        ,A Mage Of Sorothustra,Lore,"Like all good Sorothustrans you spent your early years receiving some sort of education. The education given to Sorothustrans is not a universal thing, but the result of extensive tutoring, decades-long apprenticeships, and much individualized, self-driven scholarship. You truly excelled in whatever education you received and now have an inner repository of automatically updating knowledge regarding the supernatural that will always let you know at least commonly known myths and legends, even in settings without actual supernatural beings (exempting you and your cohorts, of course), and gives you even more knowledge in settings where the supernatural concretely exists. You also have the equivalent of a few years of training with any supernatural abilities you gain through CP or whatever nomenclature is affixed to your points in future jumps."
370,,200,Archive,Honkai: Star Rail,Lore,"This Archive is a small room with many bookshelves, but its primary standout feature is the computer console in the middle. This computer will update its information with every world you visit or have visited, essentially becoming an extremely efficient search engine for anything from your jumps, even those without an internet."
371,,200,Combat Expertise,Generic D&D 5e,Lore,"You are a recognized savant with martial skills, but one in particular... it calls to you. This skill is something specific, such as “Longsword usage” or “How to fight unarmed most effectively” or similar. In this one skill, your ability to grow is unmatched, so far as you’ve seen.

Training this skill is not only fun, but fruitful at every turn. With this, you could make your own combat styles revolving around your chosen form of combat, or master other styles as you please. The sky's the limit, the only question is... are you willing to fly?"
372,,200,Heir of Sparda,DMC: Devil May Cry,Lore,"You are a master swordsman and a natural at combat, capable of wielding any weapon you come across with ease. You have all the skill, experience and knowledge of both Dante and Vergil combined. You are also able to call and dismiss any weapon you own, similar to Dante. You can also make a weapon stick to you even without a sheath or holster, like how Dante carries the Rebellion on his back."
373,,200,Instant Report ,Demon: The Descent,Lore,"Your ability to process complex information is inhuman. The trajectory of bird migrations, the statistics of murders in a city hinting at vampire involvement-you have a supernatural ability to make connections and draw useful conclusions from great amounts of empirical data. This isn’t unlimited and not quick enough to be useful in combat faster than sharpshooting, but it wouldn’t take you long to root out all the corruption in a company’s overlooked files."
374,,200,A Natural,DMC 5,Lore,"For free, you get prodigious talent and intuitive skill when it comes to any form of movement, combat and power/ability. You can rapidly grasp the fundamentals of whatever weapon and item you pick up, as well as any ability and power you gain. Even without any teaching, you will quickly master anything you come across, and you are guaranteed to only ever improve, never decline or dull.

For 200, you get to choose between getting Dante or Vergil’s skill, experience and training.

375,,200,Speed-Reading Book,Persona 5 Royal,Lore,"This highly sought after Book holds some neat tricks to speed up your reading... speed. The version you can buy here however has a unique extra effect. Once finished reading, your speed in learning and gaining new skills is doubled for one week. After this period you need to reread this Book to regain the effect. It’s a small Book though, barely ten pages so that’s not a big issue."
376,,200,Skill Cards,Persona 5 Royal,Lore,"This grants you a set of Skill Cards to summon whenever you wish. Per day you can summon 10 of these, either with a Skill already implanted in them or blank and ready to be given an ability that you possess. Once used, these Cards will disappear."
377,,200,Lesser Scroll of Fate,Diablo 3,Lore,"Huh. Did Itherael give you this one or did you write your own Talus’ar? Maybe something else? But no matter. This is a lesser version of one of the most important artifacts Heaven owns. This scroll may only be one page long, but it will always be able to tell you something else when you open it. It tells you what you want to know, even the future, but it can fail in case of unknown factors. It can give you any well-known information with ease or anything written about the past if you want it."
378,,200,Proficiency is key,Diablo 3,Lore,"Being able to swing a sword doesn’t mean you know HOW to swing a sword correctly. Something that you learned quickly. Any skill meant for combat you have can now be further improved by yourself without a master or teacher, simply by using it. The more things you defeat with a bow, the easier it will become for you to shoot arrows correctly. The more enemies you chop in half with an axe, the easier it will get for you to do that. Trial and error around and you will leave masters in the dust after enough time."
379,,200,Somebody’s Gotta Explain Things,Fate/Grand Order Part 1,Lore,"No one person could possibly know everything, and yet someone has to explain to the protagonists what's what. Thankfully, you could fill such a position quite well. You have a vast amount of knowledge on a wide variety of subjects, primarily on history and magical theory. It's not exactly practical knowledge, in that you won't find it easy to arrange magecraft rituals with this alone, but having an encyclopedic level of knowledge on all human history and legends can help quite a bit in devising tactics against enemy Servants. Even obscure systems such as Grands, Beasts, and the dreadful Planetary Class measurements are known to you, as well as a respectable amount of knowledge on things such as the mechanics of timelines and the recently developed Rayshifting technology. Additionally, whenever something that you're not actually aware of comes up, such as knowledge hidden magically or otherwise, you find yourself coming to the right conclusions and making correct leaps of logic to very quickly figure things out to a similar theoretical level of knowledge as anything else. You're also weirdly perceptive, to the point where you can identify what's happening in front of you even with no hints to help you. For example, what a god wielding an Authority in battle is doing would be as clear to you as an open book, even if they aren't shouting their intentions to the four winds like they seem so fond of doing. And of course, you find it really easy to explain what you know to others in a way they can understand easily. In future worlds you'll be given a similar level of knowledge related to the world you are entering. Of course, whether or not you actually explain things is up to you."
380,,200,Chimera Spawn,GrimGrimoire,Lore,"This manuscript delves into the realm of alchemy, seeking to elucidate the mysteries of life creation through experimental synthesis of chimeras. Our findings reveal that the boundaries of alchemical life can be exceeded, and through such attempts, improbable life-forms can arise. These transient life-forms, however, tend to be fraught with inefficiencies that curtail their longevity.

Of these life-forms, the Chimera reigns supreme as an abominable amalgamation of disparate elements that coexist uneasily. The Chimera possesses exceptional physical capabilities, characterized by a potent combination of powerful movement and attack. Yet, this exceptional ability is short-lived, as the Chimera's vitality gradually decreases, compelling it to consume other forms of life to patch its own.

Despite these setbacks, the creation of the Chimera yields crucial insights into the fundamental flaws of artificial life. Through this knowledge, it may become possible to correct the errors that plague many otherwise-created life-forms, rendering them stronger and more durable in the long run.

Speaking through the Hexatheon language allows you to convey images and thoughts, but for those who don't understand it, the words will be incomprehensible accompanied by a terrible headache. Post-Jump this ability to understand languages extends beyond the believable and makes you omniglot and even supernatural ones can be understood and spoken even if you lack the means."

You have stamina for days and the longer the journey the greater the danger., the faster you grow and that's long from a normal person's point of view not yours, a journey with some danger can double your growth, one that the slightest carelessness can lead to death is 10 times growth, this same journey, but over a period of 10 whole years it can result in hundreds of times normal speed. You're a tough nut to crack, built differently."
386,,200,Forbidden Scrolls of the Watchers,Generic Angels and Demons,Lore,"The Gregori, after falling from Heaven, became sort of patrons of ancient humankind and decided to teach them forbidden knowledge, with a portion of this knowledge being only mundane but advanced to human’s current society, like how Chazaqiel taught meteorology and Baraqel taught astrology, while another portion being partially or even straight up supernatural, like how some angels, including Azazel and Gadreel, taught how to produce weapons that could have supernatural traits and how Armaros taught the primitive mages to use enchantments. Either you inherited this from your angelic parent that might had some connection with the Gregori or your hybrid physiology somehow guided you to some of the treasures left behind by the Nephilims of the old, you’ve in possession a set of several scrolls that describe all of this forbidden knowledge, which will include information about the spells, enhancement and branches of science developed by the angels, the workings of reality and the creation of both mundane and angelic weapons even with primitive technologies. While some of this forbidden knowledge might be of little utility for you, it can speed up a primitive tribe’s development to the point of making them able to rival medieval societies in a few generations."
387,,200,Baby’s First Grimoire,D.Y.N. Freaks,Lore,"Core to any Magician’s arsenal, you’ve obtained a magical Grimoire of your own. Sadly it seems to have no innate soul, at least nothing intelligent, but it does contain a good variety of magical spells that run from offence to defence to healing and even some for sensing or finding things. Holding it will allow you to channel and cast with magical energy from within the book and it holds some fair power, even beyond whatever you might personally be able to add to it. Still, don’t expect to be fighting any giant robots with just this thing. Not without a lot of creativity."
388,,200,Knowledge Drain ,Final Fantasy XIV,Lore,"If we represent everything in terms of mathematics - then surely, the world will be open to us only in a fashion that we can understand and manipulate. Even the knowledge within other people would be something available for translation and then perhaps...transcription.

With work, you will also be able to learn in such a fashion, molding what is unknown to you into a known form. You could take an entire library and condense all of that knowledge into complex equations - using it to form the basis of new equations if need be. Or you could scan into the mind of another, and document what they know in the form of numbers and values. Hopefully you're good at mathematics."
389,,200,Future Diary,Mushoku Tensei ~ Jobless Reincarnation ~,Lore,"Sometimes it’s nice if you are given with advice when you are in doubt. With this you gained a diary of a veteran jumper that jumped into an identical world you are in. The diary gives you accurate advice towards your survival along with complementing your goals even goes far as giving hints to solve the problem you are stumped with. This also gives you clues on finding the world-breaking secrets of your current world if there should be one while the diary gives you advice, hints and clues you still have to do the legwork to achieve it. The diary auto-updates taking account of the actions you took so that the diary won’t become obsolete that easily and the diary can only give advice and hints up to ten years in the future."
390,,200,Unified Specialty,Mushoku Tensei ~ Jobless Reincarnation ~,Lore,"When someone tries to train and master Martial Arts and Magic they have to train them individually which consumes a lot of time, but this would solve that problem. This unifies and links all of your physical and magical attributes so that when one grows, the other grows to match it. This is not a recursive loop; it simply balances things out such that whichever is lower is raised up to the level of the higher. In this case your Battle Aura and Mana Reserves are always in balance thus a God-Rank Magician would have a Battle Aura and Physical Feats of a God-Rank Warrior and vice versa. In future jumps, your physical attributes will scale to match your magic and vice-versa."
391,,200,Teacher of Dreadful Truths,Horus Heresy: The Primarchs,Lore,"What is the point of knowing if you cannot pass on your knowledge? Sadly, mortals often can hardly stand learning the dark truths of the cosmos. They tend to react very badly to discovering The Truth about Chaos, the Warp, or any of the other myriad horrors of the 31st millennium. Fortunately, you are at least skilled at adapting your knowledge for mortal minds and teaching them everything you know without causing them to go horribly insane, lose the will to live, and other unfortunately typical results of learning too much forbidden secrets. Perhaps under your guidance you could create a world where knowledge of the dangers of the Warp are widespread, yet civilians know better than to mess with them?"
392,,200,Skyshard Collection,Elder Scrolls Online – The Vestige,Lore,"Skyshards are peculiar objects, fragments of celestial crystal infused with the power of creation. When you touch one, you’re granted a minimal understanding of reality, enough to let you improve your skill without having to practice them. Now you have ten Skyshards in your backyard –or your Warehouse, depending on where you want to put them. Those ten Skyshards will recover their power at the start of every subsequent jump."
393,,200,Amazing Skills,Elder Scrolls Online – The Vestige,Lore,"Imagine that you wanted to explore Water Magic but the memory part of water magic doesn't work in some places like other planes, because, well, water isn’t memory everywhere. In the interest of encouraging you to explore things instead of relying on what’s proven and safe, any skill that you learn with the sweat of your brow will now accompany you in all your travels and work perfectly and without complication even in places where (meta)physically it shouldn’t."
394,,200,Tool Master,Elder Scrolls Online – The Vestige,Lore,"You cannot always be fighting. Sometimes it’s better to take a break from bloodshed and do something constructive. Except Tamriel is in flames right now, and you cannot take the time to go and relax at the forge or something. No more worries! Now, time you spend using a tool counts as training for every other tool too. Swing that mace around to learn how to better hammer metal. Cut vegetables to better learn how to make potions. Cast fireballs on a horde of monsters to learn how to better enchant. No more long grinding session to slowly learn everything you need to survive in this crazy world. The effect is pretty limited the more the tools are different. Swinging a sword will not do too much to increase your ability to cast illusions, but it will do wonders for your ability to knife people in the back."
395,,200,Beastly Mind,Akame ga Kill!,Lore,"The Lord of the Path of Peace possesses several supernatural abilities that are considered God’s blessings, such as healing powers and prophetic visions, but one of his abilities that people doesn’t associate to his hybrid physiology but that definitely is related to it is his superhuman memory that allows him to remember who each one of his followers are and their stories. You also share this same virtually unlimited memory storage and indexing, capable of remembering after a brief reflection the name of a person that you, while partially unconscious, barely met centuries ago. Such a memory capacity not only fits a cult leader but also a beast that may live until the end of the world."
396,,200,The One Pulling All the Strings ,Akame ga Kill!,Lore,"You might not be a good father, maybe even far away from this, but you’re definitely far better when it comes to being a mentor figure to others, however this isn’t limited to only being very skilled in teaching life lessons but, more importantly, you’re particularly skilled in guiding others to achieve their true potential while gaining their trust and molding them to fit your purposes. Such a talent as a mentor is perfect when you’re planning to use a puppet ruler to indirectly control a country."
397,,200,The Master of Torture,Akame ga Kill!,Lore,"During your time hunting and looting Danger Beasts, you acquired a good knowledge of their physiology, however, you further improved it, gaining an extensive knowledge of not only about the beasts’s bodies, but also of human physiology. Your skill and knowledge in the human body allows her to perform immediate medical care to yourself and others, as well as having the needed skills to dissect a dead body to find information on them. But this is only the basic usage of your medical abilities, as this is also the needed knowledge and skill in order to torture your enemies in the most painful way possible while keeping them alive for as long as possible, being a specialist on the most varied forms of torture and punishments. Additionally, your mind is also blessed with a cruel creativity when it comes to developing new forms of torture, mainly when it involves any supernatural ability you might possess."
398,,200,Tome of the Magos Superior,Marvel: Age of Krakoa,Lore,"This book holds anything and everything Apocalypse and later Rictor discovered while trying to create Mutant Magic, and any and every other arcane secret they may have picked up in the process. With this tome, you’ll have everything you need to establish your own coven of mutant sorcerers and figure out what you need to do to generate what spells."
399,,200,Cyberpathy,Marvel: Age of Krakoa,Lore,"Your brain combines the best features of an organic brain and a highly advanced supercomputer. This doesn't make you “smarter” per se, but it does mean that you can store and perfectly recall an infinite amount of information without it being distorted, process far more information from your senses than you otherwise could, perform strenuous mental tasks for longer, and think at far faster speeds—twenty times peak human at a minimum. The exact benefit scales up with your intellect and combines synergistically with any and every other mental enhancement you might possess."
400,,200,Metaknowledge,Marvel: Age of Krakoa,Lore,"This is where it starts to get real. With this, you have a general knowledge of the world you’re Jumping to. The history, the “plot,” the nature and motivations of all the “main characters” and a bunch of the “minor ones.” The whole shebang, really. I got mine by living that #geeklife, binge-reading any comic that struck my fancy but if you don’t want to get that meta, or if you want to play along with that coy summary up in the “Origins” section, it could be that you’re a student of history from the distant future or a powerful postcognitive or what-have-you. However, this isn’t omniscience. It’s only good up until the exact instant you start the Jump so I’d take the time to actually watch Game of Thrones if you’re planning on chasing this Jump with a trip to Westeros. And in a big enough “narrative,” there can be gaps in your knowledge—Deadpool was always a little too “Lol Memes” for my taste which really bit me in the backside when I ran into him in Murder World—and this perk does absolutely nothing to improve your memory or information recall so I really hope you took that one freebie. Oh, and if you want to, in future Jumps you can use this to treat any Origin as a Drop-In, with any knowledge you’d normally gain from your In-Jump history and memories being bundled with the metaknowledge."
401,,200,Yaoguai Bestiary,Chinese Mythology,Lore,"There exists a vast variety of yaoguai in the legends of ancient China. From spirits to ghosts to monstrous beasts, the creatures of the supernatural have as many forms and types as their mundane cousins. This extremely thick book describes the basic information of every creature that appears in Chinese myth, from behaviour, weaknesses, abilities and illustrations of their appearance. This bestiary will update to contain information of supernatural creatures with every new setting."
402,,200,The Unknown,The Destiny Universe,Lore,"Simple study, observation, repetition, and conclusion can only take one so far, and to pretend as though causal and paracausal sciences are incompatible is to miss the point. You understand that the same methods of thought and study that allowed Mankind to dominate the universe can similarly allow you to comprehend the incomprehensible. Where before you were merely guaranteed a metaphorical ‘foot in the door’ to start your studies of any given magical system, now you are all but a savant. No matter the world, no matter its magic, you are an unparalleled genius, able to take that world’s understanding of its more arcane laws beyond even the brightest minds could have ever done on their own. All of the same research and knowledge that the Tower required millennia of collective study to reach could be discovered by you, and you alone, in as little as a century.

Requires Discovering Truth to Purchase"
403,,200,Discovering Truth,The Destiny Universe,Lore,"Following the Collapse, and the creation of Humanity’s Guardians, Mankind was presented with entirely new facets of the universe to study. Unlike causal sciences, however, paracausality by its very nature defied conventional thought and wisdom - observing it told one little to nothing about what it truly was. Faced with such an alien field, the Warlocks rose to the challenge. They took a universe that had previously only been understood through the lens of causal science, and peered deeper to divine the truths of paracausal forces. The vast majority of modern Paracausal knowledge comes from Warlock study. With this perk, you have a natural skill in studying the arcane, the magical, the paracausal. Those fields that don’t follow natural law are now yours to explore. Regardless of the world or the magical system, you can begin from absolute zero and slowly venture outwards, unlocking the secrets of the universe as you go. Given time, you can understand any paracausal system as deeply as the Tower understands the Light and the Darkness."
404,,200,Hive Magic,The Destiny Universe,Lore,"Taught to the Hive by the Worm Gods, Hive Magic is a system through which they call upon and utilize the Darkness. This is not directly invoking the Darkness, but rather is a vector through which they can use it. Primarily utilized through runes, rituals, songs and arcana, Hive Magic has been shown to do everything from travel the stars, perform necromancy, separate souls from their bodies, access the Ascendant Realm, and create Throne Worlds. Unlike utilizing the Light or the Darkness directly, Hive Magic is far less fluid, rather it is closer to programming a computer - each practitioner is possessed of a certain set of immutable instructions, and it is up to them to learn how best to combine these instructions to achieve the desired effects.

Purchasing this perk grants you an affinity with Hive Magic, learning the art and expanding it comes easier to you than the oldest and strongest of Hive Wizards. Furthermore, with each spell learned through Hive Magic, you are guaranteed to never forget it, and like executing a program on a computer, successfully designing and implementing a spell through Hive Magic just once guarantees that future uses of the spell will be successful. Finally, should you so choose, you can pass these skills on to others of your choosing, teaching them the same rituals, runes, and songs that you yourself have learned, ensuring your knowledge will never die. "
405,,200,Mnesiac,Miracleman,Lore,"Your mind is the dragon’s hoard, that unreachable, golden treasure. You have a perfect memory and are immune to amnesia. No amount of blunt force trauma, memory-altering drugs, psychic tampering, strange comic book physics, or anything else can cause you to lose your memories. You can also easily tell the difference from your true memories and any that get implanted into your head after the fact. Your past is as set in your mind as it is in time itself."
406,,200,Hakuda ,Epic of Leviathan,Lore,"Hakuda refers to high speed unarmed combat. This is the second of the Shinigami’s main fighting styles. Some of the notable techniques are Shunko and Takigoi. Purchasing this power will boost your capabilities to match individuals such as Sui-Feng, Yoruichi Shihoin, and Mashiro Kuna. Lastly there is a synergy bonus if you purchase all four of the Shinigami fighting styles. Your skills and power will instead be boosted to that of the members of Zero Division and Yamamoto."
407,,200,Zanjutsu ,Epic of Leviathan,Lore,"This is not necessarily a power, but it is a major part of the Shinigami’s fighting style. Zanjutsu refers to the swordsmanship techniques they practice. There are a wide array of techniques such as Ryodan and Suikawari. This perk will boost your skills to match individuals such as Retsu Unohana, Kenpachi Zaraki, and Sosuke Aizen. Lastly there is a synergy bonus if you purchase all four of the Shinigami fighting styles. Your skills and power will instead be boosted to that of the members of Zero Division and Yamamoto."
408,,200,Appropriated Collection,Epic of Leviathan,Lore,"This is a cache of valuable reading material covering a wide array of fields. The books within this collection are valuable resources to any individual who seeks to learn their skills. This cache will cover a particular profession or group that you may choose. For example if you choose the Shinigami then you will acquire Zanjutsu arts from The Spiritual Arts Academy in Seireitei, Hakuda books from the Headquarters of the 2nd-Division of Soul Society, Hoho arts from the 2nd-Division Captain's personal collection, and Kido arts from Aizen and the Captain-Commander's personal collection. You may purchase this to acquire multiple caches of books. Post jump this will update if applicable and you may choose a new category of information.

409,,200,Escalations the Name of the Game,Epic of Leviathan,Lore,"When you have a good idea you need to run with it and press your advantage while the iron is hot. This perk makes it so that it actually is possible. You gain the ability to rapidly expand and grow on a truly impressive scale. Each time you purchase this you may apply it to one aspect you possess. For example some options include your perks, powers, skills, and properties. If you choose properties then you would gain the opportunity to rapidly expand your businesses. Maybe you would start out with a single restaurant and you could end up with a restaurant in every country on the planet in a few months.

This will only provide the opportunities however, you will need to seize them yourself. If you choose skills on the other hand you would probably constantly run into experienced individuals who want to pass on their skills. You would probably need to pass a test, but if you succeeded then you would certainly gain a powerful teacher.

410,,200,Brain Blast,Final Fantasy XIII-2,Lore,"You have this innate knack for figuring out important details and historical information in the world, by conjuring a strange figure (You can choose who this is based on your experiences) who will feed you information in the same way as a game show might. The information they feed you is usually aligned with things you actually want to know. (Most of the time anyways) Your ability to retain information is also increased."
411,,200,Idiot Savant,Cultivation Chat Group,Lore,"While you may not be anything special in most other areas, there is one area in which you shine. This could be something like talisman creation or shady divinations. This talent is strong enough that even those of greater cultivation than you probably can’t match you in it if it’s a production talent, or lets you do something quite casually that normally is hard or unreliable if it’s something more abstract like fortune telling.

412,,200,Improved Experience Modifier ,Bofuri,Lore,"It seems you collect three times the experience as normal. And I’m not just talking about in NWO. Any training, learning, or practice yields three times the result it otherwise would."
413,,200,Memories of Anotherself,Black★Rock Shooter,Lore,"You’re not them, you just... look like them, but perhaps that is enough, no? The closer you look to someone else, the more you’re able to draw upon their memories and personalities to help complete the disguise that you’re going for or otherwise help you pick up the pieces if you’re not so sure of what you are anymore. Due to picking up the memories of this person it'll also allow you to utilize their skills more effectively, even supernatural ones if this transformation you’re in allows for that sort of thing.

As a bonus, you’re able to fool items that only allow one person to use them so long as you look like them in the first place. If you look like Ainz from Overlord, you can use the guild staff without any problems and so on."
414,,200,Learning of Airmed,Irish Mythology,Lore,"It came to pass that when Miach, the greatest healer to ever live, died, murdered by his jealous father, that all the medicinal herbs of the world grew from his grave and his sister Airmed did gather and order them, but their father Diancecht did scatter them, and so men were forced to learn them by trial and error. You, however, know all the properties and uses of every herb in the world, whether magical, medicinal or toxic. This knowledge updates in future Jumps."
415,,200,Beneath The Throne,Dies Irae,Lore,"You gained a brief peek into the Throne itself and while you gained no power or nature from it, you became aware of a wealth of information that only one other man is normally privy to you. You are innately aware of the true nature of existence, of the identity and nature of the creator or ruler of all existence and of a great deal of other information about the universe that you find yourself in, its metaphysics and its structure. Much of this knowledge is lost, hidden or protected but in this world and even in future worlds, you will always possess this knowledge on existence and it’s ruler, even if it might be desired otherwise of you. This knowledge will never harm you to possess nor will anyone immediately know that you possess it."
416,,200,The Greatest of Challengers,Dies Irae,Lore,"How can one hope to reach the greatest heights of power without some motivation? A rival is a perfect source of such motivation, something far truer for you and any rival you have than for others. Whenever you are part of a rivalry between yourself and another being, that rivalry will steadily increase the rate at which you learn and grow so long as the both of you continue to strive to compete against each other. So long as you continue to desire to have them as your rival and treat them as such, they will benefit from this steady increase to their growth rate as well, providing you with a challenger who will constantly be able to push you to grow even better than you were."
417,,200,Real Memories,Dies Irae,Lore,"Through the blood that runs in your veins, you have a connection to your forefathers. The genetic memory of all those who preceded you biologically is still present within you, in a way. Over time, you slowly absorb the memories and knowledge of your direct ancestors, starting from the most recent and going back as the years go by. Some of this knowledge will be useful, some outdated and some plain scary to know at all. You’re able to force this genetic memory to focus on specific ancestors with time but it can be actually quite tiresome to do. "
418,,200,Self-Made Man,The God of High School,Lore,"Training in the martial arts on your own is rarely a good idea. Who knows what fatal mistakes you could memorise into your fighting style or what ways you could hurt yourself learning a new technique? You manage to buck this trend to an extent though. Even despite lacking a teacher or teaching materials, you seem to fall into the correct procedures for learning the martial arts on your own. You’ll instinctually correct your movements to be more in line with the style you are trying to learn and you’ll get a warning feeling whenever you’re about to try something that will definitely hurt you. It’s not as good as having a real master teach you personally but you’ll actually manage better on your own then with some ordinary teacher in the martial arts with you."
419,,200,The Crusaders ,Final Fantasy X,Lore,"Well even if you’re completely new to this world, it’s good to at least have a foothold somewhere right – some place that you can consider as a safe haven is better than nothing. Thankfully, you’ll find that the Crusaders seem to be somewhat sympathetic to your plight.

In addition to making you a better fighter against fiends and massive beasts alike, you’ll find that the Crusaders also have ample supplies, being aligned with the Church of Yevon. There’s word that they’re planning something big against Sin though...though you’re a bit too new to be involved straight away. In future worlds you go, you’ll find that your Crusader training can help you adapt to  monster attacks better and respond to them quicker."
420,,200,Cloistered Souls,Final Fantasy X,Lore,"Years spent sheltered inside Guadosalam has given you plenty of time to look inwards and develop yourself, rather than be distracted by the outside world. The outside world has nothing to offer you...but there are secrets within yourself just waiting to be discovered. As you meditate, you’ll find that you can learn and develop skills at a much quicker rate than normal – the deeper your trance, the more effective this becomes.
 
But be careful of tunnel vision...after all, a person can only go so far alone. You may find yourself going in circles if you obsess too much...and you’ll only end up limiting yourself. Maybe that’s what getting some exposure to the outside world would be good for."
421,,200,Moon Scepter,Elantris,Lore,"Kept by the curators of the Rose Empire, the Moon Scepter would appear to be an exquisite, if mundane, light blue rod covered in intricate carvings. However, this art piece hides a powerful secret; the carvings that adorn its surface contain translations between the different magical languages used on Sel. An Elantrian who studied the Moon Sceptor could access the Dor in Fjordell using Dahkor symbols, or take their magic to MaiPon using Forgery markings instead. This artifact alone doesn’t grant the ability to use Investiture, but it is a key component in adapting different types of Investiture to work with each other. See the Notes section for additional details."
422,,200,Fervent Focus        ,Elantris,Lore,"With the dangers of Elantris and the torment of the Shaod, Prince Raoden would have been forgiven for ignoring the secrets of AonDor and focusing on his survival. Thankfully for everyone, he chose to attack his studies with the same ferocity that fueled his altruism. Now you share his dedication and drive. Whether you’re studying Aons or practicing your Forging, you have the focus and determination to plow through the countless hours necessary to truly master a craft. In return for your commitment, you’ll see a steady benefit in your studies. As long as you dedicate yourself fully to the task, you will learn new knowledge and skills twice as fast as you normally would."
423,,200,A Handy Book        ,RWBY,Lore,"Found this on a Farm? This little book can give you details about all sorts of Monsters you may meet on your Journey. For every new beats you encounter, a page is added and should you find yourself in... odd circumstances I advise you to take a look at the newest page. You might be under the influence of a newly discovered type of Willpower draining Grimm without knowing. The Book will know however and detail you exactly what the beasts abilities are."
424,,200,The Defenders of the World         ,RWBY,Lore,"Let’s be honest... you can’t do this job forever. Sooner or later you will have to retire. It is good then that there are many young aspiring heroes around to fill your place once you won’t do it anymore. If you like you can have a direct part in their training. It will become easy for you to train any young heroes, passing on your (learnable) skills and knowledge to the next generation of Defenders. In time, even a certain Jaune Arc could go from a hopeless case to a capable fighter."
425,,200,Dyne,Final Fantasy IX,Lore,"Though it seems to be excerpts from a book elsewhere, this manual guide is titled “Considerations of the Perfect Genome”. There’s a long list of techniques, skills, and traits in here – perhaps all considerations made by the first creator of the Genomes, and from the various descriptions it appears this guide illustrates the potential paths a “Perfect Genome” could have followed.

There are a couple useful tips and tricks that you can draw out of this, though a lot of the pages have been crossed out or scribbled over. You’ll learn a set of Dyne skills and the equivalent base skill, namely “Free Energy”, “Tidal Flame” and “Scoop Art”, though the rest you’ll have to innovate yourself, or learn from perhaps another Genome in the world."
426,,200,Big Fucking Heavy Book,Hazbin Hotel/Helluva Boss Pilot,Lore,"This book’s most basic function is Dimension/World hopping. While you can’t hop to other jumps until you spark, demi-planes, connected worlds, etc. are all pretty easy to learn to poke your head in. Just don’t get it bitten off. Actually, do, so that I don't have to see your fugly ass face."
427,,200,Not That A Yankee Would Understand Me,Solo Leveling,Lore,"Communication is a key factor for Hunters inside a dungeon. Sadly, the language barrier usually makes assembling international teams a difficult task at best. Even for non-humans that can speak their own tongues, communication between different species can possess a problem.

Unlike most beings, you don’t seem to have that problem. Be it due to your own magic, such as the High Orc Shaman Kargargan, or due to speaking the ancient language that some Monarchs and Rulers use, you are capable of understanding and being understood by every sentient being. Being able to speak to one another may be useful to solve so me conflicts, but different interests would still mean that preventing blood from flowing will not always be possible."
428,,200,I Love Your Style: Sincere Admirer,Avesta of Black and White,Lore,"Appreciation for an opponent’s power and talent, regardless of their side, is a common trait among the warriors of the Evil side. And what better way to show your respect for an enemy’s style than through pure imitation? You have a natural talent for analyzing and dissecting the techniques of your enemies after crossing blades just for a few minutes, before being able to start to reproduce them on your own. It may not be a perfect reproduction, but when it comes just to pure combat styles, and disregarding actual supernatural abilities, you are able to take them apart and assimilate them into your own style as easy as you walk."
429,,200,A Well Preserved Sword: Body of the Kings,Avesta of Black and White,Lore,"For someone as busy as you, it may seem impossible to maintain your martial skill when you are left behind, buried under the paperwork. Yet, you find that your abilities refuse to degrade over time, and whenever you grab a weapon, the experience accumulated over years rushes into you as if you were still in the midst of a campaign. Regardless of how long it has been since you trained or saw real combat, your battle prowess and skills never seem to rust."
430,,200,Growth Curve,Fate/Grand Order,Lore,"Not everyone learns the same way. An oft repeated childhood saying has rather more relevance in this world and for you especially on buying this option. The way and speed you learn has been altered to one of three modes of which you may pick only one. Linear Mode will allow you to always learn at a constant rate. You will learn as fast as at the start as you do during the middle and ending stages of your learning, even if the process would normally slow down greatly in one of these phases. S Mode learning reduces your learning rate during the beginning and ending stages of training but magnifies it greatly during the middle portion of your growth. Reverse S Mode alters this by having you grow much faster during the beginning and later stages of growth, while slowing down significantly during the middle stages. This alteration cannot be changed once picked."
431,,200,Abnormality Pages,Library of Ruina: HamHamPangPang,Lore,"The Library used to be the main facility of L Corp so the agents, clerks, and sephirot became librarians, but what happened to the abnormalities? Well, they became the books, and not just any books or even the ones used as equipment by librarians, Abnormalities give pages capable of changing the user’s abilities in various ways, reflecting those of the abnormality with its weaknesses and strengths. There are two kinds of them, breakdown(red) and awakening(green), with different abnormalities giving different pages. Breakdown pages are usually stronger but come with a downside like an ability that requires getting hit to use or doubling all bleeding caused by you and your enemies, while awakening pages are completely positive effects but usually aren’t as powerful as breakdown pages. Each purchase gets you a single floor’s set of abnormalities, and you can freely use up to 5 at a time, 2 tier 1 pages, 2 tier 2 pages, and a single tier 3 page, you can freely mix pages from different floors if you have multiple available.

432,,200,Book Smarts,Library of Ruina: HamHamPangPang,Lore,"The most distinctive thing about the Library is how when someone dies in there they are turned into a book which can then be used by the librarians to replicate the skills and equipment of whoever got booked. Now you can do so too, regardless of if you’re in the Library or not. These capabilities extend beyond just the books made by someone killed in the Library or by you if you have Beaten into a Biography, you can use the power of any book regardless of what it is about or who wrote it, with different subjects and levels of expertise from the writer changing the effect and power of the book."
433,,200,Artificial Existence,Bibliomania,Lore,"Like I mentioned in the beginning of this jump, humans aren’t the only beings in this world. You are still human but are a result of experiments that create some of the entities that may still exist in this world. Effectively you are modified yet artificial which puts your base physical and mental capabilities to the peak of your species. But that's just your base, since you can now train and improve yourself to be 2 times better than you should be possible allowing you to go from post human to superhuman. Most important about this is that any enhancements you gain also benefit, allowing you to train them to be twice as powerful as what should be possible."
434,,200,Mind of Illustration,Bibliomania,Lore,"You remind is special, being that your mind is a fantastical advanced mental book keeping a detailed archive of all you have experienced and learned with all that information being a single thought away, hell you remember with such clarity now you could vividly describe the complete experience of your birth and every word, sentence and intent you have ever heard. Your mind simply doesn’t forget and more importantly you have full control over it. Nothing can read your mind without your permission as if your mind itself is in a different language, coded, and sealed away from view all at the same time, it would take very powerful psychics to even notice your mind with how subtle it is as well and even then you have a passive defense of your mind seeming normal. Due to the way your mind works now you have an absurd reading and comprehension level allowing you to read 20 times faster than before casually and learn and comprehend from written word as if you have studied and practiced whatever it is you are reading, though keep in mind that aside from Mental knowledge and skills your physical skills can develop from this but will seem un trained or rusty until put into practice at which point it would only take a few moment to fully practice the skills. You think clearly and can focus on 5 things at once from now on with the ease of focusing on 1."
435,,200,Skilled Development,Bibliomania,Lore,"You are now very talented being that you now improve physically and mentally twice as fast as before but for skills you now improve 5 times faster than before. Now you might be wondering why not just take Body conTrol for that growth instead of this perk. 1st, your skills will now naturally lean towards optimizing and improving via repetition, meaning you will improve skills just by using them as if actively training them. 2nd you now have the peak natural talent for any skill you attempt, you won’t be good off the bat but you will effectively have a higher base learning rate for any form of skill. 3rd your skills no longer degrade meaning that your skills will be just as good as when you stopped practicing no matter how long it's been. 4th and last if you are starting training a new skill and already have similar skills you will find your pre-existing skills experience will enhance your new skills growth rate, the closer a skill is the faster the growth and multiple stack, though only to the same level of skill. Almost identical skills will see growth almost doubling while something that's only tangentially related(such as Piano and Guitar both being music skills with no direct overlap) will improve growth only by 1% minimum."
436,,200,Guide Book,Final Fantasy VII: Remake,Lore,"This book contains maps of another world! This tome offers readers details about the geography, politics, and culture of each world they visit. The book changes to suit the current setting on arrival, and contains plenty of space to take personal notes. Should you find yourself in an alternate timeline or mirrored version of a familiar world, the book will detail the differences between the prime setting and any divergent timelines. Wherever you wander, you’ll always be informed!"
437,,200,First Class Saber Teaching Licence,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Lore,"Sabers don’t spring up from nowhere. Sometimes. They mostly do but the best Sabers are the ones you raise yourself! Legally, one can only raise a proper Saber if you have the right qualifications. You passed every licensing test with flying colours and now any Saber would be lucky to have you as a professor. You’re not just brilliant at teaching other Sabers to be better Sabers in the ways you do know, such as the skills and abilities you purchase here, you’re even great at helping them develop the Saber-like qualities you don’t even have. A knightly teacher could cheer and encourage their magical student so well they make leaps and bounds of progress each night! Those not blessed with the Saber class, or a similar focus in life, can still learn Saber-like things from you at an accelerated rate. They’ll just have to accept that they’ll never be quite good enough for you."
438,,200,Goddess Scriptures,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Lore,"This is definitely how archaeology works. You’ve uncovered a hidden cache of records, each one billions of years old. Somehow, they still hold information on the ancient history of your universe. Each log reveals the secrets of how things came to be, what came before and details on the true creators/rulers of existence. Even should there be no logical way for anyone to have recorded or remembered this information, you’ll be able to learn it through these logs, along with much secret information on how the universe works metaphysically. Whenever you travel to a new universe, the scripture box will reveal a new set of logs with adjusted and appropriate information."
439,,200,Kinetic Learner,Honkai Impact 3rd,Lore,"You learn faster physically and through experiencing stuff than from classroom environments. This does not mean that you learn slower from classroom environments than you did before – it simply means that you’re more of a kinesthetic learner than before, and you learn things about ten times faster when you learn it kinesthetically. And, when it comes to combat, you can learn it ten times faster kinesthetically than you can learn normal things kinesthetically, meaning that you can learn combat one hundred times faster than normal."
440,,200,Book Drop,Library of Ruina V1.0,Lore,"Librarians have a need for books, and this power allows you to gather them from other avenues of life. Upon besting an opponent either through combat or through some kind of competition, a book based on the opponent may drop. The contents of the book widely vary based on the manner of their defeat. Defeating a champion through chess may describe well known strategies of chess and their perspective on it. Whereas killing a man will often provide a biography as well as the person’s own musings on their favoured subjects. The odds of a book dropping depends primarily on the emotions of your opponent at the time of defeat. At the height of despair moments before death could net you several books giving a full biography of the person, while losing a casual game of darts will need plenty of luck to even give you a page."
441,,200,Book of Ruina,Library of Ruina V1.0,Lore,"It’s not the one perfect book being sought after, but it should prove useful for those who wish to log their adventures. A grand and thick book that records data of realms, regions, animals, monsters and significant figures that you and your companions encounter. The book is impossibly durable, repairing itself and regrowing pages in seconds. All the information in the book can be sorted, filtered and otherwise tailored to you (and any readers you may designate).

442,,200,Abnormality Pages,Library of Ruina V1.0,Lore,"These sheets of paper are like strange contracts that enable the use of powers and abilities from one person to the other, provided certain criteria are met. For example, gaining the ferocity and regeneration of a werewolf, but while the recipient is in combat, currently in a heightened emotional state (typically anger and frustration) and can actually see a moon. How strict the conditions are depend on the amount of power and traits being provided. Some of the strongest effects can go as far as channelling the being themselves, granting their entire moveset, but only capable of doing so in highly intensive or long lasting battles."
443,,200,Scroll Collection,Final Fantasy VI,Lore,"Magic scrolls exist in this world but are rarely seen in this era. Most consider them merely collectables of the past. But the set granted to you, contained in a handy scroll case, has their magic well intact and ready to be unleashed. The case contained two scrolls of fire, water, and lighting, each capable of unleashing a blast of elemental magic on an entire group of enemies when activated. It also contains three that grant the user invisibility and three more than create several illusionary images of the user. Both operate for a short time before the magic fades. The case will automatically refill any used scrolls every third day."
444,,200,Monster Knowledge,Final Fantasy VI,Lore,"The Magi have been around for quite a while. They survived the War and the thousands years after despite every hardship. What has helped them the most is their studious nature and curiosity. You’ve taken that spirit to heart and dove into the literature of sages past. And whether due to sheer passion or simple age, you’ve learned all there is to know about the monsters of this world. You understand their weaknesses, their strengths, and just which spells hurt them the most. Even better, any monsters you choose to study in other worlds will reveal their secrets to you much more quickly."
445,,200,Divine Mind,God Of War (2018),Lore,"With this perk your mind is something truly divine, in comparison to mortals that is. Not only is your intellect greatly boosted but your ability to develop your skills is as well. If you put enough focus into one skill, let’s say for a decade, then you would be able to become skilled enough to be known even by the gods. Though keep in mind that this skill alone would not make you the best among the gods, though it could if you spent a century practicing this one skill. Keep in mind that this perk does synergize with other perks that boost skill development."
446,,200,Book of Dreams,Thailand Mythology and Folklore,Lore,"Some dreams can have omens of the future. Some are just meaningless gibberish. This book deals with the former, although sometimes it might seem that all dreams are prophetic. It's quite a thick tome, having almost a thousand pages and likely more hidden away through magic. Thankfully it has an index to navigate it efficiently. What it can be used for is deciphering dreams, which almost always give clues of a future event, usually the immediate kind that'll arrive within a month. Even in future worlds this'll work as intended, letting you diagnose a person's immediate future even if that world doesn't actually have any kind of prophecy or fate. Do be careful, people aren't very pleased when their future is grim."
447,,200,The Time Has Come,DxD Universe,Lore,"You wait long enough, but at least waiting has paid off, because the longer it takes to get revenge against someone else the faster you grow, with this maybe you could reach the level you need, this doesn't work in any revenge however, it must be something that really makes you mad, the death of a loved one for example."
448,,200,Language Lessons ,Fate/Apocrypha V1.4,Lore,"It would be unfortunate if you showed up unable to speak the local language or travelled to another country here that you weren’t too familiar with. Now you can read, write, speak and understand any normal language, which can either be like learning a language like everyone else, showing up as subtitles only you can see, or make it seem as if everything is in your own native language. Basically, it works however you think would work best for you. You can pay 100CP to keep this in future jumps, and for 200CP you can communicate in anyone’s native language even if they’re from a different time or planet, so feel free to converse in Sumerian, Ancient Greek, Klingon and whatever else you encounter. You can use, lack, perceive or not hear the correct accent for the language, at your preference, and you’ll be aware of literal translations of names as well as how they should be said. Doesn’t automatically solve things like codes with just this though, at most you’ll be aware of that trick when people say something in a language they think you don’t know and claim they were saying something other than what they actually said."
449,,200,Intuitive Mimicry of Skill,Final Fantasy V,Lore,"There’s a saying that imitation is the highest form of flattery, but your imitation begins to take on a whole new level. If you are able to watch someone for a time with a higher level of skill than yourself (or if you can temporarily gain additional skill), then you can determine exactly what makes them more skilled, and incorporate it into what you’re doing. The more advanced they are over your current skill, the longer it takes you, but as long as you can replicate what your target does, nothing is out of your reach."
450,,200,LITERACY,CthulhuTech,Lore,"You are well read. You can speak a couple foreign languages, and can of course read and write them too. You also know how to read four dead languages, usually ones used in ancient magical writings like Akkadian, Aklo, Aramaic, Coptic, Latin, Old Norse, Pnakotic, R'leyhan, Sanskrit, or Tsath-yo. This also make learning new languages easier."
451,,200,PROFESSIONAL,CthulhuTech,Lore,"You have a professional skill. You could be a doctor or lawyer or accountant. You could be a mechanic or craftsman. Whatever it is, you have a job that you can fall back on. It won't save you if the human military is overrun or if any of the doom cults' attempts actually bear fruit, but it lets you feel productive as you pass the time. This perk can be purchased multiple times

452,,200,The Courage to Protect,Library of Ruina,Lore,"The Library isn’t known for its consistency of armaments, one day you’re using a flaming bat, the next you’re busy using a butcher knife in one hand and a gun that shoots freezing bullets in the other. Now of course, the Library itself usually covers this issue for you by providing the experience of whatever poor fool got invited while wielding that weapon, but now that proficiency extends to any armaments you pick up. Even if you’ve never seen a violin case full of mechanical phalanges before, you can draw upon the maker’s vision of how to use it to manage a passable job, even better if it had prior wielders."
453,,200,Dance Fight 69,HighSchool DxD,Lore,"The ones that were forged in war are just built differently. Not only are you a descendant of a hero, but a hero in your own right. After years and years of training, fighting, and studying, you have become a one-man army. One of the greatest examples of humanity’s potential. A master in several martial arts, capable of using any weapon efficiently with one in particular you have mastered to the limits of human capacity. And even have become a proficient user of Magic, if one more centered towards practical uses rather than showy spells. Similarly, if you have a Sacred Gear, you’re proficient in its use and privy to its secrets already."
454,,200,Disciple of Chiron,God of War,Lore,"There are few teachers as famous as the centaur Chiron, who trained such heroes like Hercules and Achilles, both heroes who have gone on to make immortal legends.

Your learning speed is enhanced, and any skills of yours (including those from classes, freelancer or otherwise) improve almost twice as fast as others in this world."
457,,200,Modern Day Kheiron ,Fate/Strange Fake,Lore,"There are some people that are born great. You may or may not be in this category, but you have one special talent: to help others with more talent to reach even greater heights. When you come across a talented person, even if you lack a perfect knowledge of their field, you have an incredible insight in how to better the technique and abilities of others, and even how to communicate this in incredibly short lessons.

Finally, those who become your students also end up becoming quite fond of you, even if they may not fully respect you or your abilities, they will always be open to come to your aid should you need it."

This spellbook contains the basic healing spell Cure and the Poisana spell, which purges toxins and poisons from a living body.

Through such ethereal comprehension, you are able to broaden your sense of proportion and scope to encompass the context and worth of all manner of things beyond human reckoning.

With this you can at least be assured you’ll be a natural learner for all kinds of new experiences, and always be able to keep an open mind for new vistas and ways of being. Within days of arriving in a new culture you can learn the customs, figure out how to fit in and sniff out who’s in charge. This lends itself well to picking up new skills too. You may not be the greatest swordsman or painter ever to live, but you’ll find yourself picking up the trade a lot quicker than most."
467,,200,Monster Book of Monsters,Wizarding World,Lore,"Written by one Edwardus Lima, the Monster Book of Monsters is a rather interesting tome. While being a very informative guide on creatures that can be found in the world, the thing is named Monster for a reason. The book is in fact a living thing that will bite and gnaw at anything it can get its jaws around. Fortunately for you, the book likes you and will let you hold and read it as much as you desire. The same can’t be said for everyone else though.

Moving on to its benefits, the book already contains a veritable treasure trove of knowledge of every creature that can be found in this world. It details their strengths, weaknesses, habits, temperaments, and so much more. Basically, if it can be found in a high-class encyclopedia or bestiary, this book will have it. Of course, it also has a special feature just for you. In every new world you find yourself in, this tome shall update itself, writing down new pages of information for every manner of beast to be found within such worlds."
468,,200,A Set of School Books,Wizarding World,Lore,"School can be a difficult time for many people, even for those you’d believe to excel in such things. But what students often forget is that they are not the only ones suffering and that they are not alone. Help will always be given if they but ask. And if they cannot find help in the present, then they can always find help in the past, from the students and teachers who came before.

At first glance, these books appear to be nothing more than ordinary schoolbooks with some wear and tear due to use and age. But open them up, and you will see writings on almost every page. Examine these writings and you will see that they have information quite relevant to the book at hand. This information is generally better than what you would normally find on the book but it’ll be quite useful regardless of the form it takes. You receive a new set of these books every time you start a new class, regardless of the subject."
469,,200,Book & Quill,Wizarding World,Lore,"Within Hogwarts, there is a book and a quill, one of Admittance and one of Acceptance. Together, these two magical relics work in tandem to ensure that names of each and every person with a scrap of personal magical talent are written down so that they may be admitted into the school. Not once has it failed in this task. Not once has a Squib or other non-magical person ever been admitted into Hogwarts.

Bound in black dragon-hide and dipped in silver ink, your copy of these two items are meant to serve the same purpose. Without fail, the names of every person with magical potential in the world shall be inscribed within the book. With this, you will be able to create the foundation of something like the eleven Great Wizarding Schools. With this, wizards and witches shall be made known to you. Whatever shall you do with such a thing?"
470,,200,Safe & Sound,Wizarding World,Lore,"If you were to compare magic to any natural element, it would perhaps be most similar to fire. Like fire, magic has changed people’s lives and like fire, magic can run rampant and take away life as easily as it saves it. After all, there are no shortage of witches and wizards who have met their ends in magical experiments. Fortunately for you, you are far from the foolish sort.

You now have considerable experience when it comes to all manners of research and
experimentation which means that you know the processes involved in such things and you know what safety measures are needed to ensure that everyone will come out of it unharmed, mostly.

Not that you’ll need that last one when you consider that, unless acted upon by an outside influence, your experiments will never have any risk of catastrophic failure. It doesn’t even need to be your experiment. So long as you’re somewhat involved in the process, you don’t have to worry too much about catastrophes and disasters."
471,,200,Heir of Slytherin,Wizarding World,Lore,"Salazar Slytherin was one of the four founders of Hogwarts, and he possessed a peculiar talent. Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth and so, he could talk to snakes, communicating with them through Parseltongue, the language of serpents. Perhaps you are a descendant of his if this ability of yours is any indication. Others will certainly believe so should you deign to make such information public. They might even name you as his heir.

As a Parselmouth, you will be able to converse with any serpentine creature, from the simple and common garden snakes to even the great and mighty basilisks. But more than that, your status as a Parselmouth ensures the loyalty of mundane serpents of any kind and the respect of all other serpentine creatures, enough that they would be willing to follow your commands unless you prove yourself unworthy. And with Parseltongue, you know how to enchant or create objects such that they will only respond to those who can speak the tongue."

This perk makes you skilled in whatever skills are desired in a club of your choice. The Engineering club would make you skilled at making wacky inventions, while picking the Hot Spring Development club would make you better at determining the locations where underground hot springs might be found along with how to excavate them. If none of the canon clubs catch your eye, feel free to make up your own. Just don’t get too wild though, you’re still just students after all."
474,,200,Quick Study,Blue Archive,Lore,"It might be easy to forget due to the amount of shenanigans that happen in Kivotos, but you are still a student, with all the tests that implies.

476,,200,Weathered Witch’s Hat,Wizard 101,Lore,"A beaten up, raggedy old hat. Enchanted with the knowledge of countless witches before you, this hat is a veritable second brain, capable of helping the wearer come to innovative conclusions and solve problems easier than they could alone. Please be advised that the witch’s hat cannot command you, and in fact, cannot speak. If you hear the hat speaking to you, please remove the hat and seek assistance from the nearest Conjuror or other mind-arts practitioner."
477,,200,Lightning in a Bottle,Wizard 101,Lore,"A literal spark of inspiration, trapped in a complex assembly that surrounds a glass bottle that serves as its prison. If you need an extra kick of inspiration to get you past a roadblock in your studies, you can put on the attached breathing mask, release the valve on the bottle, and breathe in pure creativity for a small bit. The Lightning has enough juice for five light hits, a couple modest hits, or one long draw a month. Once depleted, the Lightning grows noticeably dim and listless until it recovers."
478,,200,Eureka!,Wizard 101,Lore,"Storm Magic is often advanced in fits and starts, as bolts of inspiration strike the mind. Like all storm mages, if you are truly out of ideas, you are almost guaranteed to have a moment of inspiration, such as why your creations fail, or your new spell keeps fizzling."
479,,200,Expert,The Owl House,Lore,"Magic users at this skill level have pushed the boundaries of their specialties, distinguishing themselves and their Covens.

Just as a Lord requires subjects, so too can you take on students to help push your agenda of acquiring knowledge. You are capable of teaching anyone magic, even if they are as mundane as dirt itself. So long as you teach it like anyone is capable, they will learn and eventually pass along your knowledge long after you have left the world."
481,,200,Copy of the Book of Spells,Star vs the Forces of Evil,Lore,"If you got yourself a magic wand, you may want this. It’s a book of spells known in the universe. Mind you, the book is thoroughly disorganized, and sometimes nigh-illegible, but it comes with a magic entity (not Glossaryk, unless it is) to help you learn how to learn magic. You’ll need this to learn how to do things like stop time, or cast The Spell with No Name – but those won’t come without excess amounts of practice, or power levels comparable to Queen Eclipsa. Remember to write down any new spells you develop or learn; this version doesn’t have an auto-transcribe feature."

488,,200,The Library of Cagliostro ,Marvel Cinematic Universe - Volume 3,Lore,"Keen eyed readers may note that the author of this obscure collection of tomes is the very same writer of a book used to invoke the power of Dormammu. While spells from across the ages and invaluable research for refining the mystic arts abounds within, one piece of knowledge in particular poses terrifying potential. That spell describes the art of summoning mystical creatures of varying power-and then devouring them to increase the magician’s strengths. Creatures ranging from tiny beings far below a mortal sorcerer’s power, to terrifying dragons straight out of legend and even eldritch horrors from beyond reality’s veil. Devouring such beings causes them to fuse with the user’s very soul, allowing them to invoke the entities’ forms from parts of their body as well as increase their magical power. The library does NOT warn you of the demonic amalgam you will surely become if you spend centuries inhaling such entities. Only promises the power to thwart even an Absolute Point in time after perhaps centuries of consumption, a promise it would be unwise to trust at face value."
489,,200,Chakra Books,Marvel Cinematic Universe - Volume 2,Lore,"It can be difficult for those who are unaware of the world around them to grasp that they know nothing. It can also be difficult to show them just how small their worldview has been all this time, or help them. But the first step to learning is awareness. This is a substantial supply of books regarding the body, such as a map of the nervous system, MRIs, and more importantly, chakra points and how to open them. These maps for the body will help bring awareness to would-be students, and how to show them the wonders of the world or themselves. For an additional undiscounted 100CP, you may also gain a substantial collection of spellbooks that will assist in helping you learn the formation of spells, the art of drawing energies to power them, and the basics in casting them. Just be aware that the warning labels come AFTER the spells."
490,,200,Notes of the Vishanti ,Marvel Primal,Lore,"Agamotto would one day, with two friends, pen the ultimate tome of white magic.

491,,200,Sorcerer(200),She-Hulk & Ms. Marvel,Lore,"Went to find spiritual enlightenment, did we? A trip to Kamar-Taj has introduced you to supernatural secrets, granting you powers and capabilities that seem pulled from a fantasy novel.

492,,200,Sorcerer(400),She-Hulk & Ms. Marvel,Lore,"Went to find spiritual enlightenment, did we? A trip to Kamar-Taj has introduced you to supernatural secrets, granting you powers and capabilities that seem pulled from a fantasy novel.

494,,200,A Weird Piece Of Wood ,Helltaker,Lore,"What’s this? A piece of wood? Anyway, it has a weird inscription written on it. Could it mean anything? If you’re into the whole ‘benevolent god who loves to test their chosen ones’ shtick, you can place this under one of the blocks in your puzzle, demarcated by a rune of your choice written on it. You can buy two more but undiscounted now. Post-jump, it has one third of one of the current setting’s most powerful rituals written in it. My rule of thumb for ‘how powerful should the ritual be’ is: as powerful as a perk worth 400 cp. If the setting is much more powerful than the perks on the jump doc then adjust accordingly. If the setting is non-magical then the inscription has a third of some kind of vital information. Do note: whatever benefits the ritual gives you fade away every jump.

495,,200,I Made Some Sparks ,Dr Strange Multiverse of Madness,Lore,"Sometimes it can be difficult to control your abilities. You however seem to have instinctual control over your powers. This doesn’t mean that you will have immediate mastery over them, but you will never have to be concerned about losing control. This will also accelerate the speed at which you gain mastery over them and the speed you increase your control."
496,,200,Mystic Study,Marvel Cosmic,Lore,"There are many paths to power and the path of the mystic arts is an alluring one. It is also very dangerous to both its practitioners and victims. You have begun down a path trod by some of the most powerful entities in the cosmos. You are not yet the match of those such as Dr. Strange but you know dozens of spells, can identify the most famous mystics, and are familiar with dozens of grimoires and artifacts. You instinctively know where to find new sources of mystic knowledge and power and learn new magical skills much faster than others."
497,,200,Light Chakra ,Avatar: Beginnings,Lore,"The Light Chakra at the brow is the seat of insight, and inhibited by illusion. Your insight has pierced the greatest and most essential illusion of all: that of separation. Though humans and spirits come from different worlds, they are much alike. Though the elements appear in conflict, they are part of a greater whole. Perhaps this insight can help with your bending abilities, but your piercing intellect makes most forms of disguise and deception useless against you."

500,,200,Fast Learner,League of Legends,Lore,"You're just better at learning than other people. You have an excellent memory, capable of absorbing entire books full of complicated subjects in one sitting, and your note-taking skills are so great that just by writing down a few mnemonics you can distill an hour-long lecture into a single page. Even when experimenting with trial and error, you seem to figure things out faster than most regular people."
501,,200,I’M ON FIRE?!,Ben 10,Lore,"AAAAAAH THE BURNING AAAAAH!...snrk, okay, couldn’t resist. That happens sometimes! Alright, so you’ve got your foot in the door and you’ve got some kinda superpowers. But maybe you dunno how they work or the super smart alien who gave it to you doesn’t wanna explain it. Good news is you’re fast at figuring out what your powers can do just by testing them out a little bit. You’re quick at figuring stuff out like strengths, weaknesses, how to look cool using your powers...if you had enough time, you could get a good grip on it in time for lunch! Plus, when you’re in a real fight or trouble, you’re real quick at making snap decisions with these new powers and finding new tricks with them. Cool, huh?"
502,,200,Where Do You Find This Stuff?,Ben 10,Lore,"Wait, what? No way, you just punched that into a computer and you found it right away?! What the heck! You’re really good at finding nerd stuff like information or clues almost instantly, as long as you have some kind of Internet or big library to consult. It only takes you a few minutes to find info on where bad guys came from, who gave what to who, where they’re hiding out...even stuff that should really only be on cop computers. As long as it’s on some kinda network or dusty book somewhere, you can find it FAST. Seriously, how do you do that?!"
503,,200,Master spellbooks,Generic Dungeon Crawler,Lore,"Crackling with energy, these disturbing tomes hold the mightiest spells known. The damaging-dealing spells can bypass resistances. Singularly powerful creatures or hordes of lesser creatures can be summoned. Enchantments offer incredible power, unmatched speed or nigh-invulnerability for a short time."
504,,200,Old World Practices,Dresden Files,Lore,"There are a thousand and one different gribblies out there, all with their own cliques and groups. And whenever the unfortunate event happens where a modern day mortal has to interact with them, they all expect them to behave perfectly. It’s like they’re expecting everyone to be... well, you, actually. Turns out you do know all the proper mannerisms and etiquettes. Yes, all of them. You seem to have been provided a very strange form of intellectus now. Or maybe you’re a kind of Archive. Anyway, the point is that you have the ability to just know the right way to behave in any and all supernatural environments and interactions. You know the obscure phrases in languages dead for most of history that this specific demon lord likes, you know that the king of the Tylwyth Teg is a baseball fan, you know to turn away and run really fast if you see a certain mother-daughter pair at Disneyland... and so much more."
505,,200,Little Green Book ,The Dresden Files,Lore,"This worn and tattered green three-ring notebook is one of those things you'd better be very careful with. While it's mostly empty, the first page has a number of names on it, including pronunciation guides, and a description of exactly who the name belongs to. Write a name you know on one of the other pages, and it'll be stored the same way, and even update if they change it. Speaking the True Name of someone, exactly how they say it, creates a link so strong it's like you're touching them, perfect for working thaumaturgy on them or summoning them up. It's also good for getting their attention, hence the warning."
506,,200,"""Convenient Translation""",Dark Souls 3,Lore,"These lands are churning, converging at the base of Lothric, and they bring with them a wealth of knowledge considered lost, possibly even mythical by modern standards. This perk allows the buyer to quickly decipher and translate text, no matter how foreign, ancient or alien it may be, as long as the text itself covers a field of knowledge the reader has extensive knowledge In. Basically, a Sorcerer could recover ancient spells by reading an old tome from before the first Age of Fire, but a common thief wouldn't be able to make heads or tails out of a scroll containing lost secrets of Pyromancy."
507,,200,Journal,Fantastic Beasts & Where to Find Them,Lore,"A self updating journal of the animals and magical beasts you’ve encountered providing a fact file about them including their behaviours, diet and habitat as well as various notes on how best to care for them."
508,,200,Pillars of Origin ,MtG - Ixalan,Lore,"A strange pillar etched with various diagrams of both the dinosaurs of Ixalan as well as its people, reading and interpreting these inscriptions will give you greater insight into the behaviors and the features of all of these creatures - both in how to best use your magic in manipulating and empowering them, and if you were to be powerful enough of a mage, even capable of creating “summoned” mana constructs based on them and their talents. "
509,,200,Spellbook,MtG - Amonkhet,Lore,A written record of spells in a form of your choosing. These spells can belong to any form of magic you desire.
510,,200,Mindful ,MtG - Amonkhet,Lore,"Martial strength and unity will lead a crop through some of the trials, but not all. Kefnet’s trial cannot be won by force of arms alone. It must be won by intellect and adaptability. Fortunately, your mind is sharp as a razor and adaptable like few others are. You are a natural puzzlemaster, and your years of training have only made you better. Whether it’s cracking a code, memorizing a text, or solving a deadly riddle your mind is fluid and flexible, and shall always remain so."
511,,200,Curious Intruder,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Lore,"The Wilds are vast, unpredictable, but filled with all kinds of wonders and treats for those who can snatch their dinner from the jaws of the wolf. You’re one of them - trolls, witches, and wolves may see you as a delicious prey, you’ve learned quite a bit of what makes the shadows tick - what scents the wolves desire or the way that troll flesh withers under fire, and you can leverage your wit to not only make off with their treasures, but with some luck and pluck slay the beasts. Though, make no mistake - one wrong move or one cocksure step against something that much stronger than you and you’ll find that instead of being the hero of this story, your bones become a cautionary tale."
512,,200,Lore Master,MtG - Zendikar,Lore,"You are a library of knowledge passed down in oral tradition, much changed over the years as spoken word is wont to do, but preserved nonetheless. In your years you have accumulated a rather encyclopedic knowledge of the tales told in this land. While it is useful socially as an understanding of the culture you are speaking to, the years spent accumulating said knowledge have also led to you develop a flawless memory for the spoken word. In future jumps you will always find those willing to tell you the tales of the land, both to fulfill your curiosity, and occasionally draw forewarning of age-old problems."
513,,200,Falconer,MtG - Homelands,Lore,"There is always one amongst the tenders at the aviary in Onella who is known as the Falconer, and is responsible for tending to the birds and ensuring their safety and comfort. The position is a prestigious one, for to have the respect of the great mesa falcons is to have the respect of Serra herself. Additionally, the Falconers know the language of the birds, the knowledge taught from Falconer to Falconer throughout the history of the aviary.

Belonging to the same family as the Falconers, you may be either the current tender to hold the title, an apprentice, or perhaps a retired Falconer. Regardless of the specifics, you know how to take care of and approach just about any bird, from the common falcons to macaws and giant albatrosses. Being able to speak and understand their language is, of course, a great benefit to this as well. The wild birds see much, and are quite willing to talk."
514,,200,Imperfect Colors Are Better ,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Lore,"Black as a color is, ironically enough, lesser than a dark blue when it comes to not being seen. A mishmash of colors is even better, especially if you’re in the woods - you want several shades of brown and green for the best result there. They all have their place, however, and now so do you. With this you may opt to learn the special techniques of your faction and whatever ninja may be affiliated with it… If there are any, at least. Ninja are rather looked down upon in the Imperial Army, trading the level of reliability that the Samurai hold for even more speed and power, while the Asari Uprising has none to its name. Well, none that we know of, or none that have managed to make a name for themselves as anything other than less than mooks. Something to do with artifacts or improvised weapons might be appropriate if you intend to be the first. Beyond that, feel free to undergo whatever training you want to acquire the skills appropriate for your faction. "
515,,200,Golden-Tailed Graduate,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Lore,"During the era of the Kami War, a kitsune with a golden tail was known far and wide to be one of the greatest swordmasters of that era. As such, when the reborn empire opened the academy, many of the teachers they hired were his own students, and the school was named after him. You are a graduate of that school, and as such are a competent samurai, advisor, and negotiator all, as required to properly serve your emperor. In addition to that, you may choose a topic of study to focus on - perhaps you entered the academy with the intention to become a Kami diplomat, and as such are top of your class in the arts of debating and conversing with the strange minded Kami. Your other skills will not suffer for it, but this is where your true speciality lies."
516,,200,Go for the Eyes!,MtG - Kamigawa,Lore,"No matter how tough a foe is, there has to be a weak point. Even the most powerful ogre has eyes that could be stabbed after all. In general, you have a knack for figuring out the best time and place to strike and your blows have become debilitating when they aren’t lethal. This feature can be turned off at will."
517,,200,Sophisticated Commands,Warbreaker,Lore,"Oh, you can command a rope to just snare or grab, but it’s more effective to say something like “become as my arms and grip what I would.” You know how to phrase Awakening commands for maximum versatility."
518,,200,Creative Combatant ,Magi: The Adventure of Sinbad,Lore,"So many warriors believe that their rigid, disciplined style of fighting makes them strong, when all their refusal to stray from tradition really does is make them inflexible and unable to adapt to change. Though you may not be the most skilled or most powerful of fighters, you do happen to have one advantage over the majority of combatants: You’re incredibly creative when you fight, able to improvise new ways to use your powers and attacks on the fly to adapt to whatever foe you may be facing. What’s more, you’re also surprisingly adept at using your surroundings to your advantage too, be it baiting your foes into environmental hazards or making full use of terrain and elevation."
519,,200,Sorcery Tomes,BlazBlue: Phase Zero,Lore,"Before Nine created the magic formulas, she tried to teach the world sorcery. Sadly, sorcery still requires a level of affinity for magic, and that’s something a significant portion of the world is missing. Hence the magic formula. Anyways, this set of books was Nine’s first attempt, a collection of introductory tomes, as well as a few for dummies equivalents that she wrote herself. On top of that, these books can flat out grant magical capacity to a total of six people per year. Now, there’s nothing in here that’s particularly advanced, but you should be able to grant a fairly decent understanding of the basics."
520,,200,What’s This Doohickey?,Campione,Lore,"Ah, supernatural powers. They don’t come with an instruction manual, be it the magic of mortals, the Authorities of Gods or something else entirely, one needs to get their exact limits and improve themselves by trial and error. Well not anymore, this little blessing works to take care of that. Now, you gain an innate knowledge of how to use any new powers you acquire, as well as their limitations and advantages. Doesn’t sound like much until you get a power-up in the middle of a battle and you realize you don’t know how to use it. Embarrassing. "
521,,200,Records of a Matrix,Fate/Extra CCC,Lore,"Half the battle is knowledge. And how could you call yourself a Master without proper information gathering tools? You now own a touchpad, a laptop, or some other kind of electronic device that can be used to read information, that has a special program installed in it. This program lets you learn the matrixes of Servants, or even other beings such as powerful combat capable AI, and in future jumps anyone that has some measure of power beyond the average human. The way this works is that you can simply learn more about some specific target, such as a Servant’s legend, and the more you learn about them, the more filled out with details on their abilities and elaborations on their history and personality their entry in this tool becomes.

You don’t even need to learn such things directly, even just learning a Servant’s full legend from beginning to end would give you full information on their abilities, regardless of if the legend is unclear on details or twisted into something somewhat different but still recognizable. Learning from the subject themselves does yield somewhat more detailed results, but mostly in terms of learning about their personality and secrets, so maybe it wouldn’t be quite as usable in combat. In case you were thinking about it, no, information obtained from the tool itself won’t count for the purposes of the tool itself unveiling more information."
522,,200,Shinsengumi Way,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Lore,"The samurai code is in reality, a thing mostly of fiction. The many restrictions and honourable rules
that the noble warriors supposedly lived under were fabrications of a later age. Mostly. There were
indeed good men who bound themselves in vows and promises to show their morality, as well as
those who did so to restrain their own dark sides. But the sacrifices made through a warrior’s vow
can have it’s own benefits, the loss becoming new power for battle. 

You are able to take vows that restrict your own life, receiving increases to your overall combat
ability in exchange. The more restrictive the vow is to you personally, the more significant the
increase. Sacrificing a few hours of your time in prayer each week would be a minor boost in power
at best, whereas constant limitations such as never breaking your word or always fighting in an
honorable manner could improve your power by half or even double the normal level. Breaking a
restriction removes the benefit and applies a proportionate penalty to your power on top, as well as
a damaged mental state. These penalties will disappear in time and slowly removing a vow over a
few days will allow you to drop the restrictions without cost. A vow’s power is based on how it
affects you personally at the current moment, something strong for others but weak for you will give
weak benefits."
523,,200,Striking A Deal,Fate/Legends - Land of Shadows,Lore,"The Geas is a magical contract made between two people of whom possess magic themselves, holding each person party to the Geas bound to the contract, else they face some terrible
punishment. You are well aware of how to cast such things, with the agreement of the other parties, without the need for anything but magical energy. The Geas must be made willingly and knowingly
by all parties, though they need not fully understand the implications of what they are agreeing to or
be aware of how you plan to take advantage of it. A Geas can even be laid on yourself, by yourself, to enhance your overall power at the cost of burdening you with various harsh restrictions. Breaking
a Geas inflicts a punishment decided at the time of the deal being struck, often a terrible injury, disease, binding or even death. You cannot free yourself of your own Geas and even managing to do
so will discorporate the deal entirely, for all sides of the deal. However, you do find yourself with
unnatural skill in wording these deals to your advantage, leaving and finding loopholes in them and
in manipulating people into being willing to take on these deals."
524,,200,Dark Teacher,Fate/Legends - Land of Shadows,Lore,"Teachers have a great deal of power, given they are the source of each proceeding generation’s greatest warriors, magicians and leaders. Rarely is this more true than it is for you. A teacher like few others, those who study under you find that they learn as if they had enormous talent for anything you teach them, picking up everything from the combat arts to the spells of the far off Norse with lightning speed. Even faster this grows should you welcome them into your bedchambers and give them the gift of your thighs. You are particularly charming to any student you have in that manner indeed, and find that even those not yet your student will feel a growing desire to become such as your own fame for great skill and power grows. "
525,,200,Always Learning,Fate/Legends - Land of Shadows,Lore,"The immortal life is one of long years and a constant struggle for meaning as everything around you
has begun to fade. You are somewhat familiar with this, as you age at just a fifth the rate other
humans do and have already lived for many years. Of course, unlike many immortal beings, you
found a great spring of motivation within you. You have apparently endless patience and focus, no
matter how boring the task at hand is, and that is coupled with a terrific propensity for learning new
information, as if you were still a child-like blank slate to stamp new knowledge onto. If anything, the more you know, the easier you find it to learn new things, as you apply the lessons, principles
and data from past subjects to anything even remotely similar to what you have learned before. The
final aspect to your lifelong task of endless improvement is that you find you do not technically need
a teacher, even for things that normally need such a thing, so long as you work at your task many
times longer than normal. Even the strangest of magic can be figured out eventually, given you have
centuries of isolation to do so."
526,,200,Man of the New World,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Lore,"As the world moves on from hitting each other with crude sticks and fists, power begins to change
hands. The strongest man in the room goes from an undoubted leader to mere muscle for the true
power, the man with all the knowledge. A combination of natural prodigy and years of effort gave
you a position among Britain’s most vaunted minds. While your most famous talents are focused in a
single academic discipline, such as Moriarty and his world renowned skill with mathematics or an
unsurpassed brilliance with biology, you are broadly skilled with many other fields. From several
respected academic paths to the different styles of the arts and even a deep understanding of
philosophy, you match the learning in each of what most men try a decade or more to come close to. Though a touch barbaric, you even indulged in learning a martial style of the empire, having enough
experience in boxing or baritsu to knock back-alley heads together without trouble.

It’s made possible with a particular mental technique that allows you to easily absorb and retain
information, the creation of a continually expanding ‘memory palace’ style territory within your
mind. Information is easily memorised and efficiently stored, granting the ability to rapidly make
connections between even seemingly disparate pieces of data that you have gathered. Knowledge of
disciplines you once studied thirty years ago remains as fresh as the new fad you spent an afternoon
exploring."
527,,200,Faded Scholar,Fate/Legends - Vive la France,Lore,"Magecraft is just another art to master, a viewpoint even many proud magi in the clocktower can
share. But the sort of mastery you have is a little more uncommon than most. In a general sense, you’re the equal of a clocktower elite magus, with years of study across most basic fields of
magecraft that while mostly scholarly, still render you enough to take down a company of non- magical knights with ease. Your true talent lies with a single field of choice in particular, where you
are not only one of the current age’s prodigies but also able to cast spells in a unique way. An
Illusionist would cast illusions that trick the very texture itself, making for powerful, long lasting
magic that will be treated as if it was reality by other magic. It would still be an illusion, however. Perhaps a necromancer could raise the undead and trick the world into thinking that they are
genuinely alive, massively lessening the upkeep and cost of the undead. As a minor additional
benefit, you are quite experienced at convincing the non-magical folk to fund and aid your efforts, such as bringing in several wealthy nobles to provide the materials for your demon summoning
rituals."
528,,200,Dark Spell Book,Fate/Legends - Vive la France,Lore,"A dark tome, one given as gift to you by a friend that is in to some very worrying research. Wrapped
in a leathery material best not asked about, this volume is a spellbook of notable power, should you
be willing to pay the price to use it. Collected together either by Prelati himself should you be in his
time, or a similar figure elsewhere, the tome both garners you a new friend in the form of it’s creator
and lets you use the eldritch magics held within, even if you lack magical training. The spells can be
paid for with both your own magical energy and that of any sacrifices you make to it, children
appear to be especially potent if you are depraved enough to use them. The book contains a range
of general spells, such as reinforcement or elemental magics, but most of what it holds focuses on
the summoning and control of twisted creatures covered in tentacles, from those as big as a dog to
things that tower over entire castles. In future worlds, the book will work as normal but the
depraved ally who created it will adjust to fit the new world. It may even be an alternate version of
Prelati if you like."
529,,200,Godly Personality,Fate/Legends - Strange New World,Lore,"Power may be what initially draws worshippers to your cause but it is your mind and heart that
keeps them there and grows them into the devoted worshippers you most desire. A mind ideal for a
god is what you possess. You have the mental capacity to listen and answer to thousands of
individual prayers and rituals at once, the intelligence to accurately predict the effects of your divine
actions and interference for years in advance and the charisma to create cults and religions that
dominate entire countries, inspiring love and worship. Truly, your demeanour is one that makes the
sun rise in the hearts of men and inspires them to do great things for you, especially as it is those
men who are more civilised that find themselves naturally drawn to your beliefs, making the more
advanced and developed nations believe in you more easily as opposed to the barbarians."
530,,200,Fast Learner,Lord El-Melloi Case Files,Lore,"Ironically, the greatest students are often the ones who spend the
least time as such. Your mind soaks up knowledge and new skills like a sponge,
absorbing information that will shame all but the best of your peers. Regardless of what
academic discipline you’re trying to learn, you’ll master it in half the time it takes most
people."
531,,200,Dusty Old Notes ,Tsukihime,Lore,"You’ve hit some sort of jackpot, Jumper. It’s a collection of journals and diaries that belonged to a now-deceased magus without an heir. It will take some time to decode and translate, but it contains knowledge of how to use common Magecraft practices such as utilization of the Elements, and some practical substitutes for some Formalcraft items, letting you execute effective rituals with common materials you could find in a modern grocery Store.
"
532,,200,Thought Acceleration ,Tsukihime,Lore,"Even a human brain operating at peak capacity has its limits - it is, after all, what amounts to biological hardware with set limitations.But what if those limitations could be surpassed? You are able to accelerate your thought processes to twice their normal speed, letting you quickly multitask and react faster than body and nervous system would normally allow, running calculations and strategies in a blink rather than a minute. In time, you could even accelerate this to three, or four or more times in speed. However, much like overclocking a computer, this is a stressful technique that is exhausting,and if overused, can burn your brain out like an overheated engine. Practice and careful moderation may let you overcome this, but for now, be cautious in how you use this.
"
533,,200,Rites of initiation ,Cultist Simulator,Lore,"What is a pastor without its sheep? A hunter without the hunt? An occultist without its tools? This purchase grants you basic knowledge surrounding the rituals needed for this jump, including the ritual to induct new followers. This includes a general understanding of their inner workings, allowing you to tailor them as you see fit. You may use this power to induct an individual into the dark side of the world, allowing them to unlock an affinity based on one of the Principles of the Mansus. This affinity will closely match the nature of the new disciple. Those that already possessed an affinity before the rite receive no benefit from this perk.

For an additional 200 CP, you may take these rituals to other worlds, allowing you to create a new framework for magic based on the Principles and rituals found in this jump. This framework can interact with existing magical systems, allowing you to use the rituals you are familiar with to tap into the system, or you could have your powers work in an entirely separate manner.
"
534,,200,Bibliovore ,Cultist Simulator,Lore,"There’s so much knowledge out there, and so little time. With this perk you have the innate ability to instantly memorize the contents from text and other visual media with just a touch. This ability can be used on any kind of visual medium, from engravings on ancient pottery, to diagrams in crumbling parchments, to blurry text in waterlogged codices, or even books written in a language you don't speak. The actual understanding of these contents is an entirely different matter, but you’ll figure it out with time. This ability can be toggled on and off at will, so that you are not burdened with unwanted knowledge.
"
535,,200,Loresmith ,Cultist Simulator,Lore,"It pays to give back to the community, and for someone that has been everywhere, you could have a wealth of knowledge for sale. With this ability you can now easily contribute to the collective knowledge of the world by instantly creating essays, books, manuals, papers, recipes and other written documentation of any subject you are familiar with. This information is compiled with as much care as if you had done it over a few years, and can be formatted, rewritten, and edited on the fly, allowing you to tailor the final results to your liking. Teaching perks will increase the rate at which your documents are studied and assimilated.
"
536,,200,A collection of paintings ,Cultist Simulator,Lore,"This collection consists of 9 different paintings created using rarefied pigments that can only be found in the strange side of the world. Each masterpiece depicts an Hour that best associates with each of the Principles of the Mansus. These paintings can be used in rituals as tools to perform magic, or to summon spirits. In future jumps, the subject of these paintings will change to depict a god-like entity that best embodies each of the Principles, and with the appropriate rites, it may be entirely possible to communicate with them and gain their favour.
"
537,,200,The Geminiad ,Cultist Simulator,Lore,"An extensive treatise in the Principle of Knock. This text provides knowledge on every lock, every door, and every barrier, and the many ways to open them.
"
538,,200,Magecraft,Lord El-Melloi Case Files,Lore,"You have sufficient understanding of modern magecraft to claim the title
of Cause, an average magus, and may pick one form or style of modern magecraft to
specialize in. Canon examples include alchemy, curses, holy sacraments, spiritual
evocation, runes, formalcraft, kabbalah, jewelcraft, golemancy, necromancy, puppet
mastery, gravekeeper secrets, druidcraft, astromancy, witchcraft, summoning, zoology,
onmyoudou, shugendou, Apache shamanism, Traditional Japanese magecraft, and many
others. You have a firm grasp of both its theory and practice, as well the general
fundamentals of thaumaturgy, but unless you’ve got something else up your sleeve you’re nothing special. You may purchase this perk as many times as you like. First
purchase free to all but Drop-In and Student."
539,,200,Magecraft(Mastery),Lord El-Melloi Case Files,Lore," You may pay 200 CP to elevate your skills in one form or style of
magecraft you know from average to incredible - mastery worthy of the
Association’s elite, rather than a common mage, even if you learned it on another
jump. This isn’t enough to defeat a Lord of the Clocktower in a straight fight, not
without some serious talent and quite a few more magic circuits, but they’ll at
least take you seriously as a mage. You may also buy this upgrade multiple times,
but not for the same form of magecraft. 

Requires Magecraft of any Variety."
540,,200,Magecraft(Brand),Lord El-Melloi Case Files,Lore,"By paying 200 CP after taking Mastery - or having equivalent
skill - you may elevate your skills still further. At this point, your command
of your speciality is amongst the greatest living mages. Regardless of how
long or short your lineage is, you are on par with such exalted figures as
Rufleus Nuada-Re Eulyphis, Kayneth El-Melloi Archibald, and Inorai
Valualeta Atroholm, even if your magic circuits aren’t up to snuff and your
general skills leave something to be desired in comparison. Unlike the
previous perks, however, this may not be purchased multiple times - Brand
is the highest practical rank these days, and it would stretch credibility too
far to reach it multiple times. It also does not come with a ridiculous name,
even if you want one.

Requires Magecraft(Mastery) or equivalent Skill Level"
541,,200,Circles and Symbols ,Justice League Dark,Lore,"Rather simply, this is knowledge of how to construct various magical symbols. Runes, circles, glyphs, you have an expansive knowledge of them, their uses, and how to modify them. On their own, they don’t have a ton of use besides warding away certain beings, but they are often important parts of other rituals or enchantments.
"
542,,200,The Fog of Ages ,Justice League Dark,Lore,"One of the things that can make a supernaturally long life hard to bear is the gradual loss of memory. Over time, family, friends, and lovers all fade from the mind. Your happiness and sadness, your highs and lows. All that makes a person who they are slowly slips away. For you, that isn’t a problem. Your memory of events from ten-thousand years ago are as sharp as those from ten minutes ago.
"
543,,200,Planning for the Long Term ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Lore,"The Liche Priests, for all their cunning and trickery, failed to fully research the spells of immortality that they subjected themselves to. They believed that by binding their souls to their own body, they would live forever. They were right. What they assumed wrongly was that they would live forever with eternal youth accompanying that longevity. They were wrong. They continued to age, rotting away till they were animated skeletons with dusty, leathery sacks of skin hanging from their bones in strips. If only you could have known the long term consequences of that act, you might have chosen to pass it over yourself. At least now you will not make the same mistake, as you are aware of the long term consequences of any magic, ritual or other process done to yourself. If a spell would cause your death after sixty years of empowering you, you would know that. If a serum would result in gaining a cancerous tumour within you, you would know that upon examining the serum, even if you could not have found it out before."
544,,200,Taketori Monogatari ,Golden Sky Stories,Lore,"This old and tattered book illustrates a folk tale of a Lunar Princess who temporarily sought refuge on the Earth, and those who came in search of her hand. Though she would return to the moon in the end, she left a blessing to the man she had grown enamoured with during her stay. He would reject it in the end, but a fragment of the blessing still remains. 

Whoever reads this ancient tome will attain the blessings of the moon, and under moonlight, their natural capabilities improve dramatically, including their magic and their body’s natural capacity to regenerate. One would wonder how different things might be had the Lunar Princess’ lover chosen not to forsake his beloved’s blessing...
"
545,,200,“When the loli is mass-produced: An introduction to cloning” ,Senki Zesshou Symphogear,Lore,"This book, by a famous Scandinavian Alchemist, details the fundamentals behind custom construction of human bodies, and then implantation of memories into them. When handled by a sufficiently skilled Alchemist, one can learn how to automate this process and the mechanics behind copying, implanting and transferring memories.

546,,200,“Auto-scoring your love life: Advanced fundamentals” ,Senki Zesshou Symphogear,Lore,"By an anonymous author, this book details the creation of artificial constructs via alchemy, such as the vaunted auto-scorers, bizarre wind-up machines of death. Auto-scorers are mostly known as capable combat machines, resembling marionettes, but the grand majority of them exist as assistants and custom made tools for Alchemists, such as Tiki, an auto-scorer that functions as a living observatory.
"
547,,200,Bibliophilic Luck ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Lore,"You have an unusual knack for picking up rare books, books of magical knowledge, and dangerous books infested by youkai or evil spirits. Many of these books here will offer invaluable guidance should you wish to learn magic, study youkai for their strengths and weaknesses, as well as protecting yourself against common supernatural pests. Does not come with any inherent ability to store them safely, so you might want to fix that – these books are occasionally known to come alive if stored around too much youkai energies.
"
548,,200,Youma Books ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Lore,"You have a collection of supernatural books, such as grimoires written by magicians, valuable historical texts about supernatural occurrences, letters soaked in feelings until they begun to take a life of their own, and books written by youkai to record their own existence. Includes the first Japanese translation of the Necronomicon. Be careful of thieves.
"
549,,200,Ocean Secrets* ,Peter Pan,Lore,"Mermaids know all of the secrets to the ocean, and every secret whispered that rippled off the water's surface. You are incredibly wise in spite of your outward personality, and often know things that no one else does, from where a treasure is hidden to what Hook (or someone else) is plotting, to ancient spells and lore hidden beneath the waves at Atlantis. Not only is this information available for your use, but many will come to seek your advice, giving you more opportunities to drown them. After the jump, the ability applies to any ocean or sea you can access. If you also took the Water Fairy Talent, you can apply the same power to any body of water, even the water in a bathtub or bottle."
550,,200,Lore in Iron ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Lore,"The Lore of Metal, as you might expect, resonates especially well with metal. It also, however, resonates especially well with the rational mind. It takes a clear head to memorize the thousands of formulae necessary in a true Alchemist’s work. As such, you find that your connection to Chamon also grants you enhanced clarity of thought and speed of cognition. The Gold Order has no use for scatterbrains, after all.
"
551,,200,Hedge Empathy ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Lore,"Alone among the Imperial Orders, the Jade Wizards are known to often seek out hedge mages as Apprentices - at least, those whose magics align with life and growth. The orders the Druids belonged to before the coming of Teclis still have survivors, so perhaps this makes sense. You may be just what the Jade Order needs to call that wayward third of your kin to their true calling. Your ability to convince self-taught or accidental magicians to undertake formal schooling in their powers is something beyond a way with words. It is as if your presence forces them to realize how much they cannot learn on their own.
"
552,,200,Word to the Wise ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Lore,"The path of the Hierophant requires discipline, wisdom, and most of all, time. Of course, men have short lifespans, and so it is just as wise to seek out one’s elders for information. Now you will find that your elders and superiors are more willing than they might otherwise have been to answer your questions on everything from the nature of magic to how to treat horrible burns. Even those known for keeping important secrets might just part with them in your presence."
553,,200,A Modest Treatise on the Nature of Magic ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Lore,"Penned by Magister Patriarch Gotthilf Puchta of the Gold Order a century ago, this educational tome contains no spells, but rather a deep examination of magical theory and occult minutiae, including the workings of the Eight Winds, the nature of their flow, the nature of the Realm of Chaos from which they enter this world, and the process by which they are put to use to create spells. Careful study of this massive book will certainly grant you insights you would not ordinarily have into the working of your Lore of Magic, as well as how it relates to the others overall. As your adventures continue, you may make similar discoveries on the workings of other forms of magic - and oddly enough this copy of the Treatise will record your future findings as if Puchta himself had penned them. This will ensure that your breakthroughs in magical theory are recorded in a manner that may be used as an effective teaching aid if copied and distributed, just as copies of the original are used by many Magisters in the more theoretical instruction of their Apprentices.
"
554,,200,Scroll of Incarnate Elemental ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Lore,"This scroll contains information long coveted by the most desperate or ambitious of wizards. Information that would be useless even to them, save during a Storm of Magic. In such times, when the Winds of Magic blow strongest, a Wizard may conjure forth a being of true might from the essence of his Wind. Not only will study of this scroll teach you the rituals and materials necessary to craft an Incarnate Elemental of your Wind of Magic, it will also provide you with a path to perhaps doing so at any time - even when the Winds blow weakly. Unleashing such a horror upon your enemies is satisfying, is it not? Ah, perhaps there is some confusion. It is true that the ritual Teclis may or may not soon perform has a similar name and even a similar function, but this is not that. I offer my sincerest condolences.
"
555,,200,Tome of Secrets ,Warhammer Fantasy: Warriors of Chaos,Lore,"This journal looks completely unassuming at first glance, but when one looks inside they will find that no matter how many pages they turn, the journal will simply have more pages available, the texts on those pages perfectly preserved regardless of the conditions. This will make an excellent place to write down information you keep to keep but also remain private, for if any who are not welcome attempt to take or open the book will be on the receiving end of a powerful blast of magic that will likely take off their hands and arms. The book will also magically notify you that an intruder is attempting to steal your precious secrets.
"
556,,200,Guerilla Futurism​ ,Mage: The Awakening(1st Edition),Lore,"The future is coming and you intend to be on the right side when it arrives. And now, so will all of your social media followers. You are masterfully expert at engineering campaigns of social media, public awareness and crowd­sourced fundraising. With covert use of your magic, you may use just about any information distributive method at your disposal to disseminate any information that you desire. The only limitation on how far and how wide this information will spread is how long you actively focus on keeping the campaign running. You could reach normal kickstarter goals in hours or ensure that everyone on the planet has seen a celebrity photo. Perhaps with a year of covert efforts and preparations, you could manufacture the next “Gangnam Style.” I suppose you could use it to make and spread your own memes as well, but really that is a waste of your talents."
557,,200,Stitched lips​ ,Mage: The Awakening(1st Edition),Lore,"An ever present danger in the world of espionage is that should an agent be captured, they will be tortured, interrogated and coerced, likely divulging sensitive information in the process. You have been trained in anti­-interrogation techniques as well as meditations that will prevent your thoughts from being detected by outside interference. It is likely that you will be able to shrug off just about any torture, drug, mind probe, mystical lasso of truth or any other technique that would make you divulge information against your will. This does not mean however that you will be able to escape the consequences for resisting (they may still try to kill, or torture you more if you don’t divulge information).
"
558,,200,Grimoire Hunter ​,Mage: The Awakening(1st Edition),Lore,"Grimoires are one of the most prized possessions a mage can acquire. Within them are insights on the nature of the supernal realm, spells that have been lost to the ages, and a means of casting extant spells more easily. While these tomes are frequently rare and hard to find, you have a combination of insight, talent, and luck that will invariably lead you to discovering these grimoires where others might have failed. Be warned that finding these tomes of power is only the first step, deciphering their meaning and understanding them is a challenge all its own. (In future jumps, this ability extends to any tome or document of rare mystical and/or forgotten knowledge.)
"
559,,200,Purah’s Notes ,Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,Lore,"The elder Sheikah Purah had once attempted to program a rune to make them physically younger, and to some extent even succeeded! However, it was too effective - the formerly hundreds-year old Sheikah had become nearly a child with a single mishap! The same kind of effect being used on even an old man by Hylian standards could easily fall into a grisly fate, so...using these notes to replicate the Rune without any adjustments is a dangerous proposition. Still, you at least have the opportunity to adjust it as you need.
"
560,,200,The Legends of Hyrule ,Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,Lore,"The land of Hyrule has its esoteric lore - mystical phenomena, ancient history, and hidden palaces. You now hold this knowledge in your mind, of all those things - though the details may be somewhat blurred by the fog of ages. What’s more, a similar knowledge of myth and mystery will always follow you from world to world.
"
561,,200,Swordsman Scrolls ,Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks,Lore,"You’d think that these would be only mildly useful to an engineer due to them being, you know, and engineer, but you’ve managed to get your hands on them anyways. These two scrolls detail the usages of two sword techniques that are incredibly hard to find teachers for. The first is sword beams, the ability to shoot ‘cutting wind’ type attacks from the edge of your blade. Sadly, an ordinary blade won’t be enough - there needs to be a level of magic to it in order to power the beam. The second scroll details the great spin attack, a much easier technique to use. Additionally, you can rewrite these scrolls, turning them into two techniques of your own choosing. But, why mess with the classics?
"
562,,200,Swordsman's Scroll ,Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker,Lore,"This simple blue scroll might often be mistaken for a map, but inside it lies a powerful sword technique. The great spin attack, though you may also know it as the hurricane spin. Well, I suppose a more strict explanation is that it teaches you how to add in magical energy to your attacks, something that causes the spin attack to evolve into the hurricane spin. I’m sure you can create other techniques with a bit of effort, though that's up to you."
563,,200,Hearthfire - Vast Library ,The Elder Scrolls,Lore,"For those of a more academic persuasion, this large library is a great addition to your home. Large shelves that contain a large number of books, ranging from children's fiction to history. It also contains a fair amount of spell books that make learning the spells within much easier than they otherwise would be. There are also instructions on how to make more of them, some with your own custom spells.(CG Note: Requires Hearthfire - Basics - The Elder Scrolls first.)"
564,,200,Speaks Draconic ,The Dragon Prince,Lore,"The other part of Primal Magic is speaking an incantation in the Draconic tongue. Fortunately, you are now fluent, and as a bonus, you can now easily speak backwards as Dark Mages do when casting."
565,,200,Soft Stick ,World Seed,Lore,"One of the technological staples in Neolife, these special devices are basically CDs for magic. Each Soft Stick is capable of holding a single program that can be erased or replaced as needed. Once a program is uploaded, the aura of the Soft Stick will shift to match it, making it an easy matter to convert any software you might write into a magical formation or enchantment with the same effect, and even doing things such as transferring an AI to an enchantment wouldn’t be much trouble. Furthermore, since the companion bracelet is a suitable terminal to upload software to and from, you wouldn’t even need any other equipment. With this purchase, you gain an endless supply of these useful little things, working with any code or software you might write, no matter how obscure or complicated."
566,,200,Holy Symbol ,Konosuba,Lore,"Faith is quite important to the job of a priest, though who that faith is directed to matters quite a bit less. Instead of directing your prayers towards any of the Goddesses that already exist in this world, you have a holy symbol and books that are suited to a more personal faith, perhaps even one about yourself. They work just as well as any holy symbols would and can be used to channel priestly magic quite well. The books even include a range of holy arts and magic to teach you or any you give the book to. "
567,,300,Library of the Wise,Beast: The Primordial,Lore,"Through luck or possibly connections to the Athenaeum of the Dark Mother, you've come into the possession of a massive store of information gathered by a member of the Mysterium. It contains detailed information on the various supernatural creatures and places in this world and any you visit in the future. If you dig through its contents, you may discover the occasional something the previous owner took interest in (or would of in future worlds), but never got a chance to investigate. Who knows what you could learn or gain from following up on these clues? The library differs from the grimoire in that it doesn't hold a lot of specific information about local monsters unless they're historically famous or incredibly influential."
568,,300,Battlefield Instincts ,Shin Megami Tensei V,Lore,"The odds in front of you seem unsurmountable and endless, but for the keen and creative eye there are a lot of tools available. So many means to achieve victory and you know how to use them all. Any tools or abilities you have, you instinctively know their uses, know he limits of your abilities and Items and how to maximize their use in a given combat situation."
569,,300,Astula Aspirant,The Elder Scrolls - Online,Lore,"You know what makes using a skill easier? Actually being shown how to use it. Rather than being self-taught like many mages in more rural areas or mentored by a senile hebephile in a mushroom, you now have the full education and training of a Guild Journeyman, granting you noticeably improved control over your magicka. Effects last a bit longer, are harder to resist and dispel, have a noticeable boost to overall effication, and best of all, you actually know the science behind those spells you're casting."
570,,300,The Great Work,GrimGrimoire,Lore,"The study and practice of alchemy, unlike its sister disciplines of glamour, sorcery, and necromancy, does not claim to be complete within itself. Rather, alchemy seeks to uncover the immutable laws that govern all, and through understanding of them, to harness them into the creation of more perfect forms than granted by nature or god. This treatise aims to elucidate how existing essences may be captured and wedded to alchemical products, to create existences that transcend the scope of nature. By making that which is unreliable and ephemeral subject to unchangeable laws - it becomes possible to transgress into the domain of miracles through the power of science.

Through meticulous experimentation, an alchemist may obtain a deep understanding of the fundamental principles that underlie all material phenomena, and then extend that to the astral. Through rigorous application of these principles, it becomes possible to manipulate matter and create products that surpass the limitations of nature.

Thus, alchemy - unlike other arcane disciplines - encourages the pursuit of knowledge that is grounded in empirical observation and rational analysis. We hold that the path to spiritual enlightenment and worldly success is through the realization of these principles, and the transformation of base matter into something that transcends the limitations of the natural world.

571,,300,Lemegeton ,GrimGrimoire,Lore,"The tome of Solomon's lore, the power to summon devils galore With methods taught to bind and control, the hellish forces to behold Curses invoked and maledictions sent, the dark empowered with dark intent Magic twisted and warding spells set, the hellish imprisoned with no regret This ultimate tome of sorcery, a dangerous path with no mercy

For even with its powerful sway, sorcery is not safe to play So heed its warnings and tread with care, for the Lemegeton will not spare Those who seek its power and grace, beware the devil's embrace.

Requires Chaos Nest to Purchase"
572,,300,Necronomicon,GrimGrimoire,Lore,"Behold this ancient grimoire that uncovers the arcane secrets of death, stripping bare the innermost workings of the underworld. With its invocation, you shall command the attention of the very gods of death, bending the very fabric of existence to your will. The magics of boundaries shall be your servants, and life and death mere pawns in your dark court.

Requires Archeron to Purchase"
573,,300,Tír na nÓg,GrimGrimoire,Lore,"Behold, this forbidden tome unveils the deepest secrets of the fae, revealing how one may invoke the true lords of the realm of fairy and command the greatest wonders of nature. With a mere utterance, even the trembling hand of a novice can seize the reins of the natural world and bend it to their will. Truly, this grimoire is a gateway to unimaginable powers and limitless possibilities... if one is bold enough to seize it.

Requires Titania to Purchase"
574,,300,Daemonum Enciclopedia,Generic Angels and Demons,Lore,"You receive an ancient dark tome that contains information about basically any and all relevant demons, including things like which what their abilities are, what are their preferences of rewards and summoners, what kind of deals they make, which domains and legions they rule, which is their relationship with other supernatural beings and even about the instructions of the rituals, artifacts and/or ingredients needed to summon or enter in contact with them. It also contains information about Hell and its workings, how to travel through it and even about mystical artifacts of demonic origin located on both the underworld and the mortal plane. Post-jump, it’ll update itself to add information about the demons and hell-like planes that will encounter in future worlds."
575,,300,Book of Life,Generic Angels and Demons,Lore,"According to the writings, the legendary Book of Life is the book in which God records, or will record, the names of every person who is destined for Heaven and the world to come, almost as part of the Akashic Records. What lies in front of you isn’t the actual Book of Life, but rather a pretty limited replica. You acquired this same replica of the legendary book, which records the information, like names, story and abilities, about every angel/deity that exists and about every person that was sent to Heaven after their death. It also has access to information related to prayers and rituals that can be used to communicate with the angels and deities mentioned on its pages, but it doesn't go as deeply into this matter as the Daemonum Enciclopedia. It’ll update itself, in this and any future world you’re currently in, every time that a new angel is born and that a mortal is sent to paradise."
576,,300,Book of Jumper,Horus Heresy: The Primarchs,Lore,"You have a book, one that contains your entire knowledge about one specific topic, from anything from sorcery to warfare or the art of slaughter itself. It constantly shifts and expands every time your sum total knowledge of the topic similarly expands. For an additional 100 CP (50 CP if you used your floating discount on the Book of Jumper), you have a number of books, one for every topic you possess any knowledge of, that all shift and expand likewise as your knowledge about their subjects expand. "
577,,300,Mad Scientist’s Records,Devil May Cry,Lore,"Copies of the research notes left behind by a deceased member of the Order of the Sword, these would later be used as the inspiration for the Devil Breaker system. With this stack of several decades’ worth of knowledge, someone who’s mechanically savvy could potentially pull off a similar feat, given the right materials for the job."
578,,300,Power of Laws,Epic of Leviathan,Lore,"Reo has a notable hatred of cultivation worlds and expresses this quite often when he observes similar behavior. This is kind of hypocritical since he uses a cultivation style power. His ability grants him power of the law of lightning. This grants you the ability to comprehend laws like a cultivator. In addition, you gain an incredibly high degree of talent for a particular law. This power has an incredible amount of potential, but even the greatest cultivation geniuses can take centuries to come close to their full power."
579,,300,Jumper’s Clone - A Loli Bird!,Cultivation Chat Group,Lore,"Are you training a student or cultivating a clone? Somehow your students end up WAY more like you than they should be in knowledge, aptitudes, and skills, though not in appearance. While teaching is about passing down what you know, somehow your students seem to copy more than knowledge, and they do it shockingly quickly.

While this mainly works for one-on-one teaching, or working with a small group at most, such students tend to grow ten times as fast as they should. They also keep growing at that accelerated rate even outside of class or practice, so long as it’s towards being more like you.

The greatest cultivators are the greatest teachers, and so this perk acts as a capstone booster for the origin perk lines."
580,,300,Been Around The Block,High School DxD,Lore,"Originally, it was assumed you were a relative newcomer to the supernatural stage - whether from old blood, dabbling, or just bad luck. But as it stands, you’ve been around for a while, one way or another. For non-Humans, you are a living veteran of the Great War, someone who survived and perhaps even thrived in the apocalyptic war of old. You have mastery of your Magic System of choice, any Sacred Gear or Holy Sword you own with its Balance Breaker and at least one Sub-Species unlocked for the former, as well as magical combat. You are likely a high-ranking member of your Faction, if you have any. These green and wet-behind-the-ears high school students may as well be flies to you, though the strongest members of the Factions and a practiced Longinus user can still be a challenge to you. Obviously, you’re several millennia older than a high school student, as a result. If you have no background memories or prefer to be a young prodigy, this experience and power appears ex nihilo, though your Faction is likely to hold you in high esteem as they realize your skill.

For Humans, you are instead the Reincarnation of a human (or hybrid) hero of myth who passed away many years ago. You started as an ordinary person, but you began to remember your old life and skills related to that mythological life began to surface to you in visions and dreams. A reincarnation of Lancelot would turn into a master swordsman overnight, a reincarnation of Hercules would be a master of wrestling and unarmed combat as well as incredibly strong. You require practice to unlock your old self’s full potential, but it takes nowhere near as long as it would if you were an ordinary person. Your soul’s strength will also let you quickly unlock and master the powers of a Sacred Gear or Holy Sword, particularly if they were a weapon or had an ability linked to your legend somehow."
581,,300,Weapons of War,God Of War (2018),Lore,"How do you even use that? You have a great deal of skill when using unusual weapons such as the Blades of Chaos (swords attached to chains which are wrapped around your arms). This perk grants you an expert's skill in any new weapon you pick up, no matter how unusual or magical they are. For example you have a weapon that can return to you if you throw it, now you will be able to always catch it without fumbling."
582,,300,Suckin’ at something…,Adventure Time,Lore,...is the first step towards being sort of good at something. You find that you learn new skills quickly. While this doesn’t mean you’ll master something faster it does make the step between being a beginner and being capable a great deal shorter. 
583,,300,Beyond Limits,Final Fantasy II,Lore,"There is a presumed limit that will be reached. That once you have the ability to strike at your opponent three or four times before they can attack you once, or once you’ve reached the third level of a spell, that such is the end. Not at all. Your talent can be refined and practiced again and again, whereupon even the most basic spells can reach cataclysmic levels, or your weapon skill surpass logic and explanation."
584,,300,Train the Basics,Final Fantasy II,Lore,"There are those that will find that their skills, their understandings, their power seems to struggle to increase once a certain point has been reached. You are not those. Even repeating the most basic of training will increase your skills. Form practice with your blade every morning, even after you’ve mastered the forms? You’ll continue to increase in your skill as if it were all new to you, without limitations."
585,,300,The Book of Eternity ,Hellblazer,Lore,"On top of being the true history of the world, as written by Merlin, this book will teach you potent spells, though not as quickly as the necronomicon."
586,,300,Necronomicon ,Hellblazer,Lore,"A book containing the darkest rituals imaginable. It will quickly teach you powerful spells, but it will corrupt you if you are not strong of will."
587,,300,Spark of Genius,Records of Ragnarok Gauntlet (Humans),Lore,"Like a Thunderbolt in the night enlightens your Genius the World. Nikola Tesla, one of the brightest and most genius man in humanities history, is the only one you can call equal. Your intelligence is simply above your peers, as it takes little to envision incredibly works of technology to advance humanity into a new age. The truth of the universes just wait for you to reach out to them as you can understand them eventually if you dedicate yourself and all you would need are the resources to have the things your mind develops be made realized. Beware those jealous of mind like your own though."
588,,300,Man of Many Skills ,Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,Lore,"The doctor in Del Mar is a remarkably skilled individual. In addition to his medical duties he also functions as the town Barber, Veterinarian, Dentist, and Shaman/Witch Hunter. Perhaps he trained you or you were forced to take up an equal amount of positions. You can be considered a true master of five different fields. Though if you pick similar fields they may be able to synergize allowing you to pull off even more impressive feats. Post jump you may choose an additional five fields to gain an equal level of skill in. The mastery you receive will however, depend on the setting. For example, a doctor in this setting would not be as advanced as one from a more modern setting. You might however gain knowledge of fantasy and mystical healing methods unavailable in a sci-fi setting."
589,,300,Shepherd’s Journal,Atlantis - The Lost Empire,Lore,"This book bears the symbol of the Atlantean language’s “a”, and details the explorations of a shepherd named Aziz that led him to discover Atlantis thousands of years ago. Written in the Atlantean language, it might be considered useless to anyone with an inability to read it- however, a proper understanding of ancient languages including Latin, Babylonian, and Thessalonian- in addition to Nordic runes- should give you enough to read it like a native Atlantean could thousands of years ago. And what does the book reveal? The path to Atlantis, of course- any Atlantis, so long as it’s been hidden or lost to time. Failing that, the book will also lead you to the remnants of any other lost civilizations in the future- Camelot, El Dorado, the Lost City of Z, Y’s, Iram of the Pillars- even the unnamed cities that used to belong to Lemuria, Mu, and Shangri-La!"
590,,300,Grimoire,A Certain Magical Index,Lore,"A completely identical copy of a grimoire of your choosing. Although it might drive you into insanity if you don’t have the training or will to handle its malevolent influence, it provides you with a lot of power if you’re magically inclined. Yes, this list includes the Necrominicon. Hold on, I’ll go get it. Ah, here it is. List here: http://toarumajutsunoindex.wikia.com/wiki/Grimoire"
591,,300,Ancestor’s Portrait,Darkest Dungeon,Lore,"A portrait that probably isn’t meant to depict the Ancestor. Easily carried in one’s cloak, jacket, or bag, the portrait has the strange effect of increasing the “experience” one earns by half-again; letting one learn more from their time in battle or exploration."
592,,300,I'm Not Rusty,Shovel Knight,Lore,"No matter how long you go without practice and exercise, you will stay just as skilled."
593,,300,Supported skills,Generic Dungeon Crawler,Lore,"As you practice a skill, you find that related skills also improve by a tiny degree. Swing a sword for a month, and you won't have to worry about injuring yourself with that flail you've never used before. Spend a jump as a cook and find that chemistry makes a little more sense to you. You cannot master a new skill through this method, but it will greatly accelerate the learning process when you do start fighting with that flail or working with chemistry. "
594,,300,HUD,Generic Dungeon Crawler,Lore,"Your mind is now shared with a non-sapient entity that acts as a PDA. It is able to sort through your memories and senses to perfectly recall anything you know or have experienced. The HUD cannot use any of your powers, relies upon your senses and has no initiative or willpower of its own, but can be easily 'programmed' with complex instructions, providing reminders or pop-ups in your field of view. Besides acting as an excellent mapping tool, it also gives you a perfect internal clock."
595,,300,Roman Manuscripts,King Arthur ,Lore,"You've come into possession of a series of books detailing the process of constructing large man-made beasts. Unfortunately the books are encoded and you can't understand them yet. Though from the drawings you can tell they are made from stone and wood, some even look to have several functions. One looks as if it's breathing fire, another seem to be capable of flight all in all they seem to be kinda mundane. There is one however that seems, strange compared to the others. Where all the others were shaped after an animal or a mythical beast this one looks humanoid. Modeled after a knight it's right hand holds a sword and the right hand holds a shield. Both have strange symbols on it. Several other images seem to show their effects. The sword is cleaving a mountain with a seemingly glowing sword. And another image is showing the knight holding its shield up with a orb around the knight blocking a dragon's fiery breath. Maybe there's even more secrets in these books that you can find after cracking the code."
596,,300,Consummate Rules-Lawyer,The Dresden Files,Lore,"There's three types of people in the world: Those who don't deal with the Fae, those who get really good at navigating the confusing maze of faerie law, and those who get dragged screaming from the world. Since the first isn't an option, you've gone to the second camp. You now understand every paragraph of the Unseelie accords by instinct, and can tie loops in others using it while slipping similar knots yourself. It's also given you quite the perspective on quaint mortal legal systems, and after dealing with Winter Fae, mortal bureaucrats or lawyers just seem adorable."
597,,300,"""Magical Attunement""",Dark Souls 3,Lore,"Focus in battle is a necessity; without focus, both knights and sorcerers can find themselves on the wrong end of a sword. In the heat of battle or the darkest of circumstances, you are able to find this focus and harness it. With this, your mind has become a bit sharper, and more suited towards memorization. This has two main effects; the first is that you naturally possess a larger pool of magical energy, or ‘focus’, which allows you to cast spells of all types, as well as unleash any special abilities inherent to the weapons you can find here. The second effect is that you’ll be able to memorize more spells, allowing you to have a wider arsenal when going into battle. Finally, you’ll also find that your mind is more suited towards casting the spells of this land, letting you learn to cast the more powerful ones a bit more easily."
598,,300,"""Sorcery""",Dark Souls 3,Lore,"A refined school of magic pursued by scholars, the gifted and this inquisitive. Sorcerers wield magical catalysts such as staves to pull upon the essence of the soul in order to perform various spells, each empowered by the caster's mind. You are well versed in the complex art, able to perform a variety of the more common spells such as Soul Arrow and its counterparts to attack from afar, or Magic Weapon and Magic Shield to temporarily empower your equipment if danger is close. While your repertoire isn't expansive, yet, there are numerous opportunities to add to it in these churning lands wrought with secrets. Despite that, a modest increase in intelligence and training in the art has granted you great magical potency, as well as resistance to magic. Both of these traits can grow higher yet with study and opening your mind."
599,,300,“The Hermit”,Dark Souls 1,Lore,"On purchase, a place is formed somewhere out in the world. A place you are guided too by instinct, but remains hard to find and secretive even then. Travelling far to some mysterious land is often required, but you will eventually find what you seek. A hermit of some kind, secluded within a strange place unlike most sights you may find. They’re ancient, worldly, with knowledge appropriate of their age. They could be anything from a centuries old withered king, to the last of an extinct race such as a dragon, but usually something thematic of what you’re currently seeking in life. The hermit may be wise, they might even be great and powerful, but now they simply sit in solitude for reasons unknown. You may potentially learn an incredible amount from this hermit, but there is a problem that crops up no matter which world you find them in. Each hermit you locate is varying degrees of mad, eccentric or possibly even unresponsive as they sit in a single spot, unmoving but alive. It will be a great task to pull it free, but their knowledge is almost always a reward worth earning."
600,,300,“Rite of Kindling” ,Dark Souls 1,Lore,"A lost tome containing instructions to old methods of kindling bonfires. This tome allows you to create larger bonfires that many more may rest and heal beside. What’s perhaps a more important ability however is a ceremony found within that can allow others to become firekeepers. This is not a ceremony or role to be taken lightly however. Those who become firekeepers will gain the power to kindle a bonfire and obtain souls that attract humanity used to keep it kindled. Those who cannot handle the rush of darkness may be driven despair. Unlike you, most firekeepers will only be able to keep one fire at a time. Still, spread throughout your allies, many more points of respite can be made than you by yourself."
601,,300,Runesmith,Bloodborne,Lore,"“Runesmith Caryll of Byrgenwerth was a scholar like many who studied beside them, and yet, they were privy to a special sort of knowledge. Inhuman mutterings behind the walls of mundanity gnawed at their consciousness, and the only thing they could do was write them. 

Whatever Caryll heard, whatever skill they developed with transcribing words that humans could not possibly fully fathom, they have once again manifested within you. While you aren’t any better at speaking the language of the Great Ones, you may now write their words, which maintain that power. 

These incredible runes may be emblazoned straight upon one’s mind with the proper tools, conveying their abilities, each unique and relating to the word they represent. Take care, as the unenlightened human can’t handle too many words, meaning only three or so could be benefited from by most. 

Greater perception, insight into the abnormalities in one’s surroundings, will let one better pick up the murmurs of Great Ones, allowing one access to writing more runes.”"
602,,300,Acolyte’s Knowledge,Demon's Souls,Lore,"​You’re not a fool dabbling in magic, no not at all. Whereas some amateur might remember to cast a spell or two you are well-versed in magic. It seems that your constant studies has improved the damage of your spells."
603,,300,Sorcerous Adept ,Elden Ring,Lore,"Intellect, abstract reasoning and all the other scholastic arts are those most treasured by the sorcerers of Raya Lucaria-all talents you have in spades. Not only is your mind powerful enough to withstand the scholastic rigours needed to comprehend, grasp and properly execute various sorceries beyond the common ken of most of your kind, but you are also a gifted wielder of sorceries by the standards of your kin. Some weapons in this world are also more effective in your hands, and perhaps due to your grasp of the underlying principles it seems your sorcerous learnings have made it harder for you to be damaged by hostile sorcery. Naturally this comes with a great deal of knowledge about history, studies about the traditions inherited from sorcerer to sorcerer and insight into the history of this world-but surely the power to blast away your enemies with a barrage of falling glintstone stars is more relevant here?"
604,,300,Old-Fashioned,The Sorcerer's Apprentice,Lore,"Living as long as you have, the things that were fashionable in your youth... simply aren't anymore. On top of just generally wearing suits well, you've got a collection of ancient spells in your arsenal - not necessarily powerful ones, but they're obscure, which immediately gives you the advantage of surprise. In the future, you'll always be able to readily discover some older forms of magic, if you care to look."
605,,300,Signum Linguistics,Skulduggery Pleasant,Lore,"Also called Symbol Magic. It’s one of China Sorrows’ specialties. Harnesses a magical language to produce a wide variety of effects. Fairly unique in that it can be learned by anyone, even if they’ve already chosen their discipline. As such, this magic can be purchased regardless of how many others you’ve bought already, even without Multidisciplinary Magic.

Boosted: Sorrows: Your talent is equal to that of China Sorrows, the world's most well-known user of this discipline. With this, you have become capable of producing greater effects than before. From producing waves of energy to masquerading as another, you can do it all. You can even carve sigils into your very body without a single worry of a mistake. Using this power, you could even seal others’ True Names, provided they meet the requirements for doing so, of course. What you can do now is virtually limitless, as long as you know the right runes. And if the runes you want don’t exist, you can always just invent your own.

Boost Requires Second Coming(Skulduggery Pleasant) to Activate"
606,,300,The Blade of Ma'at ,Justice League Dark,Lore,"This ordinary-appearing dagger is actually a powerful magical artifact of an ancient Egyptian goddess of truth. The magic of this knife prevents it from physically cutting any living being. Instead, when the dagger is plunged into the heart of a being, they are bound to truth so long as it remains in place. They may still lie, but if they do so, the full divine power of the goddess will be delivered upon them, either simply destroying or driving mad all but the most powerful beings.

Of course, the dagger takes a lawyer's view of the truth. Careful wording will allow the effects to be sidestepped and as the dagger doesn't compel them to speak, they can simply choose to either say nothing or only give part of the story.
"
607,,300,Sorcerer Savant ,Young Justice,Lore,"Your understanding of the mechanisms involved in casting spells now let you copy the techniques of other magical users, so long as you have the capability to cast the type of magic that they’re using. This effectively allows you to learn a spell after seeing someone else cast it, though you’ll still need to master it to cast it reliably.
"
608,,300,Gift of Bi­-Sheng ,Libriomancer,Lore,"A gift from the students of Bi­-Sheng. This plain white book made from rice paper allows you to transcribe your thoughts, memories and personality into it. It will serve as a metaphysical anchoring point, allowing you to maintain your identity and cohesion in spite of whatever trauma you may face or attempts to alter your identity/wipe you from existence.
"
609,,300,Rainbow Notes ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Lore,"While mermaids are superior singers, humans invented the art of song to begin with. You are now gifted in the art of music composition, and can creatively piece together the notes and lyrics for new songs effortlessly. In fact, your songs are good enough such that, when sung or played by a magical being such as a mermaid, or someone with magical music like a fantasy bard, they have magical powers of their own. And the greatest thing about music is that it is a treasure that can be shared with anyone. You can teach your songs, even magical ones, to companions and other pupils willing to learn. Please also note that the perk also applies to other musical forms outside of singing, such as the piano, as well as other things such as dancing, prayers, and spell chants.
"
610,,300,Renaissance Girl/Boy ,Lyrical Nanoha,Lore,"But why stop at one field? Why not...all of them? The benefits to this perk are twofold. First, you learn new disciplines and skills quickly. While this can be applied to combat or mundane abilities, it is most effective when you’re learning new sciences or ‘systems’, letting you pick up a new field of study within weeks as opposed to months, or months instead of years. Secondly, your mind is now able to calculate mathematics as quickly as a computer or calculator, able to work out complicated equations in your head within seconds. You could potentially program a spell using these calculations alone without the help of an AI in your Device, if you really put your mind to it."
611,,300,Techniques to Doguu Making ,Golden Sky Stories,Lore,"The majority of these clay figurines are ancient, detailing animals or small humanoids, and to date, it’s still unclear why they were made in the first place. This short primer teaches one how to faithfully reproduce these artefacts, even with modern materials. However, with a bit of extra magic, you’ll be able to bring them to life – though this is where the primer seems to become a bit unclear.

Doguu and Haniwa are distinctly different objects – though they may be visually similar in some cases. The primer goes to indicate however that these doguu you create can serve the same function as a haniwa would, acting as a container for the souls of the dead. In time, you’ll be able to animate the figurine and bring back fragments of the dead soul as well...

I’m not so sure they would be happy to find themselves stuck in a clay figurine, and that’s assuming that the Doguu captures their soul intact. You may alternatively choose to insert a soul into the figurine, though it is best if you have some expertise in manipulating souls and spirits before you do so.
"
612,,300,Munechika’s Legacy to Future Smiths ,Golden Sky Stories,Lore,"These are the notes of one Munechika Sanjou – one of the blacksmiths who forged the five swords under heaven – blades of renown in this land. Though his notes are rather tattered and sparse, they still possess a wealth of information for any aspiring blacksmith.

Any piece you create is far more likely to become a recognized masterpiece, and should you inscribe a signature onto a piece, you can weave an ability into the weapon to empower them. Any who read these notes can perform such a task, but the quality of their work will be dependent on their own skill.
"
613,,300,Sorcerer's Sutra Scroll ,Touhou Project: Parasol Paradise,Lore,"A limitless magical scroll that can accommodate as many spells as the user wishes to inscribe upon it. This scroll can automatically recite chants or undergo rituals in place of the user, and being a magical item, will not function for anybody except for its rightful owner.
"
614,,300,Careless Carrie and the Galette de Rois ,Ib,Lore,"A (literally) animated picture book depicting the cute and bloody tale of how a girl retrieved her lost key and opened the door. When the full tale is read aloud, the conclusion of the door being opened is applied to reality as well, so that if you are in front of a locked door, the door will inexplicably unlock itself. Be careful, though; the storybook’s haphazard coloring made it a little difficult transferring the effect into the reality. If the book is not read in the right way (you automatically know how), reality might glitch; do not attempt to glitch the world unless you feel really lucky.
"
615,,300,Crow ,Neverland: The RPG,Lore,"Like Peter himself, you are a clever mimic. Not only are you good at imitating voices, you can successfully mimic (and cast) vocal spells and powers you have heard. However, you can only memorize one spell to mimic at a time, and must rehear a spell you have forgotten in order to cast it once you’ve shifted to mimicking a different spell. Also, mimicking a spell costs (MP, energy, etc.) twice as much as it would if normally cast (even if the normal spell had no costs, the vocal mimicry will still get an extra cost attached).
"
616,,300,Magister Professor ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Lore,"You were an apprentice once, taken in by the Magisters of your Order. While they taught you much of magic, it is through your own observations that you learned the art of teaching. You now have a grasp of everything a teacher in an academic setting needs - the construction of lesson plans, the ability to command respect and attention from your students, and the use of visual aids in the classroom. If you have an Apprentice of your own, they will be more than grateful to study under your wing. For another 200 Aethyric Humors in addition to the base price, you may notice a strange thing happening. Should you take someone under your wing who is neither of this world nor in possession of native aptitude for magic, your Wind might blow upon them so that they can learn more properly from you. Use this provision for the continued advancement of the magical arts wisely. Should you fail to impart upon your student the importance of controlling that power, you will have only yourself to blame.
"
617,,300,Magic Ring Identification ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages,Lore,"The land of Labrynna has an odd number of magical rings. One assumes that there is someone crafting all of these, but they’re nowhere to be seen. Under normal circumstances, you would need to take the rings to Vasu Jewelers in order to find out what they do, maybe get a curse or two neutralized, before you actually wear them. You on the other hand don’t need to do that, if only because Vasu himself trained you to be able to do so as well. Identifying unknown magic, curses, and spells of all sorts is now well within your talents. Just remember, rings do nothing unless worn.
"
618,,400,Summoning Books,Shin Megami Tensei II,Lore,"You do need to be summoned in the first place to appear before humans most of the time, however. Good thing you have these: Several ritual books with detailed instructions to allow even the most green occultist to call you or your companions forth into this world. Once executed, you will receive a telepathic signal that you are being summoned and have a rough idea of who the summoner is and what their intentions are. If you wish, you may instantly bring yourself before them in your demonic glory.

Of course, unlike some of the smarter demonic grimoires, you’re not actually bound by any obligation to listen to the summoner nor do you need them to stay in your new location if they happen to meet a tragic accident at your hands. Such a shame."
619,,400,Book of Life,Duel Monsters – The Shadow Realm,Lore,"Part of a set of 3 Spellbooks, this book penned by the Heretic Gravekeeper teaches a set of spells that allow you to raise and bind spirits as undead, both skeletal and ghostly. You start off being able to raise Skull Servants with relative ease, and can expand to call upon all sorts of zombie and vampiric creatures as allies with time..."
620,,400,Djinn Box,Kate Daniel ,Lore,"You will get the notes that were used to construct an extra-dimensional prison for a sand storm. The principles used to construct the container and rituals are explained and the use of the reagents are explained in depth. The only issue this is a base of the invoking of the Hebrew god to seal a djinn in the bones of his family. This requires faith, reagents, and principles that may not work for your purposes. But you can use this research as a jumping-off point to create extra dimensional seals similar to this device. This both gives you a head start and speeds up the research needed to adapt this to another system and circumstances."
621,,400,Shake and Bake,Kate Daniel ,Lore,"You have been trained in the art of magical containment, analysis, preservation, destruction, and research. This lets you identify the origins of a magical effect, seal, study, and purge the effect if necessary."
622,,400,Tome of Morytha,Xenoblade Chronicles 2,Lore,"An ancient tome full of knowledge of the old world. Apart from being of extreme interest to scholars like Adenine this strange tablet-like device contains knowledge that any mad scientist would give his left arm to acquire, specifically knowledge about the science of the old world. Such things as blueprints for the first core crystals, mech designs like the Siren and Gargoyle artifices, even the plans for the orbital elevator and space station Rhadamanthus. Had you sufficient knowledge and a robust production base you could begin producing these lost artifacts yourself, though at astronomical cost for the most advanced creations."
623,,400,Legendary,Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous,Lore,"Mortals have a potential all of their own, in a way that Mythic can only hope to emulate. However it happened, you’ve become one of the legendary few to get in touch with genuine strength sourced only from yourself. Already, the sign of your natural excellence improves your body and mind significantly, increasing your strength and agility and charm and such by a few notches each. 

You grow at a speed astonishing to even the most gifted of heroes, reaching the level of mastery by the time most are getting competent. When others begin to number among the greats of their classes, you’ve already surpassed what is considered the mortal limit. You both progress much quicker in training and study while also having a much higher limit in how far you can take such things."
624,,400,Self Made Man,The Free Universe,Lore,"Now this is that rugged individualism that makes this time great! You’re resourceful, and you can sub in practical experience for actual structured “Higher learning” and tutoring, being able to become a master engineer the likes of which MIT could only dream of by simply disassembling and reassembling cars for weeks on end and other amazing feats of bootstrapping into greatness. Similarly, you can learn from experience and basic guides (such as dime store kung fu manuals) as well as if you were under a master’s steady hand!"
625,,400,Second-Born,The Silmarillion,Lore,"The elves call humans ‘hildor’ - the ‘followers’ or the ‘after-comers’ - and the adani - the ‘second ones’. Yet, is there not something to be said for coming second, and watching where the first have gone? You have the wisdom to quickly and easily learn from others’ ways of doing things, whether by observation or formal study. By merely watching a master swordsman at practice you could begin to absorb his style, or observing an elven farmer at work devise more advanced means of agriculture for yourself - and means that don’t require the innate magical talents of the elves as well, as you have equal skill in adapting the ways of others to your own capabilities or resources. Overall, you can learn, reverse-engineer and adapt in this way at thrice the speed of others - perhaps a necessary haste, with your relatively-brief life. Finally, you can spread knowledge learned this way at a similarly-accelerated pace amongst those you teach, or who imitate you in turn."
626,,400,Combat and Ki Manuals,Anima Ark Of Sinners,Lore,"Though it may not be a focus in the game, this world actually contains a variety of impressive martial arts and ki techniques you would normally see in mangas and wuxias. These manuals record all the training, ki abilities, martial arts mundane and supernatural that exist within this world. These shall update each jump you go to with similar martial arts, supernatural combat abilities etc..."
627,,400,Compendium,Castlevania - Aria of Sorrow,Lore,"Monsters, ghosts, man-eating plants, oh my! It can be hard to keep track of what’s what when you’re dashing through a castle and each new room seems to have some brand new monster trying to kill you. Good thing you have this handy little book. This magical tome contains a full list of your personal inventory, your skills and powers, and profiles on each monster or individual you’ve encountered, as well as brief anecdotes on them, their history in relation to you, and the strengths/weaknesses of any creature you’ve discovered. The compendium also has information on your companions in a similar vein, and never runs out of pages no matter how much you flip through it. The book becomes blank in the hands of any unwanted folks peeking at it, too."
628,,400,Book of Overcoming Apophis,Kane Chronicles,Lore,"One of the most popular magical books in the world, albeit one with many, many versions. It’s not the equal of Setne’s Shadow Execration version, but it is several times more effective than any of the common versions. Once per jump, you may choose a new enemy for the book’s spells to also work on."
629,,400,Book of Ra,Kane Chronicles,Lore,"One of the three magic scrolls that, when united, can restore Ra to power. Or a copy thereof, anyway. In future jumps, this item can lead anyone who reads it on a quest to restore or resurrect any ancient, god-like being, yourself included( should you fit the bill), once per jump. This quest will always be difficult for whoever attempts it but never impossible."
630,,400,Notes of Thoth,Kane Chronicles,Lore,"When Thoth, the god of writing, knowledge, and magic was young, he traveled to the far reaches of the Duat, researching the natures and mechanics of those regions, as well as the spirits and gods that called those places home. His field notes - and the many powers and dangerous spells that resulted from them - later became known as the Book of Thoth. By purchasing this, you gain a collection of his notes about the nature of gods, spirits, and other dimensions and planes of existence in this setting, which could be used to invent many of the spells the Book contained for yourself. Post-jump, these notes will update to include the local versions of such things in new settings."
631,,400,The Apprentice’s Magician,Kane Chronicles,Lore,You are incredibly skilled at training up novice magicians. They learn at a rate some five times faster than normal.
632,,400,Tomes of Magic,Castlevania - Order of Ecclesia,Lore,"Though you may not be a great wizard or powerful sorcerer, perhaps you dream of one day becoming one? Then, these tomes will help you on your path. Each one of them is filled to the brim with technical knowledge, dozens of dissected spells, and the explanations on WHY magic is the way it is. They cannot teach you how to cast fireball, but they can show you how to design your own. In addition to these texts, there are also a number of blank books for you to fill with the spells you have designed. Eventually, should you not only write down the instructions for how to throw lightning, but also the explanations behind how and why your spells works, perhaps even a variant or two of the spell, you will eventually find an odd symbol emblazoned on the cover of the book. Congratulations, for should you do this thing, then you will have just created a Glyph. It’s a far slower method than the method Shanoa and Ecclesia uses, but it is independent of their research."
633,,400,Book of Going Forth By Day,Percy Jackson,Lore,"A guide to the underworld and various other side realities. This book includes everything you need to know on how to navigate the afterlife of your pantheon, and also includes some spells useful for dealing with creatures native to there as well. Will update to appropriate planes automatically when you bring it to new worlds."
634,,400,Daedelus Laptop,Percy Jackson,Lore,"This Laptop contains the collected works and musing of the great tinker Deadelus. With some work you might be able to figure out how to build his wonders, ranging from self maintaining automata, to wings capable of flight (that won't melt) to lesser versions of The Labyrinth (semi sapient bit of architecture that can warp themselves to suit your needs). It will take quite a bit of work to figure out how to build stuff from here though."
635,,400,Paragon,Warhammer 40K: The Warp ,Lore,"How can one stand alone against the endless variations of Chaos unless one is ideal in all aspects? You are now not only a spiritual but also a mental and physical titan, omni-talented and capable of meeting virtually any challenge. The sheer magnitude of force you can bring to bear is ultimately limited by the strength of your soul, but the variety of methods by which you can potentially battle the forces of the Warp is nigh-innumerable. You have an awe-inspiring amount of talent for virtually any field of endeavor to which you could apply yourself, be it physical prowess, psyker powers, sorcery, scholarship, invention, or anything else that you could possibly turn your mind and hands towards. You can improve your skills or your strength in any aspect of your body, mind, or soul at incredible speeds and up to the very limits of your capacity. Lastly, as a true paragon you never slip or fumble, performing up to the peak of your ability and doing the very best that you’re capable of doing."
636,,400,Ascension,Warhammer 40K: The Warp ,Lore,"Your soul is unique, unprecedented, and unlimited. You have no ‘cap’ on your powers or abilities, no maximum size or strength for your spirit. You have the potential to improve yourself indefinitely in any or every aspect you possibly can, eventually growing to rival the gods - and then to surpass them. While this may in theory be potentially true for any child of the Immaterium, in your case it’s not only potential but hard reality. Your rate of growth does not experience diminishing returns, and you never get caught in a ‘blind alley’ of development or ‘plateau’ without a breakthrough."
637,,400,Veteran,Twisted-Wonderland ,Lore,"You’ve been at this for a while, huh? Maybe you trained for all your life, or maybe you’re used to surviving on your own, or maybe you’ve been fighting for your life. Thing is, your skills have been honed by experience and it shows! In celebration of this, all your skills and perks count as ‘trained for a hundred years more’, now!"
638,,400,How Far I’ll Go,Disney Lorcana,Lore,"Sometimes you need to hit your limits and push through them, only later do you find you never really had any. Whatever your strengths and skills or knowledge, you find you can improve on them forever."
639,,400,Family Library        ,Castlevania - Lament of Innocence,Lore,"Ah, now this is probably more your style, it's several generations worth of notes on the nature of alchemy and the things that were made with it. Methods for turning lead into gold - some more efficient than others, the creation of weapons and armors with all kinds of useful and powerful abilities, medicines both simple and absolutely sublime, and the crowning achievement, several volumes that theorize on how to create a philosopher's stones. The last of those is incomplete, but contains a detailed analysis on a number of failures, if not how to fix them."
640,,400,Touch no evil ,Grimms’ Fairy Tales,Lore,"You instinctively know how to keep supernatural evil at bay and combat it. Though your purity and your piety offer a natural protection against the dark forces on their own, you also know all the little tricks needed to thwart and protect against the dark arts, at least as best as possible. You’ll know that to hurt a witch immune to lead bullets you’ll have to use silver ones and other tricks to hurt, confuse and defeat evil. This doesn’t protect you against the mundane and often more horrifying evil of man however. You may know that the devil can’t touch you if you cover yourself with water and/or tears, but that doesn’t protect you against your father hacking off your hands."
641,,400,Spellbooks and Wands,Hyperdimension Neptunia,Lore,Lowee is a fan of magic! This means they’re quite happy to spread it out! You may use these spellbooks and wands to teach Neptunia magic to others as you wish. A person will usually take about a year in order to begin casting these spells.
642,,400,Dimensional Communication,Hyperdimension Neptunia,Lore,"This talent allows you to reach across the dimensional gaps to discuss things with your counterparts in other dimensions. This will be difficult, but you’ll find that your dimensional counterparts can offer you advice, and often have knowledge of their own to share. The counterparts will not be jumpers, instead each possessing a single background and the appropriate perks, and their advice will be based off the knowledge they gain from those."
643,,400,Wisdom Of The Ageless,Castlevania - Judgment,Lore,"If you would give me a moment of your time, I would like to start this particular conversation with the preface that there is no such thing as an immortal being. Time stops for no man, and your life will end eventually. Having said that, you are now naturally ageless. The ravages of time hold no effect on you, old age, if you ever feared it, is a thing of the past. And then there is what you have done with your life during this extra time. So far as I can tell, you spent your years idly researching every topic that crossed your mind, from curses and other dark magics to every weapon known to man and beast. You even had an encounter with a watcher such as myself in the past, it seems. While this has not lent itself to in depth knowledge, it does mean that you have a trivial amount of mastery in seemingly every topic - not even my arrival or the Time Rift itself is something you know nothing about."
644,,400,Grand Repository,MTG - Tarkir                                ,Lore,"The Jeskai have gathered the wisdom of their Way for over a thousand years, and this is a copy of that knowledge. Here are scrolls containing detailed explanations of all the martial styles and philosophies of the Jeskai - though despite the incalculable wealth of knowledge here, it’s no substitute for a real teacher."
645,,400,Matchless Wizard ,Valkyrie Anatomia,Lore,"Mortals are often tragically subjected to suffer and fend for themselves in a world where Gods do as they will, and monsters roam free. Nonetheless, they have not once halted the advance of civilisation, forming magical schools and alchemy sufficient that they can even create life. You will be gifted with a masterful understanding of the flow of magic in order to learn any spells or rituals that you have the chance of studying. As well as the theoretical uses, you are also naturally gifted with magic on par with powerful einherjar and the most learned scholars, nearing the extent of Lezard Valeth, a man who, in another world, once became a God himself."
646,,400,Library,Touhou Luna Nights,Lore,"You have a copy of the Scarlet Devil Mansion’s library. It’s very extensively furnished with grimoires and other books containing extensive information on magical arts and the world around you. You could easily teach yourself or someone else any magic in this series with the contents of the library, if you had the patience to study the vast trove of wisdom."
647,,400,The Resurrection Spell Book,Disney’s American Dragon: Jake Long,Lore,This spellbook contains two different Resurrection Spells that could be used to bring the Dead back to life cheating Death itself. Highly complex and they have time requirements. The first way makes use of a Magical Scarab Beetle and the Moonlight and needs this book to work. The second requires you to create a circle of stones with four torches created in the center of the circle as a bonfire. You must gather Hydra Scales and Phoenix Feather. Then most importantly you need the Chi of a Dragon or the Blood of one. Both rituals can be used to bring back to life one or more people so long as you have a connection set up to them. Though the second one is far more powerful infusing the resurrected with greater dark powers than they had in life.
648,,400,Library,Castlevania (Netflix) ,Lore,"You or your family possess a massive library, with books dating back centuries and covering topics like history, science, and even more esoteric knowledge like the weaknesses, strengths, and anatomy of various monsters and practical knowledge of how to combat them and their dark magics. Those skilled in mysticism will get the best use out of the library, however, since it possess many books of spells that can be deciphered or translated with knowledge of magic. There’s even an entire book of spells about... penises... The library can be added onto another property if you wish, or made into a Warehouse attachment. Cannot be purchased by Companions."
649,,400,Twenty Five Purities Path,Kill Six Billion Demons,Lore,"Someone found the book, it seems. Having studied this book, you have gained a multitude of abilities. You are immune to all poisons and diseases, no matter the potency or nature. You are also immune to all attempts to change or alter your mind against your will. Additionally, by studying someone, you can see their weak points."
650,,400,Necronomicon,Wild Arms 2,Lore,"A Magic book describing dangerous spells that focus on harming others, no one knows where the title is from, it just sounded cool to some crimson noble so it stuck. Any spells using this book as a focus are half again as powerful and effective."
651,,400,Crest Graphing,Wild Arms 2,Lore,"The Crest used by sorcerers during the casting of spells eliminates the need for troublesome rituals such as the drawing of magic symbols or the speaking of incantations since everything is already done in the crest. There’s even some altered crests, inscribed in a different way that supercharges a spell by boosting its impact, making it work on a larger number of targets or making it more efficient.

You have years of experience in building these crests and the talent to understand glyphs and all other runic, symbolic or magic languages. Just looking at a magic symbol is enough to let you start puzzling out what they mean, how to wield them in spellcasting and get a few ideas about building tools either powered by, or able to cast magic. You have an insight in learning how magical artifacts and magic languages work in general, everything comes to you much faster than normal. 

Building a magic tool or crest requires money and rare resources, but you can scavenge existing crests or other magical artifacts to create your own or build new ones. With time and experience you may learn how to improve existing crests or design new ones that apply different effects to your spells. You can also convert a crest into a crest cap, an item holding a prepared spell and usable by anyone at any time, though it needs to be prepped again after every use."
652,,400,Primer,Mage: The Ascension,Lore,"Grimoires (or Principaes to Technocrats) are magical books (or CDs or some other method of storing information) that contain mystical knowledge such as how to perform certain Rotes. Most impressively, by studying a Grimoire for months one can increase their Arete without going through the internal spirit quest of a Seeking. An even more advanced Grimoire is called a Primer, the most famous of which is the Kitab al-Alacir. A Primer can teach a Sleeper the first dot of Arete, causing them to Awaken. You have one Primer for each Paradigm you possess, only usable by followers of that Paradigm. As an added bonus, the Sleeper will also gain the appropriate Paradigm perk."
653,,400,Demonology,The Owl House V1,Lore,"Uhhh, look out guys, it seems Ed and Lorraine Warren got themselves a successor. You, my friend, have an encyclopedic amount of knowledge about demons stored inside your brain. Their biology, their behavior, how to best restrain and keep them trapped; and so much more. With this amount of knowledge you could instantly identify what type of demon you are dealing with and how to better befriend, capture and/or destroy it."
654,,400,Mind of a Warlock,Destiny: The Guardians,Lore,"Your mental faculties have been enhanced, your base intelligence a true contender for peak human. Your mind takes to new knowledge and skills an order of magnitude faster than average, and you seem to have an understanding of the rules and lore of the Destiny universe that lends well to solving the puzzles so many of the stronger fights here become. In future jumps you will receive a similar download of theoretical knowledge on mechanics of the setting. It will be up to you to shift this understanding to practical uses."
655,,400,Iron Sharpens Iron,A Certain Scientific Accelerator,Lore,"If you want to get anywhere, you need to be challenged, and there’s no greater challenge than lethal combat with an equal - or at least a worthy opponent. When you face such a foe, the powers and skills you use will grow and expand at a vastly accelerated rate, as will their supplementary abilities. Even one fight to the death is worth decades of careful study and development, and repeated struggle can push back your natural limits, even midcombat. Lesser fights aren’t pointless either, and it’s a surprisingly effective substitute for rehab. The burned hand teaches best, but burning off someone else’s hands is also a learning experience."
656,,400,Quincy Craft,Bleach,Lore,"Traditionalists in most ways, it’s no big surprise that even the way they grow is slow and steady. Advancements in technology and technique don’t so much come from innovation as they do from steady use and gradual improvements. Creating an enhanced technique, improving it’s power or removing it’s weaknesses, is a process done gracefully in time. There’s no need to break the mold. Your own techniques and devices follow such a path too, if desired. With long term use, you naturally discover methods to improve overall power, reduce or even remove weaknesses and generally improve your arts. Archaic and antiquated is just another way to express familiarity and mastery. It’s lucky the Quincy have such long lives, particularly given your knack for teaching others the improvements you make. "
657,,400,Guardian Witch,Mobius Final Fantasy,Lore,"Someway, somehow, there are those who have managed to worm their way into your heart. But they are so terrifyingly fragile, and far too naive to boot. So how do you keep them safe from the horrors of the World? By guiding them, by teaching them how to survive and defend themselves. If there are those whom you truly cherish, you find that they learn anything you teach them twice as fast as they would have otherwise. This also applies to Out of Context powers as well, but you'll need to set up a foundation from which they themselves can build upon."
658,,400,Powered Prodigy,A Mage Of Sorothustra,Lore,"You are a once-in-a-generation genius when it comes to learning and mastering magic. This extends to the other schools of Sorothustran sorcery, but also to all sorts of other schools of magic as well, allowing you to take and apply your magical perks from other jumps to your Sorothustran magic and take these perks and apply them to other forms of magic with ease. You are even capable of teaching others magic, though unless they are a Sorothustran or otherwise possess an incredible amount of magical energy and an indomitable will they will not match you in terms of your sheer scale. Still, you can teach them magic that is as strong as their souls happen to be, and most lifeforms possess some level of magical energy."
659,,400,Growing Into the Role        ,Seven Deadly Sins,Lore,"A Holy Knight must fulfil many roles in the course of their duties. They are not just unstoppable juggernauts in battle but also policing officers, guards, generals, diplomats and teachers. Most Knights master these roles over time, learning from their mistakes and errors to become great men that serve their Kingdom to the best of their abilities but you require very little time to get used to these roles and ranks. Whenever you are placed into a position or rank, you begin to very quickly learn the skills and abilities needed for excelling in that position. You will not gain new powers, even if the rank requires them, but you will master any powers you have that the rank you have been given is required to have mastered. While this unique talent is able to condense what might otherwise take years of experience into just a few weeks, it is only when focused on a singular role that the benefit is so great. If you lay this effect on more than one position or take a rank required to cover many different roles, the effect will be spread out amongst each role."
660,,400,Latent Power,Seven Deadly Sins,Lore,"A would-be King has a long way to go from where he starts to become a worthy king. Whilst he might have the potential to rule, no one starts with that potential fully realised and indeed, some never find the true extent of their own talent despite searching all their lives for it. You’ll never need to try so hard to unlock what hidden strength lays within you though. When it comes to finding the power that hides locked away somewhere in your being, you’re a natural unlike any other. This does not create new powers, only greatly help the process of finding and gaining the use of those abilities that you have the potential to use but are somehow blocked. It also assist you greatly in reaching your overall potential quicker, making it far easier for you to train or study as compared to your own peers. It is a King’s destiny to stand atop his Kingdom and the rest of the world, you’d hardly be much of a King if you didn’t have the ability to match."
661,,400,Great Teaching Whiz,Dragon Ball Super,Lore,"Mortals may have limited lifespans but there is plenty of use to be found in them for the brief times they are around. Entertainment, useful servants, sometimes even powerful allies on rare occasions. It pays to teach them well and bring out their potential and you’ve gotten quite good at that. You’re one of the greatest teachers of the multiverse, able to instill lessons into people that would normally take years of work in just days, no matter how stupid the student might be. You can effortlessly draw out the latent talent and potential in someone, even for something you are not skilled on yourself, and can teach people techniques that should not be physically possible for them to learn, such as a mortal training in the use of godly martial arts."
662,,400,Another Step Up,Dragon Ball Super,Lore,"Martial Arts is like a ladder with an endless number of rungs. There is always one step further to take, one more refinement to add to your techniques and one more stage to a transformation. This is the truth for you, allowing you to always be able to take any technique or transformation you have to a new stage of ability. These will always be significant improvements on the prior stage but will be difficult to achieve even at first, with successive new stages becoming exponentially harder and longer to acquire and to master. The effort will be well worth it however, allowing you to become a mighty contender even with a very limited moveset."
663,,400,Guidance,Final Fantasy Type-0,Lore,"Commanders also double as teachers in certain kingdoms, so you’ve also picked up the skill to teach your allies. Though you may only teach them skills, they will learn it without fail as long as they meet the skill’s inherent requirements. Each kingdom itself does have a standard specialty which can be taught to others.

Suzaku – Principles of Summoning: Doesn’t teach how to summon an Eidolon, but does allow for one to call upon a steady stream of an element such as fire, ice, wind, water, earth or lightning.

Byakko – Barrier Degradation: Teaches the construction of a small cube like device which will destroy magical barriers it comes in contact with.

Genbu – Iron Duke’s Resolve: Teaches how to brace oneself against attacks, and a set of physical techniques to deflect physical blows coming from any direction.

Souryu - Talking to Your Dragon: Teaches the basics of dragonspeech, and how to pacify dragons."
664,,400,Advisor,Generic D&D 5e,Lore,"You gain insight into the planes that others would kill for. When you cast a spell or otherwise go looking for info on other planes/planar creatures there is no chance it will drive you insane. This overwrites all other text which may indicate otherwise. You also know how or where to get any planar knowledge you so desire, if you think about it for more than a few minutes. 

If all else fails, there’s always old man Joe in Candlekeep..."
665,,400,This Seems Familiar,Stranger Of Paradise - Final Fantasy Origins,Lore,"This world is stuck in an endless cycle by the Lufenians who wish to keep the kingdom of Cordelia under their control while wiping out the memories of strangers they send to the kingdom. This makes it so that your memory cannot be altered against your will as well as granting you an infinite memory capacity with perfect indexing. Furthermore, whenever you enter a jump you can choose to gain the knowledge of what would have happened within your stay as well as that of any past loop that may have happened in the setting. This is a boon that could allow you to easily break out of the loop and control of the Lufenians."
666,,400,No Level Cap,Stranger Of Paradise - Final Fantasy Origins,Lore,"Normally after reaching the max level in a job which is level 30 you would require using a limit break for that job to add another 25 level to the level limit of that job if it’s an expert job or a measly 5 extra level limit to one such as Cyclic warrior. This of course would get very annoying which is why you have this. this breaks the limit on your ability to grow stronger and more skilled in all ways as well as removing any diminishing return you may face (this means in game terms that the same amount of experience is needed for level 99 to 100 as level 1 to level 2). You can level up your jobs infinitely,endless expanding the abilities you gain from it as well as the various boosts they provide you."
667,,400,World Spanning Cosmic Understanding​,Generic Exalted,Lore,"You are capable of understanding, and indeed innately understanding of, the Big Picture. The larger the scale, the deeper your insights. Large scale plans, plots, engineering projects, wars, logistical issues, anything and everything. So long as it is large in scope you are gifted with a tremendously deep insight into it, far beyond what you might possess otherwise, and will be able to make significantly better decisions in order to enact a given end goal.

You could glean, as an example, a reasonable amount of understanding into the pattern enforcing charms worked into the trade routes of Creation such that you may actually learn and understand why and how they work, and how potentially to enact such large scale effects yourself given the correct time and effort. Even a system as complex and absurdly large scale as the Realm Defense Grid itself is not beyond your ability to glean insights into, though actually building such a thing may be beyond you, especially if you lack the materials to make it or the crafting abilities to put those materials together. Just because you might understand how a given thing works doesn’t mean you have the ability to actually make it yourself, after all."
668,,400,Great Healer ,Final Fantasy XVI,Lore,Tarja is the healer of the hideout. A healer of such skill that she could even help Dominants recover from their injuries and is such a skilled surgeon that she is capable of removing the brands tatooed upon bearers with a scalpel without unleashing the poison hidden within the brand. This grants you her skill and knowledge in healing and medicine including the knowledge of various medical herbs as well as how they can made into poultices and various cures. This knowledge updates each jump making you a healer of similar ability.
669,,400,Library of Daedalus,Greek Myth,Lore,A grand library titanic in scale such that it could rival a large temple. It either connects to your warehouse or appears in the world. Within the library lie details on the works of all great craftsmen and artists of Greece detailing their masterpieces and works. A person could spend years reading the scrolls contained here without reading all of them. These scrolls are for masters so only those who have already become a master of the contained craft would be able to truly make use of the techniques and skills within them. Only the works of the gods themselves surpass the scope of this library.
670,,400,Scholar and Loremaster,Diablo 3,Lore,"Quite a clever One here... Well now you can count yourself among the more intelligent people of Sanctuary. You can count and memorize what you have on your person or what you did, read and understand any written text, no matter how confusing, long or ancient it is and learn ancient languages in a matter of days at most. But what you are really good at is any kind of history and story you may come across. Like Deckard Cain, you are one of the best Loremasters ever seen, knowing more about the Eternal Conflict than any other Mortal ever could and are able to write it down for future generations. This also allows you to come across ancient texts seemingly at random but logical places, that contain true historical facts...even when they are written like a fantastical story."
671,,400,Cardinal Codes,The Irregular at Magic Highschool,Lore,"Cardinal Codes originate from the Cardinal Code Hypothesis, a theory that state the existences of 16 Magic Sequences that can, when assembled in various combinations, recreate any of the Magics from the 4 Great Systems, two Codes for each sub-type and each being from a positive or negative pole.

Cardinal Codes are much more compact than normal magical coding, so any Sequences making use of them will be faster and more efficient. 

A single Cardinal Code has been discovered by Kichijouji Shinkurou, a Third Magic High School student, until now.

You possess two such Cardinal Codes for Systematic Magic of your choice and are capable of eventually breaking down any magic you know into Cardinal Codes equivalents with much effort, allowing you to recreate any magic you know with them."
672,,400,Mage Consul,GrimGrimoire,Lore,"Do you perhaps already know this? You claim that you’ve never practiced this magic before, but it seems more as if you’re dusting off old memories and skills once mastered, rather than like learning something new.

Every time you wield a new supernatural art, you learn it impossibly rapidly, and in such a manner that it isn’t much like learning, so much as it is showing you something you already knew, but didn’t know you knew. And once this process of revelation starts, it will continue for five days, at the end of which it will be as if you immersed yourself in that art for a hundred years, using it every day and with great desperation and devotion. This will not create talent, nor lead you to new insights, as if you hadn’t had time to expand on that knowledge. It will be the foundational uses of it, polished to perfection.

This will only happen once for each topic you’re exposed to, though for a branch as broad as one of the four arts of magic, there are many individual arts, individual topics, for you to touch on and thereby awaken your mastery thereof."
673,,400,The Next Merlin,Generic Angels and Demons,Lore,"Merlin, the legendary great mage that became known by his enormous magical power and by being the advisor and mentor of the also equally legendary king Arthur. While this is well-known by most people, what tends to be more obscure is that he was the son of an Incubus and a human prostitute. While the mage’s demon side was purged after his baptism, he retained his inhuman power and became the great mage of the legends. Unlike him, you still have your demon side intact, but, in addition to it, you now have an enormous magical potential, one that matches the likes of Merlin. Just this potential is already enough to make you able to reach the level of a genius in a single magic system in less than a decade with enough effort and this ease with wielding will also work with any magic system you encounter in future worlds."
674,,400,Faustian,Fate/Legends - Voyage to Valhalla,Lore,"Magus are selfish and troubled lot. Many are the crimes some would commit to further their power and genius. But you yourself already are possessing plenty. Much like Georg Faust you are ahead of your time in the fields of both alchemy and engineering. Your techniques could revolutionize the field, generations ahead of what is to be found here. It is easy to commit yourself to seeking further knowledge, your mind absorbing information like a sponge, though with this Perk alone homunculus and alchemy always will remain your greatest forte. In fact your particularly skilled at making Homonculus lifelike, giving them ego and human traits. Though if you desire you can switch that specialty for something else, your genius in that specialty being similar."
675,,400,Chosen Teacher,The Elder Scrolls: Dovah,Lore,"When you look upon mortals, you just can't help but feel pity for them. Their lives finite, their forms frail, their Voices weak. Luckily for them, you are capable of teaching any mortal the ancient art of the Thu'um in a fraction of the time it would take, allowing them to learn a full shout in a month. This is an even more fantastic ability then you might first think, as you can even teach those who originate from worlds completely devoid of any magic."
676,,400,Scholarly Erudite,Mushoku Tensei ~ Jobless Reincarnation ~,Lore,"Wanting to help advance a primitive society would be great and fancy, but pointless if you don’t have the necessary knowledge and ability to do it. With this you gain knowledge equivalent to a PhD in Hard Science and all of its branches and an increase in your ability to absorb knowledge like a sponge, where mere months of learning any subjects Hard Science would allow you to reach PhD-level. When you're doing research and development on a subject so long it's halfway related to Hard Science this increases the speed of the advancement and constantly gives you inspiration to finish it. By default you have the knowledge and blueprints of 21st Century Earth allowing you to build them should you have the skills and ability needed to build Earth Technology and even you could still draw inspiration from the knowledge and blueprints to make Magic Tools in this world."
677,,400,Grand Mentor,Mushoku Tensei ~ Jobless Reincarnation ~,Lore,"You are an excellent teacher who can teach even the most unwilling and hard headed people and any student that you teach will always have your lessons be perfectly engraved in their mind, body and soul. They also comprehend, understand and retain any kind subjects, skills, knowledge, discipline and etc... that you teach them no matter how complex and mind-blowing it is in the current era. The students that you teach learn and show results that would normally take even genius people decades to achieve in just months under your tutelage, though their proficiency and mastery can only reach your level proficiency and mastery on whatever you teach them. Your students will always acknowledge you as their master and even your most ungrateful pupil would shed tears on your death."
678,,400,Sublime Swordsman,Horus Heresy: The Primarchs,Lore,"When a ten foot plus titan of warfare chooses to devote himself to mastering the blade, the results are mastery beyond human excellence. You have achieved as close to flawless perfection as any man, Marine, or Primarch can ever achieve in the art of melee combat. You could out-duel nearly any of your brothers from a purely technical perspective. You might not be the largest or strongest, but you are obviously the most skilled with the blade and more than capable of out-duelling practically anything else that exists in the galaxy. "
679,,400,Genius,Horus Heresy: The Primarchs,Lore,"You would stand among the smartest of Primarchs, by raw intelligence alone. You are capable of constructing accurate mental simulations for every scenario you could reasonable predict, enabling you to come up with incredibly elaborate and sophisticated plans. You are also capable of accurately judging your own limits, which is rarer than it sounds. Your mighty intellect also has combat applications, you can rapidly adapt to any enemy you face by studying and analysing their style in seconds far faster than even the Astartes could. In this way, you can spot flaws in their moves or perhaps see new vulnerabilities you could exploit."
680,,400,Racial Skills,Elder Scrolls Online – The Vestige,Lore,"Every race in Tamriel has unique abilities that cannot be replicated by others. Bretons have innate magical resistance. Orcs can fly into berserker rages. Nord resists cold and are able to instill fear in their enemies just by shouting. Normally, these abilities are the same for every member of their race… but not for you. Now, you can develop them with training like any other skill. You can only do it for your race power this jump, but in the next one you can apply this Perk to all racial abilities you acquired, training them to new heights. As a small bonus, you can use all the powers of all alt-forms you possess independently by the shape you assume."
681,,400,The Complete Book Of The World: Rongo Rongo,Akame ga Kill!,Lore,"Knowledge is a form of power and this specific form of power is exactly the basis for this Teigu. The book-type Teigu, Rongo Rongo, contains the greatest collection of knowledge regarding this world, possessing every single map in the world, with the information about the Empire's territories being especially detailed and including every detail about its mountains and lands, as well as also contains extensive information regarding every continent and country, allowing someone to study and learn each nation’s native culture and language using this information for example. It even contains some information regarding the Teigu themselves, from their abilities to their origins. Additionally, its “trump card” is located on its last page, where there is a prediction of large scale natural disasters that will happen in the future years. Furthermore, its pages can alter their content as needed, allowing the book to expose a virtually unlimited amount of knowledge in a limited amount of pages. And, as it’s still a Teigu despite being a book, it’s probably only readable for those that are compatible with it.

For 200 CP, you’ll receive a replica of the Rongo Rongo with these exact abilities and wealth of knowledge, however, if you prefer, for 400 CP instead, you’ll receive an enhanced version of the book, one that updates itself to add similar information regarding each future world you visit."
682,,400,Master of Your Own Style,Akame ga Kill!,Lore,"In the same way as Syura, during your travels, you learned numerous different martial arts of various countries and incorporated all of them into your own unique fighting style with the best aspects of each one of them, becoming an extremely strong martial art master capable of matching a true master of the Imperial Fist, and thus capable of similar physical feats, or even surpassing one thanks to your style’s unpredictability and adaptability. Additionally, you’re also extremely skilled in incorporating any other martial art you know or will learn into your unique fighting style, allowing you to gradually perfect it more and more."
683,,400,Master of the Imperial Fist,Akame ga Kill!,Lore,"You’ve been rigorously trained in the temple considered the best school of martial arts in the Empire and, as a result, you become an extremely skilled practitioner of the Imperial Fist, essentially already having achieved the rank of master. Through your mastery over this martial art, you’re already able of feats such as dodging bullets by predicting their trajectories and moving accordingly, stopping blades with your bare hands and even briefly overpower a prominent hand-to-hand fighter who possess a strength-enhancing Teigu, all of this without having a superhuman physiology and thus limited as a regular human, so, if you had access to means to enhance yourself, you could reach even further levels of strength. Additionally, you’re also pretty skilled when it comes to teaching the Imperial Fist, as you could even make someone of average potential to achieve the rank of master in less than a decade of training, a feat that normally could take their entire lifetime to achieve."
684,,400,Creative Applications ,Marvel: Age of Krakoa,Lore,"Once you’ve been a hero for a while, you get really good at leveraging your powers in all kinds of situations. With this perk, you know all the tricks you can do with your powers, or at least an absurd number of them in the case of particularly versatile powers, and have the equivalent of years of experience and practice in each one. You can also be assumed to have any secondary skills needed to pull a trick off, such as having a talent for applied geometry if one of your tricks is bouncing energy blasts off targets at an angle to hit other targets."
685,,400,Bodhi Tree,Chinese Mythology,Lore,"The bodhi tree is a symbol associated with enlightenment, for it is under one that the first Buddha himself reached the transcendent state. This is a Bodhi tree propagated from the original that the Buddha himself sat under. While in close proximity to this tree you learn and master skills at a significantly greater rate, with endeavours taking weeks shortened to a few days and those taking months to only a few weeks."
686,,400,Bodhisattva,Chinese Mythology,Lore,"Those who have delayed their own pursuit of Nirvana in order to ascend all sentient beings to Buddhahood are known as Bodhisattva. You as well can be counted among them. You are an exceptional teacher, able to pass on lessons and skills with great ease. With only a few lessons, or even a single one, you may steer someone away from their negative tendencies, move them beyond their inner demons and pass on your skills to them."
687,,400,Wugushen,Chinese Mythology,Lore,"It was said that Shennong, the legendary founder of Chinese of medicine, tasted and tested hundreds of plants to test their medicinal value. You have managed to inherit his skill in the same arts. Your body is immensely resistant to poison and toxins, unaffected by all but the strongest poisons this world can offer. Your knowledge in the medicinal value of various substances is broad and deep; you are able to identify the effects different materials have on the body with but a taste, if not from a glance, and you are able to quickly and accurately diagnose patients with conditions in but a fraction of the time it usually takes."
688,,400,Potential for Divinity,Chinese Mythology,Lore,"If there’s one thing standing out in this world, it’s the number of mortals who either ascend or become deified by others. You too hold a similar sort of potential; while the rate of growth for your abilities has not changed with this perk, your potential for improvement is unlimited. Through hard work and effort you too can call yourself a peer to the celestial beings above."
689,,400,Shooting Suns,Chinese Mythology,Lore,"Just as Hou Yi was able to shoot down nine suns with the skill of his archery, so too can you. Your skill with the bow is legendary, rivalling that of the greatest archer in Chinese myth. You are able to effortlessly shoot the wings off a gnat from kilometres away, hit a moving target obscured by bushes and trees, and a whole manner of archery skills."
690,,400,Honed in the Crucible,The Destiny Universe,Lore,"After the battle of Twilight Gap, and then later the Great Disaster, Lord Shaxx realized that as Guardians continued to fall in battle, the number of combat veterans who had experienced the Dark Age was steadily declining over time. New Guardians tended to lack the experience of fighting warlords that had made their predecessors so effective on the battlefield, while experienced Guardians were a finite and—especially after the Great Disaster—scarce resource. For this reason, he founded the Crucible as a means of training new Guardians in mundane and paracausal combat by way of exploiting their greatest power: resurrection. Guardian teams would compete in objective-based, live-fire matches: fighting and killing each other for training and for sport. Through the Crucible, even the newest Risen could be honed into a deadly killing machine. By purchasing this perk, you receive the equivalent experience of hundreds of Crucible matches ranging from the simplest of death matches to the most complicated objective games. If you had never so much as held a weapon before, this perk would give you the experience necessary to run Strike missions by yourself—instantly honing you into the kind of one-man army that the Last City makes movies about. This won’t give you the strength and skill necessary to throw down against the more powerful opponents that prowl the ruins of Sol and certainly won’t raise you to the level of gods, but with the right equipment to back you up, there are few mundane fighting forces that could resist you. Just remember, Guardian, that while the strength of the pack is indeed in the wolf, the strength of the wolf remains still with the pack. The greatest lesson you can learn from the Crucible is that even with the ability to escape the clutches of death, at the end of the day, you can still be laid low in battle—be it at the hands of the most experienced fighter or the newest Light."
691,,400,Thanatonautics,The Destiny Universe,Lore,"...or perhaps you prefer to learn more from death itself? Thanatonautics is the field of study pioneered by Warlocks in which a Guardian dies and resurrects themself over and over again to get glimpses of what lies beyond the grave. These visions often lead to deep revelations about the nature of reality—including cryptic philosophical insights as well as knowledge of past, present, and future events—but can also come at a cost. Exploring death in such an intimate way often leads to insanity in those who have attempted it, and it is unknown—or perhaps even deliberately kept hidden—if any have ever recovered from such madness. By selecting this perk, you become more in tune with the art of Thanatonautics—requiring fewer deaths to receive usable information and gaining increased resistance to its maddening effects. The information you glean from your forays into death are guaranteed to be of use to you in payment for the portions of your sanity you are risking in acquiring it. This alone, however, will never give you all the answers: instead offering you crucial hints and insights that will enable you to piece together the truth yourself.

In addition to your previous mentioned resistance to insanity, you are guaranteed to eventually recover from whatever madness this art may produce. This is not blanket immunity, however, and looking too far beyond death can still result in a mental fracture that will take up to a year to recover from—barring outside help. Continuing to practice Thanatonautics beyond this may result in additional fractures which can quickly add up unless given time to heal—adding further damage to your mind and another year to the clock for each new fracture. Are the secrets of oblivion truly worth the sanctity of your mind?"
692,,400,Right Hand of Fate ,Scion ,Lore,"Three Purviews stand aside from the others, due to their deep relationship with Fate. Prophecy offers glimpses into future events. Mystery grants an understanding of bizarre, seemingly random events and how they connect. And Magic permits the direction and influence of Fate itself. You are now deeply skilled in all of these Purviews even if your parent had no sway over them-and if they did, your power over them would advance at a frightening speed to your peers. Crucially, instead of just to recoup Legend you may use the sacrifices of Magic to defer being fatebound to those you interact with. Should you achieve true godhood, you would exert power over these purviews comparable to the Moirai themselves-a terrifying prospect to many gods, for being reduced to little more but mouthpieces for Fate’s inscrutable force they are dangerous to interact with. And unlike them, you retain great agency in directing your fate and others’."
693,,400,Haptasnytrir Foldardróttinn,Germanic/Norse Mythology,Lore,"Like Odin, eternal seeker of knowledge, you have a gift for learning, not simply in a sense of being able to learn faster than most, but by more esoteric means being able to locate long lost or forbidden knowledge and skills, beings who have refused prior students will never refuse you, instinctively knowing where to go and what to do to acquire more knowledge and exploit it for your advantage. Your learning speed, capacity, and intuition expanded by an order of magnitude and quests to find or locate such things equally shortened.

But what good is knowledge if you can not exploit it, you now possess the ability to teach anybody almost anything, even if they are incapable to use that knowledge. You could teach a mortal how to wield divine power to create life and they would understand exactly how it works and would be capable of doing as such if they gain the ability to wield said divine power. Whenever you teach people anything, you gain power over them and what they have learned, gaining more power over them the more you teach and the more they wield your knowledge and skills. You could teach someone to be a great fisherman, but make it so they could only catch catfish and these restrictions can be selectively applied as they teach others in a chain of learning. You could teach the world magic and runes and make it so those gifts could never be used against you, or that no matter how skilled and knowledgeable they become they are unable to teach anyone these things, their mind becoming a momentarily blank. Even a third party observing you or your students would be unable to learn anything without your permission, even something as simple as making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, however this won't stop them from making a PB&J on their own they just won't be able to recall how you made it if they saw you do it they literally would not associate the name of the sandwich with those ingredients. If the knowledge from you is so intrinsic to a person that it is how they make a living or is what they are know for or is used in everyday life you would have the ability to manipulate their fate similar to the Norns with lesser control based on lesser connection of that knowledge, you could manipulate the fates of an entire kingdom, world or further with this. Students under you will be able to learn what you have to teach faster as if their intelligence, talent, capacity, and learning speed was increased by an order of magnitude.

You are a plotter and can easily come up with both direct and indirect ways of obtaining what you want. To your eyes obstacles look like opportunities and challengers like people bearing gifts. Moreover, when seeking something that you cannot obtain or achieve at the moment the steps and measures you must take to accomplish your will naturally fall into place in your mind given a bit of time.

But plans are nothing without the will to see them done. You have that will. Your determination is such that you can ignore or power through anything that would seek to stop you, should you choose to do so. From pain to loss to uncertainty to even the greatest social pressure there is nothing that can deter you from your goals but your own judgement.

694,,400,Baldr ,Germanic/Norse Mythology,Lore,"The bold and the beautiful. First the bold, choose an archetype like hero of the people, eternal guardian, black knight, super villain, or even mundane things like  substitute teacher. You will know how to act, talk, and behave to present this image perfectly; the expectations and stereotypes of the role and how to subvert them; how to promote your personal reputation and fame while filling or subverting this role. You will have or quickly gain all the skills necessary to fill this role and when and how to use them most effectively. You will be perceived as the ideal embodiment of this position to the point that you can easily take advantage of the presumptions of others who will not believe you to step out of this role. This is culture and setting specific so a villain in norse myth will be very different than a villain in a james bond movie. You don't just have the ability to subvert this role though, if you find aspects of this role disagree able through your action and presentaion the role will change in time to your ideal; feel like monologuing in a James Bond setting is dumb and the villains over time will take after your example and stop. It might take time but the idea of a supervillain could be shifted to overtaking the position of an anti-hero in the same vein as the role shift seen in Megamind. If you soften the archetype of the super villain - such as to forbid killing - there will be a minor compulsion and peer pressure for others to change their ways, with those refusing to change being considered less villains and maybe just idiots and douchebags. You have leeway for your actions to subvert or actually shift the role; even if not the most powerfull or strongest or most feared you will be the standard to which all others of that archetype are held. This will never hinder you and can be toggled on and off in part or whole as needed, just walking into a bank they may not assume you are there to rob it, or they may and be terrified but wont jump the gun and kick you out or call the cops until you actually do something. You know how to make your boasts truly impressive and inspiring, how to approach challenges to earn as much glory as can be had from them and how to skillfully rebuke naysayers without provoking undue ire. You can live as a warrior while making society and the law work for you rather than against you and these skills continue to work on any society no matter how removed they may be from the mythic Norse culture.Every new universe/jump you visit you may choose a new archetype, retaining all your skills and abilities and knowhow from the old one but it not being attached to your identity within the new place.

Second, Beauty. Beauty is not a matter of appearance, it is a skill in grace and you are most graceful. Under the geas of your appearance no challenge is impossible nothing truly beyond your reach. Any challenge or quest issued that you answer, even if it would have previously been truly impossible, is now ever so slightly within the realm of your capabilities. But sometimes that is not enough, sometimes the ugly resort to cheating and this can not be permitted as it would tarnish such victories. Within your purview the acts of others cheating simply fails, sabotage will undo itself, riging will, those committed to sweep their own or throw a match will find that they wish to be as beautiful as you and act with grace and distinction; all forms of others cheating will fail without exception and darkness will be exposed. Your beauty casts doubt upon those who, with darkness in their heart, come for you; they are compelled to honor, less likely to strike you from the back or attempt to poison your drink, harbor dark plots, conspiracies may crumble, and if someone succeeds in such villainy, never shall they go without exposure to the light of day."
695,,400,Path of Champions,Elden Ring - Altus Plateau,Lore,"It is no secret that the Lord of Volcano Manor seeks out those powerful to join his family, and further cultivates their might against other Tarnished. No matter if you truly believe in Praetor Rykard’s ambitions or are merely biding your time, it would be madness to pass up on such opportunities. You will find that you can quickly learn and master any skill, be it a weapon or spell. Your rate of improvement will only enhance during the heat of combat, soon becoming a threat that may one day challenge the very gods themselves."
696,,400,Paradox Scope ,Final Fantasy XIII-2,Lore,"It takes intense focus, but you have the ability to look into a very limited number of alternate timelines, to look ahead and see potentially what may happen if you deviate from a certain choice. The ability grows increasingly inaccurate the further along the timeline you decide to look ahead. In real time however, time does continue to flow as you look ahead, albeit at a slower rate - so best to do this in a safe place."
697,,400,My Old and Worthless Self...,Cultivation Chat Group,Lore,"...had used literature to enter the Way, righteousness to temper his body, wore the truth as clothes, and used the brush to write down the principles of heaven and earth! Becoming a great cultivator requires not just diligence in their practice, good talent, and plenty of time. It also requires a broad approach, one that builds many aspects together, harmonizing them in a natural way.

You find it easy to practice in such a way that one thing you do helps temper and grow other aspects at the same time. Much like how the Scholarly Indestructible Body of the Buddha uses Mental Energy, Virtue, and Body Tempering all at the same time, you can come up with methods that work for you which grow, train, and temper multiple aspects all at the same time. Such methods will let you make twice the progress with half the work in each area as a normal focused method would. With some work, you can formalize such training regimes to share with others."
698,,400,A True Player        ,A Wild Last Boss Appeared!,Lore,"Inequality runs in the core of this world. Befitting the nature of a world carefully designed by the Goddess, there are still great disparities of power even when one reaches the ceiling of the Level 1000. Some may be monsters born with unfair abilities and incredible stats, such as those known as ‘boss monsters’. These were granted their power by the Goddess herself, and as such, there is little born in the Scenario of the Goddess that can defy them.

But there is another path to distinguish yourself at the summit. One that doesn’t rely just on pure raw power, but on sheer talent and skill. What good is the brute force if you cannot properly utilize it? Not only are you a genius on combat terms, capable of adapting to most scenarios on the fly and master any powerset you get your hands into in the blink of an eye, but you are also the perfect optimizer who always comes with the most efficient method of action, step by step, of what abilities should be used to defeat the enemies before you.

It seems that your obsession for optimization has reached your entire build as well, as if you had built your entire being from the ground to get the most of what was possible for you. Whatever your classes are, you have chosen the best combination to ensure that your stats are as high as they could be, and that you get the strongest skill and spell combinations out of them. And that’s not limited to your current abilities, for your gift for min/maxing will still apply to any growth that you are still capable of, always intuitively knowing what paths you should pursue to achieve the greatest heights in personal power.

Finally, all of this skill has also granted you an incredible precision when it comes to using your powers, always being able to just use the right amount of power and force for the results that you intend. Truly, it is an ability that a certain Goddess too powerful for her own good would surely love to have."
699,,400,Black​ ​Knowledge​,Demon:​ ​The​ ​Fallen,Lore,"You know the basics of either the Lore of Chaos, Lore of Contamination, or the Lore of Violation. By the end of your time in this jump, you will have mastered this one bit Earthbound Lore without requiring a teacher or having to eat any Earthbound demons. In future jumps you will find more opportunities to seize and learn forbidden magic."
700,,400,How to Advance for Dummies,Cradle V1,Lore,"You get a book that tells you exactly how to advance further for any path you encounter, and you can share the lessons for anyone you let read. The lessons become etched in the mind of those who read it, so they won’t ever misremember what you shared with them."
701,,400,Apprenticeship,Cradle V1,Lore,"As a traveler from the heavens, your very presence in this world will make you very interesting to the movers and shakers. You become the Apprentice to a sage or monarch. They will teach you their personal path, and while it may be painful, you’re be on a shortcut to power like no other, besides being a princeling."
702,,400,Tablet of Life and Time,Marvel Zombies,Lore,"Behold, the secret to eternal youth! This is what the Kingpin’s after, and it’s a good deal you’re getting here. This ancient slate has the instructions to create a serum that will make its drinker younger. It’s surprisingly easy to read, though the inscribed hieroglyphics translate to chemical formulae instead of any words. Just remember that it deaged Silvermane into oblivion when he drank it (though he came back afterwards because it’s a comic book series. He showed up again in Daredevil #122.). If you make a zombie drink it, who knows what might happen?"
703,,400,Online Hunter-Base,Dies Irae,Lore,"The UN has a secret site, only for the very trusted or skilled to access. This site contains a wealth of information on some of the worst and most dangerous people in the world, the criminals who possess supernatural powers. Brief summaries of most of their powers, some knowledge on their history, personality and common tactics. It doesn’t reveal everything but even knowing this for some can be a leg up. Through this site, very high reward bounties are offered for these people, which can be an intensely lucrative trade if you have the power yourself. A similar website or at least shop will be available in future worlds, listing information and bounties on all the worst criminals in the world, focusing on the supernatural ones. "
704,,400,Passing Down the Teachings,The God of High School,Lore,"A rugged little handbook you got here. It’s blank for now but that’s just because you’ve not gotten anyone to use it yet. This book is able to copy all of a martial artist’s knowledge on one style of fighting and encode it into the book. When someone reads the book, not only will they have access to all that knowledge but a little piece of the spirit of the teacher who imbued it there will appear to teach them what they need to know just as well as the master would have done themselves. You can put your own martial knowledge into this book if you like or find a Master willing to put their knowledge into this form for you. All that needs to be done is to place your hand, or the hand of another willing Master, and will it to be so, thus the knowledge will encode itself into the book. You can update that knowledge or overwrite it with a new style but it can only store one style at once."
705,,400,Fight On!,The God of High School,Lore,"Losing a limb can be a fatal sentence for a Martial Artist. The innumerable problems such as lacking a limb and the permanent change in balance would retire all but the best Martial Artists and even those prodigal talents would find themselves severely hampered by that loss. Some learn how to deal with this loss and you’re the best among them. You are able to instantly adjust your fighting style to any sort of damage or loss of body part, never losing effectiveness until you are completely immobilised. Even having a single limb left would let you fight as if you had all four. Having all your arms and legs off might stop you...until a few seconds later when you figure how to fling yourself around with your hips and smash your foes to death with your head. And over time, you may even learn to turn these losses to an advantage, discovering ways to cut down on inefficiencies and strengthen your style after losing the crutches that others call limbs."
706,,400,Rusted Knight,RWBY: Ever After Gauntlet,Lore,"To think the former Vomit Boy could be a Hero from a literal Fairytale. This Perk gives you the kind of battle skills Jaune has developed during his time in the Ever After. In addition to that you are clever and brave, always knowing how to protect something or someone. You also have a remarkable resistance to poison."
707,,400,"Guts, Sweat, and Dedication",Final Fantasy X,Lore,"It takes years of practice to become truly great at something, and often that dedication can lead to a fair amount of tunnel vision. After all, when you become an expert in one field, you might end up walking into the pitfall of sacrificing your expertise in other fields.

Thankfully being aware of that, you can mitigate this risk somewhat. You can still train as intensively as you like, focused on a single aspect as much as you want, but at the same time, you’ll see other relevant skills to the one that you’re training return improvements as well. The more dedicated you are to training a single skill or aspect, the greater the improvement you’ll find to other skills. 

It’ll never reach the level of returns of what you gain from the skill you intended to train of course, but it will keep you from becoming a one trick pony."
708,,400,Call Me Master,Chainsaw Man,Lore,"When it comes to taking apprentices you’re simply unmatched. Any efforts to teach someone will go over much easier, especially if it’s related to combat and the methods are a bit brutal. People are safer and happier under your tutelage. After a training session ends, your students enter an enhanced period of reflection and recovery with a duration depending on how effective the session was. All studying, healing, and introspection will be multiplied in effect during this period. Your students will quickly learn to rely on you and come to appreciate your company, as well. Finally, when someone “graduates” your training and you’ve taught them enough to strike out on their own they gain a greatly weakened version of all your teaching perks, a pinch of plot armor, and a much easier time progressing onwards from there."
709,,400,Grail Grimoires,Fate/Stay Night,Lore,"A series of journals, notes, documents, books and other piles of paper have been delivered to you. This vast mass of information was the starting work of the Three Founders and Zelretch Kischur Schweinorg, the 4 Magi who created the Holy Grail and the accompanying system of war. Nowhere near the complete documentation of the build process, this trove of information still contains years of work that would propel anyone beyond any competition in recreating the Grail System if they had obtained the necessary abilities to even start and even if they lack those, the sheafs and sheafs of paper contain many hints and tricks to manipulate the Grail System as is, though you'd need a way to access the Grail first. "
710,,400,I Am the Bone of My Sword        ,Fate/Stay Night,Lore,"One thing. The very core of your being. Something to base your whole life around. For Shirou Emiya, it was Swords. For you? Perhaps something else. You'll find yourself innately understanding the idea you choose, even letting you understand other concepts a bit easier if you can frame it in the context of what you chose. More importantly, you're an absolute genius when it comes to magic based around this one thing. Shirou Emiya, an otherwise poor quality Magus, was able to use magic that approached the level of True Magic when relating to swords. It took him being in a rather unique situation, where usually it would still take years to achieve, but he did what would have been impossible for most Magi. You are on the same level with your chosen idea. When related to that idea, your magic will be many times stronger, many times easier to use and many times easier to learn or create, though the broader the concept is from 'Sword' the lesser the effect will be. Careful to not lose yourself in your own ideal."
711,,400,Trove of Knowledge        ,Elantris,Lore,"Every scholar needs a library just as every wizard needs a workshop. This small treasure in texts contains shelves and shelves of books, covering a wide range of topics. Some contain historical treaties of the world, while others contain scientific and political journals, but the most powerful tomes contain the details of AonDor itself! Granted, these aren’t instructional guides; they’re more like dictionaries written in a programming language. To the uninitiated, these books will be intimidating and information-dense. All that said, careful study will slowly uncover the worth locked in these pages. With a commitment of many months, or perhaps the Opening the Dor perk, one could use the titles within these walls to teach yourself the intricacies of AonDor.

By default, this space is contained within a cosy, weatherproofed basement attached to your domicile. In future jumps, this property may be imported normally. See the Notes section for additional details."
712,,400,Ozymandias,RWBY,Lore,"Ozpin might be the greatest human who ever lived. In no small part because of his LONG life. You could in many ways be considered a worthy rival to Ozpin as you have the same knack for recruiting influential people to your cause, all the while remaining secretive to the public at large. Why you could even with enough time redact and alter information available to the public. When you have the desire to change the world into a different manner you even have a greater learning speed regarding skills that let you do so. Finally... you receive the faintest capacity for magic. Nothing like a Maiden and very much atrophied but enough to amplify your speed and reflexed and to form energy barriers."
713,,400,Magic Stone Methodology,Final Fantasy IX,Lore,"Maybe methodology isn’t really the right word for this, but there are some folks out there who have studied into the art of learning things through rocks. Considering most of us learn things through books or experience, we decided that it had to be a methodology most magical.

Different stones will teach you different abilities, usually related to a corresponding element of some sort. With that said however, once you master this...”school”, you’ll be able to polish your skills to the point that you could make magic stones of your own! You’ll have moved onto teaching with rocks! But of course, others without your fundamental understanding of

Assisted Rock Learning will take a longer time in order to grasp these skills, and the more complex the skill is the longer it will take on top of that. From trial and error, we’ve figured out that skills which act passively tend to work best with this method. A stone really doesn’t help demonstrate complex casting and so forth."
714,,400,Savior of the Programming Department ,Knight’s and Magic,Lore,"Like out resident programmer you now have an incredible prowess in coding in a world where magic works like a programming language you are on your way to becoming an archmage. In a modern world, this allows you to remake an operating system in a single night even make one from scratch with the same time. In this magical world, this allows you to create and modify existing spells to your liking even reverse-engineer a spell to run into the magic system that you know even rewriting the Magius Engine is also possible. This also allows you to break an entire magic system like codes to remove the drawbacks and leave the nice one alone."
715,,400,True Anarchist's Cookbook,Hazbin Hotel/Helluva Boss Pilot,Lore,"An ever-updating book that never seems to get any thicker, it has instructions on how to construct basically any bomb. It upgrades to knowing everything in the local jump. It’d even let you steal something like Bakuda from Worm’s explosive designs if you wanted to...even her...odd ones."
716,,400,Teaching Prodigy,Final Fantasy VIII,Lore,"You're one of the youngest, if not the youngest teacher at your school, and there's a very good reason for that. You're an amazing teaching genius, capable of getting even the densest student to learn something, and even get straight A's. There's almost nothing you can't teach, as long as it's knowledge based. Math, science, history, combat, magic, FTL space travel, as long as it simply relies on knowing your stuff, you've perfected a method of expressing it to your students. It's almost miraculous how you can improve a student's potential, even outstripping most restrictions caused by intelligence or injury, to impart knowledge and skill beyond what they would be capable of alone. This includes, of course, the ability to make schedules, plans, and demonstrations that will optimize the learning process."
717,,400,Literacy Magic        ,Bibliomania,Lore,"A powerful form of magic based entirely on books and words. Unlike Sealing magic which is focused on the written form and has an indirect and powerful application, this one is focused on a more direct approach of using books as a medium of magic or speech to cause effect. It takes a little preperation as the speaking method takes at least a sentence to invoke a spell while using a book would see you involve a passage to create an effect reflected in the book and as such typically works best with fiction, science and history books. Due to this magic this way is fairly draining but also capable of many great things. As an example this form of magic could when used with the right books even revive the dead. Using a book medium uses roughly 25% of the energy required for a speech-only version of this magic though the book method is more rigid and restricted to what's written. A normal human would only be able to endure 5 speech spells or 20 Book spells due to the energy consumption per day, though the strength of your body and souls enhance it."
718,,400,Informational Ozmosis,Bibliomania,Lore,"An incredibly powerful ability being that as long as you are within 5 meters of a source of information you can tag it with this power and start copying and absorbing all recorded information and understanding stored in the information medium at a rate 100 times your reading rate. This gives you not only complete memorization but understanding of the material to the level of the writer's understanding at minimum since you could possibly understand to higher levels. This effectively allows you to learn just by being near some source material and at an absurd rate. More interestingly since you would have complete knowledge you could recite verbatim from any point in the information source as easy as saying your own name. This has an interesting effect with supernatural books and as such when used on any supernatural book that has an effect, you won’t harm or affect the book but can gain all information and powers from them without negatives such as the powers of skill books without using them up, The spells Weiss has from Neir or all the magic and knowledge of Moloch without being possessed or freeing him from the book in Buffy The Vampire Slayer he’s sealed in."
719,,400,Ultimate Multitasking ,Final Fantasy VII,Lore,"Being an executive in a company or someone in a leadership position can be stressful, to put it mildly. Especially if you're trying to juggle things like an adventuring career or secretly spying on a group of interest on top of all your regular duties. At least for anyone who isn't you, that is. Your ability to split your attention between two or more simultaneous tasks reaches the realm of the improbable, letting you effortlessly remote control a drone on the other side of the world with your mind while carrying out the busy schedule of a corporate executive without any break in personality or actions each and every day. Certain high-stress events might make you slip up, but otherwise don't expect anyone to suspect you and that strange talking robot might actually be the same person."
720,,400,"Teach me, Master",Legends of Runeterra,Lore,"There are dozens of temples, monasteries and dojos scattered all around Ionia, and student-master relationships are extremely important. You will never have problems finding a teacher, and in fact it seems like they’re eager to guide you . You’ll also learn at an increased speed when under the guidance of a teacher, and you’ll be able to discern the secret of their techniques just by seeing them perform them once. Considering what powerful martial arts are present in Ionia, you better put the effort to search for the legendary masters of this land."
721,,400,League Material ,Legends of Runeterra,Lore,"You’re a legend, Jumper... or at least, you have a good start for becoming one. This Perk increases the effect of all other Perks you buy in this document and improves your race physical and magical abilities. Furthermore, it makes improving all your abilities and skills far faster, it protects you from freak accidents and random disasters that could stop you from reaching your full potential. It will not help against direct, malicious harm, but it will save you from simple misfortune."
722,,400,Rank Up! ,Fairy Fencer F,Lore,Not all Fairies are created equal and that’s a fact. Because of this they’ve been divided into specific Ranks. Higher Ranked Fairies are capable of more than lower Ranked. It’s just that simple. With this Perk you find it easier to advance in Ranks faster. This provides a Discount in the Fury Section when purchasing Fairy Ranks.
723,,400,Star of Altria,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Lore,"Swords must be honed to become truly sharp. Though you have all the potential to be a holy blade worthy of the Saber name, you’ve hardly been refined at all. Your inexperience shows in every skill, power and even Noble Phantasm. But fear not. Among Sabers, your potential is a shining star, developing at an astonishing rate. A few lessons from a proper Saber could get you most of the way there to maturity, similar to how a week learning from a master swordsman could take you from a beginner to an expert wielder of the blade. While it’s not as fast by far, you’re also able to manually develop your abilities and connected items like Noble Phantasms, slowly growing in power and versatility as you use them more and more. The better they get, the slower it’ll become. 

They might often be naive but that boundless idealism can be just as fetching as any worldliness. These Sabers tend to be on the younger side, not yet having completed their journeys, and they’ve still got a lot to learn. Eager to find any teachers to help them out."
724,,400,Impossible Capabilities,Honkai Impact 3rd,Lore,"Dr. MEI was supremely intelligent, and KEVIN Kaslana was one of the finest and strongest warriors in the world. The fact of the matter is that the Old World produced many great people. People that are incomparable in quality to the people of the current era. It appears that you seem to have inherited the best of all of the people of your era, as you are as intelligent as Dr. MEI, as good of a warrior as Kevin Kaslana, and have all of your capabilities at the peak of what the Old World could reach. Ah, but these are only raw attributes and talents, not skills, so you aren’t a supremely skilled warrior like KEVIN, only talented enough to reach his level in a decade or so. You also aren’t a supremely skilled scientist like Dr. MEI, you’re just intelligent enough to become one if you put a decade or so of effort into it."
725,,400,Book of Many Locations,God Of War (2018),Lore,"While having the appearance of an average notebook, in truth this book contains a list of several locations and where their general location is. These locations can be anything from natural wonders to ancient ruins, yet the book has enough paper to cover all of the locations which are not properly shielded from scrying. Furthermore each time you enter a new world, the book will provide a new section with new locations to visit."
726,,400,Excellence of a Prince,Thailand Mythology and Folklore,Lore,"Your veins are filled with royal blood, and excellence is your birthright. How could you not live up to it? You learn incredibly quickly, now, able to bring a mundane skill to complete mastery in 7 months, and accomplish minor supernatural feats with such things too, such as a musician being able to pacify a whole forest with their song. With just this it’s unlikely you’d be able to take the skill further, for what possible way could you improve if you are already a little beyond the top? But still, with less than a year of unbroken and passionate study there will be very little you cannot accomplish. Of course, this doesn’t help when it comes to enlightenment (AKA character development), but who cares about the Heavenly palaces when you have a perfectly good kingdom down on earth, am I right?"
727,,400,"The Teach, But Actually This Time",DxD Universe,Lore,"You're a pretty awesome teacher now, being able to quickly make your students grow and unlock new talents that they didn't know they had, you can also unlock the mana from DxD into people who lack that."

730,,400,SUPPORT STAFF,CthulhuTech,Lore,"The Eldritch Society isn't just a bunch of Tagers that hunt Dhoanoids. Every murder of Tagers has a small support staff usually consisting of a sorcerer, a loremaster, an operator, and sometimes a trainer. With this perk, you get a large amount of skill at hacking, research, occult lore, and physical training."
731,,400,Pointing Fingers,Library of Ruina,Lore,"The Five Fingers are the peak of what a Syndicate can be. Each is a force of nature unto itself with every lesser Syndicate dreaming of joining one, as almost none could be hubristic enough to hope for more than incorporation. A reputation of such magnitude requires elites of suitable skill to uphold it, and you are undoubtedly worthy of being considered among their number. Like a Proxy of the Index you could consistently hit bullets out of the air with swordswings and execute those who let their guard down for even a second. Like a Capo of the Thumb you could juggle several different types of exotic ammunition without confusion, using each at the most tactically opportune time with uncanny accuracy even when blanketing your opponents in hails of lead. Your skills make you practically synonymous with the strength of entire organizations, particularly with your skills in negotiations, intimidation, and crafting whatever weapon your finger favors. Let all show you the respect you deserve."
732,,400,Office of Hopping,Library of Ruina,Lore,"Few Fixers work alone if they can help it. After all, other than the illustrious Colors each and every Fixer is tied to an Office, it would be foolish not to leverage the professional contacts that come with such an affiliation. Yet there is a problem, as even in the unlikely event your Office is filled with Fixers nearly as skilled as yourself - they’ll eventually have to be replaced with significantly less experienced newcomers. Luckily you have a way around this, finding it easier to train those under you to fulfill higher standards than they would otherwise reach. But this is not individualized mentoring alone, no you could train entire groups of newbie Fixers at once in a fraction of the time, even the most flatfooted among them absorbing enough in the way of combat techniques and principles of coordination to send them up a few Grades. Those to experience your training also find themselves acting more professional, regardless of how uncouth or reckless they may have been prior. However, keep in mind that your training works at its best if standardized, as the more varied the curriculum the more you’ll have to adjust for individual differences when you could instead be refining what you already have. "
733,,400,Mentor,Final Fantasy IV,Lore,"A talent such as yours will need to be cultivated, and as such, you have often found that there are many that are willing to teach you. Of course, while your natural talent pushes well beyond their skill, you do manage to learn from their experience. You’re always able to find someone to teach you in a particular skill, even if it’s outside of your prodigious talents. The more common the skill (wood carving, magic in a medieval fantasy setting) the more likely you are to find a mentor that can teach you something. But the less common, the harder this task will be."
734,,400,Natural Mage,Final Fantasy IV,Lore,"Magic comes naturally to you, as common as breathing. Due to this, efforts to understand, develop and teach new magical systems are several times easier for you. Whether it's the simplicities of black and white magic, or systems of magic you've never heard of, the principles resonate with you immediately."
735,,400,Mímisbrunnr,HighSchool DxD,Lore,"The famed left eye of Odin, capable of granting the user unparalleled insight of all kinds of magic. Even the ones from foreign or exclusive magic systems aren’t exempt from the insight granted by this artifact. Comes from a well located beneath one of three roots of the world tree Yggdrasil, containing so much wisdom, even Odin himself couldn’t just take a sip without losing something first. A must-have if you’re planning to become a master of the arcane arts."
736,,400,Endless Night Party,HighSchool DxD,Lore,"It’s finally your turn, your time to shine on the bright stage of the world. The wind is beginning to shift towards a new era. Never too late, as one can’t be expected to rely on old relics or the innate power of old bloodlines or Sacred Gears to do everything. You have become a formless master, a student warrior with a staunch body and spirit. To put it in other ways, you’re a genius, almost a savant when it comes to picking up fighting styles and mastering them with a little focus and time. Techniques are your game, where each practice, each fight, each hardship or even defeat does nothing but honing yourself even further and getting you closer to a perfected technique. Of course, this not only makes you the king of growth and turnaround in fighting, but in anything that can be said to be methodical or technique-based at its core."
737,,400,Guiding Light,Final Fantasy III,Lore,"The light of courage, kindness, affection, determination. These are how the heroes of this land are described. You are a mentor to heroes, able to guide them in such a way as to nurture their greatest traits. A student under you would find their positive personality traits growing stronger, their negative ones growing weaker, and will in general improve themselves at a quicker pace."
738,,400,Lord El-Melloi’s Protegee,Fate/Strange Fake,Lore,"Along the history of the Clock Tower, there have been few emerging forces as disruptive as the one that the classroom that Waver Velvet took over after his return to the Clock Tower under the El-Melloi name. Whether you were part of this class, or received an equally excellent tutelage in your young years, it’s up to you. What matters is what you received from his teachings: whatever you had before, it was simply incomplete. It wasn’t until you received that tutelage that you were able to reach your true potential. Whatever mystical abilities you have gained in this jump, are now increased in some way. Perhaps this schooling helped you to drastically increase your energy efficiency, or perhaps you discovered a powerful hidden ability from your powerset.

Not only that, but your schooling years also left you on friendly terms with several of equally bright young magi. As part of the Lord El-Melloi’s classroom, you have powerful
contacts and allies all around the world, which you can always call from some favor (and that also includes your own teacher). In future worlds, you may also share similar amicable connections with similar young rising stars from that world.

Also, thanks to having been part of the Modern Magecraft department during your schooling years, you also seem to have a way more informed view of technology than most magi, as well as some talent in mixing magecraft and modern technology."
739,,400,The Final Roster,Records of Ragnarok Gauntlet (Humans),Lore,"You can not plan your next step, or look forward to the next fight if you don’t know who is it that is fighting. This Scroll may solve such a mystery for you from now on. Just by looking into this Scroll and applying it to a Battle or Tournament you may find out the names or everyone who is fighting. For an additional 200 CP you even gain a summary of their abilities. No matter the version the Scroll will always cover every combatant from every side."
740,,400,Bargaining Books,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Lore,"A collection of books bound in red leather emblazoned with a pentagram on the spine and a unique image on the cover. Comes in an ebony chest with iron decorations and lock. While the chest is always cold to the touch, the books are warm.

Each book contains forbidden knowledge, as well as a bargain to be made. By reading one of the books you will receive its blessing, as well as a mark on a part of your body you can easily see. The blessing conferred by the book will grant you a boon, at a cost. With a few seconds of reading you can determine the exact trade that you will be making without accepting the trade. These boons and costs can affect almost anything about you, and will generally have a stronger boon than its cost. The costs will always be relevant and commensurate to the boon offered to you. Over the next few days the mark will fade, as will knowledge contained within the books. The blessing, however, will only fade once the knowledge and mark have completely disappeared.

It takes around seven minutes to read one of the books completely. The mark you receive will match the image on the cover of the book. The books within the chest periodically change, with undesired books rotating out. You can only receive the benefits of three books before the newest blessing, knowledge, and mark overwrites the oldest.

Of the books there is one unique book, the only one that seems to have been written by another hand, emblazoned with a flame on the cover. This book will improve your elemental abilities, without any kind of downside."
741,,400,A Little Goes A Long Way ,Final Fantasy I,Lore,"Alright, so maybe you spread yourself a little bit thin with your wide variety of skills and powers. That’s no problem, you just know how to make the most of it! You now have an instinctive knowledge of your capabilities and limitations, and how to use your abilities to their best effect in a given situation. It won’t guarantee success, but it will guarantee efficiency in whatever you have available. It also helpfully reminds you of some simple solutions you may have forgotten about, such a spell that easily fixes your current predicament that you just hadn’t considered using. This only works if you have such skills or powers available in the first place, of course - and sometimes the most efficient solution isn’t necessarily the best one."
742,,400,Sorcerer’s Library,Disney’s Aladdin,Lore,"A sorcerer’s power means precious little without the knowledge to go with it. Which is why this is a tremendous advantage

You have a truly vast library to learn from, Jumper. It holds books, scrolls, clay tablets and whatever about a huge, immense variety of magic styles, thousands upon thousands of spells and rituals, some of them among the rarest in the world,and who knows what else.

Nor is magic the only thing covered. History, Philosophy, fiction, potions recipes and artefact designs... if a text has at least two copies in the world, odds are, there’s a third here. It’s enough to make you one of the absolute most skilled and knowledgeable sorcerers in the world, let’s just say.

It updates with an equivalent level of knowledge in all future worlds you go to."
743,,400,Gaze Upon The Primeval Current,Elden Ring - Liurnia of the Lakes,Lore,"Many who have gazed upon the Primeval Current have lost their sanity in return for the arcane insight they have gained. Such a thing would ordinarily happen to even the most educated of scholars, but there is something different about you. Once per Jump, when you gaze into the sky above and catch a glimpse of the Current and learn a potent spell on par with Comet Azur or Stars of Ruin."
744,,400,Magical Codex,The Road to El Dorado,Lore,"Well now, I’m sure Tzekel-Kan would be very interested as to how you got your hands on this. In his many religious pursuits and studies, along with that of his forebears, this codex has been compiled over countless generations. While it appears to simply be a collection of clay tiles, this codex contains powerful magic rituals capable of shifting the fate of El Dorado, all approved by the gods of course."
745,,400,Lost Library   ,Fate/Legends - Baba Yaga,Lore,"Ivan the Terrible had a surprising interest in literature and knowledge. Containing long gone philosophies, magic grimoires and other thought provoking articles, he would no doubt rage about the intellectuals of later times misplacing these archives, rendering them lost to time. But for an enthusiastic connoisseur of magic and art like yourself this library must have been made for right? You gain a perfect copy of the library as it was in its prime, holding knowledge from all over the world within and updating with matching grimoires, tomes, documentaries and any other sort of literary record for every Jump you visit. Furthermore it doubles as a workshop, nay a Temple, for those who wish to further hone their mystical arts."
746,,400,Magick Moste Evile,Wizarding World,Lore,"Magic holds many secrets and there are those who would say that there are some secrets that are so dark that they should never again see the light of day. You are not one of those fools. Instead, you have chosen to delve deep into the mystic arts, to tread into depths that so very few have borne witness to, let alone mastered them.

Written by Godelot, a former wielder of the Elder Wand, Magick Moste Evile is, as the name suggests, a tome detailing all the wonders and power that the Dark Arts can grant to someone like you. Such a treasure trove is already quite invaluable on its own, but the book has one more special property to it. Infused with some ethereal form of dark magic, the book has a way of taking in information from the world around it. And every so often, the book shall be rewritten with new spells, rituals and potions making their way inside for every new world you find yourself within."
747,,400,Conjuration Spellcrafts,Wizarding World,Lore,"Conjuration is an interesting branch of magic and a very useful one. After all, there are many uses to being able to conjure up objects from little more than thin air. But it is also one of the most complex and difficult branches of magic out there. And such difficulty only grows the more complex and the magical the things you choose to conjure become. Which is why you’ve taken steps to alleviate that difficulty with spellcrafts.

What are spellcrafts, you ask? It would be best to think of them as something similar to recipes. Combined with moonstone, a special type of crystallized stone that glows much like the full moon, spellcrafts can allow even a novice in the mystic arts to conjure truly wondrous things.

For now, you have spellcrafts that will allow you and other magical folks to conjure up simple but entirely non-magical things. If you wish to change this fact, the book you will receive alongside your new recipes shall help you along. This book details how you can create new spellcrafts. But be warned. Like conjuration itself, the creation of new spellcrafts can and will be an arduous task, especially if you wish to have any hope of recreating the greatest works of wizards and witches."
748,,400,Book of Potions,Wizarding World,Lore,"As a rule, young students tend not to see the appeal of potions. After all, when you can create fire with a wave of your wand and make objects float with but a word, something like potions can seem a bit... boring. But for those who can appreciate its subtle science, its exact art, potions can be the key to bottling fame, brewing glory, and far, far more.

Written by the famed Potioneer Zygmunt Budge, this book is perfect for anyone willing to delve into the great art of potions. And as most things are in this world, this book is far more than it appears to be. Through methods unknown, to assure his place in history, a part of Zygmunt Budge’s soul has been infused into this book. But you do not need to fear him. Zygmunt wants only to spread the glory of potions everywhere and you represent his best shot at it.

Not only is the book filled with recipes of just about every potion that was ever made public, you will have the guidance of Zygmunt himself who will gladly guide and instruct on the best ways to brew a proper potion. And in other worlds, if you ever come across an unfamiliar potion, the guidance of Zygmunt shall be enough to help you decipher.

Strangely, there seems to be pages haphazardly placed within the book. If you ask Zygmunt, you’ll find him to be unaware of it entirely. But it seems to be a cipher of some sort. To what you do not know. The only thing translated so far are the words All Potential written atop each and every single one of the strange pages."
749,,400,Wizard’s Field Guide,Wizarding World,Lore,"The witches and wizards in this world live and breathe magic. They carry with them years, even decades of experience in the mystic arts. If you’re going to be dropping into this wide and dangerous world, you’re going to want quite an ace up your sleeves, especially if you want to do more than just keep up with the folks around here. Enter the Wizard’s Field Guide. Devised by the Ministry of Magic, the Wizard’s Field Guide is the perfect tool for any witch or wizard seeking to grow their potential and witness them realized. Enchanted with all manners of spells and charms, the Field Guide first and foremost serves as a repository of all the knowledge you’ve ever accumulated. So long as you know it, you can find it in the book. 

Second of all, the book will, every so often, provide you with a list of tasks for it to do. By accomplishing these tasks, you will be gifted with a modest boost to your capabilities. It may not be the largest of training enhancements out there but with it, it should be enough for even a late student to catch up to their peers. And finally, it is time to move on to perhaps the most intriguing part of the book. By casting the Revelio, you may occasionally find pages flying in the sky or floating in front of certain places and things. Take these pages and you will find quite a bit of information about them. And for every page you collect, you’ll receive a small and miniscule boost to your magical capabilities."
750,,400,Yet Another Half-Blood Prince,Wizarding World,Lore,"The pure-bloods live and breathe magic but sometimes, it takes an outsider to see what else can be done. Or perhaps in your case, merely someone who has a foot in both worlds. Whether it be magical or mundane, you have a natural talent for discovering or implementing new shortcuts or innovations into them. You could discover shortcuts for making potions, better ways to cast spells, or, in terms of craftsmanship, realize the potential of materials gone unnoticed by many. 

With this, you could certainly make a fine name for yourself. And if you’re willing, perhaps the world can be made far better with the secrets and innovations you can discover. Don’t be stingy like the original Half-Blood Prince."
751,,400,Master of the Art,Wizarding World,Lore,"With age comes experience and with experience comes wisdom. You may or may not have noticed it before, but many of the foremost experts in their craft have been academics, seeking to expand young minds with the knowledge they possess. Just look at Hogwarts for example. Many of their teachers have been heralded as some of the finest witches and wizards of their day. And while you may not be a Hogwarts teacher, you are certainly one of the best in your chosen field.

You have five options to choose from. If you know your books well, you’ll recognize these options to be the five subjects most desired by those seeking to become Aurors. By choosing one of these subjects, you will possess not only a prodigious affinity for said subject but your knowledge and experience with the matter will be heavily enhanced. Even if you were nothing more than simple student at the start, your knowledge in the subject will now be so broad and expansive that none can deny your mastery.

So long as it is tangentially related to your chosen subject, you have, at bare minimum, an expert’s knowledge on it. This doesn’t even tie into your magical skills with said subject. If you chose potions for example, the efficiency of your potions is magnified to such an extent that even Severus Snape would be impressed. If you choose one of the more magical subjects, spells of that nature will be a magnitude greater, and you’ll be heaps more knowledgeable on how to use it in a duel.

752,,400,Like a Robot,Invincible,Lore,"Your mind is a masterpiece. You think faster than a normal human being; you can process in a second what would have before taken you a minute. You have the ability to split your mind in twain to concentrate on more than one thing at a time. In the beginning you would be limited to dividing your mind into 10 different streams of thought, each of which has the full processing power of your entire mind. Given time however, something on the scale of decades, you will be able to split your mind exponentially more, giving you enough subdivisions to run the world, control an army, and a police force of millions of separate robot suits all the while manipulating global politics. Given even more time, who knows how far you could take this."
753,,400,Book of Going Forth by Night        ,Wizard 101,Lore,"A tome of indeterminate page count and without any index a mortal mind can comprehend. Written on its pages are every creation that does not exist in the Spiral. Every dream and nightmare that Bartleby and Grandmother Raven did not see fit to include in their creation. Off-tune songs and twisted abominations, the things contained in this dark grimoire were never meant for the light of day. Think very carefully before allowing any of them into your shadow."
754,,400,Ravenwood Library,Wizard 101,Lore,"Largest general collection of magical knowledge in the entire Spiral, and now you have your own copy of it!

Does not come with a copy of Mr. Argleston."
755,,400,Unauthorized History,The Owl House,Lore,"Sometimes the widely published account doesn’t tell the full story. Sometimes those in power have an agenda to push. For historians who don’t trust authority, this book is for you! When closed and opened, this weathered tome fills itself with an account of the major historical events of your current setting. This won’t cover everything, and some subjects may be generalized, but everything this anonymous author has written is guaranteed to be the accurate truth. This is especially helpful in worlds where those keeping the records have something to hide."
756,,400,Bump In The Night,The Owl House,Lore,"I don’t care what the others say, you are a pretty good teacher! Whether you follow a more traditional style, Headmaster Bump, or prefer the unorthodox apprenticing style of the Owl Lady, you excel at imparting wisdom onto your pupils. Under your tutelage, your students will quickly grow from novices to experts, reaching their peak several times faster than they would otherwise. You can empathize with your students, understand their strengths and shortcomings, and adjust your lessons to best fit each mentee. Shape the minds of the next generation!"

760,,400,Crystalline Mind,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Lore,"It takes a keen mind of great intellect to master the arcane, even as primitive as it is in these days. A mind such as yours, honed and polished like a prized gemstone. Your intelligence has been greatly increased, memory perfect in its ability to retain and recall whatever you have experiences, as well as your problem solving skills being similarly boosted.

763,,400,No One Can Best Death ,Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,Lore,"Death has a number of skills that make him a terrifying adversary. His most dangerous skill however, is likely his sheer combat prowess. Death is possibly the most skilled fighter in this world due to his overwhelming experience and role in the world. Death is the only being to ever draw Puss’s blood in combat and even Puss himself acknowledged that he was unable to actually defeat Death. He believed that he could only hold him off temporarily at most. Well now it appears that there is indeed someone who can challenge Death at least in regards to skill. You are just as skilled as Death himself when it comes to various types of combat as well as methods of killing. Should you actually possess the physical abilities and weaponry to match Death then you could truly be his equal in any form of combat.

Even if you are bereft of the specific skills of your students path you find that just by being near your presence any and all students find their innate potential to be increased in magnitude to virtually limitless. New vestiges of power are awakened, new levels of strength are found deep within themselves, limits are broken repeatedly and that is when you haven't the skills to teach their specific power if you do you find that your ability to teach is limitless, lessons that would potentially take decades would at most take a month to completely master, increases in strength and muscle development that would naturally take months to reach would grow in days and those are just parlour tricks."

They devised a system of runes that convey the meanings of the Great One's words, all of which have differing and tangible effects when engraved upon someone's brain. You now possess a comprehensive guide to these eldritch runes, those one may find in Yharnam at least, as well as the process on how to divine more runes of your own."
770,,400,Recreation,Marvel Magic,Lore,"Knowledge is power. You know this simple truth. And for you, this is more true than for most. After all, magic, science, it all boils down to knowledge, does it not? All of it requires knowledge and all works are built upon knowledge. You can now gain this knowledge by studying creations, be they magical or mundane. Given time to study an enchantment, magical working, or even technology so advanced as to appear as magic, you can glean knowledge of the principles behind it. This allows you to not only directly recreate the work in question, but also to expand on the knowledge gained from it, potentially unfolding it into an entire field of science or a magical system. Of course, the more advanced or eldritch the knowledge, the more difficult it will be, but given enough time, you can succeed."
771,,400,The Brave and The Bodolf,Marvel Magic,Lore,"​For those who seek power beyond their kin, there are methods of achieving their goals. Some strive long and hard, pushing their forms to and beyond their limit. Some turn to study, mastering science or sorcery to bend the world to their wills. And others yet still find other methods, making pacts with dark beings or taking extreme risks to gain power now. You now know of one such method, though whether you choose to utilize it is your own choice to make. This method takes the form of a ritual in which the one seeking power speaks ancient words of power and drinks the still-burning blood of a dragon.

At first, they will notice no change. But then, when adrenaline flows, they undergo a transformation. Gaining several hundred pounds of muscle mass and several feet of height, their skin turns as black as night and their eyes glow red like burning coals. In this form, their strength and durability are massively increased, making them one of the strongest and toughest beings in this world. But they also lose themselves to rage, consumed as a berserker until eventually the rage subsides or they are knocked unconscious, returning them to their original form. they may be able to learn control over these transformations, but it will take time and great effort. If you wish, you may choose to have already undergone this ritual and gained this power."

774,,400,Heightened Proficiency,Thor: Love and Thunder,Lore,"Isn’t it weird how an emaciated, depressed beggar picked up the Necrosword and instantly went on a wild, god-slaying rampage that terrified even the inhabitants of Omnipotence City? How a cancer patient will soon pick up Mjolnir and suddenly be able to battle Olympians and monsters of myth? Well, this effect now applies to you. When you pick up a weapon, you become infused with its power. In addition to automatically gaining skill based on what you wield, you will gain power. A normal sword and shield of Asgard might only give you the physical attributes of an Asgardian, but if you pick up an ancient weapon god-slaying legend and a thousand battles, you will be empowered correspondingly in both raw power and technique."
775,,400,Combat Casting,Avengers-Thunderbolts,Lore,"While Occultist guaranteed the capability of learning magic in this world, this grants you more than the mere capacity to work the basics. You are a capable sorcerer, with a noticeable amount of personal magical energy and enough magical knowledge and skill to make you recognized as a sorcerer. This won’t make you the equal of the likes of Kulan Gath, at least not on its own, but you have enough skill to be considered a noteworthy witch or sorcerer, and have the potential to be a mage that could compete for the title of Sorcerer Supreme.

More than mere magical skill and talent, though, this grants you the ability to keep your magic powers working while under the pressure of combat. It is not grant works of arcane ritual that you excel at, instead you are an expert at the quick and dirty invocations and spells that can be thrown around in the few instants of combat. You don’t get tongue tied, or mess up your spells through a mispronunciation due to being rushed, and you find that your concentration is beyond excellent, helping you to focus on your magic in the face of all the turmoil and distractions of a battlefield. This will give you truly prodigious focus and concentration for other purposes, in case you need to do complex math while under fire, wield a will-controlled energy device, or just not think about pink elephants."

There are many schools of magic to specialise in, such as Alchemy, Memory Partition, Thought Acceleration, Transmutation, Jewelcraft, Curses etc. You could even learn the Emiya art of Time Manipulation, though you will have only the very basics, and will need years just to get to Kiritsugu's level, but you may possible go even further. You may not choose any True Magic with this perk. This perk can be bought multiple times."
780,,400,The Master of System ,Toaruverse,Lore,"Learning one magic  is too time consuming and mind numbing to learn another from scratch, even then some persist at doing it and in the end they are granted the greatest reward. With this you gain access to all magic systems in this world along with gaining knowledge of all their basics as well as skills at using it. Your true ability is to combine existing magic systems into one magic system  that you can access that has all advantages of the magic systems that you know and discarding their weaknesses and this process is automatic and also applies to your various energy pools that you have. Creating your own magic system is also possible though this process is not automatic and you would have to do it on your own."

This briefcase contains all the scrolls and books that allow you to research the angels and demons you might encounter, all while having a fair amount of obscure information on the realms of Paradiso and Inferno. This ranges from information on each side, the denizens of each realm, and even self-updates its information when you witness angels and demons do battle... a perfect item if you wish to use their strengths for your own."
783,,400,Antonio's Journal,Bayonetta,Lore,"You may want to keep track of things you have found in this world... look no further than this book, for merely thinking the knowledge and memories you have will make the journal record them automatically. The insights you record may even surprise yourself in their depth and complexity, allowing others to feel as if they were actually there witnessing the scene. Should you tear out a page, you can actually give them a vision of the event in question and even make your side of the story extremely convincing. The pages with its recorded knowledge regenerates after a day."
784,,400,High Walker Disciple,Trinity Wonder,Lore,"Emily was a powerful mage, known to be the disciple of the world famous High Walker. You are her sibling in disciplehood. Like her, you have studied the art of spellcasting under this wise wizard, and can be considered a high level mage. As such, you are able to cast a large array of spells. What you may lack in power compared to a Murim warrior, you can more than make up for in sheer versatility. From healing the near dead, to casting protective spells, to capturing and impaling dragons. You could do it all, with time and enough mana. Without any defensive spells active, you are likely something of a glass cannon."
785,,400,Intellectus,Dresden Files,Lore,"Yeah, this is what you think it is. Only, very sharply limited. You have total intellectus in a field, which can be approximately as broad as ‘best way to hurt people’. In that specific field, you know all that there is to know, and all that there can possibly be to know.

You can, of course, buy this multiple times to get more fields of knowledge and/or broaden your range. Additional purchases are not discounted. And yes, the knowledge this gives you is expanded with future jumps.

786,,400,"Blood, Mind, and Heart",The Dresden Files,Lore,"If you want to understand the Warden's zero tolerance policy on Warlocks, you don't need to look any further for an justification than Heinrich Kemmler. So much bad news they had to kill him at least twice to make it stick, his books on necromancy are still considered the definitive primer for anyone who really wants to get their head chopped off by the Wardens. You've now come by his three-volume primer, which contains more than enough real necromancy to make you into a seriously scary customer. It doesn't include his fourth book, which had a much more limited printing, but if you study real hard you might be able to join the race for it in a year or two."
787,,400,Taking Advantage ,Dark Souls 2,Lore,"“You’ve stepped foot in one of the most dangerous places in this world when you came to Drangleic and its surrounding lands. If you wish to survive long, you’re going to have to wizen up and properly prepare for the threat you’ll inevitably face. Whatever foe you encounter, whatever enemy you face, you can read them like an open book. For you it’s easy to pick up on the quirks, capabilities, limitations and, most importantly, weaknesses. Not just easy, but natural as breathing. As you continue to study your enemies, you gain a clearer picture on how you can fight them with the skills, abilities and means you have available. How to crush weak but tedious faceless threats, how to compensate for those greater in skill or power than yourself, it will all come in time.”"
788,,400,Memories of Shadows,Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,Lore,"Memories that contain the combat data of Lady Butterfly, the Owl, and the Young Wolf. Much like the Memory of Ashina, these are memetic recreations ranging from easiest to hardest that you can access in your sleep. These memories specifically train your versatility, adaptiveness, stealth, resourcefulness, and mastery of all your techniques and tools. These training memories will strips you to only your Body Mod, but you’re guaranteed to improve greatly after each session.

But, if that is not to your liking, you can also take this in the form of text scrolls of each character, detailing their philosophies, combat styles, and tactics."
789,,400,Memories of Ashina,Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,Lore,"While not a physical item, you instead carry memetic replications of the combat data of Genichiro, Isshin and... curiously enough, a one Lady Tomoe. When sleeping, you can lucidly dream of fighting any one of these three individuals ranging easiest to hardest to fight respectively in order to sharpen your swordsmanship skills as well as the lightning redirection technique. For the sake of training, you will be stripped to only your Body Mod, but you’re guaranteed to improve greatly after each session.

But, if that is not to your liking, you can also take this in the form of text scrolls of each character, detailing their philosophies, combat styles, and tactics."
790,,400,Shadow Style,Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,Lore,"There was a shinobi who once asked, “Why do we need to know swordsmanship if we’ll never fight anyone directly?” That shinobi is now dead. It was a violent one. While not as potent as the Ashina school of swordsmanship, the Shadow Style of the ninja serves them well whenever a ninja must directly confront a foe. It primarily focuses on unbalancing the enemy and breaking through their guard, usually by parrying and countering their attacks. Because of this, it could be seen as a primarily defensive combat style intended more for duels rather than war. You are now the master of such a style, able to ascertain the weaknesses of your foe’s stance and how to best exploit it by creating window of opportunities for “Deathblows”. Deathblows are the decisive single strike that put an end to your opponent."
791,,400,Pathless Prodigy ,Elden Ring,Lore,"Like Thops, it seems you have an underrated knack for cutting corners in magic. Your capacity to improve on spells and innovate on existing magical theory is phenomenal, such that if your talent was proven and displayed your work could earn you the tittle of conspectus-first and greatest of a whole new school of sorcery. With the resources and knowledge base of an academy, within a few days you could innovate on barrier magic to heights those in this world would deem impossible-even deflecting the magical projectiles of divine beings. It’s such a shame that far-fetched talents such as your breed scepticism in many."
792,,400,Champion’s Cub ,Elden Ring,Lore,"Some heroes divine the course of ages. Others find strength in those whose legends overshadow them. In your diligence and your faith, you find yourself capable of wringing out advancements and might beyond what you think are your limits. A noble knight dedicated to the general he idolises could master and recreate his gravity magics-even if that general is separated from him by the gulf of demigodhood. Even if it is a concept you devote yourself to rather than a person all skill, abilities and competencies you train yourself in advance in leaps and bounds beyond all but the greatest legends of this world to emulate it-and in a battle directly opposed to it, your prowess will drive you on where lesser men succumb to lack of focus or exhaustion.

This determination has greatly influenced your history in this world, enhancing your experiences and skillset. Like the Redmane Knight Ogha, you too may have studied gravity magic in emulation of Radahn’s fearsome prowess.

793,,400,Coveted Jewel,MtG - Ixalan,Lore,"A powerful artifact, created as a source of mana for the construction of Orazca. It acts as a small archive of a number of the spells and construction techniques used for the creation of crystalline mana amplifiers, and studying it is likely to get you a great amount of insight - what’s more, it in itself can amplify the mana ambient to a land to much greater than its usual output, though as a consequence, this disruption and surge of mana is easily felt by any magic users who are within the lands being tapped into for power - the jewel has often changed hands due to this, though with proper vigilance, one could easily hold onto it and wield its power with impunity - surely, nothing could challenge your might. "
794,,400,Folio Of Fancies,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Lore,"Story and song are vital to the spirit of the Realm and Eldraine - from tales of noble knights to campfire tales of grisly demise to the simple sonnets of young love, these shape the paths of those who walk the Realm, giving them guidance. However, stories are etched into the very soul of the world - animals performing fables, fae enacting courtly romance even far from castles. This book not only contains a set of the stories only Chulane could amass, but as you travel will ‘read’ the world’s heart and communicate its legends and tales to you in a flavorful manner, befitting a tome of Eldraine - allowing you to understand the magic and mystery of the world around you."
795,,400,Loremage,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Lore,"Knights of Vantress are highly desired for their skill with the Wild and more to the point, how to counteract the worst of its ill magics. Curse-breaking, returning transformed people and creatures to their former selves, and undoing fae contracts and oaths are your specialty, allowing you to ascertain uncomfortably permanent magical detriments and undo them...though it isn’t always simple or easy. Some are as complex and involved as members of certain family lines feeding one another peaches while an old lullaby is sung, or some are even potentially lethal cures.

Boosted: Loremage - > Arcanist of the Loch
Your special expertise in both the history of Eldraine and the nature of the Fae has allowed you to go beyond mere gathering of knowledge - discovering ancient spells to add to your repertoire, utilizing natural ambient magic of an area to enhance your own capabilities, and discovering artifacts of power hidden from the past are all within your realm of expertise, allowing you to transform your knowledge into powerful magical capability.

796,,400,Knight of Vantress,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Lore,"Vantress. The Court of Knowledge. Knights of Vantress are those who were able to scour the Realm and the Wilds for a piece of knowledge no other has brought to the wise and venerable Magic Mirror - demonstrating what Vantress considers true knowledge...not only having facts or trivium, but being capable of creating wisdom from seemingly disparate pieces of knowledge. As a knight of Vantress, you are well acquainted with Eldraine, it’s history, its secrets, and the various facets of its life both in the Wilds and the realm...and your capabilities of both researching and winning battles of wits are remarkable."
797,,400,Adapted To Change,MtG - Zendikar,Lore,"The academic in you will not allow any less than total understanding of any magic that you use; understanding of the mechanics and components being as important to you as the ability to cast the spells. This, along with some mental gymnastics, has given you the rather useful skill to invert said magics in a similar manner to the creation of Roilmages by Noyan Dar. This process involves identifying the mechanics by which a spell or system works, and then doing the opposite: ritually breaking something would need to be replaced with repair, lighting a candle with extinguishing one etc. The new inverted spell will do the opposite of the base spell. Healing spells would cause rot or disease, a fire spell would rapidly cool the area, and a ritual to summon a demon could be inverted to banish it. Do note that constructive purposes are generally harder to achieve than destructive ones, and will take far greater investment to achieve. "
798,,400,Wizard Councillor ,MtG - Homelands,Lore,"The Wizard's Council is an advisory board made of the eight most powerful mages on the Island, usually the teachers and residing masters. The ninth member of the council is the Wizard Savant, who maintains absolute final say on any matter, though they are obligated to listen to any argument from the Council and may be challenged for the title.

While you’d have to challenge the current Savant yourself if you want that position, you certainly have the skills of a proper councilmember. You are a master of manipulation and subterfuge, along with well-practised skill in sorcery, wizardry, research, astronomy, alchemy, and the other magical arts. Your magic allows you control over the wind and the waters of the Homelands, and lets you study the aether beyond the bounds of the world.

If bought along with the Artificer perk, you may combine your skills in magic and artifice to call forth mana and shape it into temporary artifacts. Fully composed of mana, these artifacts only exist for as long as you keep the magic up, but can be invaluable in battle and when you otherwise don’t have the time or inclination to create a permanent artifact."
799,,400,The So Called “Clan Umezawa”,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Lore,"Deep in the undercity of Towashi and the spires of Otawara there are rumors. People who whisper about entire groups of Ninja that may or may not frequent a specific place, not just the ones and twos that may or may not be on contract to a greedy crime boss or a less than moral researcher. Though they do not know it, they are right. You are now the inheritor to a small clan of ninja, probably no more than a hundred people all together, and only a fraction of those being fully trained as compared to mildly competent servants. The real treasure is the estate itself, a well hidden manor home that can comfortably house the clans current numbers several times over, and the generations of scrolls and manuals detailing not only ninjutsu techniques, but the most efficient ways to teach them… and the most efficient ways to gain or force the loyalty of those you might consider teaching."
800,,400,The Way Of The Knife,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Lore,"Allow me to tell you a truth of the universe - there is never just one ninja, and if you think you have found them all you probably haven’t. Such is their signature ability of ninjutsu, a series of smaller techniques that they use to disguise themselves, hide all trace of their passage, reduce their own presence until even Kyodai themself would have trouble sending them, and otherwise be a pain in the ass to anyone who wants to find them. It’s ironic then, that the Ninja’s greatest power lies in breaking this concealment, because when properly added together these spells can be used as the building blocks to others - perhaps the broken forms and “waste” mana from your disguise will allow you to temporarily steal some life energy from your foes, or if you were skilled enough you could even summon a duplicate of one of your allies for a brief moment. "
801,,400,Yet Another Holding Action,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Lore,"The world is dividing itself and drawing hard lines in the sand, the Emperor is missing and has been for over a decade, and unknown forces lurk in the background just waiting to take a bite out of Kamigawa. And yet, for all that the plane is slowly falling apart at the seams, well, it’s falling apart slowly rather than quickly. You have everything a ruler would want in a regent, an understanding of politics that surpassed dozens of other advisors, the skill and talent to forge and force alliances into being and then hold them accountable for their breaks of faith, and even a level of skill at magic born from dabbling in various arts- nothing outright dangerous, but you can make yourself very irritating in a fight if you need to. The schools of magic you likely have access to are many and varied, but something like enhancing the Samurai likely to be guarding you, copying the spells of empowerment they would use on themselves, or simply being able to heal both yourself and them would all be excellent techniques to learn, though you are not limited to just those things."
802,,400,Gauging Pressure,MtG - Kamigawa,Lore,"Patience like the Clam Sea that eroded the mighty cliffs is something you embody. You could take five to ten years observing the same person to learn their habits and never once feel the grating sensation of impatience. In addition to this immunity to the mundane foe known as boredom you can, with repeated battles, learn more and more about a foe simply by being in close contact, the foe need not think of you as an enemy for this to work on them."
803,,400,Geralf’s notes,MtG - Innistrad,Lore,"Everything from the most basic of Skaabs to Mindcrushers, and even Grimgrin himself. Detailed notes on the creation of each and every one of Geralf’s creations."
804,,400,Arcane Encyclopedia,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Lore,"This is a curious book, it appears to contain ancient knowledge. It contains a treasure trove of information, strangely enough related to the schools of magic that you specialize in. From the appearance of it, the books seems to come from a time before the Mending and has been penned by a millenia old Planeswalker who practiced magic similar to your own. This could greatly accelerate your learning from what is penned within. Remember, knowledge itself is neither good nor evil. Just as the wrong book in the wrong hands could doom all existence, the same book in the right hands could save it."
805,,400,Secret Hunter ,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Lore,"The Planes contain secrets harder to uncover than those found in the deepest ocean. There are many such things hidden away in myth, rumors, legends. Artifacts of great power, long lost spells, bits of history lost to knowing minds possibly forever. This is unacceptable. You are a seeker of such secrets, and an experienced one at that. You can discern truth from legend, find out what rumors hold merit or are mere folktale when you hear or read them. Once you know about such gaps in knowledge, you can be sure you won’t lose the lead you have once you start pursuing it. You may not be up to the trials involved with finding such secrets but you will never be at a loss for what to do next. However, you are not merely good at finding, you are also lucky when it comes to stumbling into rumors and legends of interest to you."
806,,400,Great Teacher ,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Lore,"Knowledge that you hoard for yourself is valuable, knowledge that you share is priceless. You possess all the qualities of a great teacher. It is difficult to understand the level of complexity a student can handle at any one time. You are skilled at conveying information to others as well, it would be easy to explain advanced intellectual concepts through charades without saying a word. It would not be difficult to write a book concisely summarising your ideas and publish such a thesis for others to read, after which it leads talented students to you. With these skills it would be easy to start a magical college of your own, from which you can gather power and allies as scholars and wizards bring knowledge to you. This is especially true to those you teach directly under a direct apprenticeship as such individuals would learn three times as fast from you and will even come to respect you greatly despite any eccentricities."
807,,400,Research Notes,Warbreaker,Lore,"Absolutely everything ever written about Awakening in generations of exploration and research, from Vo’s widow, to the Five Scholars to more contemporary works. Scathing footnotes applied to old misconceptions. In future Jumps, this updates to include the local magic system, if one exists."
808,,400,Experience,Warbreaker,Lore,"A Returned is ageless, and you didn’t Return recently. You have a century of lived experience waiting when you insert. Choose a craft, skill or art and you will receive memories of years or decades, however long you chose, dedicating yourself to it’s practice. This may be applied to multiple fields, of course. In each future Jump, you receive the same boon when inserting."
809,,400,Well of Memory ,Warbreaker,Lore,"It turns out, you remember everything. Your memory and consciousness cannot be altered or tampered with by any means. A perfect memory just happens to come as a side benefit."
810,,400,Creativity,Warbreaker,Lore,"If you stick your Breath in your belt, or shoe, only a couple of the highest heightened Awakeners could know. If you give someone a lot of Breath, they’ll jerk about and go into a trance for a few moments, perfect time for stabbing, Lifeless animals make fine scouts or messengers. These and other tricks seem really obvious in hindsight, you’re just that good at devising creative, lateral thinking uses and tricks for any powers or skills you may have."
811,,400,Will Of The Jumper,Skulduggery Pleasant,Lore,"This is a version of a very powerful spell created by three Elders of the Irish Sanctuary to protect the Book of Names. This spell prevented anyone from approaching the book by a very simple means; the closer you were to getting it, the less you wanted it. Ordinarily, this spell was tied to the lives of the Elders, but this version has been retrofitted to get the same power when only bound to your own life. By placing this spell over an item, you ensure no one will be able to take it as the closer they get to it, the less they desire it. Not ‘closer’ as in physically closer, but ‘closer’ as in ‘closer to obtaining it’. This protection can be placed over more than one item, but the more items you place it on, the less effective it becomes. You can also choose to bind the protection to the life of another person. Unlike the Elders’ version, you are immune to its effects, so you will always be able to access the items you have protected."
812,,400,Library of Sorrow,Skulduggery Pleasant,Lore,"China Sorrows is many things, but above all else, she is a collector of all things magical. Nowhere is this more apparent than in her library, a home to many lost and obscure magical tomes. Now, it seems you have come to possess a library of your own, equally massive and chock full of rare, obscure, and lost magical knowledge. In future Jumps, this library will update and expand to encompass the vast majority of that world’s historical magical knowledge, barring tomes that are one-of-a-kind. You’ll need to get those yourself."
813,,400,Prodigy ,Skulduggery Pleasant,Lore,"Damn, what are you? With this perk, you have become a prodigy, able to learn various martial arts and other mundane skills terrifyingly quickly. You are now equal to Valkyrie Cain in terms of your learning rate, able to go from a total novice to being able to beat a room of fairly trained full grown men in less than a year. This applies to all skills that don’t have to do with magic (Consider this a mundane version of Second Coming in terms of growth rate boosts)."
814,,400,Second Coming,Skulduggery Pleasant,Lore,"Lord Vile to Necromancy, Mevolent to Elemental magic, China Sorrows to Signum Linguistics, you to your discipline. Every once in a while there comes a person that changes everything about what others thought about that discipline either through their great control or the abilities they manifested that no one knew existed. Now, you are one of them, whether your specialty is Elemental, Necromancy, Signum Linguistics, or one of the many other types of magic offered here. What this does is increase the speed at which you learn your discipline. What would normally take a sorcerer decades to create takes you mere months. Where one one sorcerer would take eleven months of constant torture in a barren dimension in order to advance and create new and improved moves, you can achieve similar results without trying in a year or five months with actual effort. (If you manage to get access to more than one magic this applies to them as well and you don’t have to buy it again)."
815,,400,Book of The Pagan Heroes,Campione,Lore,"One of the few Grimoires written by human hands and that possess written spells and magic inside. It contains spells strong enough to harm Gods and Campiones, although mastering them may take a while. It was based in the myths and records of several god-slaying beings in pagan religions."
816,,400,Slipping Chains,Campione,Lore,"The greatest power in this world have conditions to their use. Anything from standing in sunlight to being at death’s door to fight back depending on which Authority you hold. Often times just setting things up to begin fighting could leave you dead on the ground if everything doesn’t line up just right. In your case the chains that bind have been coated in grease. Sunlight could be replaced by electronic lights in great enough quantity, or perhaps a ludicrously sized fireball. Defending a fair maiden could become defending anyone, and one the verge of death could become grievously wounded. The core idea remains the same, but achieving them becomes far easier. You’ll find this slippery nature applying to any conditional otherworldly abilities you come to possess, should you have them at all."
817,,400,Records And Matrixes,Fate/Extra CCC,Lore,"One of the most fundamental operations of the Moon Cell is the processing and manifestation of data. However it is that you did it, you have become able to replicate this function. To begin with, your memory is perfect and endless, very useful for recording everything that you witness, although you should be wary of cognitohazards or other pieces of knowledge that are inherently dangerous to process. By focusing on something that you can remember, you can also manifest the information stored within your mind outside of you, to conjure objects, tools, infrastructure, and perhaps even intelligent beings.

To actually manifest them, you'll have to invest an appropriate amount of energy plus an additional tenth of it. For example, for truly powerful Servants, an equally and slightly greater amount of energy will be required. That said, you can choose to use less energy than you would normally require, if you don't mind not manifesting whatever it is you're conjuring in its full glory. Gathering information to build up a library of records to manifest is completely on you."
818,,400,Four Legged Scholar,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Lore,"Few monsters are bound to a human lifespan. Most are outright immortal, if not incredibly long lived, and that can often be seen in the sheer breadth of experience most intelligent non-humans possess. But even among immortal beings, you’re a stand out example of a life well learned. You hold very
broad knowledge of almost all things in this world. Different magic styles, countless combat
techniques, medicine, science, the use of many different weapons and implements, almost any skill
that can be named without being unique to an individual or being a special power instead of a skill
anyone can learn, as well as having to exist in the time that you take this. While many might consider
you a master of these things, you cannot compare to true specialists. While you skill in varying forms
of magic is broad and deep, legendary witches like Medea would greatly overshadow you. Your
talent for combat with fists and weapons is that of a master to most but only that of a journeyman
compared to Achilles or Heracles. If an ordinary master were a ten and these legendary heroes were
a hundred with their specialties, you’d be something like a fifty.
 
However, your true blessing lies in your ability to pass on that which you know. You are a teacher of
near-supernatural excellence and should you allow others to learn from you, will be the one to
create numerous legendary heroes, very much the equal of Chiron himself in this field. Bringing
others to your level of skill, even training their abilities and bodies beyond normal human limits, is
quite easy even within just a few years, but you also find yourself able to awaken potential in your
students that lets them grow beyond what you can teach with ease, especially once they begin to
adventure on their own. Your students, even the rowdiest, find themselves easily falling into the
perfect mindset to learn from you and can even retain any natural anger they might have while you
teach the. "
819,,400,Spartan Bred,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Lore,"Sparta breeds them strong, they do. Those bronzed bodies, built like they were cast by the gods in
the greatest refineries. By natural birth or a similar upbringing, you’ve got a body and the physical
potential to match the legendary Spartans. You can make cities quake with a stomp and sprint across
the country in a few minutes, enough to match even moderately powerful demigods and
phantasmal beasts. You don’t yet have the comprehensive and intense training of the Spartans
themselves but in their place, you find you have incredible potential for learning new combat or war
related skills and improving those skills at a massive rate. Even if you started as a child, you’d quickly
surpass men with decades of experience after a few months of learning. However, while your
starting potential is great and will only grow, you only show your true power when at a disadvantage. The worse off you are in battle, the more you’ll find your powers, raw statistics and skills improve for
both you and close allies you have nearby. Facing some notably stronger than yourself might see a decent boost to your own strength but taking just three hundred of your best friends to block the
passage of one of the largest and most powerful nation’s greatest army, vastly outnumbering and
overpowering yourselves? They’ll be talking about the feats you accomplish two thousand years on
from that day."
820,,400,Wisdom of the Haunting Ground,Fate/Legends - Land of Shadows,Lore,"These long, long centuries have not been idly spent by you. You devoted yourself in your life until
now to mastering all that you could get your hands on. And master you did, for you possess
seemingly supernatural ability in hundreds, if not thousands of different skills and fields of
knowledge. So long as the skill or knowledge existed before the first or second century AD, you have
already learned it to the point that you can pull off supernatural feats with it. Your skills with horse
riding, for example, are such that horses are driven to move at speeds far greater than physically
possible and become able to ride up walls as if they were flat land. You could create poultices from
plants that heal with magical efficiency. However, while your wisdom is vast, it is limited in the fields
of combat or magic. Perhaps you neglected those areas of study in your long life, for you have no
more skill in things relating to those fields than any other person. "
821,,400,Angel of the Battlefield,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Lore,"Just being a leading star in the medical field isn’t enough to change the world, not when you have to
do it from the front of a battlefield too. While you are most certainly at the front of the pack in
terms of medical skill and knowledge of your time, at least as far as Nightingale’s time, your talents
are more notable than that. A superb instinct for all things relating to medicine, it allows you to
easily master techniques and technology even centuries advanced from your time if you can gain
access. Even without access, advancing medical knowledge comes smoothly and quickly to you, accelerating the speed of new discoveries greatly.

Medicine becomes widely applicable in your hands, in some ways superhumanly so. Your knowledge
makes you a lethal combatant even with limited combat training, innately understanding the most
efficient ways to move your own body, the most vulnerable vital points to strike and how to greatly
reduce damage with the right block. Your treatments become applicable on all targets, even against
what seems like common sense, as you can stitch up the wounds of spiritual beings with no more
difficulty than a flesh and blood human. Even non-humans take only a small time to study before you
can effectively understand and begin treatment. While this talent does not directly boost the power
of healing magecraft, your knowledge and the skill it lets you use those spells with make you a far
superior wielder to most."
822,,400,Sovereign,Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Lore,"Every thing under the sun is destined to come under your rule, in your mind, and thus there is no
possession that should be excluded from your use. You have a great blessing in regards to items of
power where their use comes to you as naturally as if you were moving your own fingers. Any
magical item works with you as you hold it. You realise how to use these items as you hold them, their functions and attributes becoming clear in your mind. The arcane objects do not harm you as
you hold them and even bow before your right to use them, allowing you to bypass any restrictions
on their use.

As you hold them, you will see that you quickly master their use as well, taking only a few days
before you can use them as an expert would, in almost any situation. This skill can often be applied
outside of the magical tool as well, as mastering the use of a magical blade in combat could surely
apply at least somewhat to an ordinary sword as well."
823,,400,Body Hopper,Fate/Legends - Vive la France,Lore,"You didn’t achieve immortality because of being a lucky fool, you earned it the hard way. Yours is a
genius that is rarely matched, a mind like that of the intellectual giants of history, and the extensive
studies you’ve done on many fields of both science as well as many more mundane non-combat
skills, as well as a more mundane approach to magic, are the proof. While you are not a caster of
spells, you have an extensive knowledge of many arcane subjects such as demons, the metaphysics
of the world and the textures that make it up, even about the human soul. Combined with your
natural genius, you even found a way to extend your own life. By projecting your very soul into the form of another person, you can initiate a contest of wills, magical power and spiritual skill that if won, allows you to take over their body. Empty forms, such
as homunculi without spirits, can be taken over freely. Failure would either rebound your spirit into
your last body or leave you without a body, as something like a ghost. Not a pleasant long term
situation. You retain your perks and powers as normal, though non-perk traits like implanted organs
will not transfer, as common sense goes. Unlike many other forms, your soul will not degrade over
time due to this practice or age, as well as retaining your memories in perfect condition despite your
age. In fact, you may even choose to have been doing this for a long time till now, giving you several
decades to several centuries of experience. Perhaps an easy explanation for the wide knowledge
base you have here. You may choose to continue this longer history and wide skill set in future
worlds."
824,,400,Unleashed Will,Fate/Legends - Vive la France,Lore,"Yours is a mind that cannot ever be contained and a body that can never be imprisoned. A spirit that
can never be chained and a heart that will always be free. You possess a will like a wall of diamond, unbreakable and ever-lasting. Your mind, while not necessarily more educated than before, races
ahead and beyond almost any other. You possess Super High Speed Thought naturally, letting you
think at hundreds of times the pace of any other being when desired to make plans on the fly even
when in a fight. This thought can, through significant stress on your body, even briefly cross over to
the actions of your body, letting you move so fast that it briefly appears that time is stopped for you. The desire for freedom has a final benefit, a heart’s desire that allows you a conceptual advantage in
escaping any prison or maze. Even one made from warped space and bent time is not inescapable to
you, not with enough time, as your advantages render any impossible escape into something
possible."
825,,400,Atlas of Dreams ,Cultist Simulator,Lore,"An occult journal that maps the dark side of the world. This atlas can guide anyone to anywhere, even places outside of reality, provided the user has a destination in mind. Do remember that some places are harder to reach than others."
826,,400,Soultaker ,DC Occult,Lore,"A well crafted sword, enchanted with potent dark magic. As implied by the name, it devours the souls of those killed by it or any spiritual beings slain and allows the wielder access to their knowledge and skills, though not any supernatural ability you would not have already been able to access. Very useful for the lazy and the lacking in scruples.

If any soul is freed from the blade outside of the jump it was trapped in, it will immediately return to the jump in which it was trapped.
"
827,,400,Prodigal Sorcerer ,Justice League Dark,Lore,"Learning spells has never been difficult for you. With nothing more than bare-bones instructions, you can easily piece together what you need to cast a difficult spell. Hell, even just seeing a spell once would be enough for you to recreate it, or come pretty damn close. But your talent extends farther than just learning old spells. You have a natural ability to create new pieces of magic of surprising complexity and potency – the types of rituals spells you’d expect to find in ancient tomes and millennia-old scrolls. There’s a very good chance you could go down in magical history as a genius of the Art.
"
828,,400,Arcane Expertise ,Justice League Dark,Lore,"You’re very knowledgeable all sorts of things on the spooky side. Off the top of your, you can name two dozen types of spirits, rattle off twice a dozen regional tales of folklore, and identify the minute differences in two magical circle traps that could mean the difference in escaping them and ending up with your soul strewn in the aether. In fact, you’re one of the world’s foremost experts on the arcane. Any number of people or organizations would be willing to pay handsomely to have you on payroll.

And that’s not all. This also means it is much easier for you to learn more information of a similar vein, whether in this world or any other, and any intuitive leaps made while studying magic or the like tends to be far more accurate than it otherwise would be.
"
829,,400,Flawless Recall ,Libriomancer,Lore,"You have a flawless memory, able to recall instances that happened years ago as if only a few seconds had passed. While this photographic function will not let you “know” something automatically, you may go back and review your memories as though they were photographs or videos with perfect recollection of how things really happened. You are also gifted with superb mental organization, never getting lost in your memories and always able to summon up the correct thought or series of thoughts without fear of your mind wandering.
"
830,,400,Spell recollection ,Libriomancer,Lore,"Somehow you have expanded the bounds of magic beyond what should be possible. You are able to perfectly memorize a spell to such a degree that you can reproduce it simply by taking the same actions as the initial caster. While this effect is significantly decreased in power from the original, you may recreate literally any spell you see cast before you with only moderate effort. As this is a reproduction of the prior spell, you do not need to understand the principles behind it, only reproduce it. You will still need to learn the principles behind if you wish to truly cast it or bring it up to its original efficaciousness. Furthermore, you may still purchase and utilize this ability even if you chose the inhuman background."
831,,400,Grimoire Azul ,Drakengard and Nier,Lore,"Weiss, Noir and Rubrum weren’t the only Grimoires made during Project Gestalt. Many young people were experimented on and turned into talking, magical books. Azul is one of them. Colored blue in case you couldn’t tell, this Grimoire has similar abilities to the others, being a deep reservoir of knowledge and capable of powerful spells. Capable, in the sense that when you first obtain her, Azul will only know Dark Blast. More spells will need to be obtained via finding Sealed Verses or recording spells you discover in other jumps. And if you’re wondering why Azul costs double what the Pod perk does when all that is basically the same, the answer is, of course, power. While the standard uses of Sealed Verses are similar to pod programs, Weiss was capable of creating super-powered versions of the spells, such as giant-sized Dark Hands the size of buildings. And apparently he was only using a portion of the power of the Sealed Verses. Any spell recorded in Azul will be able to be enhanced far beyond its normal limits, creating truly ridiculous spells. 

Personality wise, Grimoire Azul starts off very reticent, almost robotic. Due to her trauma at getting turned into a Grimoire and sealed away for a thousand years, her personality has been repressed somewhat. But as you travel with her and grow closer, you’ll find her old personality re-emerging. Who knows what sort of person you might discover underneath that trauma. A refined, humble lady? A cheerful genki girl? A over-protective yandere? Just know that she won’t be anything like one of the three other Grimoires, so she won’t be an prideful gentlewoman, arrogant egomaniac or, uh, just plain crazy. 
"
832,,400,Fast Learner ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Lore,"You’re a quick learner and an even quicker improviser. Lose the majority of your magical power and not be able to blast through with sheer power and you could immediately come up with a spell that focuses your magical blast into a blade with high cutting power and low cost. Gain the ability of flight and adjust to three-dimensional combat like you were born to it.
"
833,,400,Fast Learner ,Dog Days,Lore,"You learn skills incredibly quickly through practical work. It may take you a week to learn the theory behind a spell, but once you start practicing it you’ll have it down within hours. This can apply even to things you might not expect. Some field work in archeology may really drill in your head the best way to locate ancient sites and treasures.
"
834,,400,Exposition Truck ,Generic MG,Lore,"Bringing a magical girl up to speed on the monsters she’s about to fight is tricky. Fortunately, you can condense infodumps by a factor of a dozen, somehow conveying all that information into a mind much faster than the brain can handle.

In addition, you know pretty much all of your faction’s history. Even the bits lost to time. Even the incidents buried under countless lies. Even the facts that couldn’t have written down because the person who knew them was killed right after they learned them. All included. Make sure your magical girl is never caught off guard.

This doesn’t give you enough detailed knowledge about all of your enemies’ abilities unless your faction was able to figure them all out. It doesn’t give details of lost technology or lost magics either. It would let you know that such things are possible, though it would be up to you to figure them out again.
"
835,,400,Secrets of the Land* ,Peter Pan,Lore,"Your tribe has been on the island longer than anyone can remember, but unlike the other groups, the tribal records have kept your history alive. As a result, you know countless secrets about the island, from the physiology of different plants to hidden caves and forgotten shrines. Furthermore, trees have ears, and by simply examining minute clues in the wild you can learn the secrets of anyone who has passed through the area. By simply putting your ear to the ground, you can hear a dry leaf crinkle and immediately identify who stepped on it. After the jump, you gain an intimate knowledge of the history of natural environments, and also any secrets unwittingly revealed by people who have recently traveled through the habitat.
"
836,,400,Fascinated With the World Where the Dream Continues ,Ib,Lore,"You have traveled through dark and beautiful realms, and even questioned the nature of your home and reality, but the experiences have only sharpened your mind and imagination. You have found a balance between logic and fantasy that allows you to draw upon both of them without any conflict. You are an expert at solving puzzles and will not allow illusions to lead you astray, but neither will you reject the validity of dreams and wonder, and you can hold onto your sense of magic in a world of reality and rationality. This is an outlook that few people manage to fully attain, not even artists. You will never lose heart in your journey and will not give up, coming back and rewriting fate again and again until you push forward to the true, happiest ending for everyone."
837,,400,Greater Grimoire ,Danmachi,Lore,"Among the greatest treasures for an Adventurer is this, a book that will teach you a single spell and increase your spell slot by one. Each spell gained tends to depend entirely on the person that read the grimoire as it depends on their needs, desires, and other factors the spell one person gets may be different from the spell another person gets. The grimoire recharges every month allowing the same person to learn up to three spells and increase their spell slot up to six."
838,,400,Liber Bubonicus ,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Lore,"A book of foul things, the book is part holy tome of Nurgle, part treatise on the creation of plague, part record of all the diseases that have swept the world and part grimoire of foul and pestilent magics, even the books presence will cause outbreaks of terrible diseases.
"
839,,400,Magic Arms & Armor ,Warhammer Fantasy: Orcs & Goblins,Lore,"You have come upon a tome filled with the teachings of how to craft the more common magical weapons and armor that can be bought. While these teachings will not teach you how to make weapons that are unique to a single person in this world, if there have been more than two of that weapon this information would be able help you craft something like it. Too bad that the resources and time needed for such delicate workings are beyond most Greenskins.
"
840,,400,Key of Secrets ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Lore,"The Key of Secrets is one of the most powerful symbols of your order, as the vast knowledge any Wizard must acquire is the key to power. With that said, surely power could be a key to further knowledge? Your fire magics now have a peculiarity to them - no matter how aggressively you assault a bastion or person with flame, you will never accidentally destroy any records or information contained within the structure or on the person’s person. The Bright Order is impulsive, but it is not wasteful.
"
841,,400,Conspiracy Sniffer​ ,Mage: The Awakening(1st Edition),Lore,"There are many secrets in this world, and many of them need to be gathered up and buried in deep dark hole. You have been trained in a series of mystical techniques and spells that allow you to find those secrets, embarking on supernatural investigation trails. So long as you know what the information in question is, you may mystically detect whether or not a person knows the information. Summarily, you can trace the memetic spread of this information from them, who they told it to, and who told them. With enough time and appropriately placed spells, you may trace an entire web of conspiracy...and when the time comes, may begin splitting its threads.
"
842,,400,High Speech ​,Mage: The Awakening(1st Edition),Lore,"Broken fragments and twisted syllables are all that remain of the once mighty Atlantean language. So broken is this system that the words can no longer be transcribed, only passed along orally from one mage to the next. Sleepers are unable to comprehend it at all, instead perceiving it as indistinct noise. All mages of the pentacle orders are trained in high speech to some degree, as its sympathetic connection to the supernal realms allows them to empower their spells by speaking the correct corresponding words. You however have taken this to another level, as all of your spells significantly increase in power, effectiveness and duration whenever you incorporate Atlantean into the casting. Be warned as while this may increase your spells power, if there are sleepers around it has an increased chance of also invoking disbelief. Post-­jump this high­-speech will still invoke disbelief in those not of a supernatural persuasion.
"
843,,400,Personal Grimoire​ ,Mage: The Awakening(1st Edition),Lore,"This grimoire contains the sum total of your mystical knowledge. Every spell, every rote, every shortcut, technique and secret you have uncovered in regards to magic rests within this grimoire. As you continue to grow in the mystic arts, so will the grimoire, filling in its pages with more information, or perhaps even splitting off into a second volume. With a great deal of time and effort it could be copied and mystically circulated for a significant profit, perhaps even enhancing Awakened society as a whole. Or, you could simply use it as a black­box should your mind be tampered with, forcing you to lose any mystical knowledge you had acquired. For now however, it remains well warded and in a safe but accessible place of your choosing.
"
844,,400,Heroic Aptitude ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords,Lore,"When Link's adventure started, he was like an egg, waiting to hatch into a proper hero. It was through the tests of courage put forth by the Great Fairies that he was able to become a true hero, and through his storming of the Palace of Winds, defeating of Vaati, and rescuing of Zelda that he became the greatest of heroes. Like him, you also grow from adversity and challenge. Even if you were but a simple lad, a young boy who only barely counted as a knight, you could find yourself growing far more skilled and deadly as you conquer the challenges set before you. From simple skill with the sword to the complicated use of various items such as bombs and boomerangs, from clever use of the mind to conquer puzzles and leading a team to having what most might consider a gifted skill with a mystical weapon, you shall find yourself rapidly advancing in all these and more as you face challenges that test you to your limits. The harder the challenge, the greater the gain, and should you find yourself on a quest such as Link's, facing tests of courage in dangerous locations against hordes of monsters to prepare you to rescue your love from a mighty and ancient demon lord...you could go from unknown zero to legendary hero in no time at all. All you have to do is survive the path ahead.
"
845,,400,Inheritor of the Arts ,Legend of Zelda: The Adventure of Link,Lore,"Perhaps it is an open mind, or a simple necessity of living on the move for so long, but you are an extremely good student. You can easily pick up and learn a new skill, combat technique, or spell within an hour or so of training by a master, and make the lessons stick - though this has to be a technique by technique basis, not learning an entire style in a single hour with just this. Another example of your great potential, is it not?
"
846,,400,Personal Library ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Lore,"Every magic user, sorcerer or mage, needs somewhere to write down his spells. Here’s yours. A modest library detailing your form of magic, with extra, blank books for you to record new findings in. Can be added onto your warehouse or imported into each new setting post-jump.
"
847,,400,Black Books ,The Elder Scrolls,Lore,"Created by Hermeous Mora, Daedric Prince of Knowledge, these seven books are tomes of esoteric knowledge with a special property to them. By reading them, you will be taken to an island within the realm of Apocrypha, and subjected to a test. What this test is differs from book to book, ranging from complex puzzles to a gauntlet of combat. If you die in the books, you will be returned to the real world unharmed, but should you succeed you will be granted powerful abilities."
848,,400,Butterscotch-Cinnamon Pie Recipe ,Undertale,Lore,"This is a recipe for home-made pie- Quite possibly the best pie ever made. If made using monster cooking techniques, a single slice of this is delicious enough to fully restore the consumer's vitality. However, the ingredients are rather specific, and to bring out its true potential, the pie must be home- cooked with fire magic. But the results... You simply can't argue."
849,,400,But teach a man to fish... ,World Seed,Lore,"Skills in the system are created through the memory and repetition of using them (or in the case of Quest rewards, simply put into your mind). What this means is that having a skill is not always a permanent thing. Say you learn Archery at the start of your journey, but soon switch to using more advanced plasma weapons, and don’t really need or use bows anymore. Because you never studied archery enough to develop habits and didn't keep practicing, your skill proficiency would slowly drop over time, until eventually you might lose the skill entirely.

Of course, there is nothing stopping you from simply learning archery again, but it’d still be a hassle. Thankfully, it’s one you’ll never have to deal with. Any skills you learn and any memories you make will stay with you forever. Never forget how to use that obscure spell you really need right now ever again! You could sit on your ass for a few decades, but when an enemy shows up you need to defeat, you’d still be the combat monster you’ve been in your prime. Or rather, you ARE in your prime. After all, for you it never ended in the first place. This also means that no matter how many memories you might accumulate, you’ll be able to recall any of them in an instant."
850,,400,This is What We’d Call Two-Timing ,Ajin,Lore,"“It’s Study Time?” The way you describe things can be...odd, but that doesn’t mean you are any less valid in teaching other people about things they do not understand. By purchasing this perk, any method of teaching others is just as effective as investing everything into making the lessons clear, so long as you have a good understanding of what you are trying to teach and that your methods actually have something to do with teaching no matter how unorthodox."
851,,500,Training Never Ends,Jump Force,Lore,"Why are so many heroes endlessly wandering, training, testing their limits? Because the best of them knows that a limit is just a horizon, and there's always a new one to chase. With this Perk, no ability you have is beyond improving with sufficient training. Not in the 'cultivate energy for a thousand years' sense, but in the practical spar with your rival, train your friends, battle evil and save the day sense. Every day and every experience will enhance you in some way, doubly so for any abilities you use on that day. A single day's advancement might not be earth-shattering for a skill you've already mastered by common standards, but for you nothing has a plateau."
852,,500,Jumpers Sutra,Shin Megami Tensei V,Lore,This handy book looks much like the Sutras usable by the various Demons to increase their ‘Skill potential’. This copy you own is much more effective than these however. By studying its pages you can increase your skill at using certain types of attacks and use it directly once per Jump to sorts of ‘level up’ a kind of skill in an instant. It also holds instruction to maximize your training efforts.
853,,500,Champion of the Eternal Battlefield,Diablo 3,Lore,"You are not a mere Novice... No! You are already an established Veteran in this Eternal Conflict. You have the skills, knowledge and power to be a threat to any mere Angel, Demon, Beginner Nephalem or Human that may come your way. You are also quite feared as a fighter, since your reputation of living so long without a major loss, is a feat worthy of legends in and of itself. You are also quite adept at being a good leader by example inspiring your allies should you fight on their side. 

This is also a Capstone Booster for any 600cp and higher Perks you may purchase."
854,,500,Scire ,Scion ,Lore,"This long-forgotten purview represents that which the Atlantean culture once extolled: Knowledge based on understanding the workings of the World and its component parts. With it, a hypothetical Atlantean Scion could potentially master and manipulate the full range of modern technology in ways other gods seldom even consider. At low levels, this enables intuitive understanding of even hidden consequences stemming from simple objects or tools, and lets the Scion instantly transfer information from sources of knowledge such as books, rune-covered tablets or flash drives. At higher levels this lets demigods manipulate technology remotely, immunise equipment to environmental conditions and include or exclude any targets they wish from effects that target an area. At the highest levels, gods can erase a fact from public knowledge and anticipate connections from nearly any chain of events. Moreover, their supreme understanding of universal principles grants them a limited power to nullify consequences. Entire cities could crumble as an enemy god or Titan tried to strike them down, but they would stand unscathed. However, this cannot nullify Fate and therefore fails to work on Fatebindings or Fateful Aura effects. For this reason a God in Avatar form’s power cannot be ignored either since that being is performing Fate’s work through a certain concept."
855,,500,"""Hollow Bible""",Dark Souls 3,Lore ,"What appears to be a Divine Tomb of the Way of White, when opened up it reveals a cavity has been cut out of the pages and a little black book has been tucked away inside. This Hollow Bible within a “hollow bible” reveals information that, wish some degree of practice and study, can allow the reader to harness the powers of darkness. Basic lessons inside teach you how to project heavy, dark projectiles of various types at enemies. More advanced lessons focus on different curses and spreading the influence of the Abyss. You could drive weakened enemies mad by gripping their heart in darkness, empowering them but also driving them mad, prone to attack whatever is around them, including allies. You could also empower allies with darkness if you’re careful to inhibit the “madness” part. Either form of this Abyssal Touch is easily visible due to the corrupted individual’s “glowing red eyes”. On top of unique lessons, having prior knowledge of Miracles, Sorcery or Pyromancy (as well as the necessary casting implements) can allow one to learn dark variants of tales and spells from those disciplines befitting of a hollow."
856,,500,Prime-r Merlinean,The Sorcerer's Apprentice,Lore ,"Somewhere deep in your family history, no matter how small, comes from the same lineage that Merlin did. Even if only a sliver, it means that you are destined to become an extraordinarily powerful sorcerer one day, to the point that the power within you is so great you no longer need a focus to cast magic. This applies to all of your magic as well- not necessarily making you anymore powerful, but freeing you of the need to use any sort of focus to cast. It also means that in future jumps, just like in this one, you will be distantly related to a magic user of major importance, like Merlin."
857,,600,Book of Secret Arts,Duel Monsters – The Shadow Realm,Lore ,"You won’t find this book in the library of Endymion. It holds 3 forbidden spells: The Change of Heart, the Monster Reborn, and Graceful Charity. Change of Heart allows you to permanently change the allegiance and loyalty of any creature you encounter with a weak enough willpower, the Monster Reborn allows you to revive a creature as long as it’s soul resides in the realm you’re in, and Graceful Charity allows you to exchange your magical energy for another kind of energy, either restoring your health or stamina...or any other kind of energy your body may have, depending on how seasoned a traveller you are."

Want training in being an infiltrator you can, want to be a murder hobo they got you covered or want to be able to pick up a weapon and kill something 40 miles away you are good to go. The order has refined you into the best you can be in a single job and expected great things from you.

Boosted: You are not just a knight, you are the night you have no equal in your chosen fields. You are so good you have expanded to 4 other fields to dominate just because you were bored.

859,,600,Tongue of Babel,Kate Daniel ,Lore ,"You have a skill with words and language in specific so good you have learned to use just your words and with it, you have built up an affinity for the language of power. The language is so old it is the written/spoken form of magic. To know work in this language is to own it completely. To learn more is to speak the word after it tries to kill you. To use a single word takes more magic than a normal person has and results in effects of the same scale. Total control of someone's body, driving everyone in range mad with fear, making an army kneel, etc. You know 3 words.

Boosted: You know enough of the language to string together sentences and occasionally poems and the ability to puzzle out the rest of the language given time.

860,,600,Mister Bad Man,Castlevania - Rondo of Blood,Lore ,"Who would leave a child to defeat a god? Someone with no choice perhaps, but in this case it’s more along the lines that you ran ahead and dealt with him before your allies ever arrived. You thrive in the darkness, and take great joy in being the shining light in this gloomy place. When faced with adversity, with foes that are dozens of times stronger than you, endless legions of undying monsters, you are in your element. Should you choose to fight back, you’ll find yourself growing to meet the challenge far quicker than should be possible. An untrained child could do serious damage to the forces of darkness before falling, learning to use weapons and dodge blows with the skill of a hunter decades their elder in the process. If that child had a familiar or two, perhaps a pair of doves, then you might see your battle with darkness acting as the trigger for an entire zoo of mythological animals to come to your aid to forge a contract with you. With even minimal training beforehand, you could equal a Belmont at the height of their power in mere days. You are the light, so shine as brightly as you can."
861,,600,Necromantic Archives,Baldur's Gate 3,Lore ,"This is the wet dream of a wizard, specifically a necromancer. You get two magical grimoires that contain some of the most profound and/or forbidden mysteries ever created within the forgotten realms setting, in the area of necromancy.

The first book you get is named Necromancy of Thay. This book contains various secrets and vile arts that is ever created in the school of necromancy. Normally you’d have read through the pages of this book, whilst enduring the pure necromantic curse that is radiating from it. Since you paid for it, this is no longer the case for this version of the book. You can simply read it like a bedtime story, and it is pretty easy to understand too. When you finish reading this book, you find that you can converse with spirits of the dead as much as you want. Some rules though: you need a corpse with an intact head to ask questions, you can only ask five questions per corpse, you cannot speak to the same corpse until a week passes, and the corpse may refuse to answer your questions, if you are the cause of their untimely demise (unless you are disguised of course). This is the only powers you get from this book normally in game. However, with this item, you find that your necromancy spells are more potent than they were before, around %50 of increased potency we are talking about. Also, undead minions you raise, if you have the power to do so, has increased physical stats and mental acumen to follow your orders better.

Second book you get is named Tharciate Codex. This book on its own doesn’t grant you anything. However, it contains the secrets of deciphering hidden meanings within the Necromancy in Thay. If you read this book and then the first book you gained from this item purchase again, you get the ability to conjure powerful undead servants that are fully under your command. With but a thought and a gesture you could conjure either: twenty skeletons, ten ghouls, five mummies or three wraiths. Each of them also gains the ability to explode in a burst of necrotic energy upon death or at your command. You’ll notice that these options are significantly stronger than the ones you get in game. You paid for them after all. These minions stay at your command until they are destroyed or dismissed by you. You can issue command to each of them mentally and they follow it best to their capabilities. You can only use this power once per day, and if you attempt to summon more minions or change the type of minions you have active, the previous ones are automatically dismissed as they turn into dust.

Both books can also act as a spellbook for the use of wizards. They can hold an infinite number of spells and rituals, if you want to scribe spells into them."
862,,600,Bhaalspawn,Baldur's Gate 3,Lore ,"‘The Lord of Murder shall perish, but in his doom, he shall spawn a score of mortal progeny. Chaos will be sewn from their passage. So sayeth the wise Alaundo.’ the prophecy goes. You are one of those progeny jumper (or you gained that divine spark some other way). Either way, you carry the divine blood and essence of God of Murder within your body.

First of all, your abilities, skills and powers are boosted. You become better at, generally speaking, everything. You learn skills faster, grasp intricate concepts and techniques easier and so on. At all times you are at your best, executing each action with peerless acumen. On the statistical side, this basically grants you bodily and mental prowess equivalent to person who purchased All 20s all attribute boosting options, only at a half as much efficiency (making all of your attributes around 14-15, if they aren’t greater than that).

Secondly, you have broken the limits placed on your mortal body by having a little bit of god blood within your veins. Your growth cap is removed, meaning that all of your skills, physical qualities, mental prowess and any abilities you possess can be trained endlessly with no upper limit. The only limiting factor for your growth is time constraints, which are increased as this perk also grants you an extra century of two to your lifespan, which all of that will be spend in your prime. If you find a way to extend your unholy lifespan even further, maybe in time you’ll be a match for gods themselves.

Finally, you gain an inborn talent and creativeness for all things related to killing and violence. If you just a put some effort into it, you could drop the jaws of the Murder Tribunal to floor with your pure displays of savagery. Killing is a second nature to you, being more of an art form rather than a tool. You can use all tools and equipment for murdering purposes. Maybe stabbing a pen through the eye? Or strangling someone with their innards perhaps? Possibilities are endless. Oh, and you take the meaning of ‘If it bleeds, you can kill it’ saying to its limits. If it’s possible to kill a being, you are sure to find a way to do so. And if the being were to be truly unkillable, you may find a way to make them vulnerable just to you can kill them again. This even extends to beings which are conceptually unkillable. This does require quite an effort for though, and for some beings it can be damn near impossible.

Whatever you decide to with all these powers is up to your jumper. Go and slaughter your way forth in the name of your dread father... or defy your nature and use your awesome power in the name of greater good.

On a final note, while you are still a child of Bhaal, he has no power over you or your blood, no more than any other god. To put you at ease, this means that he cannot just literally explode you in a shower of gore, if you were to defy him... he could send someone with a slayer form though, if you were to anger him too much. The only real power he has over you is parenting rights, and even that is a big maybe."
863,,600,Seeker of Names,Anima Beyond Fantasy,Lore ,"You’re capable of seeing the true names of any supernatural creature you encounter, and know the names of many that you haven’t, making it easier to summon, control, bind, or banish these beasts. You know a summon for almost any situation, and controlling a being not of the natural world becomes easier. Finally your mastery is such that when you invoke your pacts with greater beings such as Aeons or Great Beasts, you will have no need to follow the terms; their power shall be yours to use without restriction."
864,,600,Progress of the Protagonist,Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous,Lore ,"Mastery, to the heights of mortal ability, can take decades or even centuries of steady and arduous effort. Study, practice, experimentation, rest, new experiences and more all goes into the advancement of fighters, wizards and bards. And yet, you have expressed years of progress in the course of a single adventure. Improvement in your skills and abilities comes swiftly when through the lens of a quest, allowing you to make leaps and bounds of progress just by using your general set of abilities in whatever dramatic task you’ve undertaken. Even if you’re a wizard paying lip service to the absolute requirement of study and experimentation, you’ll be able to quickly surpass sages far your elder this way. Even your close allies, companions that undertake these quests alongside you for long periods, can find themselves benefiting from the same alacrity in advancement. 

The downside is that this form of heroic growth requires a steady increase in threat. Though you may progress faster than almost any mortal can match, it relies on your quests and adventures becoming more and more difficult. Stay safe with lesser threats and you’ll quickly falter to be just another mortal but pit yourself against the abyss with Mendev’s Crusade and you might become a master in just two years. "
865,,600,Put An End To This,Castlevania - Symphony of the Night,Lore ,"I mentioned before that Alucard had tried to kill his father once or twice, and even fought alongside a Belmont in the process. He has experience in matters pertaining to Dracula’s death. And now, so do you. Much like Alucard, you have fought your way through Castlevania before. Seen its halls twist against you and pushed through anyways, fighting against those you probably once called friend as you did. You possess the skills of a veteran vampire slayer, the usage of the traditional subweapons and a few non-traditional ones as well, a passing familiarity with seemingly every weapon known to man and monster, and one particular weapon you specialize in above all others. Not the whip - that is the domain of the Belmont clan. A sword perhaps? There are plenty of blades both holy and unholy to be found within the castle walls."
866,,600,Necronomicon,Old Man Henderson,Lore ,"A totally safe version of the most infamous evil book in history. While you could use it for smoking, it can offer many other benefits. It holds all the twisted knowledge of the twisted gods, updating this information per Jump for the local mad deities. Besides this information it describes spells to inflict madness, illness and enact necromancy. It is also much easier to reach such eldritch beings, summon them in rituals and will boost any of your abilities that are related to eldritch. If you happen to be an Eldritch God you may use this Book to channel your power through and as a way to communicate with whoever so much as looks at it."
867,,600,Backstory of Doom ,Old Man Henderson,Lore ,"This 320 Page Long might just be more nightmarish and eldritch than the Necronomicon. Sometimes switching tone and how it was written, and parts of it even in German, pretty much only you and those you allow to can comprehend and understand this... thing. Everyone else will be driven insane. It also holds a very accurate summary of all you have experienced as well as your powers... and what is not in there you can even make up. Before you go crazy with this, it's something a normal human in your home world must be capable of but... just look at Henderson. You had the skills gained like this the whole time and no one will bother to question where you learned this, or be able to take them away or ‘Retcon’ them as long as they are written in this Backstory. What are they gonna do to argue against it, read this thing?"
868,,600,Ark of Eternity,Anima Ark Of Sinners,Lore ,"The people of this city are stuck in an eternity as timeless shadows but what if you could make use of that time. This grants you thousands of years of experience with all your powers,skills, magics etc... which updates for all powers,perks,skills etc you get in every jump going forward."
869,,600,Knowledge of the Ark,Anima Ark Of Sinners,Lore ,"As can be seen throught the city the civilization it housed was a magically advanced one capable of creating powerful wards and even sentient puppets like ID. This grants you all the knowledge of their civilization as well as the luck to find/summon artifacts/beings of incredible power just like how they discovered The Clock that allowed them to freeze time. Since you are paying CP for it, whatever artifacts/beings you find/summon are guaranteed to work in the way you intend it to. Post-jump this updates with the knowledge of similarly advanced civilizations within the jump setting such as the Netheril civilization in a DnD jump.

Boosted: To your Eternity

The people of Ark wished to create more than a thousand year civilization Indeed, what they wished for was an eternal Utopia and now you Jumper possess both the knowledge and ability to bring the eternity the people of this city were after. This greatly boosts the effects of the previous perk on top of making you a peerless ruler and inventor capable of tackling any problem you are faced with.

870,,600,Sink or Swim,Castlevania - Aria of Sorrow,Lore ,"Okay, let’s be perfectly honest. Being handed a butter knife and told you need to fight through a castle of monsters might be just a tiny bit overwhelming for the average high school student or even some interdimensional travellers out there...or maybe not. Stll, you need to learn quick, and hands-on experience is the best available. You quickly learn how to properly wield any weapon you pick up like an expert, even ones you’ve never used before. In addition, you quickly learn and master skills through constant practice or danger involving them. The aforementioned high school student could become a master of killing hordes of monsters in droves while jumping around like a skilled acrobat in a single evening with the help of this ability. It’s slightly less effective towards passive or intellectual skills, being most effective for direct combat abilities or something ‘hands-on’ like crafting."
871,,600,Words of Power ,Grant Morrison’s 18 Days,Lore ,"There are many paths to power, and more paths than most for a sage. You know things beyond the ken of most men now, Jumper. A being steeped in the ancient mysteries, you were there when the Thousand Names of Vishnu were spoken, and they are in your memory even now, seared into place like few things can be.

The names of a God are Names of power, secret mysteries that grant you unbelievable insight into the ways and workings of the world. In this world, simply by calling upon these names you can step ever closer to Moksha, the enlightenment that lies beyond the end of all things, and free yourself from Samsara, the primal suffering that all life is prone to. Well, this is not just the names of one God. This is the Names of All The Gods that ever were and ever will be. Their true secret and most wonderful, awful, terrible names.

In a more practical sense, your mind and soul are fortified both from and by this knowledge, this conceptual understanding of all that could be, making it so that it’s all but impossible to even rattle you, let alone compromise your mind or drive you insane. Besides that, such Names are powerful spells in their own right, allowing you to call upon powers related to them. Could you manifest the power to breath underwater by calling upon the Matsya avatar of Vishnu, or manifest claws from the Narsimha? Possibly. You’re the only one who knows. You’re the one with the Names, after all.

Of course, these are Names, words, and as such they can be shared with others, though any who did not purchase this might spend an entire lifetime in meditation to come to an understanding of the power of just one Name. And they’re not guaranteed to be unharmed by the learning. You are.

In future jumps too, you receive secret, hidden knowledge wherever it is to be had, especially if it pertains to divinity or other beings like them. You know the secret names of gods, demons and spirits, how to call upon them and the right ways to talk to them. You know the terrible mysteries lost to time, secret, heretical knowledge buried and lost for fear of its power, and you know the secret cures for terrible diseases. 

You know a lot, Jumper. Don’t let it go to your head."
872,,600,Endless Grimoire,Warhammer 40K: The Warp ,Lore ,"This duplicate of the signature book of Tzeentch is a prize beyond measure. Containing any and every spell, cantrip and incantation Tzeentch has ever concocted or conceived of, you might one day master the book for yourself and gain a measure of the Patron of Sorcerer’s magical power."
873,,600,Mira Mirror,Twisted-Wonderland ,Lore ,"An ultimate search system in the form of either a smartphone or a mirror. Knows all about the present and previous worlds, except secrets that are only in the owner’s heads. Still, you will need to induce the search yourself and it’s not instinctive."
874,,600,Tapestry of Fate,Changeling The Dreaming,Lore ,"Whether it truly exists or not is unknown to the fae. According to stories, the tapestry contains every true name that there is, as well as the fate of the Dreaming. The power and knowledge it holds are invaluable. Lost long ago, it is rumored to be everywhere from a Sluagh freehold to under the Silvered Sea. Many have left in search of it, but none have returned. One thing is for certain: the finder will probably draw the wrath of the Norns upon them."
875,,600,Osiris' Flail ,Changeling The Dreaming,Lore ,"The first pharaoh of ancient Egypt, Osiris, kept two symbols of power. One of these, his flail, is depicted on the sarcophagi of many of the pharaohs that followed in his footsteps. It is usually shown crossed with a crook over the chest of the dead king. The flail is a short-handled rod from which hangs a group of three leather strips decorated with wooden beads and bone. Legend states that the flail was a treasure given to Osiris by Horus, a falcon pooka. Reportedly, it recorded all of history in the chimerical carvings upon its bone and wood beads. To tap its extensive wisdom, a person simply asked a question, then touched the flail to her brow, upon which the answer would come to them immediately."
876,,600,Show You The Way,Princess The Hopeful,Lore ,"The ultimate joy of the Seekers is not to hoard knowledge, but to share it for the betterment of the world. That’s why you’re an excellent tutor, presenter and orator: Able to keep your audience inspired and engaged over something as mundane as water reservoir statistics and break down the tedium of data into easy to grasp segments. However your true power lies in the rewards the Light grants you for enacting your role: When you expose information publicly, or educate others, all magic (including the Light’s) in your grasp recuperates it’s reserves within you at an accelerated rate. This effect is of course bolstered if you use said magic to inspire your audience and share your findings quicker, and once you’ve gotten the joy of learning going you may even safely teach others forbidden or eldritch knowledge that would normally prove harmful through them- safeguarding it in a conceptual sheathe of the Light’s joy in learning. What you study isn’t just easier to learn, but made safer to your students simply through twists of fate. The Nemesis Conundrum, an Abyssal intruder of pure malign mathematics, is feared by many mages, but with an enthusiastic class you could safely dissect it’s theorems-and perhaps, ultimately disprove it once and for all."
877,,600,Slayer Of Dracula,Castlevania - Judgment,Lore ,"A mage or an alchemist will rarely step onto the battlefield, but for all they may vaunt their intellectual superiority over you, there is something they forget. Knowledge of any kind can be a weapon, not merely the knowledge needed to manipulate the elements. Over the years, you have fought many foes and will fight many more in the days to come. Knowing what they are, how they move, what kinds of weapons or abilities they may possess, these are things that will save your life time and time again. As a hunter of monsters, you have become a living library on the topic of their death. For all intents and purposes, you have been trained to fight every kind of monster that exists, were taught the theory behind several more that don’t, and had the opportunity to practice those techniques as you fought your way through Castlevania. Dracula died at your hands - having done such a thing in the past, what monster could you possibly need to fear?"
878,,600,Enlightened Master,MTG - Tarkir                                ,Lore ,"Your mind is like the sky itself, open to countless possibilities, allowing you to learn new skills, philosophies and magics at an incredible speed - even to the point of potentially studying your opponents’ techniques mid-battle and deconstructing or replicating them - and your ability to argue your points is similarly enhanced; you need not defeat your enemies to persuade them. Your affinity for the martial arts is the same, and you can perform feats such as breaking spells with your bare hands or performing multiple techniques or spells at once."
879,,600,Tome of Dark Desire,Valkyrie Anatomia,Lore ,"A book known by many names: the Monstrous Manifesto, the Heretic Spellbook and the Forbidden Tome. Regardless of the name, it is a truly powerful artefact for any mage: it automatically records every spell you know or learn of upon its pages, which may be ripped off to cast it at no cost to you. Furthermore, it will analyse and record information that you desire to know about an individual who is objectively weaker than you and is at your mercy upon its pages. Each page is carefully sorted and will adjust its position to be more convenient for you and it will never grow so large that you cannot carry it in one hand and will always be perfectly legible. Any pages that are ripped from it are restored in one week’s time. As a side note, it happens to have excellent quality pages to use for your own personal notes. Should it be given to another, then it will maintain its properties, though it cannot be used against you without your willing intent and may be summoned back with but a thought."
880,,600,A Life of Lies,Valkyrie Anatomia,Lore ,"Human nature is one of growth and evolution, always able to surpass those who came before them, whether through refinement of skills, concepts or technology. You learn from those around you, as so many have in the past, though in an entirely different way. Rather than simply learn from others, you have the capability to mimic their actions almost immediately upon encountering them so long as you are physically capable of performing them. Simply seeing the actions of others allows you the ability to perform such things, as long as you would be physically capable. Further, you will not forget these skills – should you see a strategy in motion once, then you would be able to call upon the same methods of applying it every time, fully learning the act, and understanding the processes behind them. This will not, however, aid in study – you must see what you wish to mimic in action, but with the right disguise and mild observation, you could easily take the role of a king, even if you normally looked and sounded noticeably different."
881,,600,World Dragon Council Member ,Disney’s American Dragon: Jake Long,Lore ,"You are part of the ruling body of the Dragons and the Order of the Dragon. One of the most influential organizations of the magical community. This comes with great power, not only political but personal, as you know many hidden and secret magics and arts. This boosts your Dragon Powers to a Mastery that few dragons know, allowing you full use of your powers even outside of Dragon form. With the help of fellow Council Members, you may seal the Chi of a Dragon as well as restore it when the time is right."
882,,600,Belmont,Castlevania (Netflix) ,Lore ,"The Belmonts are an old family that have fought against  Dracula and the other monsters of the night for centuries. Their knowledge of the dark magics is second to none, save for Dracula himself- only instead of using it, they’ve used their knowledge to fight against it. You are now a member of their clan, and with this comes several gifts. First, your knowledge of monsters is unparalleled- vampires, demons, cyclops, you’ve heard of it. Your knowledge isn’t limited to just what you’ve learned in your family’s library however; you also have ample experience with fighting these creatures, having killed more then your fair share over the years. Your knowledge of tactics would let you take untrained peasants and turn them into an effective fighting force. Naturally, your body is pretty much at the peak of human physicality because of all the fighting you do, as are your reflexes which are sharp enough that you could kick a short sword into a cyclops’s eye. Finally, you’ve mastered a variety of weapons such as swords and lances. Whips are what truly shine in your hands, though, as the degree of control that you have over them is almost supernatural due to them being your family’s weapon of choice."
883,,600,NU Graduate,Amphibia,Lore ,"Congratulations jumper you’ve gone through and graduated form the prestigious Newtopia University! You’ve learned almost everything there is to know about the science, culture, and politics of Newtopia and somehow come out of the university with your personality still intact. Going through a rigorous university program has left you with some very useful skills including being able to read tomes at an extreme speed in order to pull those much needed all-nighters. On top of this you’ll become more creative and a faster thinker in accordance with the amount of notes you take. Just try to remember that there’s more to life than school.

887,,600,Personal Skills,Wild Arms 2,Lore ,"A Skill, habit or set of priorities developed during years of battle experiences, collected from the best fighters and streamlined in order to be easily taught to everyone. These are the personal skills, basically they are tips, tricks or techniques that others learned in combat and sold off to newbies. Certain shops teach them to those strong enough to learn. It may take some time and experience before one can fully learn one of these, but their usefulness it's worth the effort. Better attack power, more defensive capabilities or just some utility, they make battles easier. 

Personal skills aren’t necessarily only useful in combat, for example: If someone trained in order to avoid forgetting important things they could have developed a personal skill that helps them become better at resisting spells that affect memory and give them better memory overall.

You have the training to run one of these special shops. You have the expertise and understanding of people's limits that lets you design training plans or a series of specific challenges that make anyone learn any kind of personal skill. You can even design a personalized gauntlet that makes those that complete it learn a personal skill uniquely suited to them, with original effects based on their talents. The strength of the skills created this way cannot exceed your powers and this kind of gauntlet will only benefit any given person once per jump or every ten years.

In future worlds, you can keep creating training plans to learn new personal skills, however during your chain, the number of personal skills one can benefit from at the same time is limited to a half a dozen, though this limit will loosen as one gets more experienced or grows in power. You can still learn any number of personal skills and you can freely toggle any personal skill on and off."

889,,600,Zodiac Brave Story,Final Fantasy Tactics,Lore ,"It is more than just a mere story. It is a lesson, a blessing, a plan, a prophecy, and so much more. You, like the founders of the Church, can train people in a suite of special skills, allowing those you chose to become Holy/Ark/Rune/Temple Knights, and tap into the holy energies needed for these Jobs that only a select few can. Holy and Temple Knights focus on creating status effects by channeling holy energy through their blows. Ark and Rune Knights, on the other hand, are both unique Jobs only given over to highly skilled individuals. An Ark Knight strikes with the Blade of Ruin and each strike can sap away speed, physical, mental, or magical prowess causing holes to open where none should otherwise be as each strike becomes like a curse for a while. A Rune Knight invokes Runes to cast high level Black Magic and perform Holy Swordplay akin to a Holy or Temple Knight. 

In addition, your long experience with the Glabados faith has shown you how to copy their feat of building a myth or story up until it becomes an unquestioned truth believed by the masses, much as the Lucavi built up the Zodiac Braves and Ajora, you may invent a new myth or story up or you may use one already in existence. This includes all the skill needed to puppet an entire kingdom through the myth or story you’ve chosen to elevate."
890,,600,Celestial Library,I’m The Grim Reaper,Lore ,"You receive a copy of the jewel crown of Heaven, the Celestial Library itself. This metaphysical library contains billions and billions of books, with them together recording all of God’s memories and knowledge until the current day, being potentially ever expanding or even infinite. Some books contain memories written in chronological order like diaries, while others are written separated on different subjects, being more similar to encyclopedias. Despite the almost infinite number of books contained here, you’ll have an innate feeling of where the books you’re searching for are and, after reading a book, you’ll be able to automatically summon it to your location, without needing to search for it again. Alternatively, due to the metaphysical nature of the library, all the information recorded here may be manifested in other ways other than books instead, like being stored in a structure similar to a supercomputer, manifesting as holograms or any other form, if you prefer. If any of the books is lost or destroyed, it’ll immediately reappear in the library. Post-jump, the library will be expanded and will copy all the knowledge and information stored in the Akashic Records related to the local multiverse of future settings. The Akashic Records are like the main storage memory for Life, the Universe, and Everything's server, with essentially and literally everything ever stored inside of it and altering these records would literally enable someone to edit and overwrite reality itself on a universal scale or even greater. As the information recorded on your Celestial Library is just a copy of the original, it lacks this property, so editing anything recorded here won’t edit the universe. By default, the library may become a Warehouse attachment or be turned into a separate personal dimension if you prefer."
891,,600,Priory Collection,Guild Wars 2,Lore ,"You have in your possession the entire library of the Durmand Priory. This contains nearly every spell ever recorded in Tyria, historical accounts from every race and books on culture and ancient legends. This library updates itself every jump, accruing information about local races."

893,,600,Apex of Secrets,Beast: The Primordial,Lore ,"No secret is truly impossible for you to discover as long as you remain persistent. Even when not putting in the effort, important and obscure secrets involving the supernatural and things that can benefit you in some way have a habit of falling right into your lap. Secrets are only secret if known only by a few, so you don't have to worry about others finding out you know things you really shouldn't as long as you're not a complete blabbermouth."
894,,600,The Heart of Heb-Hemertet,Mummy: The Curse,Lore ,"Heb-Hemertet was a priestess of Irem, who was a pure conduit to the wisdom of the gods. The Shan’iatu grew jealous over her powers, and so sacrificed her and preserved her heart in this bronze casing that is engraved with scenes from her life. So long as you have it, you will be deeply aware of your surroundings and the heart will whisper occult insights to you. Its curse is that the owner will be enraptured by contemplation of the heart’s knowledge, preventing them from learning new skills."
895,,600,Uplifted Soul’s Grimoire,Mummy: The Curse,Lore ,"This Seba contains three Utterances of your choice. As long as it is bound, it allows you to use those Utterances and to activate them without cost with a significant exertion of will. Its curse causes one of the Utterances to suddenly activate for free, attempting to cause epic tragedies."
896,,600,Truth,Fullmetal Alchemist,Lore ,"The Gate of Truth, the place where all knowledge of Alchemy is stored, or so some think. You see, when one undergoes human transmutation, they find themselves taken through this gate, and given knowledge of alchemy greater than most experts, alongside the price of something taken from them. Somehow, your In-Jump origin managed to figure this out, and instead of trying a human transmutation, worked solely for the sake of entering this Gate and obtaining this knowledge. Somehow, this worked. Whether there was an item of great strength involved(hint hint), a gift from The Benefactor, or just Truth deciding to be a magnanimous fellow for once, he got that knowledge. You see, like a certain Dwarf in the Flask, you too have great knowledge of Alchemy. Instead of just being an expert, you’re more like a Master, having knowledge of almost every branch of Alchemy in one way or another. Included in this is also the method for creating Philosopher’s Stones, Father’s eclipse ritual, Homunculi(the original kind), Alkahestry, and all the lost arts of Xerxes. Somehow, like the other sacrificial candidates, and those stupid enough to try Human Transmutation, you too are now able to use Alchemy without a Transmutation Circle. You could spend centuries truly making this knowledge yours, but for now you’ll have to settle for the good amount of expertise you have."
897,,600,Intellectual Titan,Bleach,Lore ,"With the right foundation, maybe there’s not as much need to specialise. Ever since you were born, you felt different from all the other kids. You understood things more easily, everyone felt slow in comparison. You only realised later that it was the signs of genius, the sort of intellect to match Aizen or Urahara. While this does not innately grant any knowledge or skill of it’s own, your now thoroughly incredible mind will make up for that in short order. 

Comprehension comes easily, even complicated concepts being easily understood in short order, and you see that it’s simple to innovate and improve on existing ideas. A new skill or discipline progresses swiftly once you focus, able to rapidly progress to levels that would take ordinary souls many years to reach. Spending the decades that most Shinigami or Quincy take to make their own breakthroughs would see you reach the utter mastery of a field expressed by people like Kurotsuchi or Urahara. Your mind is particularly well suited to breaking new ground where few have approached before, discoveries and progress becoming far easier to reach if you are one of the earliest to research a subject. The combination of Shinigami and Hollow may be taboo but just look at what Kisuke and Aizen accomplished on their own."
898,,600,Fires of War,Bleach,Lore ,"The crucible of war is where mankind has often made it’s greatest advancements. In power and strategy, science and technology, even in growing as a moral species. Perhaps you’re something similar, on an individual scale. Far more than most, conflict brings out your full potential. Not only in combat but any competition or battle in which the stakes are high, you are able to grow and learn at a far greater rate than is normal for you. 

Ordinary battles to the death will quickly sharpen your abilities but fatal fights that are also for the sake of others you care for will greatly increase the benefits as the stakes rise higher. From huge bounds in growth to potentially discovering entirely new powers, you can even use this conflict- derived growth to push past normal limits or caps on your potential and continue to increased your abilities. The benefits are potent but will begin to drop off as the stakes keep rising. For the sake of a world, you could bring forth unheard of potential, but beyond such global stakes you’ll find little more increases to be had."
899,,600,Number One,Bleach,Lore ,"Potential, what a terrifying concept. In every human soul, there is the potential to change the world. It may only be through little actions for some but for others, like you, your potential marks you as someone with the destiny to make great changes. In regards to war and spiritual power and the innate abilities of a race, as well as all things connected to these concepts, your potential is almost infinite. Matched only by Ichigo Kurosaki, you are able to make what might take most Shinigami decades or even centuries in just months of work.

In regards to unlocking your own hidden potential, discovering abilities not yet available rather than furthering your mastery of existing powers, your potential grows to even greater extents. The result is that you will extremely quickly, perhaps in just half a year, gain access and capable skill with most of the racial abilities and techniques available to you. Progress beyond that will still be astonishingly fast, unbelievable to all but a prodigy and threatening even then, but not quite so swift as before."

Additionally, this device contains the details of every spell or sorcery devised by a Sorothustran, as well as their contributions to biology, thaumaturgical studies, and countless other fields of study. This is an unparalleled repository of information worth countless fortunes. If you lose this device or if it is destroyed somehow it will appear in your staff’s pocket space inventory in an hour, completely restored."

You are now so skilled at this art, that you rival even the great Orpheus in your abilities. Not only could you charm any mortal or immortal alike with your skills, but you could even enthrall inanimate objects. The trees sway to your beat, the mountains lean closer to hear your performance, and the waves part to give you a better view of whatever you are painting. Such artistry is beyond mortal comprehension, and nothing you create in your chosen medium will ever be anything less than a masterpiece."
902,,600,Grandmaster,The Seven Deadly Sins,Lore ,"For one to be worthy of the title Grandmaster they have to be strong as one. You have skill. Skill that even to a three thousand year old demon would make you seem nearly invincible. Your application of your power and your skill with your weapon makes it seem as if you have trained for ten thousand years straight. Every angle and every swing seems perfectly timed. You have this innate battle sense that makes it seem as if you can see around you at 360 degrees and you can in a way. Your instincts cause you to dodge no matter if you can see or not relying on every other sense in your body. Your sword techniques seem to be those of true grandmasters and you seem to exude an aura of leadership that causes those around you to rally and charge forwards. Your application of your power makes it seem as if you had a million different applications for it no matter how simple it was. Every aspect of you has been raised to the level of a True Grandmaster. You gain an increase of 4,000 in your power level."
903,,600,Jumper Hero Style​ ,Generic Exalted,Lore ,"Your nature as a world (and dimension) crossing Jumper has changed the fundamental nature of your being and understanding. Your many experiences across many worlds has given you the necessary insight and mental fortitude to truly grasp the nature of Martial Arts. You can learn any supernatural martial arts style native to any world/Jump you happen to find yourself in, even if you don't actually have a mentor to teach you how to do it, so long as it is not an option that requires you to pay for it with CP (a restriction that is lifted Post-Spark). Through either dumb luck or keen insight you'll just stumble into the correct move set, frame of mind, and if necessary secret-hidden-potential needed in order to become a practitioner.

In effect this means you'll always be able to learn any form of supernatural martial arts even if you lack the qualities, genetics, special destiny, knowledgeable teacher, strong soul, or whatever that you would normally require in order to learn them. For this Jump specifically this means you can learn Sidereal Martial Arts even if you aren't a Sidereal (or even if you're just a mortal) and, further, you're a lot better at it than you should be. You've got a natural talent and insight for martial arts that allows you to get a lot more mileage out of these styles than normal practitioners, able to fight harder, longer, faster, and just all around better than your peers. 

You require less Essence, ki, qi, magic, chakra, chi, or any other energy source in order to power any supernatural Martial Art that you know. You must have been to a Jump in order to learn/practice any special martial arts from that Jump, so no learning how to make your hand glow with an awesome power unless you've been there first."

You are now the undisputed master of those seven skills. This is in addition to any skills or abilities you would normally be good at on account of your Caste or 'favored' choices. You can do things with the seven skills you have chosen while half drunk and blind on your worst day that the greatest mortal practitioners would never be able to replicate, even on their best day, in their entire lives.
 
Additionally you can train anyone that you personally tutor in these seven abilities and they will quickly reach a level of skill close to, but just short of, your own level of skill. They will learn at a rate equivalent to an Exalt so long as you personally teach them, even if they aren't an Exalt. 

If you chose Dodge you might one day be able to walk through a rainstorm without getting wet. If you choose Archery you might strike a man’s heart from over the horizon while he is standing in the middle of a forest. If you chose Bureaucracy the sheer efficiency and speed with which your organization operates will baffle even the most astute observers and leave competitors hopelessly scrambling to catch up. Choosing Medicine might allow you to perform brain surgery with a rusty knife using only one hand, and have the patient come out the other side perfectly healthy. Point blank the things you can manage with your chosen skills would be outright impossible for nearly anyone else to replicate, even other Essence users needing to ‘cheat’ and use Charms in order to match what you can do with nothing but your own innate talent. You may purchase this perk up to three times, each time it is purchased you must select different abilities."
905,,600,Experience Like a River​,Generic Exalted,Lore ,"Experience flows like a river for you, and you'll be making incredible leaps and bounds in training and personal development at speeds that might just terrify the casual observer. As a mortal this gives you the equivalent of an Exalts ability in learning speed and training times, able to master specific skills in weeks or months that would take mortals lifetimes, and able to push yourself mentally and physically such that you'd be at the absolute top of your game in almost no time at all.

As an Exalt this is amplified even further, compressing into days what would take other Exalts weeks. Additionally any skills you have will never degrade from lack of use, you'll be able to take that one obscure skill you learned hundreds of years ago and use it at the same level of skill it used to be, as if no time had passed at all. To elaborate this doesn’t let you exceed the limit or ‘cap’ on any skills or abilities you might have, but it will let you reach those limits in a bare fraction of the time it normally would."

You can now memorize Activation Sequences for highly accelerated use of Magic.

Written down in a few thousand scrolls that are repaired and brought back to you should they be ruined or stolen, what these scriptures allow is one simple but quite potent thing. Those who study these scriptures, and meditate on the meaning of its texts, may, should their mindset be right and their will steadfast, achieve Immortality. Choose one of the monk options in the Learning section, whether Taoism, or Buddhism. These scriptures are, essentially, religious texts that work just as advertised for the philosophy you chose. It’s no guarantee that someone of wicked heart and impure thoughts will be able to achieve the vaunted goal of eternal life, but it is a very real chance and opportunity to do so. Those who reach Immortality will be at a level described in the Learning section as appropriate, and will need more enlightenment and practice to grow. You could bring the Taoism or Buddhism of this world to others, truly a mission that the Sakyamuni Buddha himself would approve of. Of course, the power to achieve Immortality lies in the texts themselves, not the scrolls, so you are perfectly capable of copying the text and spreading the texts wherever you wish. You may purchase the other type of scripture for an additional 200cp, should you wish to spread both philosophies to future worlds."

Elder Scrolls are artifacts of unknown origin and quantity, fragments of creation, and are commonly believed to be created by the Aedra.

When exploring the dungeons or labyrinths you can instinctively detect the traps, recognize a hidden door, solve puzzles and know which teleportation circle is the correct one to use. This also grants you the skill necessary to make and draw maps of the dungeons or labyrinths that you cleared and this maps are so detailed and easy to understand unless they are purposely ignoring it everyone should be able to understand it, and this map making can also be applied in making world maps though you need to survey personally or see it through things like a telescope of All-Seeing Eye."

You have fully mastered your natural psychic potential; you are so skilled and experienced in the ways of the Immaterium that you can use it with minimal risk even as you bring to bear forces mortals could only dream of harnessing and you have refined your natural psychic abilities that you have learnt to draw upon it so efficiently.

Now you too will have the chance to learn these and many, many other secret practices. In fact, you can now learn anything, and you will not need teachers or books. You just need to know that the practice exists, and after pondering on the matter for a while you’ll spontaneously learn the very basics of the discipline you’re trying to learn, and from then on you can train it like normal. This applies even to innate powers of a race or accursed transformation. Want to learn how to resist magic like a Breton? Want to gain vampiric powers or transform into a werewolf without being cursed yourself? Now you can. In subsequent jumps, this Perk will expand to all forms of magic, martial arts or similar, ignoring things like bloodlines or special requirements."

This will free you from the limitation of the mortal flesh, making you able to train your Perks, skills and attributes beyond what would normally be possible. On top of that, it will increase your learning speed to absurd degrees, mastering in weeks what others take years. It will also protect you from any attempt to manipulate your fate in any way, granting you the ability to trample any prophecy without having to worry about someone coming down to smite your ass. And at the same time, you will find yourself guided to the best possible path to succeed in whatever you need. Finding treasure, rare magic, and more is a common occurrence for a Prisoner. How is this fair?"
916,,600,Living Disaster,Akame ga Kill!,Lore ,"Beyond Esdeath’s fame as the master of torture and her terrifying Teigu, one of her actual scariest traits is her great talent and skill to adapt and overcome all situations by using her abilities in clever and better ways and creating new abilities and techniques, even when previously thought to be impossible, which allowed her to create her own trump cards while she and her Teigu had no other such special abilities before.

You’re now a genius on par with her, as whenever you’re out of other options or during moments of self-reflection, new and clever applications of your abilities and weapons will rush to your mind, being quite possible for you to do the impossible, breaking the established rules of certain power systems when no one expects it, to the point you could adapt your ice manipulation to extend your range to time itself, allowing you to effectively “freeze” it, or to alter your ice constructs to give them autonomy, essentially giving her the ability to create her own army.

Of course, these are just two examples of how Esdeath used her genius talent to evolve her Teigu, but you’ll definitely be able to eventually do similarly crazy feats with your own abilities, like discovering a form of altering Wrigglers while still in their eggs to create new species of controlled insects with whole new crazy abilities for example.

Boosted: A hunter’s philosophy is that “the strong survive and the weak die"" and you, my friend, are one of the strongest around here. In terms of inner energy, physical stamina and spiritual power that serve as the fuel for most of this world’s supernatural abilities, you’re an existence closer to a walking natural disaster with a consciousness rather than a human being, possessing energy reserves that dwarf everyone else and can only be matched to Esdeath herself at her peak, being able to capable of even using the Ice Commander in Chief technique if you managed to acquire the Demon’s Extract, without needing to absorb an external energy supply, but of course getting tired after such feat. Post-jump, any other reserve of exoteric energy you might possess will also be similarly enhanced to match your condition as a living disaster. Using the Jujutsu Kaisen universe as an example, if you normally had enough cursed energy to match the average sorcerer, your reserves of such power would be enhanced to even surpass Yuta’s reserves and even reach closer to the level of Sukuna, which is also considered a walking calamity in that world.

917,,600,The Great General,Akame ga Kill!,Lore ,"While still not an actual Great General, you’re no more just a mere captain of the military, but have already achieved the rank of a general through your efforts, having a physical condition on par with the Empire’s average general. As a talented general, you’ve also acquired an enormous proficiency in combat, with your strength already being perfected, that is, you’ve already developed the most efficient combat style for your body, weapons and abilities (while being capable of quickly evolving this style as you grow stronger and for each new ability or weapon you acquire) which allow you to use your current power at its maximum possible effectiveness.

Additionally, instead of only focusing on enhancing yourself, you’re also aware of the strength of your subordinates and thus you built up a considerable amount of skill in regards to strategies and war tactics, combined with a substantial amount of experience with warfare in the most varied scenarios, making you an actual master strategist, one on par with the generals Najenda and Esdeath themselves. You also possess an uncanny skill when it comes to psychological warfare as an extension of your skill for war tactics, typically involving brutal methods, such as using torture, public executions or mutilations in order to psychologically manipulate your enemies, toy with their minds and break their mentalities. Furthermore, you’re also skilled in leading your troops effectively even in the middle of the battles, in motivating them to fight with a calm but still burning heart and in training them to help them perfect their own strength in the same way as you did.

Boosted: There are certain beings whose monstrous power is more than enough to lay waste to armies with ease and to change the tides of the war by themselves, making strategies and war tactics basically worthless when they’re part of the equation. However, such beings and threats will spark your ingenuity and creativity, boosting your planning skills as well as allowing you to quickly take stock of the situation and use all the available information related to said threats to develop precise plans and countermeasures to lead and even potentially defeat them, taking a fraction of the time such plans would take to be developed and being far more accurate without risk of you underestimating your enemies. You’ll also quickly be able to analyze and discover what are the requirements to defeat any threat, no matter how expensive or rare such requirements are, such as Esdeath that, at her peak, needed more than ten Teigu users, including Akame wielding Murasame, and the entire Revolutionary Army. Lastly, thanks to your legendary planning skills and status as a member of royalty, you were promoted to the rank of Great General of the Empire, sharing your level of authority over the imperial military with the Great General Budo himself if you haven’t decided to desert the army.

It’s hard to put a number on it when it gets this high, but you’re at least the equal of Tony Stark and enough cognitive exercises and plenty of study would make you a worthy rival to Reed Richards. Additionally, there is no aspect of science or technology that you cannot understand given enough time and effort and any such disciplines that you learn can be combined and integrated with each other at your leisure. Finally, this perk combines synergistically with any and all other perks or powers that improve your intellect or mental faculties.

Boosted: Brain Storm 

Forget Reed. You’re the equal of his daughter, Valeria. That is to say, you are as far beyond Reed as Reed is beyond the average man. Not only that but your raw intellect grows continuously over time without limit, so that in each passing year you are noticeably smarter than the year before it, and any efforts you make to improve your knowledge base, intellectual skills, or cognitive functions will pay dividends without hard limits, glass ceilings, diminishing returns, or bottlenecks. Naturally, any further boosts to your intellect will increase your rate of growth going forward so that you always gain noticeable improvement. Additionally, your affinity for learning and combining the sciences now extends into the arcane and the eldritch sciences and even outright sorcery. You can learn and master any form of magic you have access to and combine spells, schools, or entire forms of the arcane arts with each other or any science and technology you have proficiency with.

Pick up the guitar and shred solos in an afternoon. Pick up a sword and kick a master fencer’s ass by the weekend.

This potential to improve is unparalleled. Sure, it’s easy to throw in the towel and call it quits, but when someone really applies themselves through hard work and effort, they can reach incredible heights. And a really hot-blooded, stubborn bastard could eventually surpass the limits of their ability over and over, so long as their will keeps on burning.

Boosted: Well, I guess the only thing that’s really impossible is impossibility itself. Not only can you improve your skills without limit, you can now even acquire skills through combat, as well. Similarly to a certain blue bomber, whenever you fight someone or something, you can learn one of their skills, so long as you’re able to defeat them. On top of that, even weird, esoteric abilities can be gained this way. Learn how to slow down time from a horse; learn to turn your own shadow into a clone from... well, a shadow clone.

920,,600,True Threat ,The Destiny Universe,Lore ,"While there is debate on whether or not the Vex have a true equivalent to the concept of a military, or if simply ‘all is Vex’, there can be no debate that Sol has only ever seen the barest fraction of a percentage of the true might of the Vex. The Vex have conquered vast swathes of the universe and are believed to have survived several iterations of the Flower Game, their numbers and technology are so far above everything Humanity has ever seen that the Human mind cannot comprehend of the threat they represent - even going so far as to outright ignore one of their wisest sages when he tried to convince them of the threat of the Vex.

This is due in part to the simple fact that, for all the strength centered on Sol, from the conventional to the paracausal, it is merely one star system - barely an atom of a grain fo sand in the vast desert that is the universe that surrounds it. All that the Vex have ever done in Sol has been an afterthought, just one single partitioned task amongst googols more. As Osiris has so fervently argued, were the true might of the Vex brought to bear upon Sol - or anything they deemed a threat - there very well could not be a single thing in the universe that could resist them.

This perk is that concept made an ability: You are so unimaginably strong that virtually any obstacle you come across can be dealt simply by partitioning off the barest portion of your mind and strength to deal with it while you remain centered on your main focus. Should you however deem something a threat to your overall pursuits, something that could very well threaten your existence, then by diverting the main brunt of your attention to it, you will find that even your awesome power is amplified by the act of focusing it on a single target, a single task.

Boosted: Overwhelming Priority 

Then there exist situations that don’t just require attention, but rather require focus at the cost of all other things. Where before simply focusing on something could amplify the power you could bring to bear against it, now, should you provide something with your sole, undivided attention - should there not be a single space left in your mind for anything but this new variable - your effectiveness will be amplified not just by factors, but by exponents. Understand that this doesn’t simply mean ‘all available attention’, this means dedicating absolutely everything you have to a single pursuit. This means should you be attacked, you would not respond for it is not your current objective - even so much as sparing the shadow of a thought towards something else would cause this ability to fail and simply be brought back to its previous, un-Capstoned state. This would be equivalent to a mortal Human on fire not even so much as considering fleeing for safety. Should you be so willing to abandon all other pursuits, there may very well not be a single thing you are incapable of, given enough time - up to and including quantifying paracausality.

You have the strength and skill necessary to be Wrath yourself, making you one of the few mundane warriors capable of standing against paracausal enemies, and veritable armies of more mundane opponents. By purchasing this with CP, you will also find your paracausal abilities elevated to the point where, in conjunction with your mundane strength and skill, you could overcome entire fireteams of Guardians or their equivalent in other paracausal forces, and even find within you the paracausal strength necessary to the destruction of Ghosts as easy as it is for other Guardians. For an extra 200 CP, you can acquire the rank yourself, making you second only to your Queen in Awoken society - granting you training and resources second to none in all of Sol, a mastery of Awoken technology, the strength of will and force of personality necessary to command the respect of those around you, and perhaps most importantly - the ear of your queen. Outside of this Jump, should you have purchased the rank, you will find that local leaders and military forces will on some level recognize and respect it, allowing you to temporarily command local forces or interact with and influence political leaders."

It knows the location of every great artifact and the names of every family member of every clan, all the best ways to raise animals, forge weapons, or built boats, or be a good leader. It knows what everyone has said on the matter, the only things it doesn't know is what's going on inside people's minds. It doesn't know why Janet killed Todd, it only knows that Janet said she loved him before stabbing him with a spatula in the groin under the bonanza last friday while she cried. It has full knowledge of everything anyone has said or done, painted , or crafted, and can tell you all these things, but things fully in the mind are beyond it. It is able to compile information and make inferences and new advice based on that, but it is limited by what people within the world have done. It could not tell you the best way to forge steel, it can tell you the best way to forge steel based on the combined work of all the blacksmiths who have ever lived in this world, meaning it can be wrong, thereby making it the best teacher available in some respects. It would be able to make reasonable inferences like substituting in a new material never used before based on past information and know properties but it won't necessarily be correct. It will update with new information on each world you can travel to and recall anything it has ever known.

926,,600,Why Does the Scholarly Faction Have Such a Secret Technique?         ,Cultivation Chat Group,Lore ,"Somehow your Awesomeness is never quite the awesomeness you wanted. If you’re seeking to develop Sword Intent, you’re likely to discover a deep well of talent in Saber Intent. When you want a Scholarly Technique, you’ll pick up Buddhist techniques. When you want to hone your aggression, you’ll discover defensive ways.

This never stops you from learning what you wanted to, or gives you a disadvantage at it. Rather, you find opportunities to surge ahead with these alternatives. Not only that, but these alternative techniques you find will be better, more complete, or have more potential then what you would otherwise be able to get. If you’re talented at swords and want to practice sword techniques, you can: you’ll just possibly discover more talent with a weapon you like less, with better techniques that aren’t the kind you think are cool.

This perk can act as a teacher, providing opportunities or helping you grasp insights, letting you train like you had a teacher. And like a good teacher, it will help you learn how to bring disparate techniques and ways into a synergetic whole. Just, never in quite the way you would have wanted or sought out.

Boosted: The divergent nature of what you find or develop becomes more extreme, and tends to build on itself in ways that become more and more useful with every deviation. For example, you develop Saber Intent rather than the Sword Intent you wanted, and that Saber Intent diverges, becoming a defensive intent that manifests as armor. As a defensive intent, it acts like armor intent, but it surges as a counterattack, and it combines unnaturally well with other Saber Intents. Then, when you advance to the Fourth Stage, your “Immortal Bones” that are supposed to become blades that temper your Illusionary Core, instead become Saber Intent that smoothly merges with your core, saving you an entire tribulation's worth of danger.

Things like this happen to you, with one somewhat useful deviation repeatedly building upon itself. These deviations will never produce quite what you would have wanted or asked for, but will become more and more useful and helpful over time. This can be in the form of power, but usually somewhat more sideways than that.

Or at least, a copy of that book, made of skin and written in blood. It’s up to you whether your edition of the book is sentient or not. It’s got various spells and incantations written down, namely on the summoning of various hellish creatures. The book will add more pages about necromancy, summoning, and dark magic as you travel to new universes. There’s no Kandarian demon involved in the process, but the book does have the power to raise an army of the dead. At your command, it can raise thousands of deadites - and these zombies are completely subservient to you. It can also be used to travel between dimensions, but once and only once. The book has a limited amount of magical energy, so you can either raise the deadite horde or get out while the going’s still good - you can’t do both. Lastly, the book has the gift of prophecy. It can tell you the future to an extent. If there are any prophecies in a universe you’re currently in, the book will have it.

So what if becoming a mage caused your life to take a turn for the worse causing your parents to get divorced, your house to be destroyed, and you dog to drink a shrinking potion. You will be the best mage ever one day no matter what stands in your way! (Sudden urge to speak in rhyme optional)"
931,,600,Born With It Baby,Dies Irae,Lore ,"Some people find that they get good at things faster than anyone else. Others like yourself, don’t even need to bother getting good. You’ve got natural talent for everything you try, almost as if you’d already been doing whatever you start doing for a whole decade. Whether it be picking up a strange magical weapon, trying out a new martial arts move or even just trying to study for exams, you’ll find you’re just as good as if you’d already had ten years’ worth of regular practice. This won’t give you any knowledge out of the blue, just increase your innate skill in a subject as if you had years of training. Deciding to study how firearms are made won’t suddenly give you all the knowledge you’d obtain through ten years of studying how firearms are made but it will give you ten years of experience in studying and, once you try out those firearm making techniques, ten years of experience in each technique. "
932,,600,Beast of Possibility,Dies Irae,Lore ,"You may not be the most suited to gathering souls in slaughter but you might just find you no longer have need to grow strong. You have a soul with a vast amount of potential, something that allows you to not only grow at a rate that turns days of time into decades of progress but also lets you progress in power without the usually required materials. Despite normally needing you to eat a certain number of souls, you are able to progress through the stages of Ewigkeit just through time, constant fighting and training and self-reflection. You are able to do this with other sorts of powers as well, progressing even when lacking the usually required resources and simply using time, battle and self-understanding in place of them. "
933,,600,I Am Entering Your Memories,80s Sword and Sorcery,Lore ,"You possess the ability to forcibly reach into the minds of others in search of their memories, knowledge, and skills and rip them from inside of them. This requires you to grasp their head, holding it in place as you stare into their face, pushing your mind within theirs and with the strength of your will ripping free facets of their mind. This is a painful experience for the victim, and damaging to their mind, growing worse the deeper you go. You could extract a few surface thoughts, or some specific information without inflicting permanent harm to another’s mind, but if you were to extract, for example, a wide base of general knowledge about the modern world from someone’s mind it’d probably kill them; and somewhere in between lies permanent memory loss and even brain damage. You can learn skills this way, though this level of extraction will damage your victim’s mind permanently, at minimum ripping that skill from them and likely doing more harm. Learning skills this way will not necessarily give you the necessary capabilities to use them; this can give you a master’s skill at swordplay but not their muscles, or a sorcerer’s knowledge and skill in magic, but not their innate talent of mystical energy."
934,,600,Martial Memory Adaptation,The God of High School,Lore ,"You were born with a talent for Martial Arts and an even greater talent for copying off of others. All it takes is a single instance of a martial arts technique being performed in front of your eyes for you to not only learn how to do it, but also understand the principles behind it. That kick you saw isn’t just a way to move the muscles in your body but a way to control your opponent’s momentum as well and to lead up to a new attack leading on. This isn’t just for mundane martial arts. Even forms of fighting that involve magic or supernatural elements can be instantly understood by you. It has to be Martial Arts, not just an attack spell or power that buffs the user, but you can instantly copy and understand any sort of Ki attack or special martial skill that you see. Of course, if you don’t have the necessary qualities to perform what you copy, you won’t be able to use it, but you’ll still gain a deep understanding of how the technique works.

Boosted: Just a single technique is quite small scale for you. You understand the technique and the ideas behind it, it's not hard to expand that knowledge in an instant. You don't just copy singular techniques anymore, you're able to draw out entire sets at once when you see a fighting technique. See someone perform a kick technique? You'll be able to figure out, understand and be able to expertly perform a large section of that entire fighting style just by extrapolating from that kick. You won't take in everything but anything that could be related to what you copied will appear in your mind.

935,,600,Genuine Genius,The God of High School,Lore ,"More matters in a fight then brawn or skill. Having a canny and brilliant mind can allow you to triumph over those with more power or talent then you any day of the week. In fact, you not only possess a merely brilliant mind but one that surpasses all but one other human in its ingenuity and acumen. Your only peer, Baek Seung-Chul, had learnt nine languages fluently and had mastered physics, chemistry and mathematics by age nine, adding mastery of many western and eastern philosophies by age eleven and mastering both medicine and countless forms of modern sport by age thirteen. Not only is your learning rate a match for this genius but so too is your analytical skill. You can easily pick out all the strengths and weaknesses of a martial art, just from witnessing a single serious fight involving a practitioner of it and thus develop countermeasures against that Martial Art to destroy that martial artist.

Boosted: The wise learn from their mistakes, the brilliant plan ahead to avoid mistakes before they've even made them. Your planning capability is second to none, at least in terms of how you are able to simulate almost any situation at all purely in your mind. With an above 99% accuracy, you're able to predict how almost any event will go so long as you have at least a handful or two of information about it. You'll never lose a bet on a horse race or fight unless something genuinely miraculous occurs or someone purposefully throws a fight. You can simulate long sequences of events or distant things in your mind too, greatly assisting long term planning. Who needs fortune tellers?

936,,600,A New Era of Martial Arts,The God of High School,Lore ,"And a new phase of human evolution. Through sheer effort and talent, you managed to bypass a part of the Taboo that seals Humanity’s potential away from them. This has not granted you increase power, rather it has unlocked the potential you have to grow. When it comes to training, you are tenfold the speed of any other human. Training, in this case, is not useless book learning or the memorisation of martial techniques. Training is the improvement of your physical muscles and the growth of your life energy, things which can only be improved by putting in the work, regardless of how clever one might be. With the speed at which your power now grows, the idea of reaching the level of the Gods seems far less far-fetched now.

Boosted: There's nothing like a good War to kick-start the development of new technologies. Both the sort you buy in a store and the sort you learn in a dojo. Martial Arts is every bit a science as weapons manufacturing in this respect. When a great conflict approaches or is happening around you, you'll start to train even faster. The bigger the conflict? The bigger the boost you get. A street fight with your best friend set up a week in advance? There'll be something but it won't be much. A fast approaching war with a entire world of immensely powerful Gods that will cover the entire world? You'd be stuffing years of growth into days of training.

937,,600,Key to the Cosmos,Chainsaw Man,Lore ,"A warehouse attachment that contains a pocket dimension wherein a large cylindrical library with infinite descending levels of books containing all of the knowledge in each universe you visit lies. Each Jump a new “pillar” is added (as is one for every previous Jump before this) which contains all the knowledge in that Jump’s universe. Each floor/level contains a different ‘clearance’ of books, with the first level being immediately accessible and containing only a small amount of books on surface-level common knowledge within the verse. To unlock further levels you will have to complete increasingly difficult tasks as well as know and understand the majority of knowledge contained on the previous levels. There is no way to bypass this process. The shape this library takes besides these rules is generally up to you, as anything from Victorian to empty space with books materializing when you want them is fine. The knowledge in any level you have “conquered” is within your full reach and you will never forget it regardless of outside influence or the passage of time. Furthermore, you can impose parts of or the whole of this knowledge onto those in your line of sight, eventually being able to overload minds once you’ve gathered a great amount of knowledge. Upon obtaining your Spark, you will gain a final pillar that contains information on your Benefactor, the Spark, and the Jumpchain itself as well as an access card that allows you to pass to any levels in your other pillars. However, if you fail your Chain or opt to discontinue it you will never be able to reach another level again. Who can say what kind of secrets you will find in this final and greatest pillar?"
938,,600,Time Bleed,Fate/Stay Night,Lore ,"When a being meets its future self, the two will contradict each other. This contradiction causes the lines between the timelines of each of them to blur and the past self will begin to take on the memories and skills of its future self when in each other's direct presence. An impossibly rare phenomenon...until you came along. Perhaps not as strong but nevertheless, somehow you can cause contradictions with any single being at a time. You are able to choose one being at a time to copy skills, knowledge and memories, while in that beings presence. You leech one hour of memories or skills worth for every two hours which you spend in your chosen beings presence. Active interaction, whether that be a pitched battle or intimate combat, could speed this up to triple its usual speeds. Fair warning, just knowing something doesn't necessarily mean you have the ability to use it and beings will eventually become aware of what you are doing, instantly so with physical contact. 

Boosted: Time Bleed has now grown so that your abilities in causing temporal contradictions have morphed into a way to protect yourself from such temporal anomalies. Unlike the original use of this ability, which is focused on a single other entity, the effect is now centred on you. When active, this anti- contradiction effect prevents any ability or effect relating to the manipulation of time within a range of ten metres. Attempts to slow, stop, accelerate or time travel within this range fail, even if the intended target is not you. While not directly related to time, this field also prevents certain effects from altering the relationship of cause and effect, though this only applies to effects that would swap the place in time of either cause or effect.

And a weapon has no need for petty things such as likes or dislikes or quirks. All that you needed was the ability to adapt to any situation and to understand your targets. Learning new concepts, such as skills or languages or entire cultures, is as easy as breathing to you. You did in a day what took others five, no matter the subject. And when they became jealous of your speed, it was not something you could not understand. Your incredible understanding of emotions and people letting you know what a man felt just by what his face looked like, with only the most tightly controlled being able to mask their emotions from your eyes. This attention to detail assists you in other endeavours too, from near instantly sweeping a room for anything that could be used as a weapon to picking out individuals from crowds of thousands, your skills of perception lie unmatched.

Boosted: Hollow Vessel now allows you to apply your own increased learning rate to any students you take up and, much like your own teachers trained you, you have a particular skill with teaching anything related to assassination. The empathy you gained has also increased to the point that you are able to sense the emotions of those around you, whether you can see their faces or not. Only people with enough control to prevent themselves from feeling emotion at all will be able to hide their feelings from you.

The Reod and subsequent fall of Elantris meant the near obliteration of almost all knowledge of AonDor, the glyphs that produced the city’s magical wonders. With the city in ruins and all former practitioners dead or insane, it fell to one hopeful prince to resurrect the nearly dead language of Elantrian magic. Like Raoden, you are now a luminary of all things Investiture and have a talent for uncovering lost knowledge. With just the briefest exposure to an Invested Art or other system of magic, you could begin to deduce the methods and rules that govern its use. Given proper resources, you could delve deeply into the secrets of the Cosmere. With enough time, you’ll revolutionize the magical systems you practice."

The hard drive before you has the collected research, notes and findings on every piece of technology and magic utilised by the Chaldea organisation.

One much like yourself. You have incredible natural talent in everything you do, whether that be painting or casting spells, fighting or creating artificial homunculi bodies. This natural talent not only allows you to start with a shocking amount of skill in anything you try your hand at, as if you’d already been practising for months, but it allows you to learn even more in any subject you put your mind to than any other, progressing at several times the speed of any of your peers. You could accomplish in just a month what takes other scientist’s years and move on to learn even more disciplines on top of that one. 

Boosted: The progress of science gets faster and faster as time goes on and you, as one of those at the forefront of mankind’s evolution, are no different. The more you learn, the faster you’ll learn more. The more knowledge you obtain, the easier it is to obtain more knowledge. While the exact boost to learning is relatively low, you will continue to grow faster as long as you dedicate yourself to science.

You had yourself, your own human body and whatever weapons you could find. In a world of legendary heroes and terrible monsters, the odds say you should have died. Yet here you are, having earned your spot in the ranks of mankind’s legends. How? You got so damn good that you made the mundane become magical. Your ordinary fists went so far beyond the limits of human possibility that they become weapons of legend. Your skill with a gun so awe inspiring that the World itself can’t comprehend it as not being magical. Your swordsmanship literally warping space and time to try and keep up with your skills. You’ve got no limits on how far you can take any skill and the further you take any skill, the more magical it becomes. Become a great enough master and you might even see those ordinary skills forming into Noble Phantasms in their own right.

Boosted: The items you use are now also affected by your growth. This allows them to grow better at what they do as you use them more and for greater tasks.

The equipment extracted from them is on par with some of the most advanced Workshops in the City, with all the advantages of bionics and none of the downsides, some firearms that would make the Thumb’s look like pop guns, and even weapons that attacked someone’s mind or soul directly. Now while their full power is lost alongside L Corp’s singularity, you can still make use of them by using the abnormalities’ books like you would those of random City dwellers. However due to their unstable state, you can only use their power for a short while instead of constantly like back in L Corp, and also they require charging after each use which is done by heightening your emotional tension, similar to how it was described in Emotions, Quantified. You get access to all abnormalities available within the Library(doesn’t include Great Split: Horizontal/Vertical, Pú Láo, Yá Zì, or Tāo Tiè) at its peak, as well as from any abnormalities not shown there, including yourself if you were one in L Corp. For practical terms, Light represents stamina, stagger damage reflects mental damage or concussive force, and synchronization pages wear off after 10 minutes."

But you have something better, two notebooks that fill themselves in with nine short phrases that sum up what somebody can do, to use it simply point at the desired target with a pen or other writing instrument. The phrases will be specifically about whatever the target is doing at the time, so using it in a fight will have different results than if they’re filing their taxes or something. The notebooks will also state the target’s name, affiliation, and what they’re doing when it was used on them, when the notebook is full it will erase the first half of its pages and when filled up again it will erase the latter half. If a notebook is ever destroyed or lost then it will come back to your possession in a week, though anything in it will be erased.

947,,600,Distilled Research Vial,Bibliomania,Lore ,"This is an interesting silver vial containing a marble white liquid with flecks of glowing blue, amber and crimson floating in its mostly fluid. This vial is an amazing prize since drinking it will give a short lived migraine as you gain the equivalent of 1 years dedicated research into any subject you desire as if using all the resources you could possibly access without help. Most importantly is that it takes into consideration all of your intellect perks and any information resources you have and does the research as if you have each relevant part at your fingertips so it's as if you move from book to book learning and understanding what you research as if you never stop and are flawlessly memorizing and comprehending what you study. Obviously it's better if you have access to more resources and this is amazingly useful for experimentation since you can conduct as many experiments within a year as if you always have your max amount of resources while making the most of the time as possible. Hell it even removes any normal wait times for said experiments to not waste time though you would know how long each wait would be. You gain 1 vial every month to use at your leisure."

Your mind is now shockingly advanced to the point that you could know nothing and with simple access to books teach yourself to read and within a day have not only fully memorized every book's contents you could get your hands on but completely and utterly understand all the information with full comprehension. That isn’t what makes you abnormal even with your flawless memory and frankly unreal learning rate. No, what makes your mind abnormal is how your mind can subconsciously piece together information expanding your understanding of absolutely everything you know and allow you to use your knowledge to further expand your own knowledge. With the knowledge of this world the only other person who had a mind like this was fully capable of going from a highly crippled princess to a world renown genius mage and scientist and eventually the literal source of the apocalypse. Due to this your mind is extremely rigid to the point that you could defend mental attacks from groups of world class psychics without hassle and your mind is so tough, extremely durable and dangerous things for the mind to even know simply can’t harm you unless the knowledge would damage even eldritch gods minds(memorize the necronomicon for all I care it can’t harm you just cause you know it now)."

These items would gain a host of powers from the being that was sealed away, though the ritual is costly depending on how strong said being is...perhaps you could find a use for it?"

More than that, you can’t be expected to rely on old relics or the innate power of Sacred Gears if you want to get somewhere in this world. This is a lesson you have internalized, in both body and spirit - your training in both combat and mental ability is greatly increased. You will quickly become competent and then a savant of a fighting style you focus on, and any mistakes or hardships you endure quickly become experience that gives you perfect clarity on what to avoid doing on a second encounter. Not only are you a master of growth and turnabout, but you’re especially good at passing down these skills and advancement to your peers and minions, letting them operate not in your shadow but by your side. With the right time and lessons, you can topple a foe who relied too hard on innate power with nothing but determination and cleverness in a fight."
952,,600,Just That Good ,Jujutsu Kaisen,Lore ,"In the 80s and before, the power of sorcerers and cursed spirits was roughly balanced, or perhaps tipped slightly in the favour of the latter. Then, in 1989, Satoru Gojo was born, and the balance of power was forever shifted. Some of this was due to the sorcerer possessing both the Limitless technique and Six Eyes, but that was not all. He was also a natural innovator, someone who broke the limits of what was considered possible, to the point that even the King of Curses was surprised by the things he could pull off.

While you may lack in raw power, proficiency with cursed energy is something you have in excess. You have a great understand of not just any cursed technique you might have, but all of your supernatural powers. You’re fully aware of their limits and capabilities, allowing you to push them to their limits and pull off feats with them few others would expect. Your skill is at the level that for you, the rules of any power system or ability you use seem to be that bit looser. For instance, while normally one’s cursed technique is ‘burned out’ after using a Domain Expansion, making it unusable for a good while, you’d be able to figure out a way to heal your brain and regain your technique in a fraction of the time, something considered impossible by anyone else. Similarly, while some might only be able to fire an ability in a straight line, you’d be able to figure out how to make it curve around corners or even home in on your foes, and a technique that cuts things at range could be made to cut through space itself. You won’t be able to completely change the technique or power into something else, but so long as it’s still recognisably the original and doesn’t provide a direct increase in power, it’ll probably be possible."
953,,600,Genius,Jujutsu Kaisen,Lore ,"Knowledge itself is power. Such a statement may ring hollow in a world such as this, where certain beings are born with the innate ability to directly manifest the very concept of infinity in reality in order to warp space or increase their own mass to the point that they become a black hole, but there is still some truth to it. After all, while one may have a cursed technique from birth, this does not come with mastery of it, and a bit of intelligence can go a long way in this matter.

You’ve got an incredible intellect, enough that those around you would quite rightly consider you a genius. Learning new things comes easily to you, able to figure out the basics in no time at all, and reaching mastery in far less time than most others. Even if you were completely unaware of cursed energy’s very existence, upon becoming a sorcerer it wouldn’t even take you two weeks to become equal in power to a grade 1 sorcerer, just by figuring out its rules and the best ways to use it. For context, most sorcerers sit at grade 3 and will never even reach grade 2, and those with great levels of talent would usually take many years to achieve the level of mastery of their cursed technique needed for grade 1. Your intelligence undeniably lets you push your abilities to greater heights than most, coming up with uses for your techniques that would never have occurred to others. Who knows how far you could get in a few years of practice?

Naturally, your speed of learning also applies to mundane subjects, as well as other supernatural power systems you may come into possession of."

When you and a group of people work together long enough, you will find not only do they mesh surprisingly well despite conflicting personalities or history, but their abilities all synergize with each other despite vast differences between them. But going beyond that, you will find that those who work with you for a long period of time quickly find their natural growth and experience skyrocketing considerably, as if racing to meet your own level. So long as they have the capability to, those who are less experienced, skilled, or powerful than you will quickly grow to meet you at your own level all while their teamwork abilities with each other improves in turn.

Even magical powers or biological alterations, such as gaining Divinity, are possible to achieve. While such powers do remain accessible as long as one desires, mental damage or shakeups can cause you to forget them and lose access to your choices for a few hours, though you can choose something else too. A psychic attack or a terrible migraine is all it can take to shake your hold. 

An Emperor Saber is, in almost all cases, a proud thing. Of themselves and their nation, they have the highest opinion and many will not even see a difference between the two entities. Whether they’re a saint or a tyrant, they tend to have a great deal of self love. "
956,,600,Invincible Sword,Honkai Impact 3rd,Lore ,"In all of Schicksal’s history, few have reached the heights of their ranks so much as Bianka Ataegina, codenamed “Durandal”. At the mere age of twelve, she managed to fully investigate and even absorb a bubble universe into herself, and today is considered the organisation’s strongest operative, bar none.

But despite what went on behind the scenes, the plans that surrounded her and charted her path, ultimately her greatest strength isn’t just the sheer talent she possessed, but the will to train herself even beyond what most would consider ‘normal’, or even ‘expected’. To put it bluntly, when she was expected to put in ten times the effort to reach S-Rank, she instead went for a hundred times.

You may not have a bubble universe backing you, but you have what it takes to step into the halls of history yourself. From a mere B-rank you could ascend to stand up to Durandal herself, if only for a relatively short amount of time, with only a few months of training. But where this excels is when you are truly in conflict, as your capacity for learning skyrockets past even what was possible before. Perhaps you could truly match the Invincible Sword someday.

This isn’t just combat techniques, either; literature, science, you do possess a somewhat lesser talent for just about anything a Valkyrie should know...even one that’s gone rogue for whatever reason. Hmm...something tells me she has a lot in common with another girl...

With this perk you can quickly learn new techniques that are related to a craft that you have mastered, an example would be a master blacksmith from the Nine Realms could go to Japan and just by seeing the process or analyzing a blade they could instantly understand the techniques used to create the blade and how to use them for their own works as long as the technique is below their skill level."
961,,600,The Smartest Man Alive,God Of War (2018),Lore ,"They call you the second coming of Mimir, and you have more than earned that title. Not only can you process information faster, allowing you to comprehend what is happening around you at a faster rate than most and letting you break down information at a faster rate, but you also have a great talent for teaching others lessons from events that have happened in the past. Additionally you have a great gift for coming up with rapid responses without panicking. Your king angrily demands why your advice failed him? You know just what to do that would leave you blameless and either cool his rage or at least direct it elsewhere. Finally, any world you enter you will know the true history of it, knowing who really ruled that kingdom, how that person really died, etc. The only downside is that you cannot know a being’s fatal weakness, for instance if they needed to be struck by silver under the full moon to be rendered killable you would not be able to learn of it with this perk until you yourself found the weakness."
962,,600,Grand Sorcerer ,God Of War (2018),Lore ,"You have reached the principle of Sorcerers, matching Freya and Odin in terms of knowledge if not in strength and skill. Your ability to learn new magic has been tripled and no magic is impossible for you to learn, though it can be very difficult at times. For example if it was a magic that anyone could theoretically learn, and wasn't particularly strong by itself, then you would be able to learn the basics in a matter of hours if you dedicated yourself to it, but if it was a magic that required a specific bloodline or affinity to use then you would have to spend a few weeks figuring out how to get around the requirements before you would be able to learn the magic itself. Similarly the more powerful the magic itself is the longer it would take for you to learn how to use it."
963,,600,God of War,God Of War (2018),Lore ,"You find that your combat prowess seem to grow endlessly, though they seem to grow the fastest when in combat. Whether it be your reaction time, your reflexes, your martial prowess and skill, how you use magic in fights, or even just how to dodge while making minimal movements you will always find that you can go further. Keep in mind that you grow slower if you vastly outmatch your opponents, not growing any faster than if you were training alone. If you fought your equal then your growth rate would triple and if you fought a challenge like an army or your superior in combat? Your growth would accelerate to give you the skills you need to fight on equal footing with them."
964,,600,Valkyrie Training,DxD Universe,Lore ,"Valkyrie's are kinda like angel's... But not really, what this gives you is enough power to match an experienced Valkyrie, being proficient In various fighting styles, and also equal to Rossweisse in magic, this only gives ability in asgardian magic however, so if you want to know multiple magic systems this is not the place."
965,,600,A Ton Of Swords For A Ton Of Arms,DxD Universe,Lore ,"You master equipment incredibly fast, if you picked a sword and started training you could even surprise someone like Okita Souji with how fast you grow, not only that but you always seem to discover new functions with your equipment, buying this perks with a sacred gear makes that sacred gear a subspecies."
966,,600,LOOK AT THOSE MUSCLES        ,DxD Universe,Lore ,"You are a genius, just not a normal one. It seems the more mocked you are for being weak the faster you get strong, being disowned for your family for not having a power for example could boost you enough to go from somebody in the lower-class to somebody in the middle tiers of Ultimate. This is however just a training boost, so don't think you can be lazy, better start training now."
967,,600,Rune Magic,The Song of the Nibelungs,Lore ,"Knowledge of runes and their magic. You know where to carve them and what form they should take for the desired effect. Examples include victory runes to give you luck and success in battle, runes that keep your ship safe, runes that help in childbirth, runes that make you smarter and wiser, runes that keep your ale from being poisoned or tinkered with, runes that help you influence people better and runes that help you heal sickness and mend wounds. The rune magic you have access to is wide and far, ranging from protection, swaying of luck, divination and even talking to the dead."
968,,600,The Legacy of a Magician,Witch on the Holy Night,Lore ,"At first, one might question what all the knickknacks and curios in this dusty attack are good for. These mystic codes make no sense! These grimoires and notes refer to principles alien to magecraft! But take a closer look: These are the personal effects of a Magician, the left- behind comprehensive research about how to use one of the True Magics as well as the reagents and artifacts needed to channel it as a professional magus would magecraft. It will take time and diligent study for even many of the greater mages, but with enough determination it might just be possible to unlock the power detailed here; a mediocre magus might take six or so generations to make that breakthrough. And if you know True Magic already? This trove is pretty much like having a mentor walking alongside you."
969,,600,The Eye Facing the Fear; Breaking the Cycle,Library of Ruina,Lore ,"Ah, but this has been keeping you too long, hasn’t it? You want the main draw of the Library, the appeal which draws in every poor soul destined to become a tome for cheap perusal: The very books they’ll become. 

Upon slaying a being capable of an independent existence, you may choose for them to not quite die, but for their being to become a book that lands at your feet. These books can be read to find out anything the former individual knew, though it might be a bit of a chore, allowing you to form your own grand repository of knowledge. However, perhaps more importantly (particularly for your kind), these books can be torn apart for pitiless plunder of their users’ skills. You see, hidden within each book amongst every thought and memory is the key page, a record of one's more fundamental being and passive abilities, and a smattering of combat pages representing their techniques. If you were to rip them from their bindings, you would find that they can be absorbed by yourself or those who otherwise obtain them, obtaining a facsimile of their abilities. Though, this is not to be confused with a perfect copy: You may find that those truly above you in stature may have certain limits they lacked before, or be missing their most horrifying abilities. 

But a lack of perfect mimicry can also be to your benefit: You may find, if you’re further willing to deface your new literature, that a limited number of abilities may be torn from key pages you have no intention to put into your soldiers, and combined with those you do to bolster them. Meanwhile, combat pages are generally interchangeable, though on occasion either may be so unique as to be inseparable from their original source. 

Fortunately for your Books loved ones, or perhaps your conscience, this isn’t necessarily a permanent state. While holding a book, you can revert all attributions, returning it to a clean slate, and from there you can return them to human form. Alternatively, you may fight them again to return from your past battlefield with a more comprehensive table of contents, repeating their strife to highlight new combat pages or interesting trivia. As long as the competition was a fair choice, who cares what you do with your spoils?

Boosted: Your EGO has taken upon itself the traits of a Bucket, though to be clear, not one for drawing water so much as ferrying pieces of the collective unconscious into reality in the form of Abnormalities. As you accumulate books and grow in power, your own psyche will reach out to commonalities between itself and the shelves of books you have made, creating monsters or strange objects based upon your perception, your flaws, and your virtues taken to their logical extremes. Some may even form from metaphors for particularly momentous events. Almost all of them will be monstrous and rowdy, but at least decently under your control as their originator and an effect of your ego. Perhaps your might not be able to direct the ever paranoid and watchful beast formed from a companion betraying you to not investigate anyone, but you can ensure it only goes for those you wish dead when it inevitably finds proof of them working against you, or just refuse to manifest it when you have no use for it.

These monsters can also be manifested partially, allowing invocations of their essence through your EGO to grant particular traits of them to yourself. For instance the aforementioned beast of betrayal might grant you its ever vigilant eyes, or make your attacks strike harder the more you focus on a single target. In the event you also possess Those Who Are Faithful and Trustworthy, this can be taken to an extreme, yourself and an abnormality fusing together briefly for one grand attack bringing to bear the totality of the Abnormality’s essence against your foes. Or, perhaps, a more lasting union, with enough light…?

Fittingly for the father of lies, it was far from the only project he started to destroy everything. Even the Malenbranche were made in his time, as well as several other machinations that rivaled the very own bloodline powers of the original pure blood devils. This library here is a blend of notes, instructions, and unfinished projects left by that very first devil. With this you could find a way to reproduce the powers of the devil bloodlines, or their brand of magic, you could even use it to replicate the demonic artifacts lying around hell. Of course, provided you have the right materials."

You have done well resisting this far, but here I have an offer you won’t feel like passing over. Here lies The Guide, a small book of seemingly infinite pages, it holds the ‘how to git gud’ instructions as dictated by the best in the field across history. Learn swordsmanship from Okita Souji and Lancelot du Lac, get started in magic with the advice of Odin, Ajuka, or Merlin, learn how to get swole like Strada, etc. Thinking on something you want to archive with automatically open the relevant pages. The book can’t be destroyed. It can’t be sealed. It can be stolen. It can be used by others."
972,,600,"Turn Around, Bright Eyes",HighSchool DxD,Lore ,"While the Judeo-Christian God failed to kill the Trihexa and then died like a chump, he still managed a feat that no one else could have done alone at the time. Seal that motherfucker so hard no one was able to even know about it until centuries later. While you might not be a total jobber like that guy, you might want to seal others too, so I’m going to give you this book – a comprehensive guide to sealing. With this even the most unremarkable of talentless hacks can become a verified god-tier sealing specialist in a few months. Enough that mastering the secrets of the guide would give you the same amount of skill needed to reseal Trihexa or similar beings should the need arise."
973,,600,Forbidden Lore,HighSchool DxD,Lore ,"Ah, the intelligence that goes beyond mere genius and falls into the category of a damned miracle. You realized long ago that all the phenomena and abilities that occur in this World have rules and laws in how they work. By using your superior intellect, you’re able to fill the equations that control them. This is the ‘Kankara Formula’, once the precious and exclusive magic of Ajuka, and now something that you as well possess. With it you can easily take over the magic attacks of your opponents, copy their powers, redirect them, mess with the natural occurrences of the world and more. Beyond that, you’re also his intellectual equal, and able to pull the same inventions he has created, provided you can obtain access to similar resources. Have in mind that he was the one that created the Evil Pieces and several other artifacts."
974,,600,Shifting Tactics ,Hades,Lore ,"Being dead does have a few benefits. After all, one cannot die a second time. The loss of a fight is no longer the end. And there are few that disagree with the idea that losing is always a learning experience. Combined this with the fact that, as a warrior of theHouse ofHades, you have access to most of the greatest combatants who have ever died and even the most talented of warriors could improve beyond what they thought possible.

The benefits you gain from this combination of fortunes are threefold. First, your combat abilities will never become dull simply because they are not used. A weapon as finely honed as your skills will never rust simply because it is left in its sheath for an extended period of time. Secondly, you gain a keen insight into the tactics of your opponents and are able to learn something from every bout with them. Win or lose, you will discover a new insight that will allow you to come closer to defeating them each time. Finally, should you eventually find your way back to the world of the living, some of your experience returning from death so frequently will remain with you. Once each decade, when a blow would normally strike you down, you will instead rise to stand tall and once again almost instantly. Your wounds will be healed and your vigor for battle fully restored."
975,,600,Holy Grail War Plans,Fate/Strange Fake,Lore ,"The completed notes from Prelati’s observations of the Fuyuki Holy Grail War. These, along with immense resources and a properly prepared and selected land, will allow you to create your own mockery of the Holy Grail War. From how to create your own Lesser Holy Grail and Greater Holy Grail, to how to modify some of the rules of the rituals, like allowing for more Servants to be summoned and Extra classes to join. While the knowledge is here, you probably will need the help of many experts in several areas, or just to steal from others in order to get this running on your own. However, with this alone you will likely not be able to recreate Heaven's Feel, as that is a secret closely guarded by the Einzbern. Yet, both Servant summoning and creating your own Wish Granter device are on the table.

In future jumps, you will have these plans adapted to somehow function into the land you find yourself in, provided you can fuel the huge amount of magical energy needed to start up the Holy Grail."
976,,600,The Great Detective,Fate/Strange Fake,Lore ,"In a world of living tales and closely guarded mysteries, those who are able to bring light are hated and feared regardless of their actual power. And you got the makings of one of the most feared enemies of Mystery: a detective. A genius with few peers when it comes to how quick your mind can make connections and solve problems.

Not only that, but your knowledge of myths, history, and popular culture around the world is near flawless. You carry within your mind an extensive library of tales and facts of any place you visit, a resource that you draw upon to make sense of any mystery and puzzle you encounter. And even when you visit a truly unknown place, you quickly gather a similar trove of knowledge. Your understanding of these narratives enables you to identify the threads of influence they have on the world around you, and you can weave these threads into your own investigations and deductions. If you were to be the protagonist of a mystery novel, it is almost certain that no crime that is presented to you would go unsolved.

However, this has its most potent effect in the world of Magi. Even the most arcane enigmas unravel under your gaze, and even the inner works of Magecraft can be deduced from the scantest of evidence, even when it comes to second hand tellings. Your understanding is so profound that you can dissect and dismantle the Mysteries of other magi, decreasing the value of their mysteries, and opening a path to bring them down. This makes you a formidable foe to any who would seek to oppose you with Magecraft, and a valuable ally to those who respect your abilities.

Despite potentially lacking in powerful Magecraft or boasting average magic circuits, your ability to unravel Mysteries makes you both feared and revered in the world of magus. Finally, as a detective, it also seems that you seem to be constantly attracted to the most bizarre situations, where your intellect is put to the test and new mysteries are presented to you."
977,,600,Jack of All Trades,Final Fantasy I,Lore ,"Reaching your peak just means it’s time to re-evaluate your skills and fighting style, and pick up something new along the way. Your ability to learn new skills and abilities, should you be able to in the first place, is much faster and effective. You can pick up a book on a subject you never knew about in your life, and put the book down adept in said subject. This won’t let you become a true ‘Ace’ in said abilities or skills instantly, but you’ll quickly build a foundation into the road to becoming an expert, so long as you take the time to learn more. In addition, you know how to properly use your skills and powers in conjunction with each other, creating your own personalized fighting styles or scientific practices. You can’t actually combine powers this way, but you’ll know the best way to use them in tandem and combinations should you take a little time to figure it out."

When faced with hardship or challenge, you will find yourself quickly growing in power and skill, all the better to match them. After enough time and countless challenging battles, you could claim to be the equal of those with millennia of experience.

Boosted: It is your curse to struggle endlessly, and so you shall find your potential for growth is similarly endless. There are no heights you cannot reach, no limits to how mighty you may become or how skilled you are. Your rate of improvement is simply astonishing, capable of mastering in a year what took others centuries to perfect.

From Yuuka’s mathematical prowess to Kyouki’s cryptanalytical capabilities, there is no shortage of potential paths for that intellect to manifest. For 400 CP, you’ll get an intellectual ability similar to any regular member of Seminar or a particularly smart member of the Engineering club or the Veritas hackers. Instead, for 600 CP, you could have an intellect to rival Tsukatsuki Rio, the president of Millenium, who possessed predictive abilities that were able to semi-accurately predict the future while simultaneously building a secret, futuristic fortress city without anyone catching on."

It may be the rays that have empowered you, the radioactive liquid that you drank, your inhuman genetic code, or something else entirely but your brain and body have been supercharged. You learn, grow, and master things incredibly quickly. This boost has resulted in you growing, learning, and mastering things at a hundred times the speed that it took you before. Physical techniques, knowledge, philosophy you learn anything at this speed. Don’t worry about that math test, a thirty second skim through the textbook, and you’ll get marks like you studied for about an hour. Learn something for a day and it is like you spent two months mastering it."
982,,600,Sygaldry,The Owl House,Lore ,"Every spell starts with a circle. For most Witches and Demons, the physical process ends there. But magic is woven into the very fabric of the Demon Realm, and even the most unlikely of spellcasters can tap into the magic around them. Like Luz Noceda, you have discovered this long-lost form of magic. By drawing a complete spell circle and its accompanying runes on a surface, you can create constructs of elemental magic. The bigger the circle, the bigger the effect.

Unlike the typical spells used by modern Witches and Demons, Sygaldry draws on the magical energy in the environment, not the caster. This allows anyone to perform magic so long as they know the proper glyphs and enough energy exists in their immediate environment. This does mean that Sygaldry will fail in the Human World, where there is no ambient magic.

You start out knowing two of the basic glyphs, allowing you to produce simple constructs made of two of the following elements: light, ice, plants, and fire. You can discover the remaining two basic glyphs by observing your natural surroundings, and different combinations of these glyphs can be linked to create complex effects. A few weeks of experimentation might let you create a cloud of mist with paired fire and ice glyphs, but study long enough and complex effects like invisibility and even teleportation can be achieved.

This is not the simple finger waving of modern Witches and Demons. This is a more complex and difficult way, but it may be all you have. Even still, there’s lots of potential here for eager and creative minds.

To use Sygaldry, ambient magic must be an explicitly stated quality of your current world or dimension. For example, Roshar of the Stormlight Archives, both the Mortal and Spirit Realms of the Dresden Files setting, and Mekka of Twokinds all have magic that exists in the environment before being drawn in and used by spellcasters. Sygaldry would not function in settings where magic is an innate ability, such as the Wizarding World of Harry Potter or any other world where magic is something you’re born with. You can bypass this restriction by packaging your runes with a “battery” or attached magical power supply, but this will require some experimentation."
983,,600,Illuminating,The Owl House,Lore ,"The Demon Realm is a magical place, and thanks to the efforts of a certain authority figure, not even the finest witches know all the secrets their magic holds. Maybe all they need is an outside perspective. You have an inquisitive mind perfectly suited to deciphering the intricacies of the magic that surrounds you. Your research could set new limits on what your coven is capable of, or even uncover the root source of magic on the Boiling Isles. In future worlds, you’ll decode new systems of magic with similar ease. If there really is a way for humans to use magic, your curiosity ensures that you’ll be the one to uncover it."
984,,600,Grand Archives,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Lore ,"After the war with the Ancient Dragons, the Lord of Sunlight would give the pale drake many gifts for his service, most prominently being dukedom and the ownership of the Grand Archives, a structure that you now claim as your own. This massive library is a repository of a large array of knowledge, from natural sciences to the arcane. It currently houses all the knowledge that Seath would have accumulated right before the Chosen Undead made their way to him, but that is not the end. For each world you visit, and have already visited, the library will gain new sections and new books containing all known magical lore from the world in question."
985,,600,Chosen Undead,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Lore ,"In a time yet to come, a certain undead would fulfill an ancient prophecy, but it would raise a certain question; did they succeed because they were always meant to be the Chosen Undead, or did they become chosen because they managed to succeed? Regardless as to the specifics, you share a few similarities with that future figure, namely in your incredible luck, as well as the ability to quickly learn and master any skills you try your hand at. You could go from a novice to a master swordsman in a fraction of the time typically needed.

Boosted: Though the world may appear harsh and uncaring towards one lone soul in the dark, you are undeniably the lord of both yourself, and of your own fate. Events seem to line up perfectly for you, always giving you a way to succeed or bypass some challenge, all the while granting you mighty rewards for your efforts. The potential of the Dark is also manifested perfectly within you, as you are capable of improving both yourself and all of your skills and abilities without limit.

To Millenium, the discovery of Wilhelmina Harker’s skeleton was this latchkey. Using the bones of Dracula’s wife, they were able to reverse engineer and eventually mass-produce Vampirism. Maybe you receive a copy of this remarkable find, or something equally monumental. Whatever artifact you choose, you will have priceless opportunities to uncover powerful secrets using this strange and singular discovery. With careful research and enough brilliance, who knows what you could accomplish. At the start of each future jump, you will receive an equally invaluable and nightmarish source of knowledge, allowing similar chances for innovation and discovery."

Some say it was through occult magics, others the grace of God, his later family might suggest he was simply that skilled a monster hunter. Perhaps the truth is in the middle, as you share these traits and more. Though your skills in combat elsewhere may be negligible, you are a monster slayer with few limitations. Tracking and hunting down even the most magically protected creatures becomes as easy as hunting wounded deer in the snow, their defences and guardians prove weak and falter against your advance. Your knowledge of the occult represents a comprehensive study of all the creatures of myth, magic and darkness. Not only do you become aware of the strengths, weaknesses and best strategies to battle monsters here, it becomes simple to gather such knowledge in future worlds on anything known as a ‘monster’. 

Through a mixture of skills, charisma and often incredible luck, you find yourself easily gathering the tools and allies needed to help you take on the monster you currently hunt. And this good fortune is only magnified during the final battle itself, with you and your allies able to conquer over what should be impossible odds. A small group of well educated and well armed humans laying low the No-Life King, for example."

Eventually he succeeded and recorded his findings in a diary for future explorers. This gem-encrusted journal is a copy of the very same, which followed diligently, will lead you to Poseidon’s Tomb. Should you ever reach the Tomb, you will find that the ruby embedded in the cover is key to acquiring the Trident, so be sure not to lose it. For each jump you visit after this, you will discover a similar set of notes in your possessions.

Notes, private journals, and articles, just about the only thing that can’t be found here is information which is inherently useful or supernatural, such as maps to hidden treasure or books containing magical rituals. It still has everything you’d need to start investigating such things, and though not all of this information is perfectly accurate, a small grain of truth can be found in any that you care to read. This collection will update in future worlds to include copies of any information regarding myths, urban legends, mysteries, cryptids and anything else of similar flavor that’s even slightly true. The only condition is that “private” and “secret” information must be in circulation somewhere around the world. Nothing found in these halls will have been actively guarded or hidden."

Furthermore, if you did purchase the Magic Perk, you start on par with a 15 year old Justin, and are skilled at combining magic, and science."
992,,600,Can’t Make A Bomb Without Oregano,Atlantis - The Lost Empire,Lore ,"It’s not enough to just be knowledgeable, or to just be good with your hands- anyone could be one or the other, but it takes someone with true talent to apply their mind and body towards their craft; not just to build on what others have taught them, but to make their own discoveries and inventions in the pursuit of greater mastery. You are one such person- you might not be a “genius” as far as most university professors would call it, but you are certainly one of the better engineers and inventors that this world has to offer. Your talents truly shine when you are working on something that belongs to a field you are truly passionate about- take Gaetan ""Mole"" Molière, for instance, who had patents on over 59 independent mining and excavation related tools or vehicles before he reached his forty years of age, having started his tinkering at the ripe age of fifteen. Not only that, but his works were truly beyond his time- microscopic goggles that could see germs and burrowing machines capable of digging through volcanic rock among them. So long as you hold the same passion for your work as he does for dirt, you’ll find that breakthroughs and inventions that beggar belief are well within your area of expertise. "
993,,600,You And That Little Book,Atlantis - The Lost Empire,Lore ,"Like a sponge, a person absorbs knowledge over the course of their life. You’d think that an ordinary person would be at a distinct disadvantage when compared to an Atlantean, who has had hundreds or even thousands of years to learn and grow. But then again, considering Atlantis’s current state you’d be wrong- but it helps that the rate at which you learn is, frankly, astonishing. Furthermore, you have a habit of stumbling upon lost or forbidden knowledge- the stuff of cultures long since past, or even the secrets that their own people have forgotten about. Knowledge of the esoteric, the scientifically advanced, and the magical all seem to end up in your hands at one point or another. Finally, you find it much easier to disseminate this knowledge to others- a quick demonstration of how to control a vehicle is enough to make someone who’s never driven before a passable pilot, and a few months could see you rebuilding an entire civilization from the ground up; elevating them from a tribal society to one with a much more modern culture."
994,,600,Trainer of Heroes,Disney’s Hercules,Lore ,"Not for you to take the center-stage in smiting monsters and rescuing damsels. Rather, your skills lie more in what comes before. You are a truly unbelievably skilled teacher and trainer of people. You have a grasp on the finer point of the art of passing information on to other people that would be the envy of even the likes of Philoctetes and Chiron, let alone ordinary teachers.

Any subject, skill, technique or ability you know, you know how to teach to others several times as fast as normally possible, to the extent that you can cover decades worth of material in months, years at the most.

The curious part about this is that this is not limited to things that can conventionally be taught. Even techniques or abilities that require specific biological or magical factors can be taught thus, as you can pass on inferior copies of your own abilities to your students. It takes time for them for these copies to grow into proper abilities and potential, but it happens far more quickly than one would think."
995,,600,Zero to Hero,Disney Villains Victorious,Lore ,"What it takes to be a real hero is to stare danger in the face, grin with a fire in your eyes and come out on top. You’ve got an amazing potential in any skill you can pick up normally, as a sword swinger and fighter your name can go down in legend, as a wizard you could be a peer with Yen Sid and Merlin...all it takes is a little pressure and heat to turn you into a diamond. With training, dedication and overcoming hardship you basically can go from a somewhat scrawny nobody to a herculean force to be reckoned with in record time, especially when you’re put in fly or die situations...just don’t forget that the latter bit is on the table if you’re too reckless.

Of course, you must actually experience these moments of epiphany and actively demonstrate them in that moment to gain any benefit. They’re not limited to moral lessons, either - Machiavellian experiences are available for you villainous or pragmatic types. A show of hypocrisy or weakness after the fact won’t take your skills away...but it is a poor practice to play with your own heart like that, you know?"
996,,600,Someday Out of the Blue,Disney Villains Victorious,Lore ,"I guess ‘ol Aesop was on to something, huh? It’s about the journey, not the destination. The lessons and morals you internalize from the stories of your own travels are more important than locking yourself in your room and practicing the same sword swings. When you complete a significant personal objective, you will have an opportunity to internalize a new ‘moral’ or ‘lesson’ the experience had taught you the same way you would training and mundane experience. Simple things or techniques like ‘stick ‘em with the pointy end’ or ‘keep a cool head’ will make you just a bit better at something, while grand lessons like ‘friendship is worth more than power’ or ‘being a leader isn’t about doing what you want, but what your people need’ will see a meteoric rise in your skills or abilities that have room for growth - especially skills relevant to that lesson or the moment it is called for."

998,,600,Exterminate,Symphogear,Lore ,"From Alca-Noise to Autoscorers, Chrysopoeia to Faust Robes, memory combustion to Philosopher Stones, and philosophical weapons to world dissection, alchemy sure is a large field of study. WIth this perk, you can take on a combination of knowledge and genius to rival Carol herself. Even as you face the gods themselves, do not let them underestimate your alchemy."
999,,600,Sorcerer Supreme,Dial,Lore ,"With this perk, you attain the powers of the Sorcerer Supreme, just like Doctor Strange. You gain access to an extensive array of mystical abilities and spells, allowing you to manipulate the fundamental forces of the universe. You can conjure magical shields for protection, project energy blasts, manipulate matter and energy, and even bend reality to your will. Your mastery over the mystic arts grants you the ability to traverse dimensions, communicate with otherworldly beings, and tap into ancient sources of magical energy. Your knowledge of spells and enchantments allows you to heal injuries, ward off supernatural threats, and manipulate time and space. With the powers of the Sorcerer Supreme, you become a formidable sorcerer, capable of wielding the very fabric of reality to defend the world from mystical threats."

1001,,600,Tomes of Power,Marvel Cinematic Universe - Volume 3,Lore ,"In all of time and space, two tomes inspire fear beyond even the gods themselves. The first, the Darkhold, is by far the best known. Containing profane information compared to blasting the universe’s deepest thoughts into a reader’s unsuspecting eyes, the countless spells and formulae within also translate to building machines that can harness energy from other worlds-or even coding. Horrifically corruptive, it’s malign influence can even drive artificial beings to evil while inflicting even signs of physical taint-and yet it’s addictive properties are not completely unfounded, for on top of everything the books serves as such a powerful amplifier for magical spells that a normal witch could briefly stand against the Scarlet Witch herself. As an example, the secret of dreamwalking (possessing an alternate universe variant) as well as forcibly taming and binding the souls of the damned who would punish such an act is gainable through mystic mastery of the Darkhold. While that same Scarlet Witch could use the tome as a focus to summon powerful demonic minions and unleash her full potential rapidly-even destroying every version of a target across the multiverse. By purchasing the Darkhold here, it will be bonded to you as it was to the Scarlet Witch-still heavily tempting, but no longer to the point of distorting you in ways you do not wish to be or driving you to self-destruction. Woe unto others who dare tamper with it’s pages.

The other tome is the Book of the Vishanti. Of it, only two things are known: It is the antithesis of the Darkhold, and it can grant a sorcerer anything they need to defeat a specific enemy-at least, a specific enemy from this universe. Assuming the sorcerer has time to read it and discover the answer, at least.

1002,,600,"They’re Two Completely Different Powers, Actually",Loki,Lore ,"You’re no petty sorcerer messing with powers you don’t understand, you were actually paying attention when you were being taught. You have extensive knowledge of magic and can very easily explain even the most complex features of it to even the dullest and least interested audience. Though this is more if an in-depth academic understanding than genuine skill at doing it, you will quickly be able to understand even unfamiliar other forms of magic through brief observation or explanation. Even if you have no interest in being a teacher or scholar this could be useful for the ambitious. After all, understanding something is the first step to being able to manipulate it...

Boosted: Technicalities are wonderful when they’re on your side. For example, while being within the TVA supposedly supresses the use of any magical powers, preventing the use of illusions, conjuration, magical blasts or mind control through magical means, it doesn’t seem to universally remove or negate effects that were put in place outside of the TVA and brought inside. Otherwise, a Frost Giant that took on the appearance of an Asgardian while outside of the TVA would shift back to their natural form when taken inside the TVA. You’ll find that there will always be similar ways around effects that would supress or otherwise affect you or a power you have, such as being able to use something that’s technically not magic despite being very similar when magic is being blocked, or just creating a passive magical effect outside the anti-magic area and being able to retain it while inside. Perhaps you could even find a way to use a magical effect inside yourself and thus not technically within the area that the effect is prevented from working in. Unless the preventative effect was specifically put in place to stop what you’re doing and covers every conceivable approach to using it, you’re bound to find a way around it.

1003,,600,Darkhold,Marvel Midnight Suns,Lore ,"Created by Cthon this book is the greatest literary piece on dark magic for this world. The item is the complete book including the Parchment of Power. Usually, it would be highly corruptible but as you are paying CP you could read the thing cover to cover and be totally sane. There is an untold number of spells within its pages based on sacrifice, offence and control."
1004,,600,Lost Library of Cagliostro,Marvel: What If...?,Lore ,"Any Master of the Mystic Arts understands that the true gateway to power is knowledge. It is for this reason that the wise Cagliostro hid his library away from the world. Thankfully, you have a backdoor key. Protected by magical enchantments that gave even Dr. Strange pause, this library contains hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of books on the arcane arts. Even forbidden tomes and texts thought lost to time are all protected within this expansive stone structure. From now on, you may access the library at any time, conjuring a doorway to the mysterious jungle that hides this place from prying eyes. Even as you travel to future worlds the library will expand, allowing you to find all manner of magical texts and literature here."
1005,,600,ONE SECOND HAS PASSED,Helltaker,Lore ,"When in a situation that requires careful planning or is any kind of Puzzle, you get an infinite amount of time to think. Be careful though, if ‘playing’ against someone, they also get infinite time to think their actions through. This can be turned on/off at will."
1006,,600,Darkhold,Dr Strange Multiverse of Madness,Lore ,"The Darkhold, also known as the Book of Sins, was a book of spells created by Chthon the First Demon. This book has two main powers. First the book is said to contain infinite knowledge. Spells, formula, advanced technology and numerous other examples of invaluable knowledge are within this book. Second, the book amplifies the user's magic. While using the book Scarlet Witch was capable of easily overpowering Strange and a number of other sorcerers at the same time. Since you are paying CP for this you will be immune to its corruptive effects and gain access to the entirety of its knowledge as soon as you acquire it. You may also gain a third eye like Dr. Strange to represent the boosted power you have obtained."
1007,,600,Book of Vishanti ,Dr Strange Multiverse of Madness,Lore ,"The Book of Vishanti, known as the antithesis of the Darkhold, was an ancient book of knowledge and power that could be used by sorcerers. The book is supposedly capable of granting anything that is needed to defeat their foes. Little is known of the book's exact capabilities. We were however told that the book was used to stop an incursion between two universes. The book was capable of allowing Dr. Strange to resist Wanda’s magic while he possessed as well."
1008,,600,Master of the Mystic Arts,Dr Strange Multiverse of Madness,Lore ,The depths of magic are truly limitless and we have only seen a fraction of what this world is capable of. This perk makes you a true master of the mystical arts. You become a Sorcerer on par with Dr. Strange and the Ancient One. The amount of beings that surpass you in the mystical arts can be counted on one hand. This also boosts your talent in all magical fields. You could go from a complete novice in a field to a master in only a few months. Should you have a qualified teacher and ready sources of knowledge this time could be greatly shortened.
1009,,600,Top Ten Brains,Avengers Vs X-Men,Lore ,"Right up there with the top ten now, aren’t you? You’ve become so smart that all the guys obsessed with such lists put you on the top ten smartest people on Earth list. It’s possible that the list guys are just your new peers. Whatever the case, you’re a bonafide genius now and there’s very few that can really hope to match up. You’ve got the raw intelligence, creativity and adaptability to keep pace with Stark, Parker and Banner as well as the very broad knowledge base expected of a super smart superhero or supervillain. You don’t know everything these smart guys know but you are extremely well versed in most sciences and academic areas, with a speciality in one field of your choice, from radiation to robotics to a more supernatural study like magic or cosmic energy."

All of your abilities are at the level of someone with decades of experience in that ability. You also have a complete and total knowledge and understanding of your capabilities and how to leverage them to their maximum capacity, especially when using them in tandem. You know how to use any allies or minions to their fullest and tend to know the capabilities of all of your enemies. As an added bonus, every person knows your name as one they should be afraid of if you so choose."
1011,,600,Supreme Mind,Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Lore ,"Your mind is one of the greatest in the world; like a super computer in its ability to process and store information. This means you have perfect memory, down to the minutest details, as well as a greater ability to process information on the fly. Your enhanced mind gives near instantaneous calculative abilities, as well as greatly increased resistance to unwanted mental effects, such as mind control, insanity, and memory alteration. Furthermore, your mind has infinite “memory”, as well as the ability to handle having infinite memory without being detrimental to your health. Finally, you can remove unwanted memories and information, in case you want to do some spring cleaning or remove potentially hazardous information."

From math to magic, you have the know-how to pass on pretty much any knowledge or skill that you’ve learned to others. It’ll take longer the more complex the subject is, but given enough time you can bring just about anyone up to your level of experience. "
1013,,600,Innovative,Avatar: The Last Airbender,Lore ,"You're a true genius, the kind who can launch an industrial revolution single-handedly. You can easily come up with fantastic new concepts for solving almost any problem, and adapt existing ideas you've come up with to work using any resources available. While you might not be able to make a steam engine with stone age tools, that'll only be a problem for as long as it takes you to design the tools you need - which won't be long. This mindset isn't just limited to technology, either - you'll come up with novel strategies, fighting styles, and Bending moves just as easily."
1014,,600,Summoning Handbook,Fate/Zero,Lore ,"This small handbook is a lot more valuable than it might immediately appear to be. Wrapped in human skin, and rather smelly because of it, this book describes a wide variety of summoning rituals and the methods and components needed to perform them. From various imps, ghouls and familiars, to the details for the Servant summoning ritual for sue during a Grail War, to even theoretical research on how to summon a True Demon, though there are no details on binding or control methods in this book. It will update in future jumps to detail new summoning rituals. This can be imported into."
1015,,600,A Purpose or Lack Thereof   ,Fate/Zero,Lore ,"To some, the reason children learn so much faster than adults is that they have not yet experienced life, being like empty books to ascribe knowledge onto. Whilst you are no longer a child, you have an emptiness within you. The only thing that fills this empty space is knowledge. With this ability, you may focus it on one subject at a time. A particular style of combat or magecraft, a single discipline of academia or a single sport are examples of such subjects. You learn this subject in a tenth the time you would normally take to do so, racing through all the stages of skill and knowledge involved with it. However, just as you reach the verge of mastery, this chosen skill will become unaffected by this ability, leaving you to choose another target. The void within you desires purpose, but it is flighty and will seek variety, even if you desire otherwise.

Boosted: The purpose you have found is not limited to one subject. Rather, it is knowledge itself. Whilst the increased learning speed will still leave you just before you reach mastery in any skill or knowledge field, you are no longer limited to one specific task or area at a time.

1016,,600,Library of Knowledge ,Toaruverse,Lore ,Having a library full of topics from mundane books to magic books of eldritch knowledge would be awesome but would be a hassle to protect and relocate. With this you gain the power of a certain index giving you an encyclopedic knowledge of all one hundred three thousand magic books of eldritch knowledge along with perfect indexing of your memories and knowledge that gives you perfect memory and allows you to retrieve information from your mind easily. You also gain a sub-consciousness that analyzes and gathers information or data that you encounter from all of your five senses and when you encounter problems or questions your consciousness would cross reference it from your knowledge and memories and give you the right answer with frightening accuracy. The resistance that you have for mental poisoning even from the grimoires have increased massively that mental poisoning from the grimoires are now negligible or a minor annoyance and the same can be said when facing eldritch horrors. This also makes you resistant to insanity giving creatures and events. This encyclopedic knowledge also updates every jump giving you the knowledge and information from all magic and science related books ever existed no matter how rare or one of a kind it is.
1017,,600,Shorthand ,A Certain Magical Index,Lore ,"You can now create temporary, small, and imperfect grimoires with your knowledge of astrology by mixing the different symbols and colours of the four elements onto a sheet of paper. Despite the fact that no knowledge can be passed on with this method, it allows you to store and create a vast variety of spells of different levels of complexity. By writing symbols down in different ink colours and in different angles, you can create spells that range from repelling bystanders, fireballs, blades coming out from the ground, communication, or even counter attacking a person when he uses magic nearly instantaneously. However, you do need to bite down on the sheet of paper to activate the spell, and the spells disintegrate after an hour (less if your handwriting sucks, more if you have great penmanship). Nevertheless, being able to cast spells that would ordinarily require anything from long, large rituals, many magic circles, or a simple incantation at a bite is pretty damn amazing. Hope you can write fast and see threats coming. This technique is not found in any grimoire."
1018,,600,Index,A Certain Magical Index,Lore ,"What people might start calling you very soon. You have a memory on par with that of a Certain Magical Index. In other words, you have a perfect memory, total recall, and extremely efficient memory indexing. Your analytical skills are also increased to boot, helping you use your knowledge a lot better. In addition, you have a vastly increased resistance to mental poisoning, and nigh- complete immunity to the form of mental poisoning a grimoire uses. A grimoire, or even 103,000 of them, won’t poison your mind any more, though reading that many grimoires will still be bad for your sanity unless you spread your reading out. However, you’d still be hard pressed to defend an assault from, say, a monster from the Cthulu Mythos or a Greater Daemon of Slaanesh, and even a perfect memory can be deceived. Still, it might be time to go on a quest as you “gotta [read] ‘em all”!"
1019,,600,Knowledge Through Disintegration,League of Legends,Lore,"The best way to figure out how something works is to take it apart and look at it that way. The most efficient way to do this? Magic, of course! You gain a magical ability to disintegrate objects, machinery, and living beings in order to figure out how they work. You cannot glean the contents of an information-storage medium (such as a book, a USB, or a human brain) by disintegrating it, but you can learn how it works and possibly how to recreate it. This ability is difficult to use in combat- Your disintegration magic requires concentration and time to use most effectively, and using it with haste will not let you learn nearly as much information as if you'd spent the time to examine your subject properly. Bust enough heads, though, and I'm sure you'll get the jist eventually."
1020,,600,In the Air Tonight,Super Dragon Sword,Lore,"It is not enough to hunt alone. The world must change if it wishes freedom: A change you can herald. You may spend a week giving someone your full attention to induct a person as a Godhunter, granting them the “Will of One”, “Keep Quiet”, “No Easy Way Out”, and “Light up the Night” perks. They do not start with a Job Stone, but may use yours to learn Jobs you know."
1021,,600,Some Kind of Prodigy ,Ben 10,Lore,"Unlike some blockheads in the world, you understand how important it is to use your brain and learn things without just throwing yourself at a problem and thinking things will things work out. While you’re not necessarily a super genius like Azmuth or one of those mad science types, what you are is an incredibly fast learner when it comes to things using your noggin. You can pick up and breeze through college level textbooks at age ten and only go up from there, quickly memorizing and internalizing any information you wish with photographic clarity. That’s not the only thing, however! If you start learning a supernatural ability that depends on things like study, knowledge, formulas...like magic, for instance, you pick it up like a pro. You could go from an ordinary bookworm to a capable sorcerer in just a few days. Who knows what you could do with a few years?"
1022,,600,Library Dweller ,Dracula Untold,Lore,"​Ancient scrolls and books are your bread and butter. You have tremendous skill when it comes to ferreting out ancient information, or even information that was deliberately hidden. You are a top-notch researcher, eminently capable of digging up even the most obscure lore or stories. Whenever faced with something you don’t know, you get a sort of instinct as to where you should look, and these pay off just about every time. Not only can you look up the details of even the most obscure, rare monsters, you can also dig up details of how to fight them, or contain them so they become harmless. Finally, you can also extend this research to any and all kinds of information. You’re an expert investigator, and you could find long-lost magical or scientific knowledge that others have been looking for centuries in days."
1023,,600,Quick Learning,Dracula Untold,Lore,"When thrown in an entirely new situation, with strange powers and abilities, damaging and painful limits and problems, most would be lost. Not you, though. You can surprisingly always land at your feet in such situations, and more, you are always able to figure out the details of any and all powers and abilities you have at a truly unbelievable pace. The speed at which you learn to control them, to find new and powerful uses for existing things, or to recombine them in incredible ways is easily an order of magnitude faster than anyone else, if not more."
1024,,600,Denarian,Dresden Files,Lore,"Oh boy. Where did you find one of these? ‘This’, in question, being the coin of a Denarian. But as if that wasn’t rare enough, this is rather more than that. While unlikely to be any more moral or righteous than their fellows, this Denarian is utterly unique in that they don’t want you to fall to the Hells and/or be their puppet. Instead, they’re content to be an impossibly knowledgeable advisor, sounding board and teacher, while letting you go about doing whatever you want entirely free of their influence. It seems like they’re giddy with the opportunity to actually get out of this universe with you at the end of this jump. For those not in the know, this is one of the Fallen Angels trapped in the Thirty pieces of Silver paid to Judas, a member of the Order of the Blackened Denarius. A being quite literally as old as the universe, the depth and breadth of what they know is beyond mortal (and most immortals') comprehension. And this isn’t one of the rank and file either, the Angel this coin holds is second only to Anduriel in terms of power and knowledge, not to mention having their own unique power that you get to define, that’s on the same level as being able to use any shadow in the world as a listening device. Any shadow, but not every shadow, mind you. An important difference. Alternatively, you can have them be any of the other angels you’re partial to… for whatever asinine reasons it might be. They do become a true ally in all the ways mentioned above."
1025,,600,Archive,Dresden Files,Lore,"One of the most powerful beings in this world, for all that she’s a small child right now, is the latest of a long bloodline of women who have the power to know, instinctively and completely, every piece of knowledge and wisdom in the world. That’s a power you now have, too. You have access to... well, a Mental Archive that holds a real time, self-updating record of every single thing ever put to text, typed into a word processor, or otherwise documented/known. Every book, every homework assignment, every scrawl on every wall, the whole shebang. All that is now at your fingertips. Naturally, the magical knowledge this gives you is just about limitless, but more than that it makes you privy to a lot of immensely dangerous secrets. So much so that this perk comes with a bundled-in immunity to all Memetic threats and a ‘below the radar’ effect that makes it so you don’t count in any magical reckoning of such, so you won’t be dooming yourself and the world just by knowing some of this stuff. But seriously, the Archive is the lynchpin of a war against monsters sneaking into reality to destroy it, and unlike her you have no neutrality obligations. Do be careful. In future jumps this naturally updates accordingly. "
1026,,600,Eternal Memories ,Dark Souls 2,Lore,"“The Curse, it afflicts all undead. It hangs over them as something more maliciously terrifying than death itself, as death cannot take them. Worse yet, they lose themselves, piece by piece until their old identity is gone, nothing but a hollow corpse remaining. You no longer have the flaw of ‘accidentally forgetting’ anything. If you desire to remember something, it will never leave your mind again. This even extends to memories of exactly how you felt when a specific thought crossed your mind, or a special moment happened. If you wish to relive the invigoration or sorrow of some past experience, it is simply a whim away. Your mastery over remembering is not excluded to your own memories however. Find something of meaning, the corpse of someone or something with unfinished business, relics of someone who left an impact on many. Once you have, you gain the capacity to travel into such memories, rather, the ages where those memories represent. Although the past can’t be changed, your walk through memory lane isn’t a fabrication. It really is as if you’re physically incarnating in those eras for a fleeting time, and what you do there can be brought back with you. Even if that’s stealing the soul of a giant, or falling to one’s hand.”"
1027,,600,“Willing Pawn” ,Dark Souls 1,Lore,"It is a sad truth known to few, but there is no such thing as a Chosen Undead. In fact, all these prophecies, trials and tribulations testing the undead and leading them to linking the flame are the machinations of a Primordial Serpent and abandoned God. So what though? Following their lead, while abhorrently perilous, freed you, showed the way to great power, knowledge, treasures, experiences and ultimately left you with the ability to undermine them in spectacular fashion. By purchasing this perk, you now fit snugly into massive schemes laid out by others that’ll deliver you to all sorts of advantageous or dangerous places and events in a swirling storm of activity. You are an incredibly important peace to the plan that needs to be prepared after all. You have a sense of when this has started and what path you’re being guided towards. This allows you to decide in the moment whether you want to go with the flow as a ram on rails, or diverge from the path set before you to potentially ruin the carefully laid plans of mice and men. If taken with Backstabbing Bastard, you’ll be especially adept at figuring out how to overturn the incredibly complex plots that surround you to destroy them and the ones who were plotting in grand, spectacular fashion."
1028,,600,Sword Saint ,Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,Lore,"Ashina Isshin had retaken this realm for the sake of his family and for the sake of the land. It wasn’t all simply for the sake of the fight, even if he enjoyed it immensely. But as the years waned, Isshin had grown old, like any human. When he finally retired his blade to allow his grandson to take over, a new sword saint had emerged, and that saint was you. You are this generation’s newest sword saint. You have ridden across the lands, conquered the battlefield, and left behind no one but the slain. A testament to your swordsmanship said to be divinely gifted. Perhaps you even rode with Isshin himself, or was mentored by him, but regardless, you are now unparalleled under the heavens with no equal except for Isshin in his prime, or another sword saint."
1029,,600,Command Tower,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Lore,"The Tower has a special place in the Wilds, a powerful symbol of expertise in magic and the arcane. This forgotten wizard’s tower is filled with all manner of secrets and knowledge, giving laboratories andarchives to study and learn the magics of “Seasonal Spellcraft”, “Witch’s Vengeance”, “Frogify”, and “Hypnotic Sprite”...though it would take a brilliant mind unto an Archmage to break the ciphers and wards on all this knowledge. Beyond that, it is a magically protected tower that holds all that is needed to plumb the Arcane."
1030,,600,Arcane Signet,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Lore,"Once a simple drop of water, it became something much greater due to the power of the Magic Mirror. This signet ring has an echo of the Mirror’s power, giving it a nascent intelligence that can perfectly recall and even create knowledge through induction and deduction...a brilliant keen mind that only asks for more data to gain further wisdom. In addition, the Signet is capable of creating Mirrormade constructs, using mana to ‘mimic’ spells and creatures it sees, though the verisimilitude of these constructs requires more mana to ensure they’re good copies - mana it can gather over time from the ambient energy of the land around you."
1031,,600,Perfection Through Logic,MtG - New Phyrexia,Lore ,"You’ve attained perfection as part of the eternal process of improvement, understanding it not as a goal in itself, but as part of the greater picture. Your mind has been improved greatly, granting you photographic memory and perfect recall, ensuring that nothing you see will vanish from your mind when you need it the most. Your capacity for calculation has likewise been improved, becoming able to perform even the most complex of equations in the blink of an eye. The effects of “Research Matters”, if you have it, have likewise been boosted, your ability to combine fields of research normally considered opposite or incompatible into working creations, and having the end result benefit from the strong points of each, while reducing the drawbacks that come with them- You could animate a corpse with power stolen from angels, use pyromancy to steal heat from devices and keep them cooled- the applications limited only by your knowledge and creativity."
1032,,600,Teachings From A Golden Tail ,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Lore ,"Though the respect for the land and its creatures that a druid ought to hold is something of a dying dream in the eyes of many, that doesn’t mean it’s entirely gone. And the proof of that lies with you, for you remember the days before the Futurists even existed. And yes, that does make you rather absurdly old. So old in fact that you might even have been trained by Golden-Tail himself, whose teachings define what it is to be a Samurai to this day. This would mean that you are perfectly competent in their arts, and would likely be offered a job in a heartbeat for your sheer skill, able to not only cut with a sword, but heal with one as well. Of course, by that same metric you possess an excess of talent in all arts, not just those of the Monk or the Samurai, and could very likely get such an offer from almost anyone. Lastly, you have begun to transcend your mortality by becoming just as much the idea of yourself as you are flesh and blood. This has weaknesses, but removes any such concerns as “old age” or growing weaker as you do."
1033,,600,To Take And Never Give ,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Lore ,"The Reckoners are not a Ninja clan, though one of their more powerful and well connected leaders is the scion of one. And so, it seems, are you. In fact, not only are you a scion of one such clan, but a prodigy of their arts as well - you can easily teach someone a handful of disguise and stealth techniques inside of a couple of hours, or perhaps a bit longer for a more personalized set of spells that will culminate in the highly useful Ninjutsu. Given even a few days of effort, you could stand a very real chance of teaching each and every member of your particular branch of The Reckoners - or Saiba, or even Jukai, what do I know? - the basic skill set of a Ninja. But of course, it doesn’t end there. These techniques are poisoned in a way, forcing their users to tithe a small portion of their magical energy to you. Not enough to power anything special, and often stripped of their color, but the nature of that energy as something that you have stolen means that it works quite nicely with a specific set of techniques. Ones that you, as a prodigy, also happen to know. Isn’t it funny how things work out like that?"
1034,,600,What Dreams Are Made From,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Lore ,"A scientist's greatest dream should be to make something new. Not a better version of something that exists, a bigger mech to replace a smaller one, a energy sword to replace a steel one, but something properly new that has never been seen before. To that end, I offer you two boons. The first is a simple and yet absurd amount of knowledge on everything Otawara has to offer, which is itself an impressive amount. Everything from spells made from code, code made from spells, mechs and robots aplenty, and far more can be found here. The second is not so impressive, but infinitely more valuable - an opportunity. There are more wonders in Kamigawa than can be dreamed of, and beyond the Blind Eternities there are even more. You now have a talent, a tendency, the stroke of luck needed to stumble across things not of this world. Perhaps a scientist from another plane will approach you with an offer… or perhaps a madman from another plane will kidnap you for your resources. It will be something of a balancing act, but the rewards are more than worth the risk."
1035,,600,Seedguide Sage ,MtG - Lorwyn,Lore ,"Treefolk are born from seeds and grow into mundane trees, but some of these trees awaken into sentient, mobile treefolk through a process called the Rising. As a sage of the treefolk, you are a master seedguide. One of those treefolk elders who prepare the seedlings, tend to the saplings, and educate the youthful treefolk in the wisdom and oral history of their elders.

Until finally, these treefolk decide to pull up their roots and wander the world. This is a long process, one that takes years, maybe decades, before a tree becomes conscious. And then decades more before they are ready to leave their birth-grove and choose a name for themselves. With your mastery of root lore though, this need not be the case. With the appropriate spells, a seedling could grow into a six foot tall sapling within mere days, and open its eyes several seasons too early. But while such saplings could dredge their roots out of their planting beds quickly, they would remain dangerously naive without the benefit of the decades of wisdom and teachings normally provided to them. 

Additionally, you are adept at teaching the shorter-lived races your magic. No matter if it is the magic of your species of tree, the nurturing path of the seedguide, or something stranger still, you will be able to make even the least interested students learn. If they’re not as eager to work with you as the elven seedguides the treefolk sometimes take on, they can even figure out inventive ways to adapt the magic to their own occupation and goals. More importantly, such mentorship forges a strong empathic connection to your students. You gain a vague sense of where your students are and what they are doing, and may contact them telepathically at any time. They too may speak to you through this connection, though they don’t learn anything else, and may even ask for your aid in their spellwork. Calling on the arcane power and knowledge of a treefolk sage is a great boon for many here."
1036,,600,A Bargain Made In Bad Faith,MtG - Innistrad,Lore ,"HAH! Even demons should shy away from your deals, you filthy liar. Should. It eludes me why anyone would broker with you, and yet they still do. Even seeking you out, only to be betrayed like the last dozen fools. I will not weep for cheating demons in their magical bargains and the extra wriggle room you always seem to get slight breaches of the deal not retracting whatever blessings they bestowed and outright keeping the things they gave you and your soul when you manage to kill them. But just so you know, reclaiming your soul by killing those demons doesn’t make it any less unclean. Your never ending youth as much a sign of that as your new vanity, and their foolishness. May your soul be denied the eternal rest."
1037,,600,Speaking to Sphinxes ,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Lore ,"The hunt for knowledge is never ending, when needs must be met it is prudent to search for the best sources of such knowledge. Sphinxes are the hosts of ancient knowledge and often hold many decades, centuries or millennia of knowledge. You have an affinity for such wise beings, they sense you are a worthy vassal for which they share their knowledge. To form friendships with Sphinxes would be easy for you and they are more than willing to fight for your side by offering them knowledge or riddles they have yet to learn.

In addition to this you are granted additional boons. You are a master at solving riddles and puzzles, can discern lies from truth, and can discern truth from honesty through inference. Not only this but your words and thoughts have an innate weight to them. Like a sphinx your voice can become a symphony and this symphony conveys the amount of knowledge you possess giving you an air of authority. This knowledge also aids your mental defenses as the information you understand becomes a maze in which telepaths can get lost in from which they can easily escape but find near impossible to enter. After centuries of learning, it would take a prodigious telepath of the highest quality knowing you personally and multiple attempts to actually breach your mental defenses. Post-Jump you will be able to encounter sphinxes with form and ancient knowledge appropriate to the setting, though you would need to conduct a dedicated search and they are few in number. The more fantastical the setting the more numerous they shall be."
1038,,600,Go With The Flow ,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Lore ,"The triumph of those Planeswalker’s who embrace Blue, is not outhinking their opponents, having more knowledge than their opponent or having more power than them. What truly sets them apart, is seeing through the illusion, understanding and coming to the truth of the situation. An insurmountable obstacle, an unattainable dream, an impossible goal. There is no such thing, the more “absolute” something appears to be, you can see the flaws clear as day given time to figure it out. 

A master plan that an enemy lays out that makes it so that all roads lead to their victory will always have a way out where you pull ahead. Likewise, while you might fail to solve an impossibly complex spell formula, the knowledge you gain in the attempt will always benefit you, not being a waste in the long run. Even if you are stranded on a plane without your memories, resources, or allies. You can always piece together a course of action through a lead you stumble into to regain yourself. That doesn’t mean anything will ever be easy, you will need to take the initiative, and it might even seem downright herculean. But if you go with the flow you will always be heading the right way."
1039,,600,Elder ,Skulduggery Pleasant,Lore ,"You're not some low-level mage working the usual nine-to-five anymore. You worked and worked until you were recognized for your skill and elected to the position of Elder of your local Sanctuary. This gives you an incredible amount of political influence on the national scale, and quite a lot of pull on the international stage as well. Of course, all that influence wouldn’t do you much good without the skill to wield it properly, so you’ve also gained an unfathomable degree of competence in all fields relating to running a country of mages; politics, economics, resource distribution, the works. Not only that, but you have a special sense, passively informing you of the country’s needs. You’re also a fair bit stronger in terms of your magical power. This is less a benefit of raw power and more a case of your tremendous familiarity with your own powers. Your magic simply requires less effort to cast than it did before, with spells taxing your reserves far less than they would other practitioners of your discipline. Be warned though: Elders tend to die quite often around here. If you buy this perk with an Origin other than Sanctuary Worker, check the Notes section for suggestions on how it might work.

Boosted: You aren’t just an Elder, you’re your country’s Grand Mage. This means you hold complete and uncontested control over your country’s government. You have a direct line to any of the country’s resources, and can requisition them for personal use with very few questions asked, if any at all. Your preternatural awareness of your country’s condition is heightened as well, acting as a kind of danger sense that warns you of acts against the nation as a whole, whether that might be foreign invasion, infiltration by spies, or a terrorist attack. Additionally, your magical skill is even greater than before. Where before you could cast a spell with half the effort it would take a lesser mage, now you can cast it with one twentieth the effort. In future Jumps, you may choose to gain a similarly high-ranking position of power in either your starting location or a location suitable to your race/origin.

1040,,600,Elder Jumper,Magi: Alma Torran,Lore ,"The average member of the Orthodox Church is, to be honest, little more than a brainwashed fanatic, wholeheartedly convinced by the warped dogma concocted by Elder David and more than willing to martyr themselves to further his divine agenda. While you’re fortunately likely to be a fair bit more rational than the rank-and-file, your current position might leave a lot to be desired, as those low on the totem pole tend not to have very much actual power.

You’re not some low-ranking member of the Orthodox Church anymore, but someone much more important – you’re a member of the Council of Elders, the governing body of the Orthodox Church, and among them your status is second only to Elder David himself. As the Orthodox serves as both a religion and a theocratic empire, this naturally gives you a great deal of power over matters both spiritual and secular, allowing you to influence policies towards you own ends and guide the daily lives of those who follow you. You’ll also gain access to a not insignificant number of secrets, both of a magical and metaphysical nature, known only to the leaders of the Orthodox, and so long as you don’t do anything monumentally stupid, you’ll be pretty widely beloved by your faithful subjects, too.

In future worlds you visit, you’ll possess a similar position to this, becoming a leading figure in one of the world’s major religions."
1041,,600,Wise Dragon,Magi: Alma Torran,Lore ,"Among all those who live on Alma Torran, the greatest of them all could be said to be the Origin Dragons, a species of such might that even the powerful mind-breaking magic of the Magicians bounced right off them. Little is known about them, however, as not only do they live at the bottom of the Continental Rift, the inhospitable black void between landmasses, but also, for reasons unknown, there is only one left. That survivor, known only as Mother Dragon, is incredibly wise and knowledgeable thanks to being millennia older than any other living creature, and serves as a mentor and advisor to Solomon.

Much like Mother Dragon is to Solomon, in each world you too will know an ancient being which sees itself as a mentor figure to you. Their form, personality, and history will be different in each world you go to, but a few things will remain the same: They will always have an almost parental fondness for you and, though they may not always be the most capable combatants, they’ll always be incredibly knowledgeable in almost all matters, with very few subjects being beyond their grasp. They’ll use their vast knowledge to answer any questions you bring before them, and even if they don’t know something, they’ll likely still be able to guide you in the right direction to find the answer for yourself.

Another thing these mentors will have in common is that they’ll always seem to take up residence in extremely isolated areas. Perhaps most won’t end up living in somewhere as desolate as an empty void in reality, but they’ll always be somewhere rather out of the way and difficult to reach for most, maybe living atop a tall, perilous mountain or something similar."
1042,,600,Magic Otaku,Magi: Alma Torran,Lore ,"It has been said that the greatest Magician of all time was not David, who created the Gunuds and tore open a hole between dimensions that let him intrude on the realm of God itself, or even his son Solomon, who could rewrite the laws of physics with a flick of his hand or usurp God’s control over destiny, but a man named Uraltugo Noi Nueph, or Ugo for short. He didn’t have the greatest natural aptitude for magic and was almost useless in combat situations, but Ugo had one thing going for him that no other had: He was unparalleled when it came to the theory and inner workings of magic. At least, he was, as he now has an equal – you.

While this perk doesn’t grant any increase to your skills at wielding magic or a direct boost to your spells’ power, when it comes to the knowledge and theory of magic, you are a genius above all others. Impossibly complex arcane formulae which would take centuries for any normal Magician to decode would take only about fifteen minutes for you, maybe less if you keep a cool head. Fields of magic that would take many years to become proficient could be learned by you in days and later revolutionised in the following months. You may even end  up developing new types of magic altogether based on your theories, like the vector magic used by Solomon (and later Aladdin), or come up with arcane theories that would forever change how magic is understood, such as Ugo’s theories on higher dimensions and later discovery of the Rukh.

Your understanding of all things magical also makes you a master of creating all kinds of magic tools. Not just small items like flying carpets or lightning-shooting guns, but artefacts on a far larger scale too, such as mobile fortresses the size of a city or the Gunuds, those towers which can control the minds of any non-humans within many miles and acts as an intermediary to help Magicians wield magic with greater ease. Maybe you’ll even be able to replicate the Divine Staffs gifted to humanity by Ill Ilah or use them as the basis for something else, like the Metal Vessels found in a certain future world."
1043,,600,A Million Ways,Campione,Lore ,"Slavatore Doni, a heretic genius capable of matching any Great Knight with swordsmanship alone. Luo Cuilian, an absolute master of martial arts and Daoist Arts. They are grand warriors who faced gods with nothing but their honed skills, perfected to an inhuman degree, and came out winning the battle. Now, you join their ranks as the great master in one skill of your choice. Take blacksmithing and start forging weapons that can hold their ground against Authorities or Divination and start spoiling the hell of all those shows that are yet to finish. Sure, you could also choose swordsmanship and become the only decent practice buddy for Salvatore. In any case, you also gain a small boost in learning other skills directly tied to the one you choose."
1044,,600,Imperial Privilege,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Lore ,"The greatest Roman Emperors all shared one trait above all else. It’s not their similar majesty, their
incredible charisma and beauty, not even how everyone from each corner of the world could not
help but love and admire them all. It was a singular ability of particular potence, known as the
Imperial Privilege.

Your Imperial Privilege allows you to claim new skills and powers for yourself, ones you wouldn’t
normally have, provided you can provide even a weak justification for why it might now be so. Become a supernaturally skilled rider of all vehicles because you once spent a few years racing
chariots. Gain powerful magical abilities that let you control flame and heat due to working as a
smith in your younger years. Even become a notable divinity for a short time because your kingdom
worships you as a divine figure. So long as the gained capability is not more powerful than what you
might currently have in other areas, you can grant yourself anything that can be poorly justified, even abilities that alter your body.

However, these powers are temporary. At most, they last for a few hours before being sapped away
and remaining inaccessible for a day or two. It is also possible that severe mental disturbance, such
as intense migraines or enormous emotional shocks, could force you to lose hold on your abilities. You can use your Privilege to take up to three separate abilities at once. Additionally, beyond your
three slots to use to gain, you can also use your privilege to partially or fully suppress any ability or
skill that you already have, such as returning to mortality from being a divine being."
1045,,600,Herculean Skill,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Lore,"Were you raised alongside Heracles, learning the arts of war with your cousin Demigod? It might be
one of the few situations that explain your outrageous skill with all forms of combat. Be it sword, bow, spear, wrestling or any other weapon that can be found in this time, you hold divine levels of
skill with them. Even warriors that are many times stronger and faster than you can find themselves
hopeless against your arts of combat. It’s possible to find people that manage to surpass you, somewhat, but they are few and far between, such as comparing your archery to that of Atalanta’s. 

Still, while you may not be outright perfect in skill, you have a special benefit that no one else but
Heracles seems to have. You can create martial techniques that act like spells, drawing on your
stamina in order to use weapons to accomplish supernatural things. Using your knowledge of the
bow to create a combat move that allows you to shoot a hundred arrows in a single motion, which
will endlessly kill anything it strikes down even once to completely counteract most forms of
regeneration and immortality, like what Heracles used against the Hydra. Once you’ve done these, you can effortlessly adapt the technique to other weapons or even the use of magic or your own
body. It may lose in effectiveness, such as your hundred bow shots becoming nine slashes of the
sword or nine beams of energy, but this adaptation is instant, compared to the several days of
practice your techniques usually require, and the new forms of techniques can even be made suited
to specific kinds of foes in minutes of focus."
1046,,600,"Omnipotence, So They Say",Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Lore,"A natural born genius, with a mind like Da Vinci, possessing unparalleled intelligence and talent at all
things, even when you seem to lack the necessary traits to really ascend to the top. Not only are you
able to effortlessly unlock most puzzles and solve most problems, you can absorb entire fields of
academic study into your mind in just weeks of study or master multiple systems of magecraft, such
as alchemy or elemental magecraft, in a few years, even should you be a completely ordinary first
generation magus with just a few ordinary circuits. Whether it be a skill or an ability, you simply
possess an overwhelming talent for it that when combined with your own breathtaking genius, allows you to quickly become world class and then surpass what is thought possible by almost
anyone else, despite being a normal person. You’re incredibly smart, are incredibly talented in all
you do and can take these skills far higher than normally possible for ordinary people."
1047,,600,Sturdy Spear,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Lore,"A humble weapon, with none of the status of the sword, is the spear. But to those that devote
themselves to this versatile tool, they discover a depth few weapons possess. You’ve gone quite a
few steps further. The spear became the target of a religious obsession, a fanatical drive to master it
to the utmost. It paid off with a mastery that verges on the realm of godliness, such pure skill with
the spear that it has changed your very being. If it weren’t for their lesser reputation, you’d be
remembered alongside the likes of Musashi and Munetori for your military talents. The divine nature
of your skill greatly increases your physical power, smashing down whole dojo buildings in a single
swing of your staff is a great way to teach these sword using brats a thing or two. The focus you’ve
achieved when wielding a spear allows you to ignore most attempts at interfering with your mind, the bloodthirst of your foes being so evident to your purified mind that it allows you to move before
most of them can finish the thought of attacking you. 

Nothing else demonstrates your mastery more than your ability to respond to any enemy or
technique however. Even on your first encounter, you can adapt your style to whatever you
encounter with a few moments consideration, letting you counter even truly bizarre things that
should not be matched with a simple spear. Cutting apart magical spells, piercing a spirit’s core, turning aside the three thousand bullets of your foe. While your ability to create martial arts to
respond to any challenge is impressive, and possible to expand beyond the realm of a spear with
some work, it can require enough power to keep up with your foe to some degree. Too far beyond you and even all your skill will falter. Additionally, these techniques are often partially effective at
first, requiring time to hone to full mastery before you can fully negate or counter their intended
target.

You may optionally exchange the parts of this perk that focus on spears with another fairly specific
weapon type. You can’t have it for all swords or anything you do while unarmed but longswords, halberds, nunchuks or a specific martial art style can all work. "
1048,,600,Fish Oil,Fate/Legends - Land of Shadows,Lore,"Through a miracle of breaking the rules, Fionn was not the only boy to get the first bite of the
legendary Salmon of Knowledge, the fish that contained all the world’s wisdom. You found yourself
with a replica of the fish and ate it whole, from head to toe for yourself too. Thus, you gained all the
wisdom of the world, even if it is concentrated in your thumb. By biting your thumb, you are able to
connect your mind to a seemingly endless repository of knowledge, containing all the information
that exists in this world. Like a mental library, you can search through it just by thinking but also like
a library, it takes time to find information and time to read through it as well, plus you will not
automatically memorize what you see there. But with the patience of a good lord, you can find out
anything you wish, within the limits of this world."
1049,,600,Magician of the Early Ages,Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Lore,"A magician is nothing without his magic and like many in this divine age, you’re quite the caster of
spells. You’re an experienced magic caster, both in a range of half a dozen or so scholarly disciplines
and in how to put your magic to use in combat, even against entire squadrons of soldiers at once. Certainly, this basic command of magic that you have would seem unbelievable to people in the
Common Era, much less Modern Times.

What’s better, you have a natural gift for interfacing with the world directly and find that spells that
communicate with or otherwise directly interact with the world are significantly better in your hands. You also find that you are generally quite skilled when it comes to riddles and word games with
others, rarely meeting your match.

If you are instead willing to pay 600CP, 300CP for those with the Sorceror origin, you can upgrade
your training and power. You will come to match the Queen of Sheba in your magical prowess, standing near the top of the world in skill. Circe and Medea would be other names talked about in
the same way as yours. The disciplines you focused on in the base perk are brought to much greater
heights. Bounded fields to seal powerful demons away, alchemy to create army slaying golems and
monsters, elementalism that can whip up natural disasters to wipe away whole cities and more are
possible. You cannot come near the strength or skill of Solomon but you remain one of the greatest
in history."
1050,,600,King Maker,Fate/Legends - Garden of Avalon,Lore,"Your place is not at the forefront of this story but behind the curtain. Yours is the hand that guides
the heroes to success, raising farm girls to be kings and serving boys to slay dragons. You are the
maker of kings and bringer of heroes and this is only too apparent in how you can guide others. Even
should you lack knowledge of the specific path your proteges may wish to pursue, your constant
presence and tutelage brings out vastly more potential than should be possible for your students. People discover brand new powers and levels of strength that they did not believe they had and may
very well truly lacked before you took charge. Lessons and study that should take half a lifetime can
be compressed to just days for even a dull brat to digest. The ones who call you mentor and master
are almost assured of becoming legends that are known throughout the world and will continue to
be remembered for centuries after they pass. Of course, they also develop a loyal affection for you, even if you are a strange, oft annoying and troublesome teacher to have."
1051,,600,Man of Gun,Fate/Legends - Strange New World,Lore,"It was the gun that tamed the west and it was your hand that tamed the very concept of the gun. So long as there is a firearm in your hand, there’s little you cannot do, as your mastery of the gun has reached the very peak. Every bullet always hits it’s target short of intense magical interference, even bending through the air or warping space to strike through nothing but the fact of your skill. Bullets split into fragments to strike multiple targets, fly ten times further than should be possible or ignore the weather entirely when you fire. Conceptually perfect marksmanship, some might say, though you can pull off some pretty perfect quick draws and fancy tricks with your guns too. You’ve got the potential to do this for stuff beyond guns too. You can reach this sort of ‘perfect’ level of skill with pretty much any kind of skill, though some might take longer than others. Helps that you learn pretty quick though, as you reached your current proficiency with firearms in about half a decade of regular use."
1052,,600,Magical Genius,Lord El-Melloi Case Files,Lore,"You are a prodigy when it comes to magecraft, both in theory and in
practice. You can learn and develop spells in a fraction of the time it takes your peers,
and end up much more skilled than them. You are the kind of genius that’s seen only
once or twice a century, the sort of mage that will reach beyond ordinary magecraft and
be recognized as an exceptional magus by the entire Mage’s Association. In fact, you either will or already have learned or developed a rare or totally unique mystery, or set
thereof, whether that means your fire spells can consume normally unburnable things
like magical energies, spiritual bodies, and otherwise inflammable materials or that you
have created a cheap knockoff of Kischur Zeltrech’s Kaleidosword - or if you’re really
crazy, one of his Kaleidosticks. Unfortunately, this has limits, and they are such that
nothing produced here can compare to an actual True Magic or sorcery from the Age of
Gods, so don’t expect to project Noble Phantasms or create an almost perfect copy of
yourself. You also get a free purchase of Magecraft or Mastery, and further purchases of
both are discounted."
1053,,600,Visualizing How to Run,Lord El-Melloi Case Files,Lore,"Regardless of your practical skills with thaumaturgy, you
are a master at instructing others. It seems to be connected to your superb visualization
skills, which are indeed quite impressive. Even if you are only an average magus, your
students could be some of the best in the Clocktower, if not the whole Mage’s
Association. Such is your skill that you could have single handedly revolutionized
magical education - if Lord El-Melloi II hadn’t beaten you to it, anyway. In fact, this skill
helps you teach any and all of your supernatural powers, so long as they are teachable at
all. You are also very skilled at figuring out unconventional and more efficient
applications of magecraft, including those involving modern technology."
1054,,600,Risen Legend ,Kara no Kyokai,Lore,"There is a poisonous fetishism at the heart of magus society, an obsession with the old and the mysterious. A toxic belief that all that we have now is just a pale imitation of what came before. Age is power, an old family serves a magus better, we must reach the origin of it all. That’s just so much shit. Magecraft may lack the raw power and direct use of systems from earlier in history but the idea that it is useless is the thought of someone without the will to persevere. A true magus would not stop, not until they tear open a path beyond their limits.

You’re living proof of the idea that magecraft being an inferior system is not necessarily as true as much of the Clocktower thinks. Whatever your own innate power, you have taken a chosen specialty of magecraft to obscene heights, the likes of which is only matched within magecraft by things like Aozaki Touko’s doll making styles or the impossible Bounded Fields of Araya Souren. Whatever your chosen field of study is, you’re certainly one of the greatest users in many generations, if not centuries outright. Your spells within that field are stronger, cheaper, faster and far more skillfully controlled than any hopeful peers. Your knowledge and skill is near total, at least in regards to existing knowledge on the field, and you have the sheer talent to continually push the limits and learn impossible spells and actions, like discovering how to make Bounded Fields mobile around a person. It’s far easier than normal, almost springing into your mind, to discover ways to combine other magic and magecraft you know into your chosen field to expand and empower it even further. As a finishing touch, whatever path you choose has revealed to you a method of immortality, a way to make yourself not just unaging but outright harder to kill in general. Touko’s famous immortality puppet network as a sterling example.

In future worlds, you’ll find anything similar enough to your chosen specialty will receive all the same effects. A brilliant alchemist here will be one in the future too. You may also buy this perk multiple times.

One may gaze upon it and have general questions answered from information that isn’t a closely-guarded secret. This Magic Mirror will also see past any illusions or disguises reflected inside it.​ ​If someone is a reincarnation and they gaze within the mirror, you may see who they were in a past life and gain a vague feeling as to who they were.​ ​If someone was a mighty warrior, for example gazing into the mirror may conjure feelings of adrenaline and power within someone. You may gaze upon someone you share a bond with in this mirror, and teleport yourself to them if you must at any time with the spoken command “submarine mirror”. It may only teleport the holder with this ability. It can also produce a forceful torrent of water, like the might of a raging storm.

A High Priest of the Mortuary Cult was buried within your body, in full or only his skull in the case of smaller beings taking this option. His spirit was reawakened along with your own, though his body remains unfortunately inert. He seems rather unbothered by this fact, quite happy to be able to laze around and watch what you do. He has a wealth of magical knowledge and knowledge of the lore and rituals of this country, all of which he is happy to share or give advice with. He lived for centuries through many dynasties and wars, even the time of Nagash’s rule was experienced by this Priest. Doubtless he has much wisdom to dispense. At the end of the jump, you may remove his body from your own, though his spirit may remain with you if you wish instead of going with his body.

Hypnosis: Now allows you to implant knowledge into others minds.

Mirror world Transfer: The mirror world can now encompass an area as large as a modern city and be increased with further training.

Counter Magic: You now know how to make restraints that could hold entities on the level of an average Heroic Spirit and prevent them from moving or using their abilities.

Gravity Magic: Can now be applied to work on a large area the size of a football field, increasing the strength of gravity by a hundred times for example.

Jewel Magecraft: You now know how to create a magic amplifier circuit that greatly increases the power of magic used in combination with it. Jewel magic can also be used to store spells from any other magic you have from other worlds.

These notes will allow the creation of a mystic code capable of the Multi-Dimensional Refraction phenomenon allowing them to draw in unlimited magical energy. As such a mystic code constructed with this knowledge would be able to refill a magus’s magical reserves instantly. If you also have Zelretch’s Student then with time you may be able to create existences like the Kaleidostick.

Once the students that your training reached half of your level the rate of their improvement under you would slow down until the skill would become ineffective when they reach a level below you."

So long as you are striving to complete the goal you will advance at an astronomical rate. Naturally this skill is a result of you having the drive to actually pursue such a goal, so it also comes with some pretty decent willpower and determination to ensure you’re willing to go out there and get it done. If you complete a given goal you may select a new one or the perk won’t work."
1067,,600,Purview,Danmachi,Lore,"While the power of the gods may be sealed, there’s nothing to say that a God might not be skilled in specific areas. As a god you’re known for excellence in a particular specific mundane skill from weaving rugs to blacksmithing even swordsmanship. This is excellence by the standards of immortal perfectionists and by mortal standards this is unbelievable, inconceivable levels of skill in the narrow area you specialize in. Hephaestus for example could easily shame even her best smiths using nothing but pure skill, even though her smiths were explicitly benefiting from supernatural abilities to enhance their smiting talents while her own were sealed. Even Soma could make wine so good that even the failures would go for astronomical prices. There’s nothing stopping you purchasing this more than once but it doesn’t stack.

1068,,600,Thinking Cap ,Warhammer Fantasy: Orcs & Goblins,Lore,"Some wizard left this fancy cap lying around and now it’s yours. Whilst wearing this cap you become a basic mage of a random lore suddenly before every conflict. In later worlds this will expand to randomly allowing you access into the various magic systems of the worlds that you go to. This is only a temporary boost and after battle your understanding of the various systems fades into obscurity, but with this Thinking Cap a cunning boss could do some pretty odds stuff.
"
1069,,600,A Cap that Thinks ,Warhammer Fantasy: Orcs & Goblins,Lore,"An ornate helm that grants powers beyond the kin of those who have it. It is a horned thing formed in such a way that it rests upon the head of a human snugly. After donning the helm the wearer will find their minds opened to the True Dhar. This allows them to grasp the particularities of both Necromancy as well as countermagic, the True Dhar being a mixture of the various Winds of Magic which allows none of them to retain identity, with greater alacrity than even the masters of the arts among the Dead. This power and knowledge, while great, fades quickly from body, spirit, and mind once the helm is taken off.

This helm also holds a voice within it. A man or woman who followed a dark master and learned arts far beyond their kin during the long tutelage. Amiable enough to teach what is artificially given by the helm this voice has only one objective. To leave the cursed world behind. Would you deal with this millennia old voice?

1070,,600,One’s Classified Secrets ,Warhammer Fantasy: Skaven,Lore,"A Warlock-Engineer’s secrets are his life. Discoveries, inventions, and creations are the measuring stick by which he expresses superiority to the sadrats that are his “peers.” But as such, a Skryre rat’s secrets must be preserved. Hidden behind locks, concealed under layers of code, scrambled between numerous blueprints without rhyme or reason.

Or perhaps, you could just use this book. A grand tome bound with the skin of stormvermin, stitched with bronze wire, ink messily strewn and slung about. But this book is a perfect one for a mad, inventive mind such as yours. For not only are all of Skryre’s inventions kept within, but any discoveries or inventions you make, be they scientific, mechanical, or magical, will be automatically recorded within this book’s pages. Right down to the most miniscule detail regarding that which you’ve so painstakingly cracked. The pages will automatically, via clues within the text and notes, also indicate which other discoveries and creations can be linked or may be improved by studying in tandem. And to top it all off, this book is bound to your claws only. Should any other eyes try to pry its secrets, they’ll be stumped two-fold: The first, the book will spontaneously rewrite its secrets in such a thick and foul code that a determined cracker would need decades to break it. The second, the reader will contract a skaven-devised curse, being randomly stricken with bolts of warp-lightning.
"
1071,,600,The Lore of The East ,Warhammer Fantasy: Skaven,Lore,"Before they journeyed to the Land of the Celestial Dragon, Eshin were just like any other clan of ratmen. The secrets they found there in Imperial Cathay, and the deadly shadows they learned from in misty Nippon, changed them as certainly as Lord Tsien-Tsin and Chi’an Chi the Great Conspirator change the world. These secrets were brought back when Eshin returned to their people, and since those days have remained as deadly as the ninja-assassins of the east.

You have a set of five mist-billowing scrolls, covered in the flowing and elegant script of Cathay - standing out starkly from their verminous surroundings. Within these scrolls is carried all the knowledge and secrets that allow Eshin to turn fidgety, cowardly clanrats into cold-blooded, disciplined assassins and orchestrators of disaster. They also contain the magicks to the Lore of Stealth, causing any one rat or person who handles the scrolls to gain potential within that shadowy magick of Eshin Sorcerers. If one simply reads from these scrolls, and practices, they will swiftly rise in skill to become a dreaded assassin within weeks - with your aid, even days.
"
1072,,600,Liber Bubonicus ,Warhammer Fantasy: Skaven,Lore,"Ah, the Book of Woe. The holy book of Clan Pestilens, wielded by their scion Lord Skrolk. The hidden and unknown lore of Plague Magic is contained within these pages, as well as the alchemical and magical knowledge of every disease, pestilence, and plague in the whole world. Merely holding the book is enough to begin tainting the reader’s flesh and skin with pox, and reading the pages afflicts the fool or priest as surely as if they’d been exposed to a vector.

Originally, there was only one complete Book of Woe. Now there are two - the second within your grimy, diseased claws. Your copy of the Book of Woe contains every possible spell of the Lore of Plague, and method of creating every disease known to the world. As well, any new diseases and poxes you encounter or find will be recorded within the Liber Bubonicus - gaining its own page and the spell or alchemical formula to conjure it forth. Any who read this tome, unless they bear some magic to cleanse themselves or have some immunity, will be ravaged by every single pathogen wreathed into the mouldering pages.
"
1073,,600,The Pride of Hoeth ,Warhammer Fantasy: High Elves,Lore,"Unsurprisingly, given their long lives Elves invariably stand head and shoulders above the ‘lesser races’ when it comes to magic. Just so, there are those that rise to the top of even such an auspicious heap, you in particular with this Perk. Like your Asur peer Teclis, you weave spells with such ease and power your enemies will feel like the gods themselves are smiting them. Additionally, as befitting one of the guardians of Order, you are also deeply talented at teaching others the ways of magic. So much so that you could induce a magical awakening in a society that before had no magic at all.
"
1074,,600,Tiger Scrolls,Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap,Lore,"Just as the Blade Brothers, you are skilled in the Art of War. Mastership of your swordsmanship can now allow you to channel your vitality or desperation into blade beams, shatter stone, and use a spinning slash that covers a distance beyond the range of your sword and hits everyone nearby. All of this culminates in a greater overall fitness and also makes you a single repetition learner, like Link you’ll only need to be shown how to do something once and you’ll be able to do it as long as you have the ability to.

In addition to this mastery of swordsmanship you have learned how to create Tiger Scrolls which allow you to pass on any of your physical arts to a willing student.

A student must dedicate around six hours of practice to what is written upon the Tiger Scroll every day, however the instructions are concise and within a week a weak version of the art should be learned with the full version being learned in around a year. Sadly you can only craft one of these Tiger Scrolls per year and it can only contain one 'move' of an entire art, so to learn a full martial arts style the master would have to break it down into separate pieces that together teach the entire style, The Tiger Scroll can’t teach magic or non-physical ‘moves’ but those moves that are largely composed of physical action with a magical or mystical component can be taught, such as the moves learned from the Blade Brother’s Spin Attack is done by channeling slight mystical energies into the sword before using the attack.

The Tiger Scrolls don't discriminate, however, so if someone you don't like picks one up they could learn as easily as anyone you like.

1075,,600,Mimic,Legend of Zelda: Hero of Worlds,Lore,"Whether you're fighting the ultimate foe or studying under a wise old mentor, you're able to understand the nature and method of any technique or spell performed before you--if you survive it. Afterwards, so long as you have the power, ability and resources necessary, you know how to replicate it. However, you do not get the muscle memory required to use it on the fly. That takes training.
"
1076,,600,Master of the Arcane ,The Elder Scrolls,Lore,"While magic by its very nature is flexible in how it is manifested, you devoted yourself to a single school of magic. You are an undisputed master in one of the Schools of Magic, knowledgeable in both its underlying principles and its practical uses. In addition, you are quite skilled in passing along your knowledge of your chosen school to others."
1077,,600,Spell Crafter ,The Elder Scrolls,Lore,"The only thing that really holds magic back is the creativity of the caster. You can easily create new spells with a bit of effort, and if you were to see any new or unknown spell in action, you could recreate or mimic it through experimentation. No magic is beyond your reach."
1078,,600,Elder Scroll ,The Elder Scrolls,Lore,"They have no known origin or author, and upon their divine parchment one may find archives of the past as well as auguries of the future. They are believed to be fragments of creation that are said to exist outside of time and space, extricated from the limits of the mortal realm. Upon reading this, the reader receives a portion of a fraction of its knowledge in return for blindness, but it may be possible to utilize its unique nature for other ends, should you be daring or foolhardy enough to try."
1079,,600,Oghma Infinium ,The Elder Scrolls,Lore,"The Daedric Artifact of Hermaeus Mora, Daedric Prince of Knowledge, this is an ancient tome of knowledge written by Xarxes, the wizard sage and scribe also known as ""The Ageless One."" Upon reading it, you gain the eldritch knowledge of one of the three paths of Magic, Might, or Shadows. Each person may only be affected by this artifact once, as more than that can and have driven men to madness."
1080,,700,Book of Dawning Sky ,Lyrical Nanoha,Lore,"How on Earth did you get your hands on this?! It’s either a predecessor or an offshoot of the Book of Darkness, a legendary Lost Logia that collects both magical knowledge and energy, giving it a completely bottomless well of mana as well as knowledge of every spell from everyone world and individual it has absorbed. Problem: This white book is completely blank and tapped dry of any mana. While it can store as much energy as you can put into it, and copy as many spells as you can find a way to absorb into it, it has nothing within it right now. Still, if you had some way to do so, you could potentially gain a grimoire with an infinite supply of mana and an endless index of spells...if only you had some way to fill it. Maybe the book’s more-complete counterpart could give you some sort of clue? Once it has absorbed some mana and spells, it can be used in an identical way to a Unison Device.

Even if you’re not the ‘collect and fill’ type, this book has another program of note: The Guardian Knights program. It contains four AI programs designed specifically to protect the user, who begin without personality and or sentience beyond guarding the user of this - though some time and care can cause them to develop personalities and wills of their own, much like Hayate Yagami did for her Knights. They start with low magic capabilities and function similarly to Familiars, but could potentially use Devices of their own (if built) and eventually advance to as far as S-rank natural ability after some growth and training. They do not count as companions and can be resurrected by draining mana from the Book if slain, but can be imported as true companions in future jumps, where they follow all associated rules therein. You may also import four companions into this role for free to receive the same benefits, though they follow normal companion rules instead from the get-go.

Similarly, it contains a nascent control AI in the style of Reinforce, though like the Knights and Book itself, which is the primary subject of the Unison function. It starts off lacking personality or anything except base functions like a ‘Basic’ Intelligence, but will steadily grow to become Sapient as time goes on, particularly if you devote effort to educating it. It follows the same rules as the Guardian Knights in terms of companions, and is otherwise completely loyal to the Book’s user (you).

After the book has collected a significant amount of mana, it can even begin to form an ‘internal world’ that functions as a pocket dimension, which will grow along with the Book. Obviously, if the artifact is destroyed or damaged, things contained within that world go with it...so mind keeping this safe, if you can. If you took the Darkness bloodline, the Book automatically retains all spells you learn and copy without needing your direct input.

1081,,800,Father of the Khazâd,The Silmarillion,Lore,"When Aulë crafted the dwarves, he began with seven; the ancient Fathers of the Dwarves, who were secreted away beneath the earth to await the coming of the Firstborn. It is said that the spirit of the greatest of these founders, Durin, reincarnates down the ages to guide his people - and perhaps you are one such reincarnation, of Durin or another of the Fathers of the Dwarves.

You are the very epitome of the Khazâd. You have great longevity even according to the accustomed span of the dwarves, you are even tougher and more resistant to hardship, mental domination and injury, and have great mastery in the skills of your people. You have tremendous charisma and ability to lead and inspire others of your kind, and will likely be respected as a reincarnation of one of the Seven Fathers. You do not entirely remember your previous selves, but their memories can give you potent guidance, or lead you to ancient and lost things, as well as giving you some mastery of their ancient arts - represented by two free purchases of Master of Craft.

In future jumps, you may choose either a species or cultural group (e.g. Parshendi in the Stormlight Archive, the French on Earth etc), and become the reincarnation of a great figure in their past. You gain a similar level of ‘paragonhood’ with regards to that group, exemplifying many of its best aspects and taking any innate skills or talents of that species or group to their apex, along with mastery of any skills associated with them. Depending on the world you may not be literally regarded as a reincarnation, but may instead be seen as that person ‘come again’. Being the ‘reincarnation’ of Napoleon during World War 2 would give you a reputation as and skills of a master strategist and politician, but being the reincarnation of an ancient cultivator in a xianxia world would give you knowledge of and skill in their cultivation methods, but not their actual level of cultivation."
1082,,800,The Enlightened One,Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Lore,"He who stands above both heaven and earth. The great Jumper-sama. You are incredibly amazing at advancing your powers in the heat of battle. If you were about to die and decide to ignore defense and attack and throw all you have into attempting to heal yourself even if you've never done it yourself. You can always somehow grow even if you are the strongest. It’s not even fun anymore to fight someone who is outside of the damn rules. Because ignoring rules is also a fun thing you can do. Healing burnt out techniques. Making your technique automatic based on mass and speed. Or just increasing the strength of your flames by turning them into plasma. This enlightenment works at all times but it jumps when you're fighting. You also have the option of being high after a great breakthrough. This won’t make it harder to fight, it will just have you acting weird."
1083,,800,The Tome of Larloch,Generic D&D 5e,Lore,"Golly! This is Larloch’s Spellbook! It has every spell in it! As in, all of them! Ever!

All D&D spells from all editions are in this book. It is also immune to all forms of Scrying, and is comprehensible only to you. If Larloch, the Grand-Daddy of all Lich's, figures out you have this? Well I hope you can run fast and hide well. He’s known for killing first and asking questions later."
1084,,800,The Hands of the Maker,Generic Exalted,Lore,"You have gained a forbidden knowledge. A dusty tome has come into your possession and within it dwell the secrets of producing Alchemical Exalted, one of the greatest creations ever made by a Titan devoted to Craft. It could take a hundred mortal lifetimes to glean even the barest secrets of this knowledge, though one who is Exalted above others might manage it in as little as one. It contains instructions on how to make all the various types of Alchemical Exalted and, unlike the Alchemicals that were first created, these instructions show how to create improved versions. Ones that are immune to the dread sickness that so afflicted the Maker and far less susceptible to the vagaries of Clarity. This is only the knowledge to create these beings, and someone that desires to make use of this knowledge will need to secure the materials, infrastructure, and other reagents needed on their own. The Jumper, and only the Jumper, is guaranteed to one day be able to make Alchemical Exalts if they study this, even if they wouldn't normally be capable of such, though it may take a very long time indeed.

While you may discover the method of the creation of Alchemicals, how their Exaltation itself is formed will elude you, no matter what method you attempt, until such time as you have gained your Spark. Further you will discover that no method you are capable of will be able to utilize the Alchemical Exaltation for anything other than powering the Alchemical that it has attached itself to. This, too, will be something that will be beyond your comprehension until such a time as you have gained your Spark. As a reminder Alchemicals were once people and while the process may have changed them both in looks and abilities they are people still. So unless you take them as companions, or have some other method of bringing them with you into future worlds, you will not be able to take them with you. Finally the process of making an Alchemical does not infuse into them any sort of loyalty to you, so beware if you have used this knowledge to force this condition upon the unwilling."
1085,,800,Salmon of Knowledge,Shin Megami Tensei V,Lore,"So you too ate of the Salmon? Much like Fionn mac Cumhaill some of its grease has hit your thumb and with it the infinite knowledge. With the true source of a Nahobinos power being knowledge, all you have to do is lick your thumb to briefly match a Nahobino in power."
1086,,800,Final Solution ,Diablo 3,Lore,"Learning and gaining abilities were always something the Nephalem were good at. If you can improve your body and skills endlessly, there is no point in not learning more abilities to improve, right? Well now you can gain and claim more abilities you prove yourself worthy of. Either by meeting a teacher that shows you a certain trick, ability or skill. Or by being called worthy by an artifact or powerful being blessing you and gaining anything that way. The Nephalem needed the Power of Death to even face Malthael, so you are now capable of that too.

Boosted: Archon of Paragons

You can now supercharge any of your abilities. This either makes the ability more powerful or makes it less costly. You can also now create Alt-Forms for any of your abilities, especially abilities that could count as ‘Ultimate’ as long as they aren’t way more powerful than what you normally are capable of. For example if you have an ability that shoots a very powerful beam, but can only use that normally for a short time, because it burns your mana out too quickly, you can now create a form for that, which allows you to shoot that beam without any costs to your mana, but does not allow any of your other active abilities to be used at all. You have to change your form back to a normal form for that.

The knowledge within these books are beyond priceless, detailing the creation and workings of everything from Heaven, Diyu and the earthly realm. In future jumps, this book will update to also hold detailed knowledge of the current universe’s laws and workings."
1088,,800,Book of the Vishanti/Darkhold ,Marvel Magic,Lore,"Now this, this is something else. You have come into possession of an incredibly valuable and powerful tome of eldritch knowledge – or at least a replica of one.

The Book of the Vishanti is the book of white magic. One of the oldest and most valuable magical artifacts in existence, the Book of the Vishanti contains within in it virtually every spell and counterspell known to white magic as well as general knowledge to advance one’s mastery of sorcery and vast amounts of mystical history. The book has an endless number of pages, periodically updating itself with new spells and will continue to do so in future worlds that you visit. However, the book contains no offensive magic within it, only that which can be used defensively or constructively.

On the other hand, we have the Darkhold. The Book of Sins, the Shiatra Book of Darkness. As you can probably tell, this is not a book of white magic. The equal and opposite of the Book of the Vishanti, this dark and terrible tome was created at the dawn of the earth when the Elder God Chthon first scribed spells onto its indestructible pages with dark fire. Everything that its brother book is to white magic, the Darkhold is to the dark arts. However, the evil tome has a malevolent will of its own and will attempt to corrupt the user if their will and discipline are not hardy enough to prevail.

1089,,800,Sorcerer ,Marvel Comics - Exiles,Lore,"You are a talented sorcerer. You are ultimately more on the level of Selene, Magik, or Shaman than that of the Sorcerer Supreme, though Magik and Selene have at least been in consideration for the position and have the raw talent if not the skills or the trappings that can magnify their power. This magic provides you with a great variety of possible actions and abilities, though it will on occasion depend upon external sources of energy, or time and preparation."
1090,,800,Peerless,Fate/Legends - Garden of Avalon,Lore,"The knights of Britain are renown for their skill, power and honour. The knights of the Round Table exemplify Britain’s virtues to an even greater extent. You? Lancelot at his height is the only one you can call a peer and he doesn’t remain there for long. Few men are as perfectly well rounded as you. Your physical abilities are enough that you could fight powerful adult dragons and demons to a draw with your bare hands or even win if you added a good weapon to your side. You’ve got unbelievable levels of martial skill in both offense and defense, across two dozen kinds of weapons, such that even without your physical abilities being so great you could slay armies. You have strategic and tactical abilities that let you lead small forces to crush far larger ones and can even make a good substitute for a king if your liege needs to spend a few months away at war, though you are far below the sort of king that can create a golden age. You have a high level of natural talent at any skill or ability you try your hand at and find it very easy to learn and train to become better at new things, quickly surpassing even the most venerable of warriors in their specialties. Of course, you would not be peerless if you did not also look the part. Among all the men in the world, only the divine could outmatch your physical splendour and even then, only by a touch. Your king might frown on the hordes of maidens that lust after you but you really can’t help it, as you gather admirers and love interests even when fully armoured and masked. Just something about you."
1091,,800,Grand,Fate/Legends - Garden of Avalon,Lore,"The truth of magecraft is thus. It is not power that matters, not really. It is knowledge and skill and
talent that allows one to become unsurpassed in this field. A true master of the arts does not need
the power of a thousand magi to blow up a fortress. He just needs a spark of mana and the right
words to utilize it properly. And a master like that is far below you. Among all the magi in the world
and those from history long since past, you are something special. A magus with such skill and
knowledge that they have the potential to be a Grand Servant. There is little to no discipline of
magecraft that you have not mastered to such an extent that others think you are wielding True
Magic. Almost no spell you do not know as intimately as a husband knows his wife of several decades. No inch of your own magical circuits or energy that you do not exert absolute and total
mastery over. Merlin the Incubus, Solomon the King of Magic. The names of the only two other magi
to be your equal in knowledge and skill, though the matter of magical energy and power is
something different. Perhaps you could find a way to take that too?"
1092,,800,High Libriomancy ,Libriomancer,Lore,"(Requires Libriomancy) Oh, oh my. You seem to have taken a step above the common libriomancer. You have grasped the true spellcasting potential of libriomancy, able to “read” the story of magic in all things living or magical. At a glance you may determine whether something is magical as well as any active spells or effects it might hold. Furthermore instead of drawing objects or energy out of books you may instead call upon supernatural or magical effects described therein, allowing you to cast spells and magical effects as though you were the proper caster (standard limits of libriomancy still apply). Perhaps the greatest application of all is that you may draw out spells and magical effects from multiple books, combining them into a new spell all its own with the best parts of all those described. Using this method, you could perhaps even create a stable portal from the earth to the moon. Whatever you do, you will likely be at the forefront of magical knowledge and research in this world. (Restrictions for regular libriomancy still apply)"

But in their mortality, there is a certain strength, a thirst to learn and grow. And in you, this burns more brightly than most any other. You are a paragon of man, a prodigy among geniuses. You will find that any task set before you is mastered far faster than otherwise. Be it sorcery, science, arts, or something else entirely. So long as it is something you can learn, you will be able to do so in a fraction of the time it would take others. Perhaps you would learn a language in a days or master a martial art in a week. Though, this is not absolute mastery. There are, perhaps, those who will be able to surpass you in individual fields, though these will be the greatest minds alive and what does it matter if you’ll never be the best at something when you’re the second best at everything?"
