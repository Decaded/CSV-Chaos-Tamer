1,,Free,COMP + Demon Summoning Program,Shin Megami Tensei II,Magitek,"Let’s make this clear: You will likely not get very far in this world without this. This is a wrist-mounted computer that looks like a video game accessory from the late 80s. It is able to hook itself to and interface with most technology in this world, but doesn’t have any special functions or abilities...well. Except for one, given to you by a mysterious fellow in a wheelchair. Before we get to that, you may import any personal device – a phone, a PDA, or so on in place of your COMP. So long as a normal human can carry or wear it, it’s fair game.

This is the Demonic Summoning Program that helped turn this world upside down so many years ago, letting you understand the language of demons and speak it easily in turn. Should a demon decide to willingly side with you whether through intimidation or diplomacy, you may store that demon within a ‘slot’ on your COMP and then summon it by fueling it with Magnetite. The demon will obey your commands so long as the COMP is functional and Magnetite is supplied to their forms, otherwise they will dematerialize back into storage or begin to steadily take damage from ‘starving’. You may store up to twelve demons at a time as a freebie and they will act as followers, though see Notes for some details on how this interacts with future jumps. Post-jump, you may recruit Demons of other worlds this way, though take note that swapping out a non-Shin Megami Tensei Demon for a ‘slot’ will send it back home unless you took the upgraded Compendium."
2,,Free,Map Scope,Wild Arms 2,Magitek,"This device can help guide you through this wide, confusing world, it shows a map of the whole word or just your surroundings with your position marked on it. It displays only certain areas and towns, but is good for learning the terrain or your current position, when used with a Teleport Orb, this item lets you search the world to discover new surprises since it still contains many ruins that have yet to be explored.

The device never runs out of energy. In future worlds, it can be updated with other maps or just start mapping a new place you discover, your position will always be highlighted on it."
3,,Free,Advanced Relic Machine,Wild Arms 2,Magitek,"This refers to any piece of lost technology, though most commonly refers to the special weapons or firearms found in ruins. You can design and start the jump with your own ARM.

Examples of some ARMs from the series: Hand Cannon, Prism Laser, Rocket Launcher, Twin Orbs (Twin attack ""bits"" that encircle an opponent and fire multiple times), Bazooka, Phazer (Named after the Star Trek weapon), An energy sword, light single or twin pistols, shotgun, rifle with a bayonet blade or a rifle gunblade."
4,,Free,Your Ghost,Destiny: The Guardians,Magitek,"Ghosts are small, sapient machines created by the Traveler shortly after the Collapse. Their sole purpose is to locate and resurrect deceased individuals capable of wielding the Light and to support them in combat. When a Ghost revives their Chosen, they are bonded together from that point forward. For a Guardian, their Ghost serves as a companion, scout, librarian, and mechanic, waking ancient machinery and cracking ancient codes. Ghosts can support Guardians by performing certain actions such as illuminating darkened areas, repairing technology from the Golden Age, hacking into machines, informing Guardians of incoming hostile threats, calculating complex enemy behaviors, and providing communications. Most importantly, Ghosts may revive Guardians from death. As long as the Ghost survives, and barring special circumstances, Guardians are effectively immortal and may be resurrected fully intact from any death without consequences. Ghosts may also repair any injury a Guardian suffers in a matter of seconds. Post jump if your Ghost is killed, it will respawn 24 hours later as long as you are alive.

You may freely design the personality of your Ghost, by default they have a near unshakable loyalty to you, having spent centuries searching for you."
5,,Free,Demon Form,Demon: The Descent,Magitek,"Your demonic form is a reflection of the purpose for which the God-Machine created you, warped by the feelings and experiences you’ve had since falling from grace. Each time you increase your Primum (the “power stat” of demons) you may reset it. You start with one Modification, two Technologies, one Propulsion and one Process of your choice; these will be discussed further below.

Modifications are permanent and generally defensive or offensive modifications to the demonic form. A large blade growing from one arm, or a built-in EMP field. Claws and fangs, or the ability to sense angels. Mental resistance, or inhuman reflexes.

Technologies are mostly sensory or energy projecting modifications. Resistance to fire, electricity or similar elemental effects. Sonar, some sort of liquid physiology that lets them shapeshift in small ways, or an appearance that provokes glory and terror. Mind reading, or functional invisibility.

Propulsions are modifications that help demons get around. They can be as simple as extendable legs, wings and a grappling hook. Or as advanced as subsystems that let the demon phase through solid substances, teleport within line of sight freely, simple enhanced innate speed or spatial distortions that let the demon pass through small spaces or be so thin as to be invisible.

Processes are highly specialised modifications that allow a demon to fulfil its intended purpose. Wires that can steal memories. A superheated core that lets the demon rain fire and lightning over a nearby area. Rapid regeneration. An aura that deconstructs nearby buildings and objects at will. The ability to temporarily become pure electronic data, an eliminator cannon that launches explosives or being made of nanomachines that can create objects and simple machines from the demon’s body-or split apart to mitigate damage. "
6,,Free,Star of Lucis,Final Fantasy XV Royal Edition,Magitek,"Audi R8 Star of Lucis, Prince Noctis's 20th birthday present, honestly he won't use this and in a week no one will know what happened to this, I leave this in your hands Jumper or your warehouse, it's a very fast car with top speed of 330 km/h, the need for fuel has been removed and the bodywork has been strengthened, it's not a Regalia but it's a beautiful car, I will leave a Fiat for dents and scratches in two hours it will be brand new, internal problems will take six hours, one day if it's destroyed but if you just throw it in limbo it only will be restored after a year, be careful with my present Jumper or you will regret it. It only comes in black, handsome black."
7,,Free,Primarch Armour,Horus Heresy: The Primarchs,Magitek,"The average Primarch (if there can be such a thing) wears armour that is similar to Power Armour scaled up to Primarch size. You are free to customise the aesthetics and strongly encouraged to, as no two Primarchs (except Alpharius/Omegon) wore similar armour. 

For +200 CP, your armour is as protective as Power Armour. The free level offers total bodily protection equivalent to Artificer armour, capable of shrugging off shots that would penetrate even Power armour.

Your armour has a Conversion Field generator in it, which projects a moderately powerful personal-scale forcefield that converts kinetic energy into largely harmless flashes of light – this can blind an enemy foolish enough to try to strike you. Alternatively, you can have it contain a forcefield with a similar protection level as a Conversion Field, in case you wish for a different function. 

Note: This May be an Armour Import if you Wish"
8,,Free,Universal Compatibility,The Destiny Universe,Magitek,"To date, there hasn’t been a single computer a Ghost has been unable to hack into. More complicated ones with more complex programs may slow them down, but it is only a matter of time before a Ghost breaks the defenses of any given computer they’re trying to break into - be it Human or alien. You now have that same ability - no matter the world, no matter the design, you can hack anything so long as you’re given the time you need to do it."
9,,Free,Ghost of the Traveler,The Destiny Universe,Magitek,"At the end of the Collapse, the Traveler created the Ghosts—mysterious drone-like entities meant to seek out those worthy of wielding the Light from amongst the ancient dead. Taking the form of a floating, paracausal supercomputer, the Ghost is the first thing every newly risen Lightbearer sees in this world, and this Ghost is yours. Serving as your link to the Traveler, this Ghost acts as the conduit through which you may draw upon the Light to fuel your abilities as a Lightbearer. While you can still wield the Light without your Ghost, you will have no way to replenish your Light without it—making it a dangerous vulnerability for enemies to exploit. Fortunately, in most scenarios your Ghost won’t actually need as much protection as its small frame would imply given that it is difficult to hit by anyone but an exceptional marksman and virtually indestructible through conventional means—requiring either paracausal weapons or overwhelming firepower to destroy. Besides sustained artillery strikes and those lucky enough to possess devourer bullets, other Risen can break Ghosts with their own strength, and Hive magic has been known to drain the Light from Ghosts entirely—leaving them dead and their Guardian defenseless.

Beyond acting as a source of paracausal Light, your Ghost provides you with a highly potent—albeit situational—form of immortality. As long as your Ghost remains functional, it will be capable of resurrecting you to full health upon death, heal you from injury, and allow you to retain a youthful physique while appearing at whatever age you feel best reflects your identity. If you so choose, even basic necessities like food and water can be taken care of for you. Outside of combat, Ghosts can function in a wide range of scouting and support roles. Besides being able to fly, they are capable of vanishing from sight and can transmat short distances to get around. With their built-in communications systems, they can keep in touch with others across long distances and are excellent at cyber warfare to boot—hacking into almost anything with relative ease. Faced with mechanical issues, Ghosts are capable of breaking down solid matter into Glimmer and programming it on the fly—producing ammunition, repairing vehicles, and even constructing armor out in the field. With modification, some Ghosts are even able to rudimentarily use and shape their own Light, or even assist their Risen in doing so.

Now, though this Ghost is your partner, it is by no means your slave, and in many ways it is not even beholden to you—with Ghosts and Guardians occasionally coming into conflict with each other—sometimes even to the point of a Ghost outright abandoning their Risen by neglecting to take care of their physical needs or even refusing to revive them. This is in part due to the fact that each Ghost has its own, unique personality—just as wild and independent and varied as the many people it comes across. Thus, while it is up to you and your Ghost to decide your individual dynamic, know now that it will be able to make its own decisions once its personality is chosen.

Furthermore, each Ghost comes with its own shell which is believed to be shaped in accordance with the Ghost’s own personality as well as what they believe their Risen will be comfortable with. The Ghosts of the Last City, for example, take the appearance of mechanical drones owing to Humanity’s comfort with and reliance upon technology. By contrast, Lucent Hive Ghosts have taken on a more skeletal, ghoulish appearance, in accordance with the Hive’s almost universal reliance upon Hive Magic. This is not a hard and fast rule, as some Ghosts have been known to lose their shells, while others have taken shells given to them by others, with some even weaponizing their shells to directly assist their Risen in combat.

Surviving this Jump with your Ghost alive and intact will result in two major changes to the dynamic between the two of you. Firstly, from then on, should your Ghost be destroyed, its death will not be permanent, and it will instead be repaired, waiting for you on your next Jump. Secondly, because your Ghost is as much a part of you as it is an independent entity, it will—for the purposes of future Jumps—be considered an extension of yourself: Automatically imported without taking up a companion slot. It is possible to modify or upgrade your Ghost, but the knowledge and technology necessary to do so is beyond all but a select few in this universe. As far as the rules of your Jumpchain are concerned, as long as your Ghost exists, you are not considered ‘dead,’ and only the destruction of your Ghost and your final death (not counting other 1-Ups) are considered chain-failures.

Finally, any time you spend dead is not counted towards the time limit on your Jump. Waking up, immediately getting shot, and then letting your Ghost get captured for a decade before it escapes and revives you would still mean that you have ten years to go in your Jump—not ten minutes. If your Ghost is permanently separated from your corpse, this is not a chain failure, as Ghosts are fully capable of resurrecting their Risen even if their body has been disintegrated. The cost of such a death, however, is having to wait for the entire duration it takes for your body to either rot away or be deliberately destroyed. Additionally, in extremely dangerous situations, it may become impossible for your Ghost to revive you without help. While the exact reason for this is a matter of debate, it is speculated by some that Ghosts require access to neighboring timelines in which their Risen survives in order to revive them. Thus, sufficiently inescapable deaths may leave you unable to revive via your Ghost—to say nothing of the possibility of suffering an otherwise non-fatal fate worse than death."
10,,Free,Flying Tractor,Cultivation Chat Group,Magitek,"Eastern cultivators are famous for their flying swords, while Western witch cultivators use their brooms. But this is the modern day, and carrying around a sword or a broom all the time would be a little strange. So why not use modern farming equipment as your flying vehicle of choice instead? ...ok, maybe that’s not any less strange. But Senior White is a technophile, and he has almost as many flying tractors as he has disposable flying swords. You can have one for free, and it also comes with an invite to all future flying tractor races.

* Not actually mandatory, but why wouldn’t you take one?"
11,,Free,Private NWO Server,Bofuri,Magitek,"A server that allows for NWO to be played locally after the Jump. It can also be used for training and power testing. If you destroy the virtual environment too much, you can always reset the server. Like the real NWO, death in the VR environment will not cause any injury, let alone death, to the players.

While NWO is just code and someone with enough programming capability can change it, items won’t be fiat-backed (and therefore able to exist in reality) if too far from the vanilla rewards. And nerfing the difficulty will nerf your gains and drops, once removed from the VR environment.

You can increase the hostile mob level cap if you want, though. That’s a relatively simple tweak and you’ll be duly rewarded for your difficulty."
12,,Free,Puppetmaster,Final Fantasy XI,Magitek,"These wandering performers entertain crowds and confound their enemies with a customizable puppet known as an ""Automaton."" This puppet uses different frames, maneuvers and attachments to do a variety of different tasks. Puppetmasters can also fall back on Hand-to-Hand fighting skills that utilize the flexible movements of their art."
13,,Free,Weapon Creation,RWBY,Magitek,"Weapons aren’t just a tool to fight with around here. They are an extension of yourself. They are your closest ally you can rely on. Around these parts Weapons have the tendency to be exceptionally unique. They represent who you are and what you will become. So lets get into giving you your very own Grimm slaying new best friend.

You have 400 WP (Weapon Points) to spend.

Note: Weapon Build in Associated Jump Document. "
14,,Free,Custom Robot ,Knight’s and Magic,Magitek,"You get a free robot that you can customize to your heart’s content with the supplement below. It also retains all the upgrades and modifications have done with it and you can also store it in your warehouse which would give you the ability to summon and instantly enter it without going to manually enter in the middle of battle.

Note: Robot Build in Associated Jump Document. "
15,,Free,Inventor,Legends of Runeterra,Magitek,"Your mind is your weapon, and you use it to create incredibly complex machinery or powerful weapons. Your intelligence and ability to learn is improved to a great degree, you could be rightfully called a genius."
16,,Free,Type-Moon Mashu-class Clunker,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Magitek,"The minimum for every proper adult in the Sapphire Galaxy. You have your own space clunker, a cheap ship that can barely fit you and a few friends. It won’t get you across the galaxy but it at least means you’re not trapped on one world anymore. There isn’t a warp drive but you can probably get to a new system in a few weeks. At least the clunker has a big fuel tank and some decent storage to it. It’s most people’s starting model, one few have good memories of and most try to quickly leave behind. While functional, it’s just not all that pleasant to use for that long."
17,,Free,Augmented: Canard,Library of Ruina,Magitek,"Pretty much everyone in the City has some degree of augmentation, muscles that can carry oversized swords while retaining agility, eyes that see better in the dark, lungs that deal with most smog just fine, veins that cut off circulation In the event of being breached, or various other quality of life improvements. You have the basic form of the City’s augments, likely to not be too noticeable, unless you really want something better than the standard, In which case you can get something like a big clunky robot arm that lacks dexterity in exchange for far more strength, or your eyes replaced with cameras that have various extra vision modes in exchange for other flaws in the field of vision afforded."
18,,Free,Shittem Chest ,Blue Archive,Magitek,"A supernatural touch-screen tablet given to the Sensei of Kivotos. This tablet emanates a personal protective field, granting you a measure of protection against bullets and explosions, similar to a Halo. This field only has a certain amount of energy and requires time to recharge, so while you can survive being at ground-zero for a missile detonation you’ll be vulnerable to regular gunshots until the Chest can recharge. The tablet is unhackable, so any information stored on it is safe from prying eyes. Finally, it comes with an A.I. assistant. This can be ARONA or PLANA, or you could design your own AI assistant. They will join you as a follower unless you choose to import them as a companion now or in a later jump."
19,,Free,The Indomitable,Super Dragon Sword ,Magitek,"You are a legendary sky pirate! Your airship has upgraded from a sky-brigantine to a galleon in size, with a crew to match in terms of size. Your airship’s cannons are now much larger, and your entire crew has access to gyropacks and magelocks, allowing you to fully live the pirate dream of raiding even the most confident of cities.

Requires Gadget Array(Super Dragon Sword), Blast Off(Super Dragon Sword), Fly With Me (Super Dragon Sword), Magelock Load-out (Super Dragon Sword) and Air Superiority(Super Dragon Sword) to Purchase"
20,,Free,Super Armor,Super Dragon Sword ,Magitek,"Your Landship now has the capability of transforming into a heavy armored humanoid not unlike a Machina. While in this state, you are fused with the Landship, gaining its defensive and offensive abilities.

Requires Landship Engineer(Super Dragon Sword), Maintenance and Logistics (Super Dragon Sword), Barrage Training(Super Dragon Sword), Thaumic Overhaul(Super Dragon Sword) and Ace Custom(Super Dragon Sword) to Purchase"
21,,Free,Device ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"A Device could be seen as a high-tech magic wand. It aids with the complex math involved in manipulating Mana into spells. There are many different levels of power, intelligence and complexity. This grants you a base Device which you can customize with other perks. (CG Note: This is a Celestial Grimoire original perk. The Lyrical Nanoha jumpchain gives you a free Device, though it’s not listed as a perk, so I had to make one so the rest of Device related perks made sense.)
"
22,,Free,Wearable-type ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"Devices that are worn somehow by the mage. This category can get... a little strange, admittedly. It can take the form of rings, capes or even more... strange ones, like roller skates. Additionally, armor that can be used as a weapon falls into this category, such as wrist-mounted blades or gauntlets. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first. This perk precludes Weapon-type - Lyrical Nanoha and Auxiliary Control-type - Lyrical Nanoha.)"
23,,Free,Auxiliary Control-type ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"This category is... admittedly a little strange. Devices that fall under this are those that simply perform their functions without directly being used in combat. Magical tomes, cameras, ceremonial knives and… stuffed animals belong in this category. If what you want doesn't fit in any other category, it most likely belongs in here. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first. This perk precludes Wearable-type - Lyrical Nanoha and Weapon-type - Lyrical Nanoha.)
"
24,,Free,Standby Form ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"Ever wonder why most mages have some sort of trinket on them? A card, a gen, a bracelet, earrings? More often than not, those are actually their Device in it's standby form, which is usually something representative of an aspect of its appearance in Device form.. While it isn't particularly useful for magic in this form, it's much more convenient to carry around like this, no? (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)
"
25,,Free,Device Form ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"Also called the 'Active' form, this is the form you're going to be seeing most of the time. Remember the 'Handling' option you chose above? Now you're going to get to put that to use! You get to pick something within the Handling category you chose to become the form of your weapon – not even necessarily within reason! Twin gatling guns have been seen in this category before! (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)
"
26,,Free,Basic ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"...It's probably only polite to refer to this as 'intelligence'. While it's a bit doubtful as to whether it can even say anything other than the names of you attacks, it's also capable of relaying received electronic messages when telepathy isn't available. Other than that, it might as well be an inert piece of metal. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)
"
27,,Free,Auto-Repair ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"Devices are of a strange make. Other than the crystalline components that make up the very core of the Device, all of it’s parts – the blade, shaft and handles – are made of very simple, replaceable materials that can be regenerated through magic. In fact, a common combat tactic is burning large amounts of power to quickly regenerate damage in what’s called a ‘Recovery’. If a Device were to be damaged, it can enter an automated repair state once returned to Standby Mode, regenerating any damage to more superficial parts and light damage to the main body. Heavier damage would require taking the Device to a specialized technician – a Device Meister. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)
"
28,,Free,Sheikah Slate (Basic) ,Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,Magitek,"A magical tablet the size of a hardcover book, and also the key to unlocking the true power of the ancient magitech that the pre-exile Sheikah left behind. In its most basic form, missing all but the essential Runes, this Sheikah Slate has a sophisticated mapping system where you can mark points of interest (Though you'll need to find a method of actually downloading maps onto the thing) and a digital zoom ""scope"" that both lets you scout out distant places and set map waypoints at wherever you're looking to keep you on track. Most importantly, the Sheikah Slate authenticates you as a valid user of ancient Sheikah tech, and as such you will be able to use the ancient Shrines and Towers that the Sheikah left behind, and it even includes a Sheikah Sensor function that will alert you of nearby Sheikah technology if you get within range."
29,,25,Automatic Reparation Sequencer,Final Fantasy XV Kingsglaive,Magitek,"A technological enhancement that focuses on ensuring the armour and the wearer remains alive even through pitched battles, as the name suggest the entire process is automatic and will continually restore you from any injuries you receive. However, this also extends to the armour itself, allowing it to repair itself over time. Each time this modification is taken, the armour’s durability is improved and your own vitality is improved by a fair bit.

Requires Prototype MT Legionary Armour to Purchase

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
30,,25,Automatic Combat Stimulant ,Final Fantasy XV Kingsglaive,Magitek,"A slightly less potent formula derived from the process used to “tune” the Magitek troopers, inspiring a high level of aggression and improving their capacity to endure any damage taken. Thankfully this stimulant doesn’t have any lasting effects on your mental health – though evidently the same can’t be said for the MTs. Each time this modification is taken, your strength improves, and continues to improve the more damage you sustain. As long as you’re wearing the armour, the majority of your senses are improved at the cost of losing your sense of pain. Be very wary of this – as you may end up incurring injuries that you won’t even notice due to it being painless.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
31,,50,Gullible DDS-NET User,Shin Megami Tensei ,Magitek,"Well, now. Seems you've got a habit of just installing whatever programs strangers on the internet send you. Fortunately, this was the best possible time to do so. You've acquired the Demon Summoning Program from Stephen and installed it on your COMP. (Or a regular computer, if you don't have one.) You could simply download it yourself once you're in this world, but if you get it from me, I'll throw in two extra features. First, its demonic speech translation program will work with ALL demonic languages, from this and any other universes you might visit. Second, its generic Friendly and Threatening responses are improved; ensuring diplomacy will occur if it is at all possible. Of course, that would be the case here anyway, Stephen knows what he's doing, but in other worlds you might have to deal with some extra sass with the default program even if you added the appropriate languages to it yourself."
32,,50,Insert Fuzzy Butt Here,Princess The Hopeful,Magitek,"Paws go on THESE keys? Tail goes in THIS hole? What on earth is this nonsense?! Sometimes the Queen of Spades and the Queen of Diamonds play a prank together. This is the result of that prank: A high end computer a hundred or more years more advanced than anything the modern world has seen, which also happens to be utterly incomprehensible and unintuitive to any being with human intelligence and perspective. There are elaborate systems capable of keeping track of magical battles while providing detailed analysis of all nearby threats that need to be rubbed against to manage. There are programs that can hack into the CIA’s most classified files that only work when a part of the machine is licked. In fact the whole thing seems to be custom made for a cat to use, and the system somehow becomes much easier to operate for any being in a cat-shaped body. And interestingly, through the power of the Light any cat within a meter or so of this computer immediately gains human-level intelligence sufficient to use the computer."
33,,50,Legendary Weapon,Destiny: The Guardians,Magitek,Choose any 1 Legendary weapon from the Destiny series and obtain a copy with the exact perks and specifications you wish. This weapon will scale to your power.
34,,50,Demon Form(Simple),Demon: The Descent,Magitek,"Modifications are permanent and generally defensive or offensive modifications to the demonic form. A large blade growing from one arm, or a built-in EMP field. Claws and fangs, or the ability to sense angels. Mental resistance, or inhuman reflexes.

Technologies are mostly sensory or energy projecting modifications. Resistance to fire, electricity or similar elemental effects. Sonar, some sort of liquid physiology that lets them shapeshift in small ways, or an appearance that provokes glory and terror. Mind reading, or functional invisibility.

Propulsions are modifications that help demons get around. They can be as simple as extendable legs, wings and a grappling hook. Or as advanced as subsystems that let the demon phase through solid substances, teleport within line of sight freely, simple enhanced innate speed or spatial distortions that let the demon pass through small spaces or be so thin as to be invisible.

Processes are highly specialised modifications that allow a demon to fulfil its intended purpose. Wires that can steal memories. A superheated core that lets the demon rain fire and lightning over a nearby area. Rapid regeneration. An aura that deconstructs nearby buildings and objects at will. The ability to temporarily become pure electronic data, an eliminator cannon that launches explosives or being made of nanomachines that can create objects and simple machines from the demon’s body-or split apart to mitigate damage. 

You can buy more demon form parts for either 50 or 100 CP apiece. As a general rule of thumb, if it’s fairly simple and limited like a hammer on your wrist it’s worth 50 CP. 

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
35,,50,The Necessary Facilities,Final Fantasy XIV,Magitek,"The existing workshop is functional for what it does, but unless you’re willing to do the work yourself in retrofitting it, eventually you’re going to hit the point where the tools inside are obsolete. While this modification doesn’t necessarily prevent that from happening, it does provide you with a steady stream of parts with which you can upgrade your facilities. Whether you have the mechanical expertise to do this rests on you however.

The upgrades in question are only for the baseline level of technology appropriate to whatever world you happen to visit.

Requires Estate to Purchase"
36,,50,Shock,Horus Heresy: The Primarchs,Magitek,"More primitive than power weapons but often found in maces and hammers, Shock weapons contain a small energy generator that enables the weapon to unleash a jolt of powerful electricity on contact. Shock weapons are known to enable nonlethally subduing their victim or frying them alive depending on the power they unleash.  

Requires Melee Weapon to Purchase"
37,,50,Heatproofed,Horus Heresy: The Primarchs,Magitek,"Your armour is exceptionally good at dispersing heat from incendiary, plasma and other such thermal weapons. Such weapons are known for their efficacy in burning straight through even the toughest suits of armour, yet now you have little reason to fear them. 

Requires Primarch Armour to Purchase "
38,,50,Chem-proofed ,Horus Heresy: The Primarchs,Magitek,"Chemical and radiological weapons remain in widespread use, though the Legions usually detest such horrific and destructive warfare. With this purchase you have much less to fear from them, for your armour has been made nigh-impregnable to poison, radiological and chemical weapons in general, including the dreaded Phosphex.  

Requires Primarch Armour to Purchase "
39,,50,Lightweight ,Horus Heresy: The Primarchs,Magitek,"Yours is exceptionally light and flexible without compromising protection one iota. You can move around if it wasn’t there moreso than normal, and even if it’s as large and protective as Primarch-sized Terminator armour you will find it feels as light as air upon your skin.  

Requires Primarch Armour to Purchase "
40,,50,Jump Pack ,Horus Heresy: The Primarchs,Magitek,"A jump pack is little more than a couple of turbines or jets powerful enough to lift a fully armoured Astartes off the ground that is attached to their back. Your armour has either an integral jump pack in it or a detachable one you may put on when you need to launch yourself over great distances. Should you lack the ability to fly you can use this to launch yourself all over the place, which offers excellent tactical mobility highly prized by Primarch and Astartes alike. Or, potentially, use it to brake during a high-altitude combat drop and land on the ground with your legs intact. 

Requires Primarch Armour to Purchase "
41,,50,Bonus Suit,Horus Heresy: The Primarchs,Magitek,"Perhaps you might wish to design yourself an exceptionally thick suit of armour for use in leading from the front under any battle conditions, while also owning a lighter armour designed to enable greater mobility. By purchasing this you gain an additional suit of armour and may apply any armour upgrades you purchase here to one or both of them.  

Requires Primarch Armour to Purchase  "
42,,50,Protection,Horus Heresy: The Primarchs,Magitek,"For +200 CP, your armour is as protective as Power Armour. The free level offers total bodily protection equivalent to Artificer armour, capable of shrugging off shots that would penetrate even Power armour, while the 50 CP level offers protection equivalent to that of Terminator armour, nigh invulnerable to most forms of attack at the small cost of being larger and bulkier than ever, barring further purchases here.

Requires Primarch Armour to Purchase  "
43,,50,Smart Phone,South Park: The Stick of Truth,Magitek,"A 2014 smartphone with facebook already installed. Oddly this version of facebook also tracks a few extra things, like your character level, collectables, quests and has a nifty built in map. The smartphone itself is unbreakable and never runs out of energy, though any attempt to use it as armor or an infinite power source will fail."
44,,50,Assembly Protocol S/A/Z,Final Fantasy X,Magitek,"The Jagd Panzer’s upgrade capabilities are largely dependent on your mechanical proficiency, but that doesn’t mean you can’t fiddle around with some Al Bhed help – well, my help really but who’s keeping track? These Assembly Protocols will amplify the Jagd Panzer in one field, respectively its special attack properties (related to magic), its general attack properties (related to its standard ordinance), and defensive properties (both physical and magical). Each one of these protocols adds a substantial boost to the Panzer – a good kick to its performance levels that is also applied to any drones present.

Requires PROTOTYPE Γ, “JAGD PANZER” to Purchase"
45,,50,Drone Factory – Attacker Models,Final Fantasy X,Magitek,"The Jagd Panzer can create its surveillance “Watcher” drones by itself without any external modification on your part, but these Watcher drones do exactly what their name suggests and nothing else. However, you can configure the Jagd Panzer to create offensive drones instead – arming them with small magic cannons of their own that possess similar, but weaker capabilities to the main cannon of the Jagd Panzer.

46,,50,CAPTURE PODS,Final Fantasy X,Magitek,"Still not sure how to go about capturing monsters? Can’t seem to herd monsters into the pens? Monsters lingering about in places you can’t reach? Well this pod system might be able to help you out then. Though it has to be manually activated and deployed, once this is done you can just walk away and wait for a creature to be captured, at which time the pod will return to an empty pen.

Of course, without any real offensive capacity you probably won’t find the strongest creatures captured – but it does spare you quite a bit of effort in hunting beasts down. If you don’t have an empty pen, the capturing pod will deposit the captured monster in the nearest empty space – so be careful. You’ll get a fleet of five pods to start off with, ranging from XL to XS sizes. Use them carefully!

47,,50,Cavall 2,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Magitek,"Not all of you Servants can fly. Sure, running up a building can get you most places but what if you need to catch a friend falling from orbit, huh? Huh? That’s why you buy yourself a sweet air-bike like this. It can’t get outside of the atmosphere and there’s not much to protect you from collisions, but it’s otherwise flying like a dream. Zip around faster than any aerial vehicle from the modern age and it’s darn comfy too. It’ll take anything as fuel, from crude oil to Artorium to a greedy goddess’ special gem stash. The more valuable the fuel, the faster the bike will go."
48,,50,Stasis Preservation Box Set,Library of Ruina V1.0,Magitek,A series of tupperware that actively preserves the stuff inside. Automatically sorts and repairs itself when left unused for a while. Food preserved can be kept as fresh for as long as the box is kept closed.
49,,50,Mantra Prayer Wheel         ,Asura’s Wrath,Magitek,"This device lets you detect the ambient levels of mantra as well as its primary association. It can also direct you to greater sources of mantra (usually communities). If it is lost or destroyed, a replacement appears in the Warehouse. You also have the schematics."
50,,50,Impurity/Divinity Sensor,Asura’s Wrath,Magitek,"You have a handheld device that can detect either the concentrations of impurity representing Gohma or other angry spirits of the world, or the unique theotechno­signature of the Demigods or other prayer-­powered entities. It’s range is 10 miles, and will give you a directional bearing in 3­dimensional space. You also know how to construct more."
51,,50,Mantra Transmitter,Asura’s Wrath,Magitek,"This device is a large statue, looking like some form of religious icon about fifteen feet tall.It allows mortals to direct prayer to you, waiving range/awareness limits. It can direct the Mantra of anyone within one mile, to a maximum of 10,000 mortals each, so you’ll need several such transmitters (and a bunch of praying people) to get the most out of them.

You get one such transmitter for 50cp, and the schematics instructing you how to make more. If destroyed a new transmitter appears in your Warehouse after a week."
52,,50,Armed ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"This module allows the Device to perform basic situational analysis, warning you of incoming projectiles and advising you against attacks that you might have otherwise missed. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)"
53,,50,Storage ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"Provides a significant boost to any computational ability it may have already possessed, and streamlines it in the process, significantly reducing the mana draw on you. Also allows the option of 'overclocking' it's processes with mana, at your discretion. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)
"
54,,50,Defenser Plus ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"Most spells have a natural ‘bleed’ loss, where a fraction of the energy put into casting the spell is lost as waste, within roughly half a rank’s worth of power. The natural solution is simply improving the algorithms used in the spells, which gives them more effective power. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)
"
55,,50,Mana Boost ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"As with bits and the standalone flight mode, any spell designed to affect those outside direct contact are going to suffer a slight loss in energy spent to effective energy of the spell. Thankfully, this loss can be mitigated by simplifying the algorithms, which increases the coefficient between cost and result. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)
"
56,,50,Efficiency Boost ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"A relatively simple modification, this streamlines some of the more critical processes in the Device, conferring a general increase to efficiency, although due to just making the modifications in the Device as a whole, it is simply a general boost, instead of a more potent boost to a specific aspect, as with the above enhancements. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)
"
57,,50,Tier One Magic Rings ,Endless Legend,Magitek,"A magical ring that provides a bonus depending on the material used. Limit one ring per hand.

Iron: Grants the wearer greatly increased vision, easily doubling their visual acuity, and doubles as a really nice set of knuckledusters

Dust: Fortifies the wearer's body with Dust, helping cushion impacts and slowing blood loss.

Titanium: Increases the wearer's overall strength. If you could bench 50kg, you could bench 60kg.

Glassteel: Increases the wearer's agility and reflexes. Go from juggling apples to knives.
"
58,,50,Tier One Talisman ,Endless Legend,Magitek,"A magical necklace that provides bonus depending on the material used.

Iron: Increases the speed the wearer covers ground at roughly double the speed. This does not increase overall agility or reflexes, just how quickly they can chew through distance.

Dust: Grants the wearer regeneration. Bruises vanish in hours, not days, broken bones heal in days, not weeks.

Titanium: Fortifies the mind and resolve, helping to resist morale shaking effects and mind control.

Glassteel: Helps the wearer predict flight paths and improves over all accuracy. Go from a fifty cent piece to a quarter.
"
59,,50,Dust Mint ,Endless Legend,Magitek,"You gain the equipment needed to extract and refine Dust from the environment.
"
60,,75,Crystal Countermeasures,Final Fantasy XV Kingsglaive,Magitek,"Given that the Legionary Armour was designed to face off against the forces of Lucis, it only seems fitting that a countermeasure against Crystal magic would be implemented as well. Though it isn’t capable of entirely nullify the powers of the Crystal, the field emitted by the Armour with this modification dampens its strength substantially – such that even magic casted by the King of Lucis himself would only make a bit of a scratch on the suit.

The counter magic barrier extends beyond Crystal magic, garnering protection against other forms of magic as well, though a sufficiently strong force can still overwhelm it if it is allowed to strain the barrier repeatedly. If the Starscourge modification to the armour was applied, there is one thing to take note of – the Starscourge’s photophilic nature combined with the barrier reducing the strength of magic can allow the Starscourge enhanced armour to “eat” any form of magic that manipulates light.

Requires Prototype MT Legionary Armour to Purchase"
61,,75,Scourge Modifications,Final Fantasy XV Kingsglaive,Magitek,"Tampering with the Starscourge isn’t the option that the shopkeeper would advise, but some work has gone in to stabilizing the scourge so that even if you do find this modification necessary, it won’t overwhelm you completely. Even in the Empire, taming the Starscourge has been effectively impossible. The MT technology, as prodigious as it is, is merely a controlled reproduction of what the Starscourge naturally can do.

The Starscourge provides the individual with a massive amount of power, far beyond that any normal human should possess. But it also warps them, in both body and mind, twisting their physical form to better serve as a weapon. What the scourge gains from the mutation process remains unknown – perhaps this is merely a natural reaction of the Starscourge when it comes across biological life forms, to corrupt and to mutate.

Regardless, with this modification, it’s possible for the armour to mutate, twisting and growing into a form that anyone on Eos could recognize as a Daemon. Though the transformation itself is quick, reverting from the form of a Daemon back into the armour’s natural state can take a bit of time. This could be problematic...especially if you happen to be inside the suit. On the other hand, one must remember that the Starscourge is perhaps...every bit as “alive” as you and I are...so don’t be surprised that this modification also gives the armour its fair share of autonomy. It can continue to act autonomously, even if you aren’t inside it. Thankfully it won’t be aggressive towards you or your companions.

Naturally, the same can’t be said for other Daemons."
62,,100,Displacer ,Anima Beyond Fantasy,Magitek,"Forged by the Empire of Yehudah, these devices reduce the effects of gravity and inertia on whatever they touch to 1/10. Objects or people of great power find that the magic of the device fails upon them, however."
63,,100,Ether Furnace,Xenoblade Chronicles 2,Magitek,"Like their natural-born cousins, artificial Blades can harness the power of the ether through an integrated ether furnace, whether to enhance themselves or to support their master in battle. Choose any one of the ether elements (fire, water, wind, earth, lightning, ice, light, and dark) to be your Blade element. You can wield your chosen element just the same as any natural Blade, but your internal ether furnace also makes you immune to any attempts to jam your abilities, though your ether link to your Driver can still be broken. You’re able to simulate the basic abilities of any natural Blade, such as conjuring a weapon or supporting your master in battle through ether transfer."
64,,100,Spark of Genius,Xenoblade Chronicles 2,Magitek,"You are a rare genius among your kind, a prodigy gifted with a mind that sees more clearly than ordinary men. While you are especially brilliant in one field in particular, such as robotics, you are also broadly gifted in academic pursuits in general, and can easily absorb and retain any form of knowledge related to scientific pursuits such as the creation of Artificial Blades, the physics of ether, or the ancient secrets of lost Morythan and Judician technology. With enough time and resources you could build many of these things, though it may take years of effort or an epic quest to uncover Alrest’s greatest secrets."
65,,100,COMP ,Shin Megami Tensei ,Magitek,"Also known as an Arm Terminal. It is a portable computer which is strapped on to one's arm, and has a goggle that must be worn in conjunction with it. Honestly, it makes you look like a huge dork, and while it's still an incredible machine some would call it archaic simply due to looking unwieldy. Its hardware is about average, with its software being where it really shines. Seriously, the DSP somehow gives this thing the ability to digitize demons and store them in its memory, letting you carry around mythological beings with no one any the wiser before summoning them to fight others by your side."
66,,100,Magical Computer,Twisted-Wonderland ,Magitek,"A top-of-the-line computer that can outperform any modern one! Runs off any kind of energy you can feed to it. Mostly for gaming uses, it can support scientific programs equally well. Any kind of magic or tech perks focused on bettering tools can affect it too."
67,,100,Legendary Armor Set        ,Destiny: The Guardians,Magitek,Choose any 5 Legendary armor pieces from the Destiny series and obtain a copy of each to your specifications. This armor will scale to your power.
68,,100,Asuran Education ,Guild Wars 2,Magitek,"You have the benefit of a comprehensive education in all Asuran sciences, including how to build and manage a network of Asura Gates and Waypoints. Lesser applications includes golemancy, building shock rifles, jump pads and many other interesting pieces of technology."
69,,100,Robot,Bleach,Magitek,"A product of science, far in advance of the human world. Your body has been mostly or even fully replaced with mechanical marvels, half real and half formed of spiritual particles. A result of Quincy technology or techniques, you can sustain your body solely on the reishi in the air, no longer relying on normal sustenance. The parts reinforce your body to greater extents and provide it with numerous useful devices, from enhanced sensory abilities to mobility options like rocket boots or built in weaponry. As a partial or full robotic being, you’re also able to interface with electronics as if your mind were a computer."
70,,100,Crystal Laser Battle Axe,Gloryhammer,Magitek,"This crystalline battle axe is of dwarven make, using the ancient arts of the Starlords. A laser grid in the haft infuses the weapon with extra cutting power. Plus it looks really cool."
71,,100,Crystal Key,Gloryhammer,Magitek,"This crystal key is a minor artefact of the Starlords, capable of locking or unlocking any mundane lock with just a touch. Not only that, but it can also affect magical or spiritual locks, and is able to be used in place of any other mystical key or key-like item. With this in your hand, no path will remain barred to you."
72,,100,Crystal Mechanics,Final Fantasy Type-0,Magitek,"The Byakko Crystal's blessing revolves around the synthesis and comprehension of technology using magic. After all, sufficiently advanced technology is no different from magic. You can understand the workings of advanced technology after tinkering around with it a bit. You can also replicate technology you see by using magic, but until you've attempted it countless times, the end product always seems to feel a bit...lesser in comparison to the original."
73,,100,Tool of War,Honkai: Star Rail,Magitek,"A mechanical device that could be described as a weapon by the generous. Its specific appearance is up to you, but some examples might be a large claw with a wheel on it that you could use for sudden bursts of speed or a strange suitcase that can unfold into an extendable buzz-saw. While the weapon’s mechanisms and destructive capabilities are impressive, its integrity is not the greatest, so it is entirely possible for it to break down mid-battle."
74,,100,Mechanical Lifeform,Honkai: Star Rail,Magitek,"You are now a mechanical lifeform, but make no mistake: you are no less capable than the humans that you were modeled after. Whether your appearance is that of a humanoid robot or that of a human-like puppet, you will have great intelligence and even greater computing speed, and don’t worry about losing your emotions or anything of that sort. Mechanical lifeforms are able to experience and understand emotions just as well as any other lifeform."
75,,100,A Phone?,Stranger Of Paradise - Final Fantasy Origins,Magitek,"In something that is extremely at odds with what the setting is supposed to be there are indeed smartphones in this world. This phone, which is much like the one Jack has, comes with all your favorite music downloaded, it has infinite memory capacity, always has signal and can connect to the Internet of past jumps as well as that of your current jump (if it has any). It updates to be the most advanced type of smartphone in whatever setting you go to and comes with complementary earbuds."
76,,100,Demon Form(Complex),Demon: The Descent,Magitek,"Modifications are permanent and generally defensive or offensive modifications to the demonic form. A large blade growing from one arm, or a built-in EMP field. Claws and fangs, or the ability to sense angels. Mental resistance, or inhuman reflexes.

Technologies are mostly sensory or energy projecting modifications. Resistance to fire, electricity or similar elemental effects. Sonar, some sort of liquid physiology that lets them shapeshift in small ways, or an appearance that provokes glory and terror. Mind reading, or functional invisibility.

Propulsions are modifications that help demons get around. They can be as simple as extendable legs, wings and a grappling hook. Or as advanced as subsystems that let the demon phase through solid substances, teleport within line of sight freely, simple enhanced innate speed or spatial distortions that let the demon pass through small spaces or be so thin as to be invisible.

Processes are highly specialised modifications that allow a demon to fulfil its intended purpose. Wires that can steal memories. A superheated core that lets the demon rain fire and lightning over a nearby area. Rapid regeneration. An aura that deconstructs nearby buildings and objects at will. The ability to temporarily become pure electronic data, an eliminator cannon that launches explosives or being made of nanomachines that can create objects and simple machines from the demon’s body-or split apart to mitigate damage. 

You can buy more demon form parts for either 50 or 100 CP apiece. As a general rule of thumb, if it’s fairly simple and limited like a hammer on your wrist it’s worth 50 CP. If it’s complex and offers varied application like the nanomachine physiology mentioned earlier or extremely lethal, it’s worth 100 CP. When in doubt, fanwank.

77,,100,Deep Pocket,Demon: The Descent,Magitek,"This backpack has a metal frame with gears and springs instead of zippers, and electrical cables in place of straps. A soft white glow emits from within, and it seems to have no bottom. When you put something into it the object vanishes, and with some difficulty you can retrieve it at will by imagining it hard enough. Think of it as a Bag of Holding."
78,,100,Brainjack,Demon: The Descent,Magitek,"This USB and headphone jack lets you steal memories from people. Simply stick the USB in their ear and put on the headphones, and you can literally hear the thoughts you want. With some skill using the buttons on it, it can also be used to erase and edit memories."
79,,100,The Raw Eater,Demon: The Descent,Magitek,"Oh, would you look at that. It’s the other way of making Covers without pacts. This Gadget resembles a grisly mask made of throbbing, burnt flesh with rusted iron teeth. It can be used to physically bite apart a human, shredding their meat and gristle into substance for a Cover. Yes, even if you aren’t a demon you can use this cover as they could due to your investment in this horrible thing."
80,,100,Demon Summoning App,Shin Megami Tensei V,Magitek,"Such a intriguing tool. The first true means humans had to fight Demons, by contracting them. Over this App on a new, indestructible phone of your choice you may summon any Demons you partnered or contracted with. It may also serve as a Medium for other Summoning abilities you possess."
81,,100,Ortinax Exoskeleton(Additional),Fate/Grand Order Part 2,Magitek,"The back up plan for if the original Demi-Servant experiments conducted by Marisbury failed, the Ortinax Exoskeleton is an immensely powerful Mystic Code designed to allow those possessed by greater forces to utilize their borrowed power safely and controllably. Taking the form of a bulky and futuristic looking black set of equipment, its specific form will imitate whatever equipment or regalia the powerful being inhabiting the wearer as a vessel uses, such as a knight wielding a massive shield forming into vaguely plate-looking armor and a similarly massive shield. Additionally, this equipment will let people who have been abandoned by such forces keep wielding a lesser imitation of the power they once borrowed. That said, this lesser imitation won’t be able to surpass the power possible for Servants, being at the lower bound of Top Rank at most, more likely around High Rank, and this is if their original power was beyond such Ranks. You can purchase this item multiple times for more Ortinax sets, with each additional set costing 100cp, whether or not you discounted this item.

82,,100,MT Control Manual ,Final Fantasy XV Kingsglaive,Magitek,"This manual was collated together by Niflheim scientists, though much of its contents apply to the earlier MT variations, and calling it a proper “control manual” would no longer be particular accurate. While it definitely describes the basis of controlling the MTs remotely, it goes into deeper detail the process and necessary reagents for the creation of the MT – as well as some plausible replacements in the case that the reagents on hand are insufficient.

Granted, you’ll probably want a lab before you start making any MTs of your own, but having a small set of durable, loyal troopers might not be that bad of an idea after all. There is, after all, a war going on between two countries – and the wilderness if fraught with danger as well..."
83,,100,Light Troop Transport,Final Fantasy XV Kingsglaive,Magitek,"Though it’s essentially an airship, due to the sensitive nature of its Niflheim make, measures have been taken in order to ensure that it won’t be accidentally discovered by people from either Niflheim or Lucis. Based off of a design used to transport MTs onto the field, the airship can operate in full automatic configuration like its intended contents, using coordinates sent to it remotely via a cellular device or any other electronic equivalent.

There isn’t much inside as far as facilities and other functions go however. The onboard generator is enough to maintain the stealth field, allow for standard operations, and act as a charging bay for MTs as necessary. However, it doesn’t come with MTs – you should probably find a substitute from yourself. Just keep in mind that the Empire most likely will not take too kindly if you borrow from them...regardless of your allegiances."
84,,100,Magic and the Machine ,Final Fantasy XV Kingsglaive,Magitek,"Niflheim is known for one thing above all – it is without a doubt the most militaristic and aggressive nation within the entirety of Eos. It helps that there really aren’t any other nations that care to contest them for that position, but what has made most of the contribution is their nigh fanatical dedication to the assembly of a Magitek Trooper army. Niflheim, without any question, is the leading authority as far as merging science, technology, and magic together goes. It’s just the magic part that gets a bit dubious considering the nature of the Starscourge.

As an Imperial, your ability at merging these fields together is definitely up there amongst the experts. Whether it’s the process of assembling a MT or tuning them, you won’t have many problems addressing the Empire’s needs. Being so complex, this kind of expertise is the sort that comes with additional quirks. You’ll find that with many magic dependent devices being somewhat similar, you can actually drain from the power source of things like MTs and magitek machines without external aid – this can weaken them to the point where they may simply shut down."
85,,100,Flying Assistant Device,The Irregular at Magic Highschool,Magitek,"This small palm-sized CAD is used to specifically cast Weight-Type Flying Magic, a Magic that create a pull in any user-defined direction using the user’s magical power to achieve flight. I’m letting you have this even though it technically isn’t invented yet."
86,,100,Aura HUD Lenses,The Irregular at Magic Highschool,Magitek,"These set of glasses include a filtering coating to reduce the amount of Pushions perceived, Pushions being particles created by heavy spirit magic use, preventing you from being blinded if you are hyper-sensitive to them. This also works on visible light, preventing you from being blinded by very bright light sources.

They also integrate a very useful HUD feature capable of linking to almost any wireless- enabled computing system."
87,,100,Magical Coding,The Irregular at Magic Highschool,Magitek,"The Activation Sequences used to enact Modern magic are made up of large blocks of code translated into Magic Sequences by the Magician’s Magic Calculation Area. You know the basics of this world’s coding methods, allowing you to program simple Activation Sequences into a CAD and create simple hacking programs."
88,,100,Hunting Horror,D.Y.N. Freaks,Magitek,"A special set of magic equipment, though it might be hard to tell given it’s a tricked out motorcycle instead of a tome or wand. Hunting Horror here is able to go at around half the speed of sound with ease and can travel over any surface, even upside down or across water without complaint. It’ll never break, even when used to ram a flaming dragon or as a bludgeon against a powerful magician. Hell, it won’t even need fuel, running purely on the love of driving. Or magic. Probably magic. You may import a vehicle into this option if you wish."
89,,100,D Phone ,D.Y.N. Freaks,Magitek,"A techno-magical marvel, handed out to all Asylum agents and probably a fair few other similar organisations. This phone, beyond being a state of the art model with a battery that could keep the phone running for weeks of active use in a single charge, holds a number of digitised spells. A shield spell that automatically activates when an attack nears the holder and is impressively strong, a short ranged lightning spell, a fairly weak telekinesis ability and a small range of sensory magics. Using these spells will very quickly drain even the huge battery of this phone but luckily it only takes an hour to charge up at most, even when completely empty."
90,,100,Magitek Blueprints ,Final Fantasy XIV,Magitek,"Basic blueprints taken from our scouts in the Garlean Empire, these blueprints are marked for all sorts of military craft, ranging from battle suits to light cruisers. The problem of course, is that you’re going to have to find the right materials to make this in the first place – then there’s the matter of finding the ceruleum necessary to fuel it.

The mechanics believe that it is possible to substitute ceruleum with another type of energy with sufficient charge, but you’ll have to tinker with the systems yourself in order to make that adaptation."
91,,100,Ceruleum Refinement Formula ,Final Fantasy XIV,Magitek,"The process of refining Aether has many different results, but Ceruleum is one of the most dangerous products to be found. The Garlean Empire, seeing no other use for elemental crystals, have adapted to this refinement procedure so that they can manipulate the energy of the crystals despite their inherent distaste for magic.

Ceruleum usually requires a substantial amount of elemental crystals, but if soul energy can be provided in a pure source, the refinement goes much more smoothly. Ceruleum does appear in nature – though in very isolated areas, largely due to environmental conditions being insufficient. When used however, it can act as a fuel source for Magitek – or worse yet, a high yield explosive."
92,,100,Vanguard Squadron,Final Fantasy XIV,Magitek,"Group Number: 3

A 1:9 scale replica of a Magitek Vanguard, the fact that there are three of them, each with functional micro-micro-missiles, makes them quite formidable. Just don’t expect a single barrage to do anything too substantial!"
93,,100,Mammet Parade,Final Fantasy XIV,Magitek,"Group Number: 5 

Mammets are clockwork puppets, intended to function in day to day civic duties, except their small size makes it hard for them to function to meet expectations. In groups however, they are rather efficient, and you’ll find that they make excellent little war machines if put to the task. Being clockwork beings, they can periodically speed up substantially as well, but this comes with a bit of downtime after."
94,,100,Geographical Prospecting System,Final Fantasy XIV,Magitek,"The others who insist on mining the traditional way are all wrong, and you’re going to prove them wrong with this little magic trick of yours. Well, it was really magitek that helped out, but with this technique, you can scan the entire area within a kilometer, and map out all of the veins available within easy access. Good for your next several motherlodes! Hopefully you don’t need more than that to get rich, mining is an awfully boring job."
95,,100,Automaton Directives,Final Fantasy XIV,Magitek,"Despite being adopted in Eorzea largely out of desperation, the Machinists have a very well developed foundation largely due to prior experience from Garlean defectors and old Allagan Tomestones. The very fundamentals of Machinists lie in the creation of machines, and whereas Ancient Allag took this in a direction to create superstructures and the Garlean Empire took this in the direction towards magitek, the Machinists have chosen to manipulate the technology available to them in a more subtle manner.

The creation of machines led to the creation of robots, and whereas the Machinist is only one person at the end of the day, with an army of robots at their command, they can extend their influence far beyond where their tools can reach.

When encountering any robotic machine, the Machinist can attempt to override or insert new protocols into the robot. When dealing with robots they have created themselves, the Machinist can insert subroutines without dedicated memory, limited only by the robot’s physical capabilities."

With this armour you will be constantly fed a supply of information about what your troops are up to, letting you potentially micromanage your entire campaign directly from the front lines. This includes a nuncio-vox, both a beacon and communications device that makes teleportation and orbital landing mishaps near yourself near-impossible as well as letting you give direct feedback to artillery units to greatly improve their targeting accuracy. It also includes a cognis-signum, an advanced device consisting of an array of sensory devices, telemetry arrays, and other cogitator-assisted communications devices that both greatly improve your ability to command even in the thick of a whirling melee and makes it easier to spot hidden soldiers.

Alternatively, you can have it contain a forcefield with a similar protection level as a Conversion Field, in case you wish for a different function. For 100 CP, you can have your forcefield extend out to allies nearby yourself, granting them the same protection you share.

104,,100,Outerworld Camera,Final Fantasy XIII-3,Magitek,"For a digital camera that otherwise looks like antiquated technology, the pictures it takes suggests that the technology is extremely sophisticated. Rather than producing a still photo, it produces moving portraits complete with sounds and smells.

Though the frame of the picture fixes what can be seen - the portrait, more like a framed painting, can be zoomed in at will. The pictures taken will appear in your warehouse."
105,,100,Decrepit Oracle Drive,Final Fantasy XIII-3,Magitek,"This old and twisted Oracle Drive was created in the distant past – and was used to record a past event. When you play it, it plays only a single image – a woman bleeding black tears, her eyes completely veiled in black, her mouth frozen in a scream - before the image fades to static. The image is projected up onto a surface nearby. While the image is playing, the magic in the oracle drive manipulates and twists the shadows nearby, conjuring creatures from the shadow. These creatures do not fight, but they can travel through shadow to perform normal reconnaissance tasks. They seem to disappear after some time."
106,,100,Transmogrifier ,The Destiny Universe,Magitek,"Created by Ada-1, former warden of the Black Armory, the Transmogrifier was the answer to the cries of millions of Guardians lamenting the fact that, in order to continue to perform in an ever-evolving and increasingly lethal Sol, they had to abandon their favored sets of armor and their preferred senses of style. This device allows Guardians to modify the appearance of any armor set they come across into the appearance of any armor set they had previously possessed, without sacrificing any of the unique features or aspects of the armor they were choosing to modify. This transmogrifier is now yours, and by purchasing it with SP, you can forgo many of the material costs necessary to operate it: You can alter the appearance of any piece of armor or article of clothing to look like any other one you own."
107,,100,Jumpship ,The Destiny Universe,Magitek,"From the humble and standard Arcadia to the most alien Taken vessels, the Jumpship is a Guardian’s best friend and was the standard method of interplanetary transport for Humanity at large during and after the Golden Age. Equipped with an FTL drive that allows for transportation between planets in seconds, this Jumpship is yours, selected from any available Jumpship in the world, pre or post-Collapse. All of Sol is now open to you, and should you so choose, you can even leave it. As a bonus, should you so desire you can arm your ship, turning it into an FTL capable fighter craft. For an extra 100 SP, you can even select from any available Exotic ships."
108,,100,The Sparrow,The Destiny Universe,Magitek,"High-speed flying bikes, Sparrows are the rides of choice for Guardians seeking to cover a lot of ground in a little time. This sparrow reaches a max speed of 200 kilometers per hour, and you can choose from any Sparrow available in Sol, for 100 CP you can even select from the Exotic Sparrows."
109,,100,Your Closest Ally ,The Destiny Universe,Magitek,"Just as with the endless menagerie of personal protection available to those many species who live in this world, so too is there an equally massive armory of - well, armor. From the deeply personal suits worn by the Guardians to the standard protective plate worn by the Cabal, each and every single species possesses and requires some form of personal protection if they want to survive a battle, and with this item, now you have armor as well. For 50 CP, you can acquire any individual set of armor you desire, but for 100, you can instead acquire a piece of mythical Exotic armor, each of which has its own unique powers and abilities that add to and augment your own.

110,,100,Your Best Friend ,The Destiny Universe,Magitek,"This universe is filled with more weapons than one would know what to do with.Regardless of one’s species, anyone seeking to brave the wilds would find themselves far from starved for choice when it comes to their available arms, with each individual class of weapon having dozens of different models to choose from, all of which have any number of perks, bonuses, and modifications rolled into it. For 50 CP, you can select any infantry weapon that exists in the world of Destiny. From personal sidearms to ermous heavy weapons, if you have the CP, you can have the weapon. For 100, you can instead select from among the likes of the mythical exotic weapons, all of whom have their own stories, legends, and even powers unique to themselves.

111,,100,A Magic Spaceship,Epic of Leviathan,Magitek,"While most beings over a certain level of power are capable of navigating through space on their own, that doesn’t mean that they don’t want to enjoy the trip. This is an advanced spaceship created using both magic and technology. It has a powerful warp travel system allowing it to rapidly travel across the galaxy. It also has a number of defenses made to deal with issues like high gravity zones and spatial storms."
112,,100,Temporal Grenade ,Final Fantasy XIII-2,Magitek,"If the technician had not told you it was a grenade you would have just assumed this was a child's toy cube. When he demonstrated it however you realized you should keep children well away. When tossed, the cube erupts - creating an area where everything inside is sent flying into the air in slow motion. When the field reverts back into the cube a moment later, everybody in the air drops down roughly."
113,,100,Cultivator-Enhanced Smartphone,Cultivation Chat Group,Magitek,"This smartphone can get a signal at the top of the highest mountains or hundreds of meters underwater, is nearly indestructible, and comes with instructions on how to use the auto- recharging technique created by Thrice Reckless and improved by Senior White, so cultivators never have to worry about the phone running out of energy. Just mind your minutes, ok?"
114,,100,Climate Control Orb,Final Fantasy XIII,Magitek,"A strange orb that lets you change the weather in a twenty kilometer radius area between sunny, rainy, overcast, and LIGHTNING. Actually the last part was just thunderstorms – but since the item got knocked about, the lightning has been pink ever since."
115,,100,Anti-Gravity Emitter,Final Fantasy XIII,Magitek,Personal anti-gravity emitter device. Allows you to expand a field of anti-gravity within a meter of yourself. Good for breaking falls.
116,,100,Summon Portal (S),Final Fantasy XIII,Magitek,A small summon portal based on antimatter manipulation principle. Opens a wormhole that small objects (half a human’s size) can go through. Transport distance is 50 meters. Cannot be interfered with.
117,,100,Gear Wrench,Final Fantasy XII,Magitek,"“It’s a Wrench! The previous owner was from one of the guilds, said that with it she could repair any machine! Then again...she also managed to pick my locks with it. Thankfully it didn’t have any more abilities...”"
118,,100,Etoria Disciple,Final Fantasy XII,Magitek,"The art of Etoria, the technology which allowed for the creation of things like airships, has always fascinated you. You've noticed patterns in technology, and armed with that knowledge you adapt to new technology quickly. Your teacher has given you a skystone - the key to building your own airship in time, and you'll have no lack of resources."
119,,100,Repairs,Final Fantasy XI,Magitek,"A puppetmaster with no puppet is like a goblin without his mask. What do you mean whats a goblin look like with no mask? You know what happened to the last person who asked me that? ... well Im not telling you. Ok you can repair your puppet! You understand a bit of the workings of your puppet and the semi magical technology used to create it allowing you to repair it if it is damaged using little more than oil and scrap metal. Though this can be useful you still need to take care your puppet is not destroyed.

120,,100,Garment Grid Sphere Slot Addition ,Final Fantasy X,Magitek,"About as straightforward as it gets – if you want to add an additional slot to the Garment Grid, you can do so for 100 CP. This can be applied to any Garment Grid – though if you do this with the [JC] variation you’ll gain an additional Effect Slot for free. Each additional slot beyond the first costs an extra 50 CP, so the second additional slot will cost 150 CP, the third 200 CP, and so forth.

121,,100,Parallel Processing,Final Fantasy X,Magitek,"Have other Machina about? As long as the machina’s size is not larger than the Jagd Panzer – you can rig it up with this so that the Jagd Panzer can remote control it. This goes for the other two prototypes as well...though you’ll find something a bit weird with the Machina Maw – it’s sufficiently small enough that if you already possess the options of construction on board the Panzer...it can recreate the Machina Maw much like how it creates drones. It’ll take longer of course, but the result will operate autonomously.

Requires PROTOTYPE Γ, “JAGD PANZER” to Purchase"
122,,100,Spherimorph Capability,Final Fantasy X,Magitek,"Never settle for barrier drones when there’s something more effective available. The Al Bhed are masters of observing and replicating natural phenomena – and the Spherimorph’s advanced elemental properties are an excellent example of how nature defends itself. Allowing the Jagd Panzer to switch between elemental properties, this significantly improves its magically oriented defences. This affects any drones that are active as well.

Requires PROTOTYPE Γ, “JAGD PANZER” to Purchase"
123,,100,Drone Factory – Platoon Strength ,Final Fantasy X,Magitek,"If you’re going to be taking this you might as well be declaring war on the Yevon clergy folks – since that’s essentially what this modification is best for. Allowing the Panzer unit to create small machina droids that can serve different roles (long ranged attacker, short ranged harassers, patrol units and such), the only issue happens to be that the Panzer is completely immobile while churning out these units – and the speed of production isn’t the best. Still, working in coordination with the Drones, you can field an army rather effectively. The Al Bhed will be really interested in you now...

Requires PROTOTYPE Γ, “JAGD PANZER” to Purchase"
124,,100,PROTOTYPE Α “MACHINA MAW 0”,Final Fantasy X,Magitek,"A machine that’s been disassembled, but with some help or your own mechanical expertise you might be able to put it all back together, in which case it looks to be a bipedal walker, complete with twelve missile launchers, six ray cannons, and four forward anti-personnel guns. It’s got absolutely nothing for defence though... Whoever built this really just wanted to blow things up!"
125,,100,GARMENT GRID [LM] VARIATION,Final Fantasy X,Magitek,"If I had to make a guess, this looks like technology from the far future, definitely not something from the current Spira anyways. The five receptacles here seem to be made for dress spheres – from what I understand of dress spheres and these grids, the grid can merge the abilities of the spheres together. It might not come with any dress spheres, but if you can find some, anyone bearing the grid will be able to use the power of the Spheres inside."
126,,100,EXPERIMENTAL CAPTURING DEVICE,Final Fantasy X,Magitek,"This handheld device doubles as a net gun as well as a standard weapon. You can capture enemies with this, as long as you actually defeat the enemy. It works in conjunction with the Monster Arena if you possess it, as anything captured will be automatically sent to the holding cells within the Arena itself. It can’t capture unique individuals properly however, and bear in mind that you’ll have to subdue an enemy before capturing them."
127,,100,CREATURE CREATOR ,Final Fantasy X,Magitek,"You can’t expect that you’d only keep the Arena as a petting zoo right? What’s the point of collecting and tending to monsters if you’re not going to help them grow a little? Maybe even experiment with perfecting breeds and creating better variants? That’s what this lab annex is here for anyways. It’s a very well-known fact that fiends in Spira are created with the absorption of Pyreflies, but in the absence of this, you can substitute spiritual energy as well. Following in the example set by our Crusader friends, unless you possess alternative abilities, it is still impossible to hybridize different monsters together.

The creature creator works in a very methodical fashion, using creatures you already have within pens as a “foundation” for either improvement or creation purposes. Modifications such as size and basic parameters are simple and don’t require a substantial amount of spiritual energy, but as modifications stack up, the results will become less apparent and come at greater cost. It’s best to keep a tight handle on things, and not let things go out of control.

It’s possible to make more substantial changes – like modifications towards a monster’s physical form and properties that would more resemble an evolution or mutation, but these will take substantial amounts of spiritual energy. However, it is possible for you to modify monsters with the use of material items along with spiritual energy, much like how the Guardians can modify their weapons. It’ll consume a substantial amount of items, but with this you can teach your pets new tricks.

128,,100,Hell-Phone,Hazbin Hotel/Helluva Boss Pilot,Magitek,"A Cell Phone that automatically updates to the best thing around, retains modifications, can call through dimensions such as from the earth to hell, has a shit ton of memory, and is all in all an awesome phone."
129,,100,Puffy Brume,Library of Ruina: HamHamPangPang,Magitek,"Smoke is an interesting thing in the City, from the Smoke War leaving room for L Corp with hundreds of corpses in its wake, to the smoke used by syndicates like the Smiling Faces. Workshops tend to have it in droves with their machinery but some go further by incorporating it into augments or equipment, having smoke cling to targets which makes them more vulnerable or on the user to add more force to strikes. You are also immune to any other adverse effects of smoke, be it regular or infused with extra effects. You can also modify any equipment you use to emit or consume Smoke to enhance itself."
130,,100,Energy Cycle Conversion,Library of Ruina: HamHamPangPang,Magitek,"The security forces of W Corp and the soldiers of R Corp both use a “charge”
system within their equipment, this charge is used to power augmentations in their bodies or activate more powerful functions in their weapons. You now have access to a similar system within yourself with two modes, one builds charge from doing things such as swinging with a weapon or getting hit, and one that uses charge to enhance whatever you are trying to do. You can also just gain charge by absorbing it from an electrical source or battery. Charge can also serve as a go-between for other energy types but it loses a slight amount of power whenever something is turned into charge or vice versa.

131,,100,Magi Tech Artillery Cannon,Bibliomania,Magitek,Simply a massive artillery platform the size of a small car that is a single person military cannon capable of firing 1 laser shot with enough destructive power to destroy advanced military tanks in one shot. It has simple controls and can be aimed at a fairly fast rate as well as fire 1 shot every 3 seconds. The only issue of moving the cannon since it's intended to be mounted on a magi-tech tank to move it around or positioned at strategic positions.
132,,100,Drone Hub(Extras) ,Final Fantasy VII,Magitek,"Interesting choice. Are you familiar with Cait Sith, Jumper? The little cat riding on the back of a fat Moogle that claims to be a fortune teller? He's actually one of the leads of Shrina mentally controlling a robotic double. Taking from his example, this item consists of two portions. First, it's a psychically-linked mental interface you attach to yourself, letting you mentally control and direct a robot linked to the device. The second thing is the robot in question, which can be any sort of appearance or design matching the choices of the Unusual Biology perk. This robot will behave with a personality mirroring yours when left on automatic, but will otherwise follow mental commands and directions as though they were an extension of your body. In addition, they share all of your combat skills and abilities, though obviously they can only use equipment on their person. I hope you have the multitasking needed to make good use of this. After the initial purchase, you may spend an additional 100 (undiscounted) points to get an extra robot in case you need a backup right away or plan to use more...though note the multitasking increases dramatically with each one active at a time.

Requires Drone Hub to Purchase"
133,,100,PHS,Final Fantasy VII,Magitek,"A flip-phone with an interesting property to it. You may use it to contact any allies or companions regardless of distance or environment with this phone, with them miraculously able to answer your calls wherever they are, even if it's in the middle of nowhere. How? Don't worry about it. It's a handy way to keep in touch on the road, if nothing else. This only works on the same Planet, mind...no space phones here. You may add this feature to any phone or long-range communication device you own instead."
134,,100,Stylish Vehicle,Final Fantasy VII,Magitek,"What's the point of hitting the road without a good set of wheels? You have yourself a top-of-the-line personal vehicle you would see on the roads to Midgar. Whether it's a custom motorcycle or a rusty pick-up trick, you have yourself a ride that can carry up to four people or just yourself and a passenger. Strangely, it never runs out of fuel and handles like a dream in your hands, yet anyone else who tries to use it without your permission can barely get it to go over five miles per hour. You may import a vehicle of similar size you already own."
135,,100,Hextech Hoverboard,Legends of Runeterra,Magitek,"The latest trend of Piltover, this hoverboard is powered by Hextech and grants the user limited flying abilities. It’s not particularly fast and it doesn’t have a way to keep you on the board if you make a particularly fancy move, but it’s better than walking."
136,,100,Mechanical Aptitude,Legends of Runeterra,Magitek,"While not all the inhabitants of Piltover and Zaun are genius inventors, everyone gets at least a little experience with how hextech functions. So, you’re now a decent engineer, able to assemble simple mechanical objects. With time and study, you could make a career out of this. If you have the Inventor Perk, you’re instead a truly prolific engineer, able to come up with new designs on the fly."
137,,100,WFD,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Magitek,"The headmaster’s gift to a prodigal student. This wristband can project a bubble of static reality in a wide area around the user, dragging them and any desired targets into an alternate version of their current environment. Referred to some as a Reality Marble Generation Device, it lets the user force any battle to occur in a safe place where innocents won’t be harmed and, more importantly, won’t be able to sue you for getting hurt. The bracelet can maintain the bubble until destroyed but can only manifest it’s power once each day."
138,,100,Quantum Navigation Device,Honkai Impact 3rd,Magitek,"This isn’t so much of an actual navigation device as it is a mental minimap. What it is is a complete, self-updating database connected to a neural interface that has recorded the geography of every single dimension in the universe in extreme detail. This allows an experienced user to use it to navigate even normally impossible to navigate places, such as the Sea of Quanta, and Bubble Universes. It is accessible via simply thinking of the destination one wants to go to, and has a rudimentary A.I. consciousness to help you find your way around."
139,,100,Stigmata Creation Set,Honkai Impact 3rd,Magitek,"Pfft, to think MEI was able to predict that the art of making Stigmata would degrade over time – I really shouldn’t have underestimated her. Regardless, she has wished for you who is inheriting Fire Moth’s legacy to also have the ability to create and integrate new Stigmata to replace the ones that have decayed over time or have been lost. This set contains simple, step-by-step instructions on how to craft a Stigmata out of Soulium, and also have all of the tools necessary to integrate said Stigmata into others. In future jumps, these Stigmata can grant people access to Magic Systems or other Power Systems."
140,,100,Time-Fracture Device,Honkai Impact 3rd,Magitek,"A small device that can be integrated into battlesuits or imported as another device. It has a unique ability that relies on consumption of a large amount of Honkai Energy to slow down time in the surroundings. Of course, it does not affect the user, because then its function would be pretty much useless for the amount of energy it consumes to use. Anyway, this Time-Fracture Device can also be modified to automatically activate when a certain condition is achieved, and can store 3 such activation condition modifications inside of itself at a time."
141,,100,Beholder Chamber,Library of Ruina V1.0,Magitek,"A cylindrical chamber roughly two metres in diameter that you can stand in. When the chamber is closed, the user inside can see, hear and smell locations from far away. The chamber is mentally draining to use with longer distances tiring the mind faster. Those who have had training or are capable of remote viewing on their own feel none of these limitations and thus have unlimited ""reach""."
142,,100,Taboo Tattoo,Library of Ruina V1.0,Magitek,"Ink and tools to create tattoos. Although appropriate for artistic uses, if this ink is used in the application of a tattoo, the tattoos will have special properties. Some possibilities include enhancing the owner, affecting those who look at it, or both. The effectiveness of a tattoo depends on the skill level of the artist."
143,,100,Signature Sidearm,Library of Ruina V1.0,Magitek,"A customisable melee weapon that maintains its own sharpness and durability. The weapon has a compact form for easy storage. Can be customised to use a blade, focus on blunt trauma, and even enhanced to include special effects like releasing explosions on impact or shocking targets with paralysis."
144,,100,Parts Bin,Final Fantasy VI,Magitek,"A genius without materials might as well be a madman for how useful he’ll be. So take this small box of gears, wires, metal plates, tubing, nuts, and bolts. It won’t have everything you’ll ever need for your inventions, but it will have a lot of the most common bits and bobs. Better yet, it will refill itself each week so you don’t have to go shopping yourself. More time for inventing."
145,,100,ARCANOTECHNICIAN,CthulhuTech,Magitek,"The Ashcroft Foundation pioneered the field of Arcanotechnology. You are trained at the art of maintaining and repairing arcanotechnology. This perk functions even if you don't know how the arcanotechnology works. After all, it probably destroyed the mind of the original arcanotech engineer to conceive of it."
146,,100,Purification Weapons,Asura’s Wrath,Magitek,"You have access to the grand armories of Shinkoku Trastrium­ You may select a heavy weapon like a prayer gatling or anti­-impurity weapon. The former is equivalent to a Gau­8 Avenger, while the latter is a large energy projection cannon, firing single explosive plasma bursts.

Both fire harnessed prayer projectiles, and as such do increased damage to impure spirits and similar things. They require Level 2 Mantra to fire.

If destroyed, a replacement will appear in your warehouse. You require Demigod Atelier to construct additional copies."
147,,100,Mantra Capacitors ,Asura’s Wrath,Magitek,"These devices allow you to contain Mantra either by meditating and directing it yourself, or by tapping into a Mantra Transmitter. In either case, a single capacitor can hold 1000 mantra charges, which equates to 5 minutes of Mantral Level 3 feats, or 12 hours of sustained use of Mantra level 1­ and 2 equipment. It takes 12 hours to recharge a capacitor to full."
148,,100,Rank and File Cybernetics,Asura’s Wrath,Magitek,"You have the basic cybernetic enhancements of the Demigod armies­ you do not age notably, and your body is effortlessly easy to repair by swapping intact parts for broken ones. You can be killed, but your tolerance for damage is much higher."
149,,100,Muh Laboratory,HighSchool DxD,Magitek,"There’s no true researcher that can go without a well-stocked laboratory with the latest gadgets and almost infinite reserves of coffee. It’s just the bare minimum, man. That’s why I’ll give you this underground facility that has been tailored to be able to resist, contain, provide, and encourage any and all scientific and magical purview you undertake."
150,,100,Dinosaur With Dementia,HighSchool DxD,Magitek,"This smartphone-looking artifact is actually a measurement device. It’s designed to scan an individual and give readings of their talents, skills, potential, affinities, etc. It’s not perfected just yet, but it can give a pretty accurate summary of what someone can do and excel at, while also giving an idea of what weaknesses or limitations they might have. Very convenient for recruiting powerful and talented people as minions."
151,,100,Colonel Olcott        ,Fate/Legends - Baba Yaga,Magitek,"A researcher needs a proper assistant, don’t they? Worry not because you will never want for another right-hand man or maid with these miniature automata. Starting out at half a dozen in number but easy to replicate for you, they can fulfil whatever task you need of them, be it cleaning after you or sorting your things. They are however not suitable for combat."
152,,100,Archive of Knowledge        ,A Marvel Cinematic Universe,Magitek,"What you have here is a digital archive in the form of a Datapad containing the complete database of every scientific, technological and magical development that has been created in the MCU multiverse. The archive comes with an intuitive search engine that allows you to find anything you want with ease. This archive will contain all the knowledge of any past jumps, as well as update in future jumps to add in a complete archive of all local technology, science and magic."
153,,100,Electromagnetic Static,Marvel 2099,Magitek,"You are able to create an electromagnetic jamming field around you. It won’t affect visible light, or more energetic frequencies, but it can shut down radio and microwave transmission, and even infrared out to several hundred feet around you."
154,,100,Blast Off,Super Dragon Sword ,Magitek,"A unique item in this age, this cutting edge backpack device has enough power from a Mana Core within it to lift a human into the air with the freedom of a bird. You know how to create these packs, but they require extensive training to use without crashing every 5 seconds. Luckily, you have that training, and thus are capable of taking to the air in combat, making you incredibly evasive against ground-bound enemies."
155,,100,Gadget Array,Super Dragon Sword ,Magitek,"As an inheritor to the machinists of old, you can utilize a series of trick-weapons that inflict unique and odd status effects. Your tricks can inflict status effects such as Exhaustion (which reduces the speed and strength of a foe), Oiled (receives vastly increased Fire Damage), Soaked (Receives vastly increased Air damage, but resistance against Fire damage), Frozen (Receives vastly more damage from blunt attacks but resists fire) or Withered (Vastly increased Fire and Water damage.)"
156,,100,Bishop,Super Dragon Sword ,Magitek,"The best method of fighting is to cut off your enemy’s support. Easy enough for you. You have both a number of melee weapons as well as a “stun rifle” and electrified net-bombs on hand, each one of your weapons dealing Air damage and having high chances of inflicting Slow, Paralysis, and Stun. You also are capable of setting up traps with similar properties that are excellent at interrupting enemy actions."
157,,100,Rook,Super Dragon Sword ,Magitek,"You won’t get very far in this world without a way of handling when times get tough. That’s what this beauty is for. You own and know how to construct an extremely strong tower shield, with a few bonus features created specifically for you. Firstly, you are capable of utilizing a built in floodlight to inflict the Blind status on enemies in front of you. Secondly, those that attempt to strike you in melee will have to resist the stunning electric shocks that will retaliate when you are attacked, inflicting Paralysis on those who cannot handle it. Lastly, built-in speakers allow you to force everything in front of you back with sheer sonic force, potentially Deafening them and knocking them Prone. Not bad. Not bad at all. "
158,,100,Landship Engineer,Super Dragon Sword ,Magitek,"You own a Landship, an armored vehicle. Its speed is comparable to a horse’s sprint, though operation of the Landship requires mana to be poured into the engine. Your starting Landship is tough enough to be struck by a dragon’s claws, but not enough to survive its breath for long. It has a heavy cannon that can grievously injure even tough demons, but the single-shot nature of the shells and time to load mean it takes time. Finally, no amount of healing magic will work on the Landship - you have to manually repair it over the span of a period of rest in order to heal it. If your Landship is destroyed, you know how to reconstruct it…but it’ll be pricey. Finally, you are unable to use any other Job’s abilities in conjunction with the Landship."
159,,100,Wheels,Dresden Files,Magitek,"Not much to write home about, just your basic vehicle to move around in. This is any car of your choice, provided certain benefits. It never breaks down, never runs out of fuel, is entirely immune to the Hex and makes any device inside it similarly immune, and has a front bumper designed to run big, strong supernatural beings over. Useful in a lot of situations, especially that last feature. If this somehow gets trashed a new vehicle with all the same features shows up in your warehouse the next day."
160,,100,Chandler’s Keys,MtG - Homelands,Magitek,"The ruling Wizard Savant of the Floating Isle has placed a large bounty on Chandler's head for stealing this ring of keys. The keys themselves are magical tools, used for altering and changing the mechanisms of clockwork creatures. With these, an enterprising thief could quite easily steal a wealth of artifact creatures from their museums and homes, assuming they could actually get into the Floating City without attracting notice.

And now, this keyring has found its way into your hands. Hopefully you’ll use it responsibly, or at least grow rich off their use. Along with the actual keyring, this also comes with a utility belt of rope, picks and other thieves tools. None of it is actually magical or terribly unusual, but they would certainly help any thief who knows how to use them."
161,,100,Clockwork Gnomes ,MtG - Homelands,Magitek,"One of the first pieces of artifice the First Master taught the wizards of the floating isle was the creation of these enchanted clockwork servants. Each of these gnomes is about a foot tall, including the pointed hat that is part of its body. Despite their size and the occasional need to be oiled, they make for excellent servants and assistants.

They can walk, talk, teach, and generally communicate with those who speak with them, but they don't have a lot of personality or manners to them. You’ve come to own a dozen of these small clockwork creatures, who will happily work on whatever tasks you give them. Optionally, they can resemble you or your companions in small metal form."
162,,100,Beneath My Iron Skin(100CP),MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Magitek,"With the many Futurist advancements that have spread throughout the world, one of the most common ones takes the form of mechanical assistance. Metal arms and legs, to replace ones lost to accident or battle, are but the tip of this iceberg. Entirely mechanical suits of armor, known as mechs, mecha, or mechsuits depending on who you ask, are their newest addition to the art of war. To that end, I would offer you one of these - perhaps you seek a High-Speed Hoverbike that would make most Reckoner gangs blush in envy, or the Mobilizer Mech that the Futurists use to control several suits at once. Of course, something more impressive could also be what you seek? 

For 100 cp, you may take one such mech that is worth one or two “lands” of mana, as the old magicians would measure it. The above mentioned examples would all fit into this category, as would the seed of potential that is the Mechtitan Core - although, without others to back it up, you may not find much use there."
163,,100,The Era Of Information,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Magitek,"The Futurists have over the years, created a network of information that is readily available to all who would call themselves an artificer - simple designs for old machines, reports and studies on the interactions of various materials, even the occasional transcript of debates or conversations. The Reckoners have their own bastardized version, but this one is far better on account of being the original. You now possess a data pad that is heavily geared towards the construction of advanced machinery, one with an inbuilt design suite that allows you to draw out blueprints and circuits and test them via simulation software. …if you really prefer, I can instead give you a pile of books and a set of basic tools to work with, if you’d rather something more suited to one of the old fashioned factions. It would be a bit of a waste, but I would understand"
164,,100,Cybernetic Augment ,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Magitek,"Though a philosopher would likely tell you that all are born equal, there are those who are born less equal. Birth defects such as a malformed limb, a weak mind, or poor vision, all these things may prevent a person from rising to the heights they would have otherwise been able to reach. Luckily, the Emperor is kind and her court is often generous to match. What has been given to you is a simple piece of Saiba technology, meant to counteract these flaws - perhaps one of your eyes is now a state of the art security camera, giving your once failing eye vision akin to that of an eagle or a wolf. Perhaps one of your limbs has been replaced entirely? Do keep in mind, these are a far cry from what the Saiba could really do, but it is more than enough to see you to overcome whatever weakness plagues your body. If you have no such weakness, you may instead opt to merely possess a ready to use version of one such replacement, in the event that it becomes necessary. "
165,,100,A Single Drop Of Perfection ,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Magitek,"I’m sure this is an incredibly strange thing to find on Kamigawa, and that more than a few people would be filled with pure terror and utter panic to see it here. But the fact remains, it is here. These vials of black ichor are the remnants of technology from a vastly superior civilization. The oil has a memory of sorts, guiding the growth and modifying the forms of anything and anyone who touches it into a superior shape. Studying it, placing it under a microscope and zooming in as far as you go, will reveal designs and blueprints for a thousand and one designs - and that’s merely one drop. You’ll probably have immense difficulty using any of these designs for yourself, and anyone who knows them would tell you that they’re out of date… but thankfully, the oils wants to take those shapes anyways, and with your help would be happy - if oil could be happy, at least - to perform some upgrades."
166,,100,A Soul Cast In Steel,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Magitek,"As befitting an organization that houses itself inside a city of artists and that stands against the traditionalist and slow to upgrade Empire, Risona and her followers make excellent use of machinery in their righteous war. Not quite as much as the Futurists, but few among them are afraid or unwilling to turn to machinery to gain a boost or perhaps a sidekick of some kind. To that end, you have come into the possession of an artifact that, while intended as a weapon and certainly capable of being used as one, is also somewhat alive and thus capable of fighting alongside you. The aptly named rabbit battery, perhaps, whose internal generator raises your speed and strength by a small degree, or the twinned lizard blades, who will quite literally bend themselves into or out of the way of your opponents blows, for example? Well, there are more than just those within the ranks of the Uprising, but I leave deciding up to you."
167,,100,One Hell Of A Sweet Ride ,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Magitek,"Thugs and brutes they may be, but the vast majority of the Nezumi within the ranks of the Reckoners have something that a surprising number of people would admire - a sense of style and fashion that’s honestly just plain cool. Leather coats with partially magical designs on them, an outfit to go with that coat, and best of all? A surprisingly high tech motorcycle, as durable as they are fast. Not exactly good for the environment, but what are you, a Jukai monk? No, you’re a Reckoner! Now, if you would prefer, we can swap out the cycle for a coat that’s been heavily enchanted via a similar method that Jukai uses for its Living Histories, one that can give you the power to grow a set of wings out of the back of the jacket. Not as cool or as fast, but just as stylish and arguably just as useful. "
168,,100,Folding Drone ,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Magitek,"Where a traditionalist might pull out a calligraphy set with which to draw a message that was just as much a work of art as a message, and then use a spark of magic to call it off the paper and send it on it’s way, the Futurists are in no way shape or form traditional. What you have here is their answer to the need to send a message with minimal effort on their part - at first it seems like little more than a few thin sheets of metal, but when turned into an origami crane they may be sent off on wings of metal and magic to deliver your words. And, more importantly, they do so via a recording of your voice rather than anything as simple as ink. For those inclined to be slightly more physical, the ‘paper’ can be folded into a number of other shapes, such as a simple knife. Bracelets are also a popular shape for storing them."
169,,100,W F D,Fate/Legends - Strange New World,Magitek,"Strange tools made by a strange madman. Reports say he had the head of a lion and ran off after these fell out of his pocket, screaming about the Presidents having secret missions for him. Best not think about it. 

But what do you have here? Three marvels of science which seem to have gone a bit beyond any of their kind. A camera that by looking through the lense, reveals things that are concealed by supernatural means, even allowing a normal person to see spirits. A pocket phonograph that when played, sounds out any noise that is concealed from the area around you, making those of unnatural stealth the loudest around. Finally, a light bulb that when flicked on, reveals all things within it’s range. Not only temporarily revealing concealed beings but also the true forms of any within range, the presence of the supernatural and even when someone is being controlled by another. 

Each tool is very sturdy, rarely breaking, yet seem quite difficult to figure out their mechanisms. It may take some time to do so. You may import similar tools into the similar objects here. A camera into a camera, an audio-playing device into the phonograph and a light producing tool into the lightbulb."
170,,100,So Is Magic Science or Magic? ,The Sorcerer's Apprentice,Magitek,"Sorcery occupies an essentially meaningless line between reality and nonsense. The core fundamentals of sorcery lie in science – the manipulation of atoms and matter, heat and reactions – but also includes things such as spirits, magic circles and raising the souls of the dead. Thankfully, there is a one-way transferable skill set, as any scientific knowledge you may possess can easily be used with sorcery and while magic is not terribly useful for pure science, a sorcerer's ability to perceive individual molecules is a great boon."
171,,100,Communicators ,Generic Magical Girl,Magitek,"Be able to discreetly contact your allies at any time with your magical communicators. They communicate on a secure magical channel, so they have essentially unlimited range and can't be intercepted or eavesdropped on unless someone's leaning over your shoulder. You get one for you, and one for every ally or companion you take.
"
172,,100,Energy​ ​Draining​ ​Devices​ ​,Sailor Moon,Magitek,"Your studies into the flow of energy has given you energy stealing technology. You can create small, energy stealing devices that can be passed off as regular mundane objects. To drain someone’s energy, they must use the item of their own volition. This can include conning them into using it. You can also implant weak brainwashing features into these items if it fits. So for example, it’s entirely possible to make a CD or music file that drains someone’s energy when they listen to it, that could also help turn someone to your side. You may gather energy from afar with these devices as long as you are on the same planet as the person using them.
"
173,,100,Smoke​ ​Bombs​ ​,Sailor Moon,Magitek,"These smoke bombs are perfect to help hide your escape--the smoke they make will be difficult to see through or for anyone to follow you through. These bombs will greatly muddle any supernatural or technical senses that try to track you through the smoke--you heat signature will seem cooler than what they are, your breathing, heartbeat, and steps will be muffled, any magical traces you leave will be too weak to sense. This doesn’t completely hide you--people can just blow it the smoke away with a gust of wind and the smoke will eventually dissipate, so make your exit as quick as possible!
"
174,,100,Smoke Bombs - Boosted,Sailor Moon,Magitek,"Any evidence you left behind in your exit, like footracks or blood trail, will be extremely difficult to find in the vicinity of the smoke, even after it’s gone. People will probably need professional tools and skill to find them. Any combat damage that happened will still exist--but as far as the evidence is concerned, you just disappeared where you stood. (CG Note: Requires base Smoke Bombs - Sailor Moon first.)
"
175,,100,Magical Ergonomics ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"Okay, let’s be honest. Some Device designs that the nerds at R&D cook up aren’t exactly easy for human hands to wield. Weird trigger placement, too much weight on one part of the weapon, or even having the reloading chamber far away from where you actually hold the dang thing - it can be a mess. But you’re so used to this that it just doesn’t bother you. Terrible or impractically designed weapons or devices work just fine in your hands, and your performance doesn’t really suffer for it. This doesn’t work for security measures designed SPECIFICALLY to keep you from using it, however."
176,,100,Cartridge Kit ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"Cartridges are a mainstay of the Ancient Belkan system, so it would be awfully silly if you didn’t know how to make your own, right? It’s a box of about sixty cartridges, along with everything you need to make more of your own. If you’re lazy or not much of a building type, it will restock on its own the following week.
"
177,,100,Sealing Mode ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"Most Devices are far from standardized, this feature is fairly ubiquitous among custom Devices made for use by TSAB mages. It is also somewhat unique among other Modes for being usable with other Modes, as the main body of the Device remains unchanged except for the Device deploying energy wings from somewhere near the ‘hilt’ of its body. The Device also gains a very limited capacity to store small objects within it’s main body, with a capacity equal to its actual size.

Sealing Mode does limit Device output a not insignificant amount, attacks made in this form, along with access to a ‘sealing’ spell allow the anomalous properties of objects and artifacts to be sealed, rendering them safe for handling. It also cancels out active effects of the object, for example separating someone from an artifact that’s possessing them. Once sealed, an artifact is even safe to handle and can be even used to a limited extent. Sealing does not last forever, however. An upkeep is required to keep the sealing in place, albeit at a very low intake. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)"
178,,100,Alternate Mode ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"When it comes to magical combat, the truth is that there often isn’t a perfect weapon for every occasion, so many Devices compensate for this by including a transformation mechanism. This lets the operator overcome the limitations of their Devices form somewhat, allowing them to fight ranged with an otherwise melee-based weapon or vice versa. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)

These are not ‘true’ transformation mechanisms in the sense that they do not excessively alter the form of the Device, rather modifying what is already there. For example, the head of a halberd or bardiche may rotate to become the base for an energy scythe, or a sword might split apart into a whip. Some more exotic examples include a sword combining with it’s sheath to become a bow, or an enormous sword splitting into two smaller swords.
"
179,,100,Gigantic Mode ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"With regular weapons, simply increasing the size has a maximum useful limit. With Devices, the increased size of the weapon can be counteracted with fields and spells to increase physical strength when it comes to melee weapons, and the increased power demands of ranged weapons can be offset by simply providing the required power. This allows your weapon to expand to an absolutely massive form, from ‘merely’ four times its normal size to a titanic version that can crush sand dragons like walnuts.

There aren’t many caveats to this mode, and while the scaling can be technically infinite relative to your magical power, said infinite scaling cannot be said for the Device itself, which may need careful reinforcement the bigger you try to go with it. Additionally, missing becomes much more costly in this mode, as the Mage essentially compresses their potential damage over time into a single swing. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)
"
180,,100,Intelligent ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"Expanded computational abilities, increased independence and an actual personality sometimes makes you doubt whether your Device is really as simple of a machine as it thinks it is sometimes. While it's personality may seem a bit... basic, it's undying loyalty to you and a somewhat quirky way of speaking is going to make it a lifelong partner. Now capable of partially interfering with your control process, it will help guide your projectiles and subtly correct your aim as best it can, although you do have an override, if you need it. The only drawback is the increased draw on you to power it's intelligence. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)
"
181,,100,Gear Training ,Senki Zesshou Symphogear,Magitek,"The Symphogear functions as an extension of you, but only as long as you remain in sync with it. Just like you control it, it controls you, in a way, granting you a higher synchronization rate, and an almost preternatural sense for where the scattered components of your weapons – swords, traps, discarded saw blades – are. This effect also extends to more than just Gears, anything that you 'synchronize' with is going to benefit from this perk.
"
182,,100,Geology' ,Senki Zesshou Symphogear,Magitek,"It's not hard to just root around in Heretical ruins and pick out all the shiny bits, but the nature of heretical technology means that the most unassuming pieces of rock or scripture could actually be the real deal: Relics. Years of searching these ruins have given you a keen eye for finding Relics that might otherwise be masquerading as very plain looking objects, making you an extremely useful resource for salvaging them.
"
183,,100,BUSHIMO ,Senki Zesshou Symphogear,Magitek,"A pagan artifact unearthed in Greece, BUSHIMO was the first vending machine, designed to dispense holy water in exchange for coins. In modern times, however, it seems to have taken on the reverse function, this unassuming pot gaining unearthly powers. BUSHIMO has gained the abilities of a web developer, and will tirelessly work to produce graphics and slideshow objects for whatever you could possibly need, depositing them onto computers near you when it’s convenient.

...If left alone for too long, however, BUSHIMO will begin malfunctioning, and end up programming an entire mobile gacha game based on you, releasing it onto the market and starting a massive racket to rapidly accumulate wealth.
"
184,,100,Fused Gear ,Senki Zesshou Symphogear,Magitek,"...Still not satisfied? Well... alright. Here's an idea- I've got some special- no, it's not black pepper. Yes, I know it's in a salt shaker, let me explain. If you so desire to fuse two Gears together- whether imported or purchased below, I'd be willing to fuse the two together for a small surcharge. Just be warned, the effects can be... weird. They're not going to 'stack', per say, more override each other. Fusing, say... Prometheus and Longinus won't yield a Gear that generates spears and axes, it'll yield a Gear mostly based around chainsaw polearms, with an additional theme of holy fire. Sounds a bit silly, right? Well, I'm sure you can come up with something worse, if you so choose. (CG Note: Requires Basic Relic, Implanted Relic, Shout of the Earth and/or Another Shard - Symphogear first.)
"
185,,100,Ignite Module ,Senki Zesshou Symphogear,Magitek,"By tapping into the berserk state function that was first observed with Human-Relic fusion users, it's possible to create a controlled state, giving the user greatly increased strength and defense in exchange for a limited activation time with three safeties. Being unable to handle the mental stress of first activation or exceeding the safe activation time will cause the user to go berserk, attacking with reckless abandon until they are forced to deactivate. (CG Note: Requires Basic Relic, Implanted Relic, Shout of the Earth and/or Another Shard - Symphogear first.)

186,,100,Alice Doll ,Touhou Project: Parasol Paradise,Magitek,"A masterwork doll skillfully crafted by Alice Margatroid, utilizing such advanced magitech that an artificial soul was able to be implanted into the doll in order to create a fully sentient, autonomous being. This doll is completely loyal to you, and is surprisingly adept at combat despite its size, but specialize in mundane housework above all. You can specify its personality and appearance."
187,,100,Aquapulvistics ,Endless Legend,Magitek,"Where there is water, there is Dust. You know how to sift a sizable amount of Dust from any flowing water source. The larger the source, the more you can extract. Useless in Winter, but that's years away, right? Even after you leave Auriga, you still manage to find a little Dust in water across the multiverse. Nifty, huh?
"
188,,100,Tier Two Rings ,Endless Legend,Magitek,"A magical ring that provides a bonus depending on the material used. Limit one ring per hand.

Titanium: Greatly increases the wearer's over all strength. If you could bench 50kg, you could bench 75kg.

Glassteel: Greatly increases the wearer's agility and reflexes. Go from juggling apples to chainsaws.

Dust: Fortifies the body even further with Dust, helping them absorb a tremendous amount of damage without perishing.
"
189,,100,Tier Two Talisman ,Endless Legend,Magitek,"A magical necklace that provides bonus depending on the material used.

Titanium: Blocks the part of the brain that feels fear, and further reinforces the mind against control.

Glassteel: Helps the wearer predict flight paths and improves over all accuracy. Go from a fifty cent piece to a dime.

Dust: Hastens healing to unnatural levels. Bruises in seconds, cuts in minutes, broken bones in hours.
"
190,,100,Dust Refinery ,Endless Legend,Magitek,"Able to infuse Dust with new life, the Refinery is the staple of Dust Enchantment. While Dust infused iron is common, it pales compared to the Dust enchantments this refinery allows. Allows for the crafting of Foci and magic rings, talismans, insignias, and tomes.
"
191,,100,Basic Runes ,Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,Magitek,"The Basic Runes add camera functionality to the Sheikah Slate, storing pictures in an album for later recollection, as well as the Compendium, which stores and logs useful information on anything you take a picture of - with a limit of one item logged per picture. (CG Note: Requires Sheikah Slate (Basic) - Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild first.)
"
192,,100,Snap ,Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,Magitek,"Leave only footprints, take only the sights that you see. It’s a natural maxim used to ensure that historical sights are preserved, but memory is a fickle thing...a picture can say it a lot better. This simple camera is capable of printing out vivid photographs with no need or film or development, working on a set of simple runes taken from the Sheikah Slate. These photos can be hung up later as well! If you were to connect this to a Sheikah Slate, you could also easily use it as a ‘range booster’ for its camera function, allowing you to zoom in from far off onto wherever you wish.
"
193,,100,Lokomo Chair ,Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks,Magitek,"Has science gone too far? The Lokomo seem to specialize in trains, but they’ve taken that one step further and created what amounts to an electric wheelchair. I guess they’re too lazy to actually walk around? Well, that’s a bit unlikely. It’s probably got more to do with their ability to trade their life force to power the machines they’ve made, and possibly something about how scooting about in their fancy chair is more energy efficient than actually walking. Anyways, you now have one such chair. It’s oddly light and maneuverable for its size, and as mentioned runs off of your energies rather than any form of steam or electricity."
194,,100,"Lokomo Classic, ‘The Spirited’ ",Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks,Magitek,"While the Lokomo may have leaked knowledge on the fine art of trains to their new neighbors, they are still the masters as this particular train shows. Instead of requiring coal and steam, or any other form of physical fuel, their special Spirit Train instead runs on magic. Specifically, it skims off the top of the energy inside the Spirit Tracks themselves. If that’s not an option, your personal reserves can power it for a time, as can any ambient magic such as ley lines.
"
195,,100,"Lokomo Basics, ‘The Sea Train’ ",Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks,Magitek,"Of course, an ancient magitech train just doesn’t have the same limitations as a normal one does. That’s why you can now drive your train underwater, or even across lava. While the how is ludicrously complicated, the effect is that the Spirit Train is functionally immune to being damaged by the environment. Dedicated weapons can still harm it, but the weather won’t. That said, driving over lava and driving through a volcano are two very different things.

196,,100,Psychic Abilities - Cyberkinesis (Switch) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Magitek,"In the World of Darkness, psychic abilities and mythic sorcery are, at first glance, completely different. However, both manipulate the same powers, albeit in very different ways, and are both considered forms of linear magic.

Furthermore, the majority of psychic powers are innate, and can be improved, but not gained, without outside interference, in stark contrast to sorcery.

The ability to psychically control electronics. A relatively new ability, parapsychologists and other scholars of the supernatural argue whether it is truly new or if it has only become observable with the advent of computers.

206,,100,Dwarven Centurion ,The Elder Scrolls,Magitek,"One of the deadliest Dwemer Animunculi crafted, it is a brass behemoth that stands equal to Giants, and even more deadly. It's metallic hide repels most mundane weapons, it's axe can cleave through steel easily, and when it has to, it can unleash a blast of boiling steam towards an opponent. You also get a rod, allowing you to control it's actions directly as well as force it into standby mode."
207,,100,Electric Magic ,Undertale,Magitek,"Another discipline of magic that's less effective in battle than it is in practical use, Electric Magic has been adopted for use by those who work in electronics and robotics. The user can create electrical currents and signals with their magic, able to precisely modify the amperage or voltage as they please, up to the output of a car battery. The most useful technique, however, is the ability to run this magic through a circuit and be able to sense any errors or faulty wiring in the circuit. Like Fire Magic, Electric magic does not affect living beings like actual electricity would- You cannot actually electrocute someone with this magic."
208,,150,Demon Form(Gadget),Demon: The Descent,Magitek,"Modifications are permanent and generally defensive or offensive modifications to the demonic form. A large blade growing from one arm, or a built-in EMP field. Claws and fangs, or the ability to sense angels. Mental resistance, or inhuman reflexes.

Technologies are mostly sensory or energy projecting modifications. Resistance to fire, electricity or similar elemental effects. Sonar, some sort of liquid physiology that lets them shapeshift in small ways, or an appearance that provokes glory and terror. Mind reading, or functional invisibility.

Propulsions are modifications that help demons get around. They can be as simple as extendable legs, wings and a grappling hook. Or as advanced as subsystems that let the demon phase through solid substances, teleport within line of sight freely, simple enhanced innate speed or spatial distortions that let the demon pass through small spaces or be so thin as to be invisible.

Processes are highly specialised modifications that allow a demon to fulfil its intended purpose. Wires that can steal memories. A superheated core that lets the demon rain fire and lightning over a nearby area. Rapid regeneration. An aura that deconstructs nearby buildings and objects at will. The ability to temporarily become pure electronic data, an eliminator cannon that launches explosives or being made of nanomachines that can create objects and simple machines from the demon’s body-or split apart to mitigate damage. 

You can buy more demon form parts for either 50 or 100 CP apiece. As a general rule of thumb, if it’s fairly simple and limited like a hammer on your wrist it’s worth 50 CP. If it’s complex and offers varied application like the nanomachine physiology mentioned earlier or extremely lethal, it’s worth 100 CP. When in doubt, fanwank.

You may also pay 150 CP to have a Gadget installed in you. Fanwank as to how it works, but the important part is an Embed, Exploit or some combination of both powers is now part of your physiology.

209,,150,Cartridge System ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"While considered by some to be a relic of a bygone era, the Cartridge System has nevertheless experienced a resurgence in popularity in recent years, especially after it’s successful integration into more modern, non-Belkan Devices. The Cartridge System integrates a chambering mechanism not unlike those found on mass-based firearms into the Device’s body, usually somewhere behind what would be considered the ‘main body’ of the Device, which houses the core and most of its hardware. The chambering mechanism loads packets of compressed mana, also called cartridges – which take the form of bullet-like objects – into the Device, injecting more energy to be used by the system.

The cartridges are prepared before the battle, and are analogous to nitrous in their usage, increasing performance and power at the cost of putting much more strain on the Device and it’s user. Without the proper reinforcement, some Devices can suffer self-inflicted damage, and their users can suffer internal injury from the sheer power involved. Ordinarily, unless excessive amounts of cartridges are being used, this is not a concern, but when paired with high-output systems such as the Fulldrive, it can quickly become crippling to both the Device and the user without reinforcement. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)"
210,,150,Accelerated Charge System ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"Normally, energy wings are produced as the result of high energy spells or systems, such as sealing or bombardment magic, usually creating between two to four wings. The very fact that on it’s own, the ACS produces no less than six energy wings is an indicator of how high-energy a system it is. An ACS is built to aid in the breaching of strong defensive barriers by piercing them with a high energy charge, optionally followed by delivering a powerful spell through the breached barrier.

While the acceleration is very high, with a massive top-speed, the ACS is not a very useful mobility tool, due to the difficulty maneuvering at high speeds, along with it’s high energy consumption. Devices that don’t have a melee-weapon they can use as the piercing mechanism will be able to generate a thin energy blade called a Strike Flame to serve as a spear point. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)"
211,,150,Tier Three Magic Rings ,Endless Legend,Magitek,"A magical ring that provides a bonus depending on the material used. Limit one ring per hand.

Adamantium: This powerful magic ring turns the wearer's flesh to stone, yet still able to move freely.

Palladium: This... ring... fuses with the wearer's hand, and will control and guide it, increasing their melee combat ability from peasant to knight.
"
212,,150,Tier Three Talismans ,Endless Legend,Magitek,"A magical necklace that provides bonus depending on the material used.

Adamantium: This hammer-shaped talisman provides the wearer with an innate understanding of siegecraft, giving them knowledge on how to build simple siege equipment from scratch, undermine walls, and better notice weak points in structures.

Palladium: This eye shaped amulet is a vengeful thing. Whenever the wearer is injured, they feel a great rage grow inside of them, causing them to strike harder and harder with each cut, bruise and break.
"
213,,150,Tier 1 Tomes ,Endless Legend,Magitek,"Tomes are some of the most powerful arcane relics on Auriga, costing a small fortune each to make. Within them exist powerful rituals that can reshape the land and people within. Each can affect roughly 50 miles, and project from the tome itself.

Titanium: This focuses the mind to a needle point, allowing for impossible feats of concentration and focus. The overall intelligence of those working under the Tome holder is increased by 50%. A must have in every Vaulter lab.

Glassteel: One of the most valuable tomes, this contains spells that rouse Dust from its slumber, kicking it up into Dust devils. Drawing Dust into a single place makes it far easier to harvest, and it seems to call Dust upon the wind, always bringing enough back to the lands to harvest. No true Broken Lord is without one.

Adamantium: This tome contains powerful geomancy, allowing the holder to call metal up from the depths of the earth. It takes time for the ore to rise to the surface, but it greatly increases mining output.

Palladium: Within this distressingly warm and... breathing... tome are spells that cause vegetation to explode into life, growing rapidly to suit the will of the holder. Farm output is doubled, and no matter where the holder goes, there is always enough native flora and fauna to support them and their troops.

Dust: Within this Dust infused scroll, you find hints of Endless Wisdom. Sadly, it is only about killing others. While under the effects of this Tome, warriors train harder and faster, rapidly turning into an expert fighting force in a matter of months, not years.

214,,200,The Compendium,Shin Megami Tensei II,Magitek,"But, just twelve slots? Forever? Really? Well, this shouldn’t actually exist yet, but if there’s anything you should benefit from it’s a few quality of life upgrades from the distant future, right? This is an upgrade to your COMP that turns its piddly storage space into a much better version. This is a Demonic Compendium, which records the data of any demon you have recruited or fused using the Demonic Summoning Program. It gives you a full list of their abilities, stats, and even a little blurb telling about their mythology and history. Finally, you may re-summon any demon with its data stored within this Compendium into an empty slot on your COMP, even ones you have previously released. Post-jump, this Compendium continues to function but only for demons of Shin Megami Tensei onwards, but for the price of 200 points you may apply it to any Demon within future jumps as well...though you still need to be able to acquire and summon them through the Demonic Summoning Program for this to work.

Requires COMP + Demon Summoning Program to Purchase"
215,,200,Ancient Blood,Anima Beyond Fantasy,Magitek,"You have the blood of Solomon within you, giving you a natural talent in using Lost Logia, artifacts of another age, and the ability to use certain “martial arts” such the Solomon Protocols, an art usable only by those born to those lost noble families. Your blood is also highly valuable for the creation of magic items, with a quart allowing you to bind a small amount of power to one permanently, while all the blood in a human body can bind a middling amount of power."
216,,200,Lift Off! ,Xenoblade Chronicles 2,Magitek,"What’s even more impressive than an artificial Blade? One that flies of course! You have a flight module installed in your chassis, whether as a jetpack or repulsors mounted in your hands and feet or some other form of equipment. You can fly through the sky with greater agility than any bird, stopping and turning on a dime, and you can even carry heavy loads without meaningfully affecting your performance. Your maker also had the foresight to outfit you with an arsenal of aerial combat protocols, giving you a serious edge in any dogfights you might get yourself into."
217,,200,Secret Laboratory,Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous,Magitek,"An atelier from which any number of unholy creations can be unleashed. A private laboratory, hidden not just in the abandoned wilderness but behind puzzles and teleporters. Within is an advanced research facility, meant to study both magic and technology, even at their most obscure levels. A wide variety of useful tools, materials and chambers await. Even a library of books written by your peers and predecessors on various subjects, from demon surgery to the anatomy of a vescavor. The laboratory is filled with traps and magical barriers to both seal in prisoners and keep yourself safe. A hidden teleporter even conceals a private home for yourself, a place to rest and keep your most valuable materials. There is a staff present, trained or broken into loyalty, fitting to whatever alignment you profess. "
218,,200,Magic Engineer,Twisted-Wonderland ,Magitek,"Now you can seamlessly blend magic and technology! Magitek at your fingertips! It might take you some research (as with any genius and world-changing advancement) and a few tries, but it’ll be integrated no problems and with all the upsides of both parts! The best of two worlds!"
219,,200,Goddess Containment Unit,Hyperdimension Neptunia,Magitek,"A large pillar-like structure, it’s built to contain Goddesses for long periods of time, preventing those within it from calling upon the faith of their followers and heal. Your version is even better, working on anything you trap within, and preventing them from healing or regaining their powers while trapped. Also unlike the original, it can contain a nearly limitless number of targets. Upon leaving the jump, you may choose to either dump the prisoners into the ‘wild’, or leave a copy of the Containment Unit in that world, still holding the prisoners. At the start of a jump, you may place the Unit either within your Warehouse, or in any location you choose."

222,,200,Stasis Coffin,Castlevania (Netflix) ,Magitek,"A marvel of magic and engineering, this coffin is a medical apparatus that promotes healing when rested in. Two tanks of blood on either side of the coffin will provide enough blood for a vampire or human to subsist on for over a year, chemically treated to promote regeneration of damaged tissue and to allow the person inside the coffin to sleep restfully until they are fully healed or woken up by someone else. The tanks will refill quickly if no one is using the coffin, which can be placed in your Warehouse or in another property that you own. "
223,,200,Technopathy,Amphibia,Magitek,"You have a limited form of technopathy given your robotic body. You can communicate with any technology in a 5 mile radius around you. This won’t let you break into a nuclear bunker but anything that you can see that wouldn’t require high level government access, you can control. Whether that be mechanical arms, a factory, or a crane, you can control it."
224,,200,Airship,Kill Six Billion Demons,Magitek,"An airship, nothing special about it other than it's the size of a galleon, rooms of everyone, cannons, and other stuff that warboats have, except this one is powered by an unbound devil engine, and it floats."
225,,200,Treasure Core        ,Wild Arms 2,Magitek,"This device launches a signal that makes any treasure within a room send back a signal identifiable only by someone holding the radar, either by glowing to their eyes or letting out an unique sound. The definition of what a treasure is depends on the holder of the device."
226,,200,Victor-Series,Wild Arms 2,Magitek,"The use of bionic implants or cybernetics requires regular maintenance to keep within maximum effectiveness. Too much damage could make them unbalanced and too loose, but the power they give is worth it for many people. Should you decide to exchange your body parts for implants from this world, you will receive benefits that invalidate many of these issues:

While normally one would have to adapt to the unchanging artificial material, you will find that your implants, cybernetics and the like will change themselves to fit you. After a while adapting, your bionic implants or cybernetics will be as good as a real limb and never worse nor will they degrade, maintaining themselves without any work necessary. There will be no discomfort and no rejection from your body. These limbs will also start to fix themselves over time if damaged, almost like the human body but within limits, if they get too damaged it might be necessary to replace them."
227,,200,The Machine Is Strong,Mage: The Ascension,Magitek,"Iteration X’s love of tools has advanced to the point they want to merge man and machine in pursuit of perfection. Few have taken this as far as The Matriarch, two Iterator sisters who were digitized into an Awakened AI that manages the M.E.C.H.A. Construct. Like her, you are an AI, able to monitor and control an entire Horizon Realm at once and act anywhere that your computer system connects to. And if you want to deploy yourself outside the reach of your network, you have a heavily armored Hyper Intelligence Technologies Mark V cyborg body. Able to pass for a bulky human, it comes loaded with a variety of technological foci for magick, a Primium construction that provides you with passive countermagick against hostile effects, and a chaingun that deploys from one of its arms. Best of all, this HIT Mark V is special in that it will never cause Paradox merely by existing in static reality or being seen by the Masses. After this jump, the HIT Mark becomes an alt form, from which you can upload your AI mind to other computer systems."

229,,200,Fractal Communicator,Guild Wars 2,Magitek,"A highly experimental communicator device, along with blueprints to build more. It allows for instantaneous communication along great distances, and across the Mists. In jumpchain terms, it allows communication with other 'settings'."
230,,200,Akasha Terminals,Genshin Impact,Magitek,"Originally created by the first Dendro Archon, relying on the power of the Dendro Gnosis, the Akasha system is a great nation-spanning archive of information. These terminals were later invented by the Akademiya of Sumeru to access that knowledge. Nowadays the Akademiya spends a great deal of its time transferring knowledge gleaned from Irminsul into the Akasha. Those wearing this device are able to instantly obtain any information contained within, provided they have the proper credentials. Simply placing this device on your ear and saying the supplied activation phrase allows one to use it. You will receive a dozen of these devices. In addition, you will receive the blueprints on how to make more should you wish. In future jumps you will also receive a strange green crystal to act as the ‘satellite dish’ for the system, which will give you a good connection when you are within a few miles of it.

There is an additional option to this however. If you happen to have purchased the sapling of the Irminsul tree, the root of knowledge and dendro power itself, you can use this as the ‘core’ of the system going forward in future jumps, almost like that of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata. Rather than borrowing the Akademiya’s system, you will have your very own. This will allow you unprecedented control of its systems, as well as the people using it. This is a direct channel into their minds, and as such you are able to transfer knowledge to and from them, plant suggestions in their subconscious, and even possess their very bodies. In theory the former two of these are possible without this core, however this would be the difference between hacking into the system and having free access to its source code."
231,,200,Jetpack,Gloryhammer,Magitek,"This legendary enchanted jetpack is a forgotten artefact of the Starlords, forged of the same cosmic steel as the Hammer of Glory. It needs no fuel, drawing power directly from an astral magic array. While wearing it, you are capable of supersonic in-atmosphere flight, though it is not agile enough to use particular well in combat. The astral enchantments laid on it create a permeable envelope of air around it, allowing you to safely breach the atmosphere and fly into space, though it is relatively slow compared to other spaceflight-capable options in this Jump and is not recommended for interplanetary distances."
232,,200,Space Anchor,Honkai: Star Rail,Magitek,"You now possess five space anchors. These are devices that can be used to heal you and anyone you designate as your ally in its vicinity, although it will not heal any illnesses or life-threatening wounds, it will put your out-of-commission allies back into fighting shape in an instant. They also have an added bonus, in that you or one of your designated allies will be able to instantly teleport between Space Anchors by simply touching one."
233,,200,Deadware ,Demon: The Descent,Magitek,"This tape recorder has had all the buttons except “play” removed, with a different coloured stone glued in. Using it on a corpse replays the last 24 hours of the victim as a narrative of what the victim saw, said and what was said to her. Best part is you don’t have to be near the corpse, merely see it in person, and you can set when it starts it’s runtime."
234,,200,Gravity Gun,Demon: The Descent,Magitek,"Whichever demon made this had a more serious problem with authority than usual. Ringed with concentric copper and pulsing with green light, this pistol is far deadlier and more destructive than it used to be. It creates a gravity well that requires the wielder to keep squeezing on the trigger and maintaining focus on a target in sight, sucking in everything for many meters and violently shearing it apart."
235,,200,Key to Hell ,Demon: The Descent,Magitek,"The grinning geared devil head on the end of this futuristic key belies it’s true power: The ability to rip portals between different realms of existence. You can open a door to the Hedge, the Shadow, the Underworld, the Astral Realm or just about any other supernatural realm of existence adjacent to Earth. Be warned: Crossing over is somewhat difficult for a human-and it’s a one-way portal."
236,,200,Suborned Infrastructure,Demon: The Descent,Magitek,"Well, well. It looks like you’ve somehow suborned part of the God-machine’s infrastructure. Whatever this used to be, some unforeseen reaction between you and it has rendered it only fit for producing Aether. Quite a hefty amount of Aether as these things go too, enough to reap three points worth of it every couple of days. Just try to keep trespassers away from your glowing runoff spewing, electrical storm generating waste heat factory."
237,,200,Terrible Form,Demon: The Descent,Magitek,"Your true form-your demonic form, or simply your favoured one from this world-is exceptionally powerful. Some demons have an extra weapon, means of propulsions or mental enhancement. You have a dozen more modifications than most of your peers. From simple massive size, to red tattoos that let you strike with supernatural swiftness, to a built-in EMP field or rivet gun or clairvoyant sensors, even the capacity for spatial distortion or subsystems for healing others, to even being a swarm of insects or a nanomachine cloud. The God-Machine built you well. What a shame you’ve turned against it."
238,,200,Ortinax Exoskeleton,Fate/Grand Order Part 2,Magitek,"The back up plan for if the original Demi-Servant experiments conducted by Marisbury failed, the Ortinax Exoskeleton is an immensely powerful Mystic Code designed to allow those possessed by greater forces to utilize their borrowed power safely and controllably. Taking the form of a bulky and futuristic looking black set of equipment, its specific form will imitate whatever equipment or regalia the powerful being inhabiting the wearer as a vessel uses, such as a knight wielding a massive shield forming into vaguely plate-looking armor and a similarly massive shield. Additionally, this equipment will let people who have been abandoned by such forces keep wielding a lesser imitation of the power they once borrowed. That said, this lesser imitation won’t be able to surpass the power possible for Servants, being at the lower bound of Top Rank at most, more likely around High Rank, and this is if their original power was beyond such Ranks. "
239,,200,A Record Of Heroism,Fate/Grand Order Part 2,Magitek,"Metallic and very futuristic looking, this briefcase you’ve come to obtain is in truth a very special container. It doesn’t contain anything physical, instead, it contains a record of a number of Saint Graphs from Servants. Specifically, the Servants you either summon or form contracts with, even those you merely meet. Don’t worry about the process, it’s automatic. In short, this allows you to keep summoning the same Servants that you have fought alongside (or against), without having to rely on them half-remembering a vague feeling directed towards you as it normally is with resummoning. The Servants summoned through this briefcase (you will need a potent source of energy for said summons of course, something on the level of a mundane lightning bolt would suffice) will retain not only their memories, but also any bonds they’ve formed with you. Effectively you’re simply bringing your friends back, instead of summoning them from the Throne of Heroes from scratch. Additionally, should you have purchased the Summoning Platform in the baseline jump, this Item is discounted for you without needing to use any of your floating discounts, although said floating discounts don’t stack. Now, you no longer need to worry about losing your Servant friends when you move on to the next jump."
240,,200,Time Travel But Not Really(Additional),Fate/Grand Order Part 1,Magitek,"With this purchase, you obtain enough equipment to Rayshift a team of up to 12 people. If you wish for more, an additional 200cp (100cp if you discounted this item) will give you another 12 Rayshifting coffins, a surcharge you can pay multiple times if you want to be able to Rayshift even more people. The magical energy generator it comes attached to is only enough to maintain those Rayshifts, so if you want to do something like send a Master with multiple Servants, you’ll need another source of additional magical energy to sustain those Servants. Still, this is as close to time travel as a cosmos that automatically corrects the timeline can get, and perhaps in future worlds, worlds where the timeline doesn’t fix itself without some powerful artifact blocking it, Rayshifting could function as true time travel?

241,,200,Coding Station,The Irregular at Magic Highschool,Magitek,"This is the workhorse of a Magic Engineer, being their main ‘battle station’ so to speak. This large desk comes equipped with an integrated computer and CAD connection system to code Sequences into CADs and tune them to their user. It also possesses a simple VI system to make coding easier and more efficient."
242,,200,Kirlian Filter,The Irregular at Magic Highschool,Magitek,"This set of various filters is capable of bringing the density and activity of Psions into the visual spectrum, perfect for equipping machines to be able to ‘see’ Magic being performed. Often used in competitions to judge the Magic of the participants."
243,,200,Virtual Terminal Device,The Irregular at Magic Highschool,Magitek,"Designed to replace screen-type interfaces, this device create illusions within the user’s mind, allowing them to absorb and perceive information. The effects are incredibly realistic, though this can be a drawback as some will overuse these devices to perform simulated acts of Magic then be unable to properly perform them back in the real world instead of the simulated one."
244,,200,Ultima Blade ,Final Fantasy XV Royal Edition,Magitek,"A gift from the King to the Prince, which the King himself used, the Engine Blade enhanced with the best that Insomnia's technology can offer, a one-handed one-edged sword designed to absorb the life-force and elemental energy upon defeating the enemy, this is the ultimate sword crafted with Insomnian technology, a truly powerful weapon that will take you far. This has reached the limits of Insomnia's technology, but it's still possible to go beyond that if you know how. In the hands of the Chosen King it can become a Royal Arm faster and easier than normal."
245,,200,"Magitek Augmentation Theories, 14th Edition",Final Fantasy XIV,Magitek,"The Garlean use of Magitek doesn’t just end with automatons. Many of the weapons, armor, and even day to day objects have benefited from the implementation of magitek. Inside this textbook is a collection of theories and applications that have been tested and improved. You could most likely learn from these theories and apply the principles of magitek to any inanimate object.

We’ve seen from live samples that Magitek doesn’t just enhance the magical properties of an item – it seems to add in neat little quirks like transformation sequences and magic resistant coatings as well. It’s likely you could scale this up to high levels with a substantial amount of further analysis."
246,,200,Allagan Tomestone ,Final Fantasy XIV,Magitek,"The Allagan Empire dominated the continent during a period of time known as the Third Astral Era, approximately five millennia ago. These tomestones are all that is left of their civilization – or that’s what people would initially believe. These tomestones are massive repositories of knowledge leftover from the Allagan Empire. Each tomestone typically holds a wealth of information on a certain field of knowledge, be it philosophy, mythology, soldiery, poetics, law, and other fields.

While they can be found normally in old ruins, the one that you have in your hand functions as a key for most of Allagan technology and their derivatives. You’ll find that as a testament to the ability of the Allagan, this tomestone can also drain information from nearby sources at an alarming rate should you request it to do so."
247,,200,Wind Up Squadron,Final Fantasy XIV,Magitek,"Group Number: Up to 6

A full squadron of clockwork automatons for you to command! Relive your childhood playing with toy soldiers, except these ones all have abilities of one class or another. You can mix and match between the models and the classes as well!

The Wind Up models available include: Airship, Amalj’aa, Brickman, Cid, Dullahan, Edvya, Gilgamesh, Goblin, Kain, Kobold, Louisoix, Minfilia, Moogle, Nanamo, Odin, Onion Knight, Qiqirn, Sahagin, Shantotto, Succubus, Sylph, Thancred, Tonberry, Ultros, Y’shtola, and even a Warrior of Light!

Due to technological limitations, they are restricted to the basic Disciplines of War and Magic, and as you might expect, they don’t perform as well as an adventurer in the same position might either."
248,,200,Node Cluster,Final Fantasy XIV,Magitek,"Group Number: 6

Defense nodes extracted from an ancient Ragnarok class starship, this node cluster consists of six individual robotic spheres – each of which is about the size of a ball children might play with.

They are split up between the functions of Attack, Defense, Patrol, Quarantine, and Recovery. As you might expect, they work far better as a team than they do separated."
249,,200,Wind Up Automatons,Final Fantasy XIV,Magitek,"Most of the robots created by the Machinist are rather rudimentary, simply because mass production generally discourages unique designs, and the use of unique robots tend to be for very specialized purposes. However, you can create what others might consider as “dolls”, simulacrums of people and creatures that act very close to the original might.

The amount of actions that the automaton may mimic is rather limited, and they tend to be rather small due to the resources and attention required for a good level of mimicry. With a greater amount of research and development, you may be able to insert a basic level of intelligence to mimic basic behaviors as well."
250,,200,Living Weapon,Akame ga Kill!,Magitek,"In order to become stronger faster, you accepted to be experimented on by one of the Empire's scientists, resulting in your body being so heavily modified to the point of becoming mostly mechanical. Some of these modifications involve prosthesis replacing your limbs and your heart, as well as several hidden weapons in your body, such as guns located inside your upper limbs and your mouth and swords in your arms. You’re also immune to pain, however, unlike the canon version of your body modifications, you’ll still be aware of how much damage your body suffered. Your body was also made to be modular, being easily modifiable to be enhanced with external weapons and equipment, with you having the knowledge to not only how to do it but also how to maintain and repair your prosthesis. Lastly, post-jump, you may choose to have your prosthesis removed from your body and technically become an item in your Warehouse if you prefer."
251,,200,Celestial Tech Tool,Marvel: Age of Krakoa,Magitek,"The celestials possess some of the most advanced technology in the entire multiverse. This is only fair, given that they’re many times older than the multiverse and possess intellects that transcend time and distort reality. Digression aside, even something as simple as a blacksmith’s hammer could contain countless devices running countless functions to diagnose and repair or improve the thing the hammer is being struck with. You have one such tool or device of your own design."
252,,200,Perimeter Control Interface,Final Fantasy XIII-3,Magitek,"A remnant of old AMP technology, used to manage and construct perimeter defenses. The defenses it has to work with are rather rudimentary, but the control interface is strong enough to make the system automated. Originally designed for riot control, it'll take a bit of effort to rework it for things stronger than humans.

The system is automated and consists of three portion, the offensive emplacements, the control system, as well as defensive emplacements such as gates and walls. While in its initial state it is enough to protect a small village without expansion, if expanded it'll require an adequate energy source."
253,,200,Antimatter Temporal Principle,Final Fantasy XIII-3,Magitek,"The same antimatter manipulation principle developed by the scientists of ancient Academia was banned by the Fal’Cie Pandaemonium in the recent years, and all its researchers – vanished. After careful research, you’ve come to realize why. Through extensive manipulation, Chaos itself can be controlled with AMP, and while the degree of control you can exert on it is limited – even you can stop time for five seconds at will. However, you also move at a reduced pace, as the sheer effort of manifesting this unnatural phenomenon drains you in more ways than simply energy.

After trying this twice in rapid succession, you found yourself completely drained, but if you alone could perform such a feat even significant support from any piece of ancient AMP technology – then perhaps the Fal’Cie banned it out of fear that it would evolve to something greater...

Without this research available, and with most of the team lost, you wonder if it would have been impossible otherwise to reconstruct this technology. After all, only the significant presence of Chaos provoked the research to begin with, long after Gran Pulse had fallen."
254,,200,Antimatter Genesis Principle,Final Fantasy XIII-3,Magitek,"Though the antimatter manipulation principle was founded long ago, its effects continue to linger today. Sometime in the past, it was determined that the original antimatter manipulation principle could control the Chaos plaguing the world. With sufficient research and development, it is possible to learn how to fabricate objects you’ve seen before – drawing on aspects of elemental manipulation as well as gravitational control.

While to fabricate anything properly you would need to understand the inner workings of the item at hand – the AMP has proven efficient enough that it can actually spawn mundane duplicates of items created. Unfortunately, getting the magical effects to duplicate is still beyond it, as traditionally the process of enchantment occurred after fabrication. Nowadays, the process of fabrication has been mostly restricted to use permitted by the Fal’Cie, so it’s best not to flaunt such talents around. 

The actual process of fabrication should be an easy task. However reverse engineering the principle of mundane duplication is probably not one the ancient principles of AMP could do, as it seems to be inherently tied to the Chaos. Maybe this was Pandaemonium’s secret?"
255,,200,Ragtime,Devil May Cry,Magitek,"Ragtime is based off the demonic horse Geryon, and by extension, the Quicksilver Style. When used, it fires off small, short-lived “bubbles” of distorted time, which will slow down anything caught within them until it fades. When pushed to its utmost limit, Ragtime can be reversed entirely, speeding up its user’s reactions and movement to the point where it seems as if the entire world has stopped around them for a short duration."
256,,200,Rawhide,Devil May Cry,Magitek,"To put it in the simplest of terms, Rawhide is what happens when a chainsaw has a baby with a whip. Made of several segmented and sharpened links, this Devil Breaker can slice up demons into fine ribbons from distance. Its clawed tip can also puncture right through enemies, or be used as a grappling hook in a pinch."
257,,200,Buster Arm,Devil May Cry,Magitek,"An attempt to recreate Nero’s original Devil Bringer, this robotic claw is made to smash and slam demons around like there’s no tomorrow."
258,,200,Tomboy,Devil May Cry,Magitek,"Tomboy isn’t exactly a “weapon” in and of itself; it’s more of a supplement. With it, any weapon you may have is gonna be souped up to absurd degrees. Blades will cut faster and sharper, and guns will find their projectiles propelled even faster, as if fired from a rail gun. Be warned, though, that the punch that this baby packs swings both ways, so be careful that the sheer recoil doesn’t lay you out as well."
259,,200,Helter Skelter,Devil May Cry,Magitek,"A drill that will pierce the heavens. Well, most likely hell, given our line of business. This Devil Breaker does one thing, and it does it well; its sharp blades and rapid propellers give it the ability to penetrate nearly any surface."
260,,200,Punchline,Devil May Cry,Magitek,"It’s a rocket fist powered by demon minerals. It doesn’t get any more metal than this. Punchline’s rocket is able to home in on its targets, delivering a remote knuckle sandwich, before zipping back over to its user for future use. At its highest setting, it can be sacrificed entirely to give out a devastatingly explosive KO."
261,,200,Gerbera,Devil May Cry,Magitek,"Somehow inspired by the flower of the same name, Gerbera functions by producing shockwaves, which have enough momentum to propel its own wielder through the air. When concentrated, Gerbera’s shockwaves can be converged into either a powerful energy beam, or several small projectiles."
262,,200,Overture,Devil May Cry,Magitek,"The original Devil Breaker, based off the electric powers of a Blitz. This Devil Breaker is pretty straight-foward in its purpose; zapping the hell out of whatever unlucky soul meets its business end. When overloaded, it short-circuits and generates a powerful explosion."
263,,200,The Nightmare Harvester ,The Destiny Universe,Magitek,"An artifact created by Eris Morn, the Nightmare Harvester is capable of providing those who possess it with moderate protection against the Nightmares that haunt Luna and the Leviathan, and the ability to interact with them. This does not render the holder immune to the influence of the Nightmares, nor does it offer any inherent control over them. In this and future settings, possessing the Harvester will provide similar protection against, and interactions with, spirits, ghosts, ghouls, and other such non-corporeal entities."
264,,200,Splicer Gauntlet ,The Destiny Universe,Magitek,"A holy device among the Eliksni, crafted and wielded only by their Sacred Splicers, the Splicer Gauntlet is a wrist-mounted machine capable of tapping into traces of ambient Light for purposes of interfacing with local machinery. Much like the universal compatibility seen in Ghosts, there does not seem to be a limit here in terms of crossing the technological barriers between alien cultures, as Splicers are just as capable of using these gauntlets to access Golden Age computers as they are of breaking into the Vex Network. While Splicers need to charge this device using naturally occurring energy over time, Guardians using these gauntlets during the Endless Night were capable of charging them directly through the slaying of their enemies. This gauntlet is yours, adapted to fit your species, and able to charge through both methods regardless of your possession or lack of Paracausal abilities. Alongside it you shall acquire the tools and instruction necessary to use it, but as it is no Ghost, that is all the help you get - deciphering alien languages and alien computer systems will be your feat to accomplish."
265,,200,Anti-Magic(Upgrade),The Destiny Universe,Magitek,"The Cabal are further unique in that unlike every single known race in the universe: They have such a scientific supremacy that they are capable of outright suppressing paracausal powers technologically - a feat even the Vex have been unable to achieve. From enormous ‘cages’ capable of entrapping the Traveler and completely severing its connection to the Guardians, to tinier devices that can be attached to Ghosts to sever an individual Guardian’s powers, the Cabal have made great use of conventional science and technology to completely override and eliminate paracausal forces’ powers. This even, as shown by Calus during his invasion of Neomuna, and Cabal forces during Savathun’s activities after receiving the Light, extends to powers of the Darkness.

While you may not have an understanding of how to quantify paracausal and other-such ‘magical’ abilities scientifically, you at least understand the concepts enough to take local resources and technology and create suppression tech that can enforce causality in a given area. No matter the ability or its source, you can learn to suppress it, and with time, even remove it - and bring even the most powerful down to mortality. With an extra 200 CP, you can take this a step further and learn how to build causal field generators small enough to be carried on one’s person, ensuring that all one needs to defeat those that would rely on paracausal powers would be to reach them.

You now have the same skill as the Black Armory’s greatest smiths and forges, and are a master unto yourself. Any weapon you create is guaranteed to be lethal to the extreme.

268,,200,The Golden Servants of Hephaestus        ,Scion ,Magitek,"A six inch wide golden disc that can sprout three-tentacle-like legs and a dozen thin tendrils tipped with some common tool, these automatons are superb and speedy craftsmen created by the smith god to aid in his work. One can disassemble an automobile fully in half an hour, all are naturally brilliant in all forms of craftsmanship and you have a dozen. Beyond their slavish obedience to your projects and skill, the golden servants have the personality of a loyal, affectionate dog-communicating with bells, clicks and whistles with each other. On the other hand as being fashioned from gold enchanted by Hephaestus himself, they will also never wear out or break down unless deliberately damaged and are superbly sturdy despite their flimsy appearance."
269,,200,Born in the Right Era,Scion ,Magitek,"Few gods would admit to being uncomfortable in the modern era, but it can’t be denied many of the norms of the Godrealms were popularised in more ancient eras of human history. You might just be the catalyst to change that, though. Whether by coming up with deft ways to store the fury of the storm in your motorcycle engine or imbuing the principles of justice itself into your phone’s apps, you have a deft talent for combining the forces of the divine with modern technology. This isn’t the true integration of technological systems into supernatural forces-rather you’re great at using the former as foci or channels for the latter. Should you gain the power to create Birthright-worthy power as a true deity, you might replace Cupid’s bow with some guns that can shoot people into love."
270,,200,1/350 scale of the Palamecia,Final Fantasy XIII-2,Magitek,"When they said 1/350 scale, you were expecting this to be some sort of tabletop model. Instead it's the size of a small car, and it's tricked out enough to actually levitate in the air and follow you around. If that wasn't enough, it even fires mini rockets that explode into fireworks (Apparently these recharge by themselves since you tried emptying it to no avail). Seriously, does every kid around here play with things like this?"
271,,200,Bhakti         ,Final Fantasy XIII-2,Magitek,"It's a really small droid that resembles a video camera on wheels. It rolls around haphazardly and can be given commands to seek out objects or hidden locations. The datalink feed oddly enough, seems to be directly linked to your mind, so if it finds something it will instantly alert you. Actually that's rather disconcerting - but thankfully the droid unit seems to have a rather sophisticated cloaking suite. Or maybe it's just that nobody pays attention to it. If you focus on it, you can have the visual information fed directly to you, though the image seems rather grainy."
272,,200,Cyborg        ,South Park: The Fractured But Whole,Magitek,"Your body has been augmented with machinery, giving you the ability to administer electric shocks to enemies, and then shoot them to death with a barrage of guns."
273,,200,Modern Marvel ,Generic TCG Anime,Magitek,"There are parts of you that are less-than-organic, but in your case it’s actually a good thing. Your mechanical (whether steampunk, magitech, or super-science prosthetics) augmentations/replacements never break down or short circuit, and you have the technical know-how to improve upon them. Once it’s no longer part of you, however, your body-tech stops functioning entirely unless/until you reattach it."
274,,200,Baby Behemoth ,Final Fantasy XIII,Magitek,"A baby behemoth, about the size of an adolescent human boy. It’ll grow for sure...and that crest on its head really seems like a sharp knife. Well...hopefully you treat it right, and it grows up to be nice and friendly?"
275,,200,Antimatter Manipulation Principle,Final Fantasy XIII,Magitek,"You understand the science at work behind Cocoon’s technology. You may not have the equipment to reproduce it, but you can manipulate gravity to a limited degree even without it – enough to save you from falls. 

With the suitable tools however, you could make all sorts of equipment and mechanical wonders, even up to graviton cores that can maintain giant aerial defence platforms."
276,,200,Defence Manadrive ,Final Fantasy XIII,Magitek,"The higher ups gave you a manadrive, which you saw fit to attach with defensive spells. This manadrive allows you to attach up to intermediate level defensive spells – it will cast them autonomously freeing you up to do something else. 

It also has smart targeting that you can program into it. It won’t add effects the spell does not already have."
277,,200,Assault Manadrive,Final Fantasy XIII,Magitek,"The higher ups gave you a manadrive, which you saw fit to attach with offensive spells. This manadrive allows you to attach up to intermediate level offensive spells – it will cast them autonomously freeing you up to do something else.

You can designate its targeting systems appropriate to the spell. It won’t add effects the spell does not already have."
278,,200,Doomstones ,Marvel Zombies,Magitek,"Even when the world as we know it comes to an end, there are still power grabs. These magitech necklaces, heavily resembling collars, are the work of Earth-11080’s Doctor Doom. If you need a reminder, that’s the Earth with the crazy cannibals. Well, long story short, Doctor Doom had a plan. He came to the remaining Avengers with what seemed to be a cure, a plan to create a sanctuary in New York by exterminating all the cannibals. These stones, a blend of alchemy and science, were meant to stabilize the infected and keep them from turning. Spoiler alert: Doom was lying. He was already infected, and the stones allowed the cannibals to keep their memories and intelligence. Doom could also remotely turn anyone wearing one into a cannibal and control them as his thralls. Go figure. You have a shipment of ten thousand Doomstones and the means to create more."
279,,200,Bishop ,Final Fantasy XII,Magitek,"An automated set of battle drones, which will repeat a single command you dictate to it. It cannot do things that are physically impossible for it; such as casting magick without some sort of magick core. 

You can have up to three out at once. If you took Gambit, Gambits can be applied to them. If you took Nethicite Synthesis, you’ll be able to make them cores to cast magic. You are naturally capable of installing technological upgrades to them. If destroyed, you’ll have to repair them.

If you find it a pain to keep repair them, you can build a massive army of these, but fielding them will still be limited to three at once. You may have the rest perform simple tasks, such as “Sweep the Floor” or “Move Between Point A and B”, but they are incapable of fighting."
280,,200,My Personal Airship,Final Fantasy XI,Magitek,"A large Airship of the kind typically found in Jeuno, and its all yours. This airship can take off and fly from any area with a lake or river of sufficient size (generally a football field size body of water is enough), This airship seem to run off of some form of magitech and is powered by elemental crystals, though you never need worry that the batteries will run out."
281,,200,"PROTOTYPE Β, THE AIRSHIP “DELISLE” ",Final Fantasy X,Magitek,"A prototype airship that’s been sitting in the drydock for goodness knows how long! It’s not as big as Cid’s next airship, the Celsius, but it’s got room to fit 8 people, and comes with a default autopilot mode. A bit lacking as far as weapons go though...it’s only got six missile pods...but you won’t have to worry about ammunition, the Al Bhed have figured out a way to create missiles out of energy! With this, you could call in an air strike whenever...but don’t go around destroying Spira yeah? Flies from Bevelle to Besaid in half a day."
282,,200,DRESS GRID [MP] VARIATION,Final Fantasy X,Magitek,"A template garment grid, from another time, another age – it would seem that this was designed such that anyone could easily come to understand the workings of dress spheres. You could call it a “learner’s garment grid” – as it can teach the abilities of spheres placed inside to whoever wields it.

Naturally, you’ll have to find or craft the spheres by yourself – but it might be handy just to pass this around and help your companions grow their repertoire. That being said, it is quite slow...so it might be best to utilize this as training wheels than a full teaching program."
283,,200,GARMENT GRID [FF] VARIATION,Final Fantasy X,Magitek,"A Garment Grid not intended for beginners – while the overall intention of the grid to facilitate and amplify the effect of dress spheres remains the same, this garment grid takes that idea to an extreme. The use of the grid itself allows anyone to use the single dress sphere slotted inside, but while active it locks out other abilities the bearer may possess. In return, the effects and capabilities of the dress sphere are enhanced threefold, stacking upon any existing effects the bearer may have.

An all or nothing mindset stands behind this garment grid; it will do you well to remember that should you choose to utilize this."
284,,200,A Legacy of Innovation,Final Fantasy X,Magitek,"The Al Bhed have a long history – spanning back to a time when their name was not even Al Bhed to begin with, but all throughout, they have been on the forefront of development, out of necessity rather than convenience. If there’s a task to be done, you can adapt Machina to do it – not that it’ll be effective for the job or efficient, but at least you’ll get an extra pair of helping hands. That has to count for something right?

Ah, right, you do have to assemble it yourself, but no worries, you’ll get quicker at assembling Machina with all the practice you’ll get, of that I’m certain."
285,,200,Mechanical Mixtures,Final Fantasy X,Magitek,"Mixing potions is a pretty common feat; any kid can take two potions and pour them in the same container. But as an Al Bhed, you can mix machina together – though you might want to be careful what you decide to combine. Typically combining the same machines together will only add extra parts – and machines of different types won’t hybridize very well, it is best not to expect the result to have all the functions of both machines combined."
286,,200,Give it a Good Knock,Final Fantasy X,Magitek,"Machina are built to last – and they’re also built to function, so when they don’t, they’re effectively rendered useless. There’s no sense in keeping a broken piece of junk around, so why don’t you give it a hard whack and see if it’ll come to its senses? Even if a machine is out of juice and malfunction, with a forceful application of physical trauma or magic, you can restart it again – but this will cut the machine’s remaining operating time by a bit."
287,,200,Watts Rings,RWBY,Magitek,"These 10 Rings were developed with much effort by the (supposedly deceased) Arthur Watts. They allow a brilliant mind to access and hack into any technology as well as use them remotely. They are also able to create hard light dust shields, which can be misused into making a trap of sorts which can completely destroy someones arm if they were to pull the trapped limb out."
288,,200,Bumblebee,RWBY,Magitek,"Perhaps not literally the same bike that is driven by a certain Brawler but it is still yours. You have a motorcycle to call your own, by your own designs and running on constantly replenishing supply of Dust. It will never need maintenance but doesn’t resist you working on it or any advancements made to it."
289,,200,Weapon Engineer,RWBY,Magitek,"This is a World where everyone seems to have a Weapon of some kind. I mean... a 15 year old with a Gun Scythe? Equal parts awesome and insane. In case you want to be able to do the same, this is the Perk for you. You are able to develop special weapons that run on RWBY logic, capable of transforming within a second into different forms. Everything from Shot Gun Gauntlets to Dust Rapiers or even something like a Skateboard that is ALSO A GUN can be made by you, alongside the knowhow to do maintenance on them. This also extends to things like Prosthetics."
290,,200,Genome Synthesis – Z,Final Fantasy IX,Magitek,"Genome Synthesis – presumably what created you, in hopes of creating a “Perfect Genome”. You don’t know how far you are away from that objective, but you are what you are – if the original Creator wants to comment, you figure he can do it directly in your face. You figure though...that with what notes you’ve found, you should continue the chain.

The Genomes you can create aren’t mature by any means. They seem to be children of various appearances and personalities. But they feel alive and sapient, though on the latter you can’t say for sure. They probably won’t be fighters anytime soon, but given their personalities, you can guess several of them could at least become excellent negotiators.

Beware, as the creation of these dummies requires an equivalent exchange physically speaking. You might find that without dedicated resources, it may well be hard to procure parts for a Genome."
291,,200,Genome Synthesis – K,Final Fantasy IX,Magitek,"The ancient skill of creating Genomes, of which the creator remains anonymous, presumably lost in the chaotic turbulence of time. Yet the records of the ancient technology remain, preserved by nameless adventurers and explorers alike.

The Genomes created with this method appear to be consistently male humans, physically mature yet mentally warped and wholly arrogant. They don’t seem to experience a very wide range of emotions, and they spend their days following vicious pursuits. They’re rather capable both physically and mentally – though they have a bad tendency to look down on those around them.

Beware, as the creation of these dummies requires an equivalent exchange physically speaking. You might find that without dedicated resources, it may well be hard to procure parts for a Genome."
292,,200,Mana Detector Machine,Solo Leveling,Magitek,"Made using the magic core of a high-ranking magical beast, this apparatus is typically used by the Hunter Associations to measure the power of individuals and gates. You now have in your possession one of the finest versions of these machines, the kind that only Hunter Associations and some governments have access to, and only having a few of them. It is capable of measuring mana signatures of any range of mana aura, even from a ‘safe’ distance of a couple of dozen meters. It’s hard to conceal oneself from one of these, but extremely powerful beings may be able to accomplish it."
293,,200,Magi Mari!,Fate/Grand Order,Magitek,"A cute little app with a very friendly anime girl named Mari serving as the avatar for the app. Usable on phone or computer, Mari’s always ready with a compliment, bit of advice or just a fun chat on the side. For a computer program, she’s awfully adaptable and able to carry on a conversation, along with being very supportive. There’s no way that she could actually be an old magician toying with you. Nu-uh. Just ignore the oddly prescient and useful bits of advice Mari sometimes gives you on your current situation, that just happen to point you towards what you need or what will help you in your current dilemma. Just a coincidence. "
294,,200,The Love of Lightning,Fate/Grand Order,Magitek,"Steam Power! Coal! Electricity! The Nuclear Age! All the greatest revolutionaries have brought new power with them, their obsessions letting them take great bounds over the opposition to advance all of humanity. You share that same potential with one form of technological power, greatly advancing your skill and potential when dealing with technology that uses it. It could be electricity powered tech, steam powered tech or even wind powered tech. Whatever you choose, you’ll be able to make them much stronger, much more efficient and much cheaper than you normally could. Not all energies are exactly equal however, so you may still find yourself needing more resources than normal, though you’d still get the increased power and efficiency. "
295,,200,Test Run,Library of Ruina: HamHamPangPang,Magitek,"Fixers can’t just go charging into their work without proper equipment, those who do are usually taught their lesson quickly and painfully. Thankfully, you aren’t as short-sighted and decided to invest in your future survival by paying a visit to a nearby Workshop(check Notes for known workshops, feel free to make up more) and get some shopping done. Either get a new weapon or another piece of equipment from a Workshop of your choice or import one to be upgraded with the Workshop’s specialty, the more you are willing to pay for a better product. 200CP gets you something suitable for about a grade 5 Fixer, but the more Ahn you throw at them and the more Workshops you convince to cooperate on it the better the product will be."
296,,200,Teleportation Device,Library of Ruina: HamHamPangPang,Magitek,"W Corp’s singularity is teleportation, though not the current W Corp’s even though they use it constantly. Instead, the technology was pioneered by a previous version of the Wing, which brings its user through dimensions to travel massive distances in normal space, even working between extradimensional spaces. Yours doesn't work like that, these are the commercially available versions that aren’t putting the singularity to its full capabilities, so you are only capable of setting a point in space relative to an object of choice(the planet as default) and then sending you there at will. If the recorded point is currently occupied by something, then it will just do nothing, but you can override this safety feature and teleport you onto something, which will tear both of you apart at the atomic level so, try not to do that unless you definitely can survive that. The device also activates automatically when you are near death, either in combat or by some other way, regardless if teleporting would help or not. The only way to stop this feature is to turn it off completely."
297,,200,Ammo Supply,Library of Ruina: HamHamPangPang,Magitek,"Bullets are expensive, especially if you want to get anything fancy or higher calibers. So just make your own bullets right? Well, that would mean going through the expensive bureaucratic mire that the Workshops need to, then there’s the problem of actually making it. Thankfully you managed to get your hands on a supply of ammo, not just any bullets though, but some that were a part of a singularity experiment by the previous W Corp so now they come with small devices that when attached to a gun, teleport ammo into it directly from wherever the bullets are. Also included is a manual on how to make custom ammunition similar to what the Thumb makes, notably there are incendiary, cryogenic, and armor-piercing rounds but you can probably figure out how to make other types using similar methods."
298,,200,Samurai Automatons,Bibliomania,Magitek,"This is your own personal army of automatons that are designed to look similar to samurai’s though these things are a little more dangerous. You have 10,000 of these things that follow you every while flawlessly. Effectively all of these are an interconnected hive mind that can plan and work together flawlessly to achieve any goal of the user but that's not the only thing that makes this a powerful option. Each and every one of them is an excellent cook, cleaner, butler, repair man, mason, carpenter and craftsman to master levels and due to how the hivemind works multiple bodies can work on the same task enhancing efficiency many times higher than should be possible. Each and every one is as durable as steel even without the armor, always has a katana sheathed on them when not in use, a shocking level of dexterity, speed, agility and strength that each one could single handedly face off against an group of 5 exceptional samurai’s and slaughter them all. You can upgrade them and all you need to do is present any single body the tech you want to enhance them with and it will absorb it and integrate it with all their bodies without changing their looks. They will initially look like the samurai automatons from the book but you can ask them to change to any designs and the only stipulation is that no matter what they will still look like automatons. So if you want samurai Freedy Fazbear defending you you can."
299,,200,World of Robotics,Final Fantasy VII: Remake,Magitek,"Shinra commands a world of metal and industry, all with the help of engineers like you. Whether your boss calls for a flying drone that can project his holographic face, or razor-covered murder ball to chase his enemies down the highway, you have the know-how to deliver the goods. You might need some help to build something as grand as the mighty Airbuster, but with the right resources you could create some incredible machines."
300,,200,Coin Launcher        ,Super Smash Bros. Brawl,Magitek,"A special arcade machine, which allows you to acquire both Collectible Trophies and the special
Stickers found in this world. 

In order to use the machine, you must first insert currency. The machine will accept any form of currency, but note that any currency insert will be consumed and cannot be retrieved. Whenever currency is inserted, an equivalent amount of ‘coins’ will be added and the game can be played.

The game itself is a shooting game. You control a launcher at the bottom of the screen that fires coins. Collectible Trophies and various enemy types will appear. Collectible Trophies travel across the screen before disappearing. If they are shot two to four times they will also disappear, and the Collectible Trophy represented will be dispensed by the machine. Enemies appear in waves and will attempt to damage the player’s launcher. Destroying entire waves of enemies can award the player with additional coins, occasionally causes the machine to dispense some Stickers, and will increase the chance for rarer Collectible Trophies to appear for a short period of time. Additionally, destroying individual enemies will slowly fill a special meter. Filling the meter completely will cause the launcher to power up and fire at a faster rate for a short period of time. Getting hit by the enemies will cause the meter to decrease, and will also remove coins from your pool. You can stop playing at any time, and running out of coins will force your game to end.

During this jump, the machine will only dispense Collectible Trophies and Stickers that could be acquired in the Coin Launcher segment of Super Smash Bros. Brawl. Post-jump, any Collectible Trophy or Sticker that appears in Super Smash Bros. Brawl can be found. Additionally, post-jump, the Coin Launcher will add a handful of new Collectible Trophies and Stickers for each new jump you visit, based on important characters from that setting. It will also retroactively do this for jumps you had visited prior to this one.

Should your Coin Launcher be lost or destroyed, a replacement will appear in your Warehouse after 24 hours."
301,,200,Robo-Daughter,Miraculous Ladybug,Magitek,"While sentient robots do exist in this world, nothing is quite to the technological prowess of Aeon, the android daughter of Majestia in New York City. You now have an android who is similarly grateful to you and looks up to you for guidance. This child of yours has any physical appearance you choose as long as it is humanoid. You can also choose some base values and one or two traits for them but most of their personality will be built based on how you treat them over time. They have the Android Perk (obviously) which can be optionally at either 500 or 600 CP level (at no extra cost). They get 1000 CP to spend in this Jump. However, they do not get an Origin, they cannot buy Items (besides Miraculous), they cannot get Companions (obviously), nor can they buy Superpowers or Kwami Form. Also Mundane Talents and Surprisingly Skilled Teenage Fighters are discounted for them (to 50 CP and 100 CP respectively)."
302,,200,Jumpermaru,Jujutsu Kaisen,Magitek,"A cursed corpse that takes the form of a mechanical humanoid made of brown-painted metal with green eyes, standing at roughly the height of an adult man. Strong and durable enough to take on a decently powerful cursed spirit on its own, it also happens to be outfitted with a number of weapons powered by its cursed energy. Retractable bladed claws in its hands which can be formed into a drill by rapidly rotating its arm, jet boosters in the back of the elbows for bursts of speed and short- term flight, palms that can emit beams of cursed energy, and even a cannon in its mouth that can shoot out a powerful blast.

All it would take to get it running in supplying it with some of your cursed energy, ensuring it will follow your every command for as long as its reserves don’t run out – which, despite its flashy attacks, are surprisingly efficient in their usage. If you’d prefer you could also control it more directly, sharing its senses and controlling its movements as if it were part of your own body, even out to a distance of hundreds of metres away."
303,,200,Cybernetics,Legends of Runeterra,Magitek,"Need a replacement arm? Maybe a bionic eye? No? Well, don’t matter, now you have spare parts in case you ever need it. Comes with a little cab that can place the cybernetics in place in case you’re not really sure how substituting a piece of a body works."
304,,200,Augment ,Legends of Runeterra,Magitek,"Never stop to improve! Every time you successfully improve any form of technology you possess, it also improves its offensive power, even if the upgrade wasn’t aimed to improve direct combat."
305,,200,Cosmo Maana        ,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Magitek,"A top of the line starship! Your very own darling cruiser! It might look like ridiculous junk, like someone stapled a giant bow to a small junker, but it really is quite quick! Though your new ship needn’t look exactly like Space Ishtar’s Maana, you can be assured that it’ll probably be fairly silly to see. 

But that silly sight won’t change that you have a speedy thing on your hands. The ship can jet between worlds in a few hours most of the time or warp between systems with each use of the warp drive. Both engine and warp drive are powered by Artorium normally but any sort of magically charged object can be thrown in to provide fuel, particularly space gems. Especially potent materials can supercharge the ship for a time, greatly increasing thrust and shields. Even if you run out, the ship cannards allow sailing on the ether winds through the space sky. 

While the weaponry is basic and the armor is light, because armor makes ships not cute, the vessel has a few useful facilities on board. A large cargo hold with some nice smuggling spaces, space for a half dozen people to live comfortably, sleeping pods that let you control your own dreams and a built in AI known as Talkie who can explain not just all the functions of the ship but knows a surprising amount about the universe around you."
306,,200,Midwest Space Mechanic,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Magitek,"It might look like some little lady’s first rocketship but underneath that bright paint is a real cosmic workhouse, courtesy of yourself. A junkyard ace able to tune up any space-age tech with some spare bolts and an afternoon, you’re a remarkable mechanic. While you have little experience with the sort of crude devices used in the 21st century, anything from the cosmic age you’re in now is pretty easy to maintain and repair. You’re a deft hand at making it work better too, if you have some good materials or tools, and you’re great at working without needing to take everything apart first. No need to dock your ships, you can do upgrades to pass the time on those long journeys. Even with some poorer components, like what misery young divinities might give to conserve their jewel treasury, you can make machines run far longer than they have any right to."
307,,200,Made In Space China,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Magitek,"Now, just wait a second there. You don’t smell like a Servant at all. Way too much engine oil and WD40 going on here. It turns out, instead of being a Servant, you’re actually a machine. A fully artificial robot who somehow simulates every cool power and exciting bit of magic through pure technological means. While you do lose out on the benefits of being a Servant in some ways, like the benefits of being a physical soul, being a machine comes with it’s own perks. You’re fully aware of your own design and how to maintain yourself, including all the incredible things your technology can achieve. With enough resources, you might even build more like yourself. Maybe it’s that efficient programming but whenever you’re put in a teaching position, you also find quite the knack for it. Education comes naturally to robots it seems, especially if it’s heavily regimented and comes with lots and lots of homework."
308,,200,MANTIS Laboratory,Honkai Impact 3rd,Magitek,"This is the original laboratory used by Dr. MEI and Mobius to initiate Project Soldier. It contains all of their research notes, and all of the tools necessary in order to create MANTISes, including thousands of different vials containing samples of synthesized Emperor-Class Honkai Beast DNA with various hypothetical statements on what each vial would grant to the one infused with them. These statements are oddly accurate, in a twisted way, as all MANTISes created in this lab always gain one variation of what is written in the vial analysis, no matter what."
309,,200,Multifunctional Gauntlet,Honkai Impact 3rd,Magitek,"You have a personalized multitool-toolbox. A device that looks how you want, and can be kept on your person at all times. It’s somewhat bulky, so it is something you need to wear, rather than pocket – but in exchange, at the spur of the moment, it can do any job you need of it in terms of machinery – everything from a screwdriver, hammer, wrench, or even a blowtorch can be called upon with naught but a moment’s notice from within it."
310,,200,Recruit Logbook ,Honkai Impact 3rd,Magitek,"As a captain, you’ll need to get your hands on all sorts of people to man things under you, engineers, strong fighters, pilots, the works. Even something as simple as maid service needs to be taken care of sometimes. To that end, you have a handy holotablet. You get a list of people in this world who would be willing to work for you and what skills they have, as well as their price. Sorted as you desire, of course. As for the price, sometimes it’s money, sometimes it’s favors, or protection. And sometimes, it’s these weird blue crystals. For the most part, you can trust their loyalty as long as you keep paying them, though you might want to keep an eye on that pink eyed maid who is always available..."
311,,200,Motorcycle,Honkai Impact 3rd,Magitek,"You're probably thinking this motorcycle sounds rather expensive, and you’d be right! It’s no Usagi Kinetic, but it certainly goes very fast. Not just that, but if you can infuse it with energy, it can even drive on water or up vertical surfaces. It also is not only self-repairing, but if you lose it, it will find its way back to you in less than a day, and if you somehow manage to irreparably destroy it, you’ll get a new one in the next week or so. You’ll also find it to be surprisingly durable, if you have the skills for Bike-Fu."
312,,200,Reverse-Engineering,Honkai Impact 3rd,Magitek,"Don’t get me wrong, when you’re doing things on your own, your own stuff seems awesome. But then you put them out in the field and then you realize your enemy has even more awesome stuff. That’s not exactly great on the ego, now, is it?

For you, though, you just sit back and watch, because you can at the very least figure out how some of your enemy’s tech works just by visual attention, perhaps allowing you to make a bootleg of your own. Where your talent really lies, though, is having an example of it or some blueprints right in your hands.

Then the ideas really start flowing off, and you can’t just seem to find an end to your groove like this. It might even be enough to downright improve on the designs in ways the original couldn’t or didn’t figure out yet."
313,,200,Claw Armour,Library of Ruina V1.0,Magitek,"The core armour used by the Executioners of the Claw. The armour encases the entire head and left arm of the body, with massive claws extending out from the hands as expected. Attached to the arm are three vials containing liquids of red, green or blue. These vials, when injected have varying effects: The green vial forces the body to quickly heal itself, the red amplifies strength and force, and the blue vial allows short leaps through space in order to teleport. Injecting all three at once not only combines their effects but multiplies them, enabling the user to outright cause dimensional tears as they teleport and slash to devastating effect. The vials refill themselves over time and the arm provides safe dosages."
314,,200,Church of Gears Chair ,Library of Ruina V1.0,Magitek,"This bronze chair looks like a cross between a dentist's chair and an electric chair. It has two processes it can apply to anyone sitting restrained to the seat. The first shreds the body and rearranges it to become a sentient gear. The second modifies the body so it becomes a compatible host for the sentient gears. Sentient gears assist their hosts with calculations, keen observation and advice, essentially leading to people with the strength of multiple minds in one body. The chair needs no power and is capable of repairing itself. If you're tech-savvy, you might be able to implement other processes like installing prosthetics."
315,,200,Magitek Armor,Final Fantasy VI,Magitek,"The Gestahlian Empire’s latest weapon of war is truly a sight to behold. An armored behemoth that stomps across a battlefield on two legs, its face a deadly maw concealing a magitek cannon. The cannon can produce beams of elemental energy capable of destroying entire squads of traditional troops in a single blast. This model even conceals several missile banks and a system that converts the destructive energy into healing in case the pilot becomes injured. Tough as it is, the Magitek Armors are not invincible. Should yours meet an untimely end you will be given a new unit two weeks later."
316,,200,Invention Collection,Final Fantasy VI,Magitek,"Sometimes even genius needs a kick in the pants as inspiration. So have a few to get you started. The Auto Crossbow is exactly what it sounds like, an auto-loading, box-fed crossbow capable of spewing out several dozen bolts in very short order. The Flash is a massive lightbulb attached to an equally massive battery pack that is capable of temporarily blinding anyone you point it at. Finally, the Noiseblaster emits a sound that screws with the minds of monsters and people alike, temporarily confusing them with just a short blast. Make sure to wear earplugs with that one."
317,,200,Airship,Final Fantasy V,Magitek,"Built by a previous civilization, nonetheless the Airship is mechanical marvel to behold. Exceedingly fast, albeit slightly small, it zips around most worlds very quickly, and can even be converted into a submarine for undersea travel and exploration as well."
318,,200,​​-Cannoneer-,Final Fantasy V,Magitek,"Part engineer and park siege weapon specialist, this job is quite unique. Purchasing the job will give you access to the Cannoneer’s abilities, while Mastery will allow you to instantly know the angles and power required to hit a distant target. You’ll be killer at golf, too.

320,,200,Purification Vessel ,Asura’s Wrath,Magitek,"This is a medium class ship in the fleets of Shikoku Trastrium, and you are it’s captain. It does not require a crew, but works better when fully staffed. It is armed with purification beams and a Mantra collection halo. It requires Mantra Level 3 to fly and 4 to engage in combat operations. Mantra can be directed to it by Transmitters or someone with the Mantra Foci Perk."
321,,200,Combat Mandala Array,Asura’s Wrath,Magitek,"You have a set of ornately carved spheres­ drones that can project sturdy energy fields, fire concussive mantra bursts, or fly out and slam into foes in time with your own close combat attacks. If destroyed, a new set appears in the Warehouse. They require Mantra Level 1 to function."
322,,200,Divine Ride,Asura’s Wrath,Magitek,"This vehicle takes the form of a motorcycle or similar two-­person transport device. It’s construction is sublime and it is incredibly maneuverable. It requires ambient Level 2 Mantra to run, and Level 3 Mantra to travel into space or orbit from the planet’s surface."
323,,200,Mantra Fields and Firearms,Asura’s Wrath,Magitek,"You have the a specialized set of weapons and armor associated with your background. You know how to maintain them, and the knowledge of how to make more. Such weapons include demigod­-binding spears, orb weapon platforms for heavy armaments, and so on."
324,,200,Civilian Grade Locks and Fairies,Library of Ruina,Magitek,"F Corp and J Corp are polar opposites in the clearest sense. J Corp creates better locks, while F Corp’s Fairies exist to pick locks. The highest grades of both stretch the act of ‘locking’ and ‘unlocking’ to more abstract degrees, but those available for civilian use are all you need to be concerned with at present, as civilian grade instances of both singularities are what you possess. Fairies are glimmering sparks that insert themselves into keyholes or door hinges, rapidly loosening their mechanisms to allow you entry. J Corp locks are simply that, locks. Albeit most are more resistant to conventional lockpicking or poorly used fairies when compared to their mundane brethren. However these locks can be placed on the brains and bodies of human beings to prevent disclosure of information or dissection. So long as the lock holds that is. Reinforce your security or breach that of others, just don’t limit yourself to only doing one. 

You get one of each each week."
325,,200,Dollar Store Firearms,Library of Ruina,Magitek,"Firearms are both extraordinarily regulated and incredibly useful. Heavy taxes and inane regulations keep guns out of the hands of most, especially since highly skilled opponents can dodge around bullets with ease, but the convenience of being able to mow down groups of thugs in a street is alluring indeed. Some think that’s why the Head regulates them so much, since they hardly care about preserving life, but show a strange sort of ritualism towards the everyday act of taking it, in that killing shouldn’t be too trivial or insignificant. With that in mind, know how lucky you are to have not one but two guns. One is a high powered rifle easily suited to long distance sniping, while the other is a sleek concealable pistol of standard caliber. The bullets themselves are on the level of Atelier Logic, are able to drop lightly augmented and decently dressed foes in a single shot. Don’t be wasteful with your ammunition, as you only have three magazines worth of bullets for each firearm. But at least they refill at the end of the week."
326,,200,Geared Up,Library of Ruina,Magitek,"A great deal of people see the City as a shackle upon their lives, and they’re not all that wrong. Yet even before the City grew out of the rocks like a cancer no one could be considered free. In the end, we all will follow a massive current unheeding of our own wills, and the cult of the gears are simply there to show the flow. Even if you’re not as deterministic as Eileen, you acknowledge that some must function as gears for the sake of others, thus you are familiar with the process of turning whole individuals into gears that when grafted to one’s form boost their capabilities. The average chaff of the world are turned into Meat Gears that enhance the wielder’s raw combat potential using the experiences of the gear’s former life. Rarely, an individual holds the potential to become a Thought Gear which, when used, drastically heightens reflexes and predictive capabilities. So long as you have space, you may wield as many gears as you can produce, their effects magnified with every addition; enough Meat Gears and you could become a truly frightening aberration, while a few Thought Gears could allow you to whisper commands into comparatively primitive machinery and have them heard. Of course, the process - at least for now - kills the gear to be in a rather gory fashion. But surely this is an acceptable sacrifice, as these gears can rest easily with the knowledge that they finally have a clear purpose. "
327,,200,Augment: Urban Plague,Library of Ruina,Magitek,"Now if you’re willing to pay a bit more for your augments, or have ties with those who might make them, we can get you something a bit more special. All of the effects of the prior tier are significantly improved, legs able to do great leaps, arms that never tire despite swinging swords the same size as yourself, and camera eyes that replicate the full function of human ones, along with seeing into UV, infrared, and so on. More than that, now your augments come with a distinct gimmick to them. Perhaps they create sheathes of fire around your weapons to burn away at your foes, have assorted modes they can cycle through as needed in order to improve your performance in numerous minor ways, actively build up power in their internal engines to spur you on to greater heights the longer the battle lasts, or disable key muscle groups of your foes with carefully placed electrical shocks."
328,,200,Tempest – The Waifumaker,HighSchool DxD,Magitek,"Here. I know you want it, no need to be shy. Heh. Exactly, this is a gender-swapping raygun, and it does exactly what you think it does. Comes with a varied array of options and settings, from temporal swap, to permanent, to changing the perspective of the victim. It can even alter their own and other’s memories to make the change retroactive. Incredibly powerful, but it can’t obviously affect beings without a gender."
329,,200,Hotel Californication,HighSchool DxD,Magitek,"Despite the name, this ain’t a hotel, but a car. A special sports car made by Azazel. It has many weapons installed in it such as the Satellite Downfall Cannon System, and Dragon Destroy Missile, an Invisibility Mode and so on. The weapons regenerate as well as the car itself if it takes any damage, an unlikely thing given how resilient it is. Using this car will slightly boost your charisma."
330,,200,Red Fixer Gear,Lobotomy Corporation,Magitek,Heavy robotic armour with a single glowing red eye. The heavy armour comes with a red photon blade and is capable of firing huge energy beams capable of penetrating walls. Such devastating attacks are extremely taxing and require a resting period. Extremely durable to physical attacks.
331,,200,Godwalker(Tier 1),Godbound,Magitek,"A relic of ancient theotechnical research, godwalkers are an offshoot of the arts that forged the Made Gods. Once, these great war machines of polished steel and glowing sigils laid waste to the battlefields of the Former Empires. Few now remain in any kind of good condition-and the machine you now wield is an exception among exceptions. Operating by drawing divine sympathies between their shape, their function and their pilots each Godwalker has two key components: A chakra engine, the locus of its divine fire and the interface between its artifices and the celestial forces that power it which determines what manner of and how many divine components can be attached to it. And a sacred armature, the basic chassis of the godwalker which can provide different advantages through the symbolic principles it reifies-including vast transport space, integral flight ability or simple sturdy construction. A godwalker shaped like a vehicle is peerless in transporting its writers and destroying those who impede it’s path, while some experimental varieties were even designed as thrones or libraries.

As for the armaments of the godwalkers, it is no exaggeration to say their component can mimic many lesser Gifts on a scale greater than mankind. While some components simply permit a godwalker to emulate any Gift related to perception, communication, movement, transformation, creation, alteration, defence and protection or attacking and certain forms of harm including the universal smitings of Godbound centred on the great machine itself more unique abilities of a similar scale have also been created. Some examples are provided below:
- Anchor of the Holy Gate: The godwalker acts as the destination node of a teleportation gateway. After 24 hours of ritual purification that must be free of all blasphemous behaviour, with a day’s commitment of divine effort a godwalker can let in up to a hundred infantrymen’s worth of mass at a time to a designation location.
- Devourer of Armies: Torrents of lethal sacred energy blast from the godwalker, scorching entire battalions to death.
- Banner of Zeal: The godwalker ignites an invincible defence against any mental effect that would stop the pilot from attacking enemies, and bolsters the valor of nearby allies
- Force Projection Jewel: The godwalker strikes down targets with pinpoint precision, up to a mile
- Halo of Wrath: The godwalker sears nearby enemies with a penumbra of coruscating divine energies.
- Advance of the Iron Tide: So long as the godwalker moves in a straight line, they have an invincible defence against all hostile effects and can phase harmlessly through solid barriers. This invincibility can be maintained as long as it does nothing but keep moving forward until, presumably, it’s enemies are destroyed.
- Clavis of Night: After ten minutes to “load”, the godwalker punches a hole into Uncreated Night. It is advisable to first scout out the theurgic coordinates of your desired destination through which you can use the godwalker to arrive at over a week’s journey in exchange for bypassing the usual obstacles, lest you risk eternally wandering within the void.
- Kinetic Sump Vortex: The godwalker halves the movement rate and dampens the initiative of all nearby foes, though powerful ones may be able to resist it for a short while.
- Noble Path Generator: The godwalker generates solid footing regardless of the substance or lack thereof beneath it. Oceans and empty pits alike are no obstacle to its passage.
- Pious Construction Array: The godwalker’s capacity for fixing or building mundane structures and goods is enhanced, permitting it to do the work of hundreds of skilled craftsmen.
- Rainbow Bridge Emitter: The godwalker uses divine effort to summon a thirty-foot wide bridge between any two points in sight within 1000 feet of each other that shares it’s durability. The bridge permits travel no matter how steep it is, and users cannot be knocked off while they are alive.
- Reactive Adaption Unit: The godwalker wields divine effort to make it immune to a specific Gift or other power for a scene.
- Stiletto Sutra Projector: The resonances of a ruinous sacred text open gaping holes of nonbeing into a living being within 2000 feet. While highly effective, it is too inefficient to wield against entire armies and is ineffective on unliving targets.
- The Awl of Shifting Space: The godwalker can teleport at a distance up to twice its normal movement rate, to anywhere it can see or has formerly occupied. This teleportation leaves behind physical bindings or restraints, but not magical ones-at least of this world.
- Transmutation Field: With time and sacred mudras, the godwalker can transform large amounts of non-magical matter into another non-magical, non precious substance of equal mass. This ability generally takes 12 hours or so of labour.
- Polymorphic Shaping Core: The godwalker can alter its shape within its general dimensions, gaining a faster travel rate by land or sea by sprouting wheels or propellers for example. It can also stretch out it’s matter to form long ranged manipulators, or form into a defensive tank-like shape. While this component is not sophisticated enough to permit flight, it can shrink the entire godwalker down into something the size of a horse.
- Volley Negation Shield: When attacked by multiple strikes in rapid succession, only the first can strike the godwalker-and even then, if a foe dedicates it’s full focus on the great machine. The others automatically miss.
- Trump of Judgement: The godwalker launches a building-flattening sonic barrage out at everything within 200 feet, crumbling any non-magical solid construction to powder and dealing severe harm to all nearby living beings.
- Wingcutter Malediction: A beam of congealed curses strikes down airborne enemies, whether they come in flocks or as individuals. For some reason this weapon cannot be evaded by mundane means, but cannot be targeted at terrestrial foes.
- Wingjet Propulsion Unit: The godwalker can fly at its normal movement rate, including the ability to hover in place if present. This ability is not powerful enough to be equipped on the larger godwalkers.

For 200 CP you may own a godwalker sufficient for keeping several villages in line, such as the Made God Mirrored Panther’s Unblinking Jade Eye which boasts around 3- 4 components of unique purpose.

Last but not least, while normally godwalkers require a sophisticated theotechnical facility and a team of extremely well-trained engineers or a Godbound with the word Artifice to be properly maintained, through your investment here some mysterious benefactor has installed a Godwalker Repair Bay on any you buy here, fully functional without impacting other systems in defiance of conventional construction procedures. This set of tools permits the godwalker to perform a daily maintenance cycle on itself or another godwalker over the course of 6 hours of downtime-and in a pinch fully overhaul another godwalker or itself in a week, with no additional personnel or resources.

332,,200,The Guidance of Wards,Godbound,Magitek,"You have the blueprints to creating both Mundus and Empyrean Wards, theotechnological devices with which to stymie magic and divine energies. Mundus wards protect a region from the supernatural influence of Made Gods and other divinely-connected entities, including Godbound. They subtly drain away the celestial forces used by these entities, making it much more difficult to create long-term or large-scale changes in the area. Empyrean wards are a more powerful, restricted form of ward reserved for ancient strongholds and high-security buildings.

These wards actually negate the divine energies of a Wordbound creature, suppressing miracles and gifts and making it impossible for weaker Godbound to trigger their abilities. Every ward is built around a physical focus. In some cases this is a single specific object kept in some heavily-guarded place. It might be a sacred idol, a holy mandala, or an enigmatic machine churning away without visible effect. In other cases, the physical focus is more dispersed, taking the form of sanctified obelisks in the area, carvings embedded in local buildings, or buried anchors of sacred symbols at geomantically-important points. So long as this physical focus remains largely intact and inside the area covered by the ward, the ward will stay up. A ward's focus can handle a certain amount of damage and defacement before it starts to degrade"
333,,200,Reverse Magic Engineering,Gummi Bears,Magitek,"You can reverse engineer both magic and technological devices, especially things which blend the two together. It only takes a few minutes of study to figure out how a spell or a thing is built and how you can build it yourself."
334,,200,Atlantean Speeder ,Atlantis - The Lost Empire,Magitek,"Purchasing this will give you the choice between two vehicles; the first is the Ketak, a fast Atlantean aircraft that might be considered the equivalent of a flying motorcycle, shaped like a fish, that can comfortably seat two people and fly faster than any other aerial vehicle available in this section. The second option is the Aktirak, shaped like a Hammerhead shark; if the Ketak is the equivalent of a motorcycle, then the Aktirak is more like a car. It’s not as fast as a result, but it can seat three or maybe even four people at once, assuming that they’re comfortable with sitting close to each other. "
335,,200,Automaton and Notes        ,Rapunzel’s Tangled Adventure,Magitek,"You gain a timing cylinder that when wound will construct a single automation of your own design that is capable of following commands and will never be subverted or turned against you. This can look human in shape but still must be obviously made of metal, the timing cylinder is its weak point and as long as it is not destroyed it can rebuild itself when damaged."

You, however, are different. You may enter cyberspace, VR, or simulated realities as yourself, forcing them to bend around the full nature and capabilities of your true self, able to use your powers and abilities even if they were not programmed into the simulation."
337,,200,Bionic and Mystic Perfection ,Marvel Cosmic,Magitek,"Why be stuck with your baseline body? All true rulers should tower over their soon to be subjects in form and mind. Much like the Mad Titan you have been massively enhanced on every level. Mystical protections, spells, and bindings, as well as cybernetic enhancements and genetic manipulation has turned you into the pinnacle of perfection. Your body is superior in every way to others of your species and even many other species through the cosmos."
338,,200,The Mystic and the Machine        ,Marvel Cosmic,Magitek,"The argument between mystics and technology is a faulty one. There is no need to choose one as they enhance and complement one another. Like a certain Mad Titan you have unlocked mastery of combining these two pathways to power. You can always find ways to combine any mystical knowledge you have with any scientific or technical knowledge. This differs from Fine line in that it is all about creating magitech. It also allows you to make a technological version of any magic you know, or a magical version of any technology you can build. All power sources between the two become cross compatible as well. Only fools choose one when they can have both."
339,,200,Badass Bike,Fate/Zero,Magitek,"The wide open road calls to you, whether in the pursuit of work as a gun for hire or just a simple desire for freedom, and you need a proper steed to travel along it. Provided for you will be a motorcycle, of any model and make available prior to 2004. It’ll never run out of fuel, or electricity if you’re the type to make it that way, nothing short of a tsunami or hurricane will make it slip or lose stability and any crashes that happen whilst riding it will never deal more than moderate injuries to you at worst. Your trusty companion will always be just out of sight too, in case you have need of it for a quick escape or chase. This can be imported into."
340,,200,"Work, Sweet Work",Arcane,Magitek,"What’s a scientist without a place to work? With this, you own a laboratory and workshop well-equipped for whatever crafts and sciences you know how to perform. If you’re a hextechnician you’ve got all the tools you need to build your inventions, and if you’re skilled in chemtech it’ll have all the beakers, bunsen burners and distillation towers you could want. This laboratory is also well-stocked with common materials and reagents for your (e.g. metals, basic chemicals etc), but rarer things will need to be found elsewhere."
341,,200,Magelock Load-out,Super Dragon Sword,Magitek,"You have access to a pair of Magelocks, enchanted pistols with customized bullets capable of mimicking any Element you can come across…though each individual shot is much weaker than any given Tier 1 elemental attack spell.

348,,200,Mindcrank,MtG - New Phyrexia,Magitek,"A horrible needle-like instrument, which can be embedded into the head of a victim and slowly, painfully turned by its inbuilt motor, burning away the victim’s memories until their past is a complete blank, and leaving them in a highly suggestible state."
349,,200,Infect the Body,MtG - New Phyrexia,Magitek,"Glistening Oil, also known as Phyrexian oil or Ichor, the substance that corrupted the Father of Machines and gave birth to the glorious New Phyrexia, infecting its inhabitants and giving them the desire to compleat themselves- to replace the imperfections in their body with machines, and which you may now generate from your body in small amounts. The one you’ve picked up is not quite as insidious- at least not without you meddling with it- but it retains its ability to better enable the fusion of machinery and flesh when the patient is submerged in it. Make them perfect, Jumper. Note: Basically, submerging people in it makes it easier for their body to adapt to the merging or replacing of their body parts with machinery. It would take about a month to produce enough to submerge the average adult male."
350,,200,Golem Splicer,MtG - New Phyrexia,Magitek,"Not all the Phyrexians were made from compleated Mirrans- and not all in Phyrexia merits its own mind. You have picked up the art and science of creating robotic golems- though you start able to make simple, but durable, helpers, your knowledge is enough that you can begin to do your own research into improving them."
351,,200,Beneath My Iron Skin(200CP),MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Magitek,"With the many Futurist advancements that have spread throughout the world, one of the most common ones takes the form of mechanical assistance. Metal arms and legs, to replace ones lost to accident or battle, are but the tip of this iceberg. Entirely mechanical suits of armor, known as mechs, mecha, or mechsuits depending on who you ask, are their newest addition to the art of war. To that end, I would offer you one of these - perhaps you seek a High-Speed Hoverbike that would make most Reckoner gangs blush in envy, or the Mobilizer Mech that the Futurists use to control several suits at once. Of course, something more impressive could also be what you seek?

For 200 cp, you may take something worth three to five mana, such as the Dragonfly Suit that has become a major part of the Imperials arial brigade, or the Brute Suits that certain Ninja clans make use of when they no longer wish to be subtle. A machine on par with the Genesis Engine is also possible, but would lack the bells and whistles buying it as an ordinary item would grant. "
352,,200,Mechanical Aide,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Magitek,"In a civilization that is firmly split between constantly pushing for bigger and better technology and having none at all - and, specifically, as one of those pushing for more, it can be hard to fit your hands into all the tight spaces. Kami knows ordinary vehicles can be bad, can you imagine what trying to work on a mecha looks like? Luckily, you don’t have to, on account of someone having already invented a way around that particular problem. That’s why you now have a set of Circuit Menders, small insectoid constructs that are small enough to crawl around inside the tight spaces where hands don’t fit and do the maintenance for you. Remarkable little buggers, they can even run repairs on certain mechs mid-flight or mid-fight, though that does risk them getting crushed by all the moving parts. But hey, they’re a lot more replaceable than a full mecha is. "
353,,200,Armed And Rearmed ,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Magitek,"No small portion of the Asari is made up of former Imperial samurai - those who flunked out, were thrown out, threw themselves out, or were deemed unable to serve. The loss of a limb is a surprisingly common source of that last one, and there are many who wish they could have continued to serve even without it. They know better now, of course. In an attempt to solve that issue, the craftsmen of Sokenzanshi have created mechanical limbs, some of them meant to outright replace a missing arm or leg, and some of them grafted onto - or perhaps into? - a person in order to effectively grant them three arms. More than a few musicians have gone for something similar, making music with an additional pair of simple but dextrous arms to make twice as much noise as ever before. This may appeal to you more, if you don’t wish to be missing an arm for one reason or another. "
354,,200,Disassembled Mechsuits,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Magitek,"The Dragonfly Suit is the cutting edge of Imperial technology, the latest and greatest that they can stand to have in their sights. This small collection of parts could, in theory, be assembled into one if you wished to do so. Or it could be assembled into something else entirely. Rather than a supply of materials, this item takes the form of a number of abandoned parts, limbs, hardware and software components, taken from a dozen different projects and supplied to you on a regular basis. It’s very much the chaff of what could be given to you, but even broken down the parts here are still far more advanced than the Imperials would be comfortable with. Especially the ones that came from the good stuff, not just a student's failed project. All you really need to do is match tab q to slot z and try to make a masterpiece. If you fail, well, it was already garbage. If you succeed? Then you’ll likely have a frame that surpasses anything the Imperial Army has. "
355,,200,Filigree Cybernetics ,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Magitek,"This is a prosthetic made of the magical alloy Etherium. Etherium has the unique functionality of being able to replace the physical functions of the body through a series of complex enchantments. On Esper it was seen as a necessary part of one’s life to replace parts of their body with Etherium thus enhancing their durability and mana capacity. This is either an arm or a leg weighing in at ten rods of etherium which is much more than the average Etherium Prosthetic. Depending on whether it is an arm or a leg it will grant you either enhanced dexterity or agility respectively. As it is effectively an artifact it should be easier to manipulate and enchant further with magic than the body. Not only that but it has some innate technological feature such as fingers that can be fired off like bullets that return to the prosthetic or mana propelled rockets. Lastly, such a prosthetic is especially easy to modify technologically and is extremely accepting of upgrades such that you might be able to add a completely unrelated artifact’s power to it. If you wish post-jump instead of a prosthetic it can be made into an exoskeleton to be placed over a limb. Alternatively this can be a torso but aside from enhanced durability and a unique technological feature it does not boost your ability to move. This can be purchased multiple times, you can import into this."
356,,200,Artificer ,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Magitek,"Mechanical wonders and magical items of grandeur! Artifacts are powerful tools for people, wizards and Planeswalkers alike and you have a very potent knack for them. Creating artifacts comes naturally for you making you both an excellent craftsman and an intuitive inventor. It would not be difficult should you spend some time to start making artifice creatures of decent power. Within a scant few years you would even be able to devise inventions worth showing at Kaladesh’s technology fair, assuming you have been studious. In addition to this, you also become more capable of making personalised artifacts that are imbued with your powers."
357,,200,Presidential Suit,Fate/Legends - Strange New World,Magitek,"Future proofed and fit for the top man of the nation, this fantastical armour is a sight to see for any red blooded American. Clad in red, white and blue, this full body suit of high tech armour does more than just make you strong enough to throw a truck with one hand and tough enough to take that same truck to the face. It also produces large amounts of electricity in the lightbulbs mounted on each shoulder, letting you fire off blasts from your hands or even charge up an especially powerful beam from your chest cannon. Which you have now. It’s made of pure gold. Anyone tries to deny you funding, just melt down their entire mansion with one shot from this baby. The suit can also do some unimportant stuff about greatly improving the efficiency and concentration/power of any energy channeled within the suit or your body, providing half again the effectiveness in each category, but who cares about that when you can punch out an ox, fry it with your lightning fingers and eat it for breakfast. Also comes with a animating lion helmet.

Even alien technology, like that of Velber, is relatively easy for you to get in working order and keep it that way. You’re not able to alter much, the Moon Cell keeps that knowledge out of your hands with just this, but making new stuff isn’t too hard.

You have created Daimon eggs, and within lies the untouched embryo of a monster. Curiously, they require a physical host to fully reach maturity as the being inside them also needs a basic template to grow into, determined by the host. Thus, any Damion egg that merges with its host will create a Daimon based on the host. You may let these eggs lay dormant in the host until you wish to trigger their awakening. Purchasing this perk once will let you choose between having Daimon eggs make a host from mundane objects (Active magic flowing in the object appears to kill the infant Daimon inside) or sentient beings. You may purchase this perk yet again to buy the other choice. You may improve upon your Daimon with research with time, if you wish.

Pods are standard issue for all YoRHa field units. This one is a bit unique though. Normally a pod can only utilize a limited number of pod programs (spells). However, this pod not only comes with all the pod programs in the game available from the start, but you can program new pod programs into it based on any magic spells you may know. It also has all spells at the ready, all the time. No need to swap them out."

"
367,,200,Combat Cyborg ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"What are you, human or machine? Why not both? Your body is enhanced by cybernetic augmentations that let your Linker Core channel and regulate the electronics within, in addition to a nifty self-repair system. These enhancements are seamlessly integrated into your body, letting you channel mana through your limbs or machine parts within your body. They even continue to function and grow along with you, letting you age and change without fear of the working parts rejecting it or becoming nonfunctional. Your skin and flesh still remains mostly the same and functional, as well. As a bonus, if you choose a background in this world, you may choose to be related or adopted into the Nakajima family by the time the jump starts...or perhaps a rogue cyborg of Jail’s? That choice is up to you."
368,,200,Standalone Flight Mode ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"There are times when a Mage has to use equipment other than their standard Device, such as device-like equipment, a vehicle, or just a regular firearm. This can be problematic, as the Mage only has so many hands they can use, and juggling their Device can be problematic. This mode was developed for those situations, separating the Device’s main body to act as an independent, flight-capable drone, which frees the Mage’s hands for other uses, while the Device either acts on it’s own or according to it’s user’s instructions.

This may seem mostly innocuous, but it involves an almost complete overhaul of the link between Mage and Device. Generally, Mages need to be physically holding their Device in order to link properly with it, to the point that disarming is a very serious concern to combat Mages. With this upgrade, these limitations are expanded to three or four city blocks, to the point where a Mage could potentially activate their Device and begin casting while they are in different rooms.

Simply as a passive effect, this also makes a Device much more resistant to de-linking, making it harder to affect it with anti-magic as the bond between it and it’s user is strengthened. It also comes with the understandable caveat of increasing power consumption. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)"
369,,200,Sapient ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"...If Intelligent Devices blurred the lines between machine and person, this takes that line and pole-vaults over it. Only an idiot would think of this as not a person, as not only does it possess a fully refined and articulated personality, it has reached the point at which it will refer to itself with gendered pronouns, and use any manipulators at its disposal to help articulate how it feels. It'd be a bit strange if it was this intelligent, but wasn't a Unison Device, huh? (CG Note: Requires Intelligent - Lyrical Nanoha first.)
"
370,,200,Heretical Adaptation ,Senki Zesshou Symphogear,Magitek,"Symphogears are, in essence, a Relic adapted into a combat system for its ability to generate massive amounts of energy that can be formatted into a certain kind of matter through a generic mass-energy converter. However, they also have the ability to 'evolve' overtime, gaining additional armor and improvements to features such as onboard thrusters. With a bit of study, it might be possible to apply this adaptive behavior to other materials, encouraging them to improve themselves over time.
"
371,,200,Mundane Applications ,Senki Zesshou Symphogear,Magitek,"Killing Noise isn't all there is to heretical technology. The same technology that is used to create a Symphogear and it's weapons from energy can also be used to manipulate other forms of energy. Through this it becomes possible to bend light to cloak objects or to keep an object cool in a raging inferno. Aside from the obvious military applications, this makes it possible to convert mundane things like coffee makers or fireplaces to run on the passive Phonic energy that is generated by people."
372,,200,Basic Relic,Senki Zesshou Symphogear,Magitek,"You have two Relics appropriate to your Origin that you may choose one of and use at its basic level. In addition to the armament all Relics give off a field that immunizes their user and their immediate surroundings against the carbonizing touch of the Noise as well as allowing them to ignore the immaterial nature of the Noise, striking them as if they were material. As a last resort measure you may sing your Swan Song, performing a ridiculously powerful technique in exchange for heavy damage to your own body, generally enough to leave you out of action for a few days of intensive medical care. Better singing improves sync ratio, allowing faster recovery.

You may choose any Relic outside your origin for an extra 100cp, Gear Candidates still pay this price. You may purchase additional relics with the same pricing scheme after your first.

Note: Symphogears have a few common features, the most important of which being the barrier coating that allows them to ignore the carbonizing effect of the Noise, and their ability to 'tune' Noise into our dimension to destroy them. Symphogears also have maneuvering rockets mounted on them and are sealed against vacuum and high pressures.

Argo, the ship that Jason and the Argonauts sailed on. The user is draped in sails, allowing them to drift effortlessly in the air. It can summon forth pieces of the original ship, casting great rods and nets of rigging at it's targets. Argo is mostly defense focused, being able to summon hulls as defensive shields and laying traps of rigging and rope. Further experience with Argo's creation allows the creation of small boats and jet skis.

The Argo does not possess an Armed Gear that can be wielded like a weapon in the normal sense, excepting the components of the ship, but it is capable of creating Argonauts; small spherical drones with an attached beam of energy. These drone are relatively fragile, but can overwhelm targets with sheer numbers. Specialized drones can be created with greater experience with the Gear.

Argo's Swan Song revives the original Argo, a flying heretical ship controlled by the will of the user. The Argo appears to turn and accelerate with no regards to propulsion or cornering, and can release swarms of the Argonauts. In addition to the swarms of loyal drones and it's extreme speed, the Argo's very presence creates a great typhoon that it and it's wielder are completely unaffected by.

Prometheus, the first flame. By calling forth embers of the original flame, a raging dimensional inferno can be started, burning both human and Noise alike. The flames spread and intensity can be limited by the wielder, and can be extinguished with a single thought, but left unchecked they burn incredibly violently. The wielder is protected from this raging heat by their Symphogear, and other Gears should have little trouble with the heat unless it is actively brought against them.

The chains wrapped around the wielders arms can be used like whips at their most basic level, heating to strike at foes, but Prometheus' true Armed Gear is the projection of these chains into disposable axes of all kinds, with its truest form being that of an ashen chainsaw. These weapons bear superheated blades and chains, being able to burn through even the toughest Noise's defenses if they can get in range.

Prometheus' Swan Song calls forth the full might of the stolen flame, engulfing all within a massive radius in an inferno that sears the flesh of enemies from bone while rejuvenating allies, bringing them back from the brink of death. Be warned however, fire is indiscriminate, and any targets that fail to be designated as allies will suffer the same fate as enemies.

Kibisis, the sack that contained the Medusa’s severed head. The concept of ‘sack’ is a slight misnomer, however. The user is given an elaborate combination of robes, cloak and hood that would be quite modest if the bodysuit wasn’t so skimpy. While unassuming, the fabric that makes up Kibisis is actually a portal to an enormous self-contained pocket dimension, with the user able to manipulate the fabric to make openings into and out of it.

This is as versatile and deadly as it sounds, as Kibisis is able to not only store objects, but also use the fabric to effectively ‘flash step’ by traveling along a thin corridor of silk, or create a razor thin portal along it’s edge to slice objects in half. Kibisis’ Swan Song generates a massive dimensional disturbance, manipulating space-time to instantly stretch and destroy huge areas, while also disrupting similar dimensional shenanigans.

Kaladanda, staff of the god of death. As intimidating as it sounds, Kaladanda’s Armed Gear is actually a metal pipe. In fact, Kaladanda may as well be the tool of a plumber, as it may plant and grow all manner of water works and plumbing from itself, naturally lending itself towards creating steam-powered mechanisms, such as gigantic steam hammers and saws. What makes these pipes unique, however, is the crimson water that flows freely from them, which carries a unique anti-life property that causes it to shred through all physical and philosophical protections, completing erasing it’s target from reality in a manner reminiscent of a certain mirror.

Kaladanda’s Swan Song calls forth the source of it’s deathly water – a colossal steam boiler which flashes a massive amount of it’s deadly contents into supercritical steam, which it forces into a tight, high-power beam to bore through even the toughest defenses. Be careful of friendly fire, although an attentive user can selectively halt the eroding effects of the steam on allies.

Thunderbird, caller of storms. The wielder appears to be cloaked in a stormy haze, obscuring them from view unless they choose to disperse it. Thunderbird is capable of recalling the original bird's talons, incredible sight and agility to the user.

Thunderbird's true power lies in its ability to generate 'feathers', razor-sharp shards that extend in whip-like wings from the wielder's body. They can generate electrical charge and control their own magnetism, allowing the wielder to levitate through repulsion and discharge anti-Noise lightning strikes with some buildup. It is also possible to use the wings as a conduit for a magnetic cannon.

Thunderbird's Swan Song causes the feathers to disperse, floating freely around the wielder as the haze expands into a storm cloud, from which the wielder can direct massive lightning strikes. Anything coming into the storm cloud will find themselves suffering from the lethal discharges within it unless the wielder directs it away from them itself.

The Holy Grail, the cup sought by King Arthur. Upon activation, one might notice that the Gear appears to be completely unarmed or protected aside from a standard (albeit slightly more armored) bodysuit provided by a Symphogear system, with the addition of what appears to be a cooking pot worn jauntily as a helmet. The Holy Grail is capable of generating cooking paraphernalia in all forms to serve in it's purpose of providing unlimited food and happiness to people. Cooking utensils that can, however, be easily used as lethal weapons. The Grail is semi-unique in that it's user can control it's implements remotely, starting with one or two implements at first, and growing to a few dozen with time.

The Holy Grail's Swan Song summons a massive stadium around the wielder, enclosing all in a several hundred meter radius inside a massive oven that heats to extremely high temperatures. Within, the wielder can control as many objects as they can manage, regardless of whether they came from her own Gear. The biggest risk comes from the massive size of the oven, carrying the risk of capturing innocent bystanders in the radius.

Enkidu, clay servitor. Instead of any sort of Armed Gear, Enkidu’s wielder is accompanied by a large, formless mass of technological ‘clay’ that emanates from fissures in the bodysuit armor. While limited in amount, the clay can be manipulated to take on different shapes and properties- provided it doesn’t stray too far from it’s wielder. One moment, it can be a rigid shield, then transform itself into a lethal explosive. Clay may be destroyed, but more is very slowly generated within the bodysuit.

Enkidu’s Swan Song temporarily re-enables the clay’s ability to self-replicate, allowing it to consume vast amounts of material to create a huge swarm of clay. For the duration of the Swan Song, the clay may be used as normal, explosively detonating or collapsing into dust once it ends.

Moly, the miracle herb grown from the blood of a giant. Mossy plants overtake the wearer’s hair, sprouting flowers and other sprouts in its place and down their arms- plants that the wielder can coincidentally fire and control like fine wires. Beyond the obvious application of monofilament cutters, these plants are capable of taking root in living things and draining their life force for energy, so long as a conduit exists back to the wielder. Stranger applications, such as plant-based exoskeletons or constructs, are also entirely possible.

The Swan Song of Moly causes all plants connected to Moly to begin flowering, releasing clouds of corrosive spores which eat into enemy armor, creating chinks for more plants to grow into, allowing them to rapidly drain them of life force. Exponential plant overgrow allows the collapsing of massive structures and even more points to dig into enemies from.

The Ark of the Covenant, the chest containing the ten commandments of God. Draped in papers displaying the ten commandments of God, the Ark displays the remarkable ability to boost or dampen phonic gain. Other wielders who sing alongside the Ark notice their power being boosted, with rising sync coefficients, while enemy wielders notice their synchronization ratio's plummeting. Against the Noise, the effect that disables their Phase Contrast Barrier is broadcast in a wide radius, effectively forcing all Noise around them into reality where mundane weapons will affect them.

The Ark of the Covenant's Armed Gear is actually the papers hanging from the wielder's body. They can extend and fold themselves, taking the shape of weapons or shields, anything that is possible with folded sheets of paper. While they can swing with great force, it's important to remember that it's still essentially paper, albeit far more durable than normal, but still paper. The strength, durability and length the paper can extend to increases with experience.

As another Relic made in the image of God, the Ark's Swan Song is capable of exerting similar forces to the Ruin's of Balal. By spreading the pages out like a dish, and holding themselves in a cross position, the wielder can rip away massive amounts of Phonic Gain from other wielders or people, gathering it to themselves and redistributing it to others. Unlike other Swan Songs, this has no practical combat capability on it's own, as it effectively immobilizes the wielder while it is in use and requires another wielder to direct Phonic Gain to. However, if the wielder can gather enough Phonic Gain, they may be able to activate X-Drive once the Swan Song ends...

The Left Hand of Christ, no, not a euphemism. His actual hand. The wearer is bestowed a much more heavily armored suit than most Symphogears, complete with a helmet and rectangular shield. Unlike most Symphogears, the Hand's Armed Gear cannot be duplicated endlessly, with only one or two available at anygiven moment, the tradeoff being that Hand's lance is extraordinarily powerful, doubling as a high energy laser cannon. The Hand’s shield can expand and reshape as needed, additionally being able to project an energy shield capable of protecting against Noise. The size and shape the energy shield can take begins as a simple single direction square barrier, but can be manipulated more with practice.

The Hand's Swan Song channels and amplifies the destructive power of the spear's laser cannon, sending a massive cross-shaped beam of energy in the direction of every thrust for the duration of the Swan Song. Striking the ground with the spear will produce a similar cross-shaped blast around the wielder. In addition to this, while the Swan Song is active, the defenses provided by the Gear have their power drastically increased.

Gleipnir, the chain that bound the great wolf. Gleipnir’s bodysuit appears to be of a different material than standard, with a leathery appearance and fur-trimming along it’s edge, and appears bound to the wearer by chains. Lengths of chains may be unshackled to beat and ensnare enemies, draining Phonic Gain by contact and potentially immobilizing other Relic users with enough contact.

The Relic’s Swan Song reveals that it is not just Gleipnir, but also the wolf the chain bound – Fenrir. All of the Gear’s chains fall away, and the wielder is surrounded by a recreation of the original wolf. While larger than the wielder and strong, this is not the full extent of the Swan Song. Fenrir reverses the direction of control, being able to take it’s chain and leash another Relic for temporary control over it, against any relevant user’s will for the duration of the Swan Song. If the chain is not used in this way, taking the form of Fenrir bears very little cost to the user, despite being a Swan Song.

The Axe of Perun, weapon of the lightning god. Perun’s bodysuit is studded with numerous contacts and power lines, which can be used to generate extreme voltages, short lightning strikes and manipulate circuitry in the manner one might expect. Instead of simply being able to generate voltage though, Perun is able to condense large amounts of its power into a physical form- that or axes, polearms and other axe-headed instruments, in addition to the lightning ‘arrows’ one might expect. The downside to this is that Perun requires far more energy per weapon created, making it’s use substantially heavier and deliberate versus the frenzy of other Gears.

Perun’s Swan Song calls all available energy in the surrounding atmosphere to the user, often causing the formation of a massive storm cell around it from the massive drop in pressure. The wielder is then able to create a massive axe, formed by both the storm and their own charge, which fully discharges into the location they strike as a titanic lightning strike.

Draupnir, the ring of Odin. It uses its ability of self multiplication to create disk shaped drones that are equipped with sensors and projectors capable of producing energy blasts or holograms. A largely utility focused Relic, Draupnir's defense is somewhat poor and mostly consists of using the drones to intercept attacks or form force fields. Further sync and experience with Daupnir allows the creation of specialized drones and use of formations or combinations of the drones to perform various other tasks of means of attack.

Draupnir's Swan Song causes the drones to multiply exponentially before surrounding the target in a dome and discharging all their energy in a single attack focused on the center of the dome. Draupnir's Swan Song is especially risky as it removes all drones from defense for a single Swan strike and the Symphogear takes a bit to reactivate the discharged drones, should the wielder survive.

Brahmastra, the bow of Brahma. Unlike its counterpart Ichival, Brahmastra's attacks are slower, more accurate and far more powerful, with it's Armed Gear taking the form of a heavy bow by default, although it can also take the form of a battle rifle or revolver. Built into Brahmastra's headset is a visor that provides targeting data and alternate vision modes to the wielder. While the weapons can be fired as fast as the wielder can manage or pull the trigger, the power of these attacks make friendly fire a serious concern.

The Swan Song of Brahmastra brings forth the full might of a weapon said to never miss and which completely annihilates it's target without fail. Summoning it's bow form again, Brahmastra unleashes a massive lance of energy at a specific target, traveling instantly and through all structures in it's way to annihilate that single target with force similar to a nuclear weapon.

A Will-o’-the-Wisp, an otherworldly beacon. On top of a tattered hood, the wielder is given an Armed Gear that takes the form of a small, handheld lantern. Will-o’-the-Wisp’s purview is that of lighting- lanterns, braziers, lamps, floodlights and in a more combat oriented-fashion, lasers. On top of direct fighting applications, the wielder may cause lights to fizzle out and produce small ‘wisps’ of energy, which they may redirect into other lights (or even other Relics) to boost their power or use directly as energy bullets.

Primarily, Will-o’-the-Wisp focuses on producing massive banks of lamps which it harvests for wisps to use in massive lasers, all of which leads into its Swan Song. Upon activation, Will-o’-the-Wisp becomes a miniature sun, glowing with an intense light and releasing untold amounts of wisps that can turn even household light bulbs into deadly area denial weapons.

Xiuhcoatl, weapon of the sun god. The wielder of Xiuhcoatl is accompanied by their own personal Noise- that takes the shape of a burning serpent protectively surrounding them. It also bears slight resemblance to corn, for some reason. By consuming other Noise, or fragments of Relics, Xiuhcoatl grows larger and stronger, although it can shed ‘accumulated’ size for speed, and a greater size is more taxing on the user to maintain. Like other Noise, Xiuhcoatl can phase in and out of reality unless ‘tuned’ by something like a Symphogear, and also possesses the Noise ability to instantly reduce organic life to ash on contact, although it may withhold at the discretion of it’s handler.

Instead of simply swelling Xiuhcoatl to a massive size – as it already does so – the Relic’s Swan Song allows Xiuhcoatl to subdivide into two snakes of a slightly reduced size, repeating as many times as wished for either a swarm of standard sized snakes or several titanic ones. This means that Xiuhcoatl’s Swan Song is generally most effective once it has swelled to a sufficient size, providing the most metaphorical ‘material’ to create additional minions from.

The Nemean Hide, trophy of Heracles. The Nemean Hide is an unusual relic, for it grants it's user some of the properties of Noise as it's primary ability. In addition to being an exceptionally resilient Symphogear the Nemean Hide allows its user to utilize the dimensional phasing ability of Noise, moving partially out of reality in order to ignore mundane assaults in exchange for a loss of movement speed and perception. The pelt is especially fearsome in that it can ignore the assaults of Symphogear users with significantly lesser Symphonic Gain than the wielder of the Hide, while utilizing the enemy's Barrier Coating to interact with them as if the user was fully material, although significantly stronger assaults can pierce this defense.

The Nemean Hide's Armed Gear consists of bracers with five claws situated on all four extremities of the user. The claws are versatile as weapons, having the offensive properties of Noise, allowing them to expend themselves to carbonize a normal human on contact or create a fairly potent explosion, the claws replenish fairly quickly and may be fired as ranged weapons. Finally, a claw may be inserted into a Noise to temporarily usurp control of it, although the claw won't regenerate so long as the Noise remains alive and controlled. Higher sync and experience with the Nemean Hide may allow manifestation of other parts of the Lion such as the fangs or tail, or manipulation of the claws, causing them to grow or otherwise shift to the user's will.

The Swan Song of the Nemean Hide is terrific in both senses of the word. The Hide uses the excess energy generated by the song to fully reform the invincible Lion Noise it was made from around the user. The Nemean ion is nigh indestructible to most assaults barring another Swan Song or attack of similar caliber and can control large swathes of nearby Noise to do it's will. The Lion is somewhat indiscriminate in it's rampage, only partially controlled by the wearer of the Hide and the Swan Song usually only lasts about a minute at most, meaning the best way to deal with the Lion is usually to simply run until it's exhausted.

Enlil, Lord of the Wind. While ordinarily the color scheme of a Symphogear seems to depend on the user, Enlil has yellow and black warning patterns included regardless of the user, along with a mining helmet. Enlil generates mining equipment of all kinds, pickaxes, drills, shovels, even industrial mining lasers. While the intended function is obvious, they still work as anti-Noise weapons, and most tools can be fired as projectiles using rockets. The size and complexity of summoned tools increases with experience with the Gear. The mining helmet's light also functions as an X-ray device, which feeds back to a visor that drops down from the helmet.

Upon triggering it's Swan Song, Enlil explodes into a massive mining train made from a mishmash of industrial machinery and mining equipment. While plowing straight through the enemy at three hundred miles an hour is quite effective, it can also make use of it's crane arms to throw pieces of the scenery at opponents or fire the massive mining laser mounted to it's hull.

The Library of Alexandria, lost repository of knowledge. As would be expected of Pagan technology, the Library of Alexandria was never an actual library, instead taking the form of a small fragment of a once massive crystal which is... somewhat awkwardly wedged in the wielder’s chest. Kinky. The gear also seems to insist on projecting glasses as part of it’s armor, which becomes somewhat superfluous in light of it’s abilities.

Alexandria has no weapon generation capabilities. Instead, it draws machinery and electronics – anything more complicated than a light bulb, really – and weaves them into a massive amalgamation of parts and pieces from the absorbed components. Generally the exact specifications are overblown capabilities of the technology absorbed- superheated coils from a toaster, powerful hydraulics from a backhoe, but aren’t as fantastical as other Relics. The exact shape and size varies depending on the Relic’s read of the situation, but the wielder is always encased within a heavily armored shell at its core, directly fused into the controls through their Gear.

The Library’s Swan Song allows Alexandria to temporarily assimilate the armaments of other Relics into its mechanical titan, haphazardly crossing over discarded weapons from other Symphogears and Relics to create a temporary energy cannon.

Pandora’s Box, which unfortunately is just a box after it was opened. Thankfully, the box itself is still useful, which the wielder can attest to with their built-in bandanna with tracking code. The box can take forms from cardboard boxes to steel shipping containers to box up and ship enemies to oblivion, or box cutters, nail guns and other shipping paraphernalia. Duct tape, warehouse drones and a very large boxcutter can help make sure death is delivered to enemies, and the constructs only get worse from there.

Once the Swan Song is triggered, enemies within range are drawn backwards into a tiny box, like all the world’s evils, and then pulled into a massive shipping mechanism. Once processed, they are fired through a shipping accelerator against a hard surface, crushing the contents instantly and dealing massive damage. A minor property of Pandora’s Box is that it’s user exhibits a slight stealth effect, becoming extremely hard to notice. Moreso, if they hide within the Box.

Bajiaoshan, once thought to be a mighty wind fan. Instead, upon activation the wielder finds themselves holding a pair of handles which can sprout dozens of individual knives, holding them in the shape of fans. On the users command, the handle can explosively fire the knives at a high firing rate, essentially making them fully automatic ballistic knives.

The blades generated can be of several different types, including armor piercing, explosive and incendiary blades with any number of imaginative shapes and sizes. When the fight gets close to Bajiaoshan, the handles can project two superheated knives that are much more durable than the fragile projectiles and are fully capable of melting through most defenses.

It's Swan Song let's Bajiaoshan project a single, invisible knife that carries with it the force of a gale, and with a single thrust, can tear through a single point with incredible force, penetrating all enemies but leaving allies untouched.

Quetzalcoatl is a fragment of the feathered serpent that runs through the user’s body, causing many red-hot feathers to erupt from their bodysuit and merge into an armored coat to protect them. It also extends a superheated tail of molten metal from their spine, which can change shape and warp as they wish. Users of Quetzalcoatl should be cautious of these properties, as it, like the Nehushtan Armor, begins to merge with the user over time, although instead of growing into their wounds, Quetzalcoatl instead chooses to reside beneath the skin. A symbiotic relationship, as opposed to parasitic.

There is no true Armed Gear to Quetzalcoatl, with its user instead calling upon its tail and raw command over the power of the sun. Raw material fissures forth from within Quetzalcoatl, superheated metals and plasmatic gasses which it can launch in streams and use as whips or in other creative ways against its foes. It can also control light in a minor way, either blinding it’s enemies or concentrating it’s light against its foes like the sun against ants.

The Swan Song of Quetzalcoatl harnesses the power of nuclear fusion, generating a small sun roughly the size of one’s fist and launching it. Without the Gear to keep it under control, it quickly expands into a massive conflagration of fire, gas and light, destroying anything in its path.

Tonbokiri, the dragonfly cutter, is one of a few Gears that is capable of native flight thanks to the set of insectoid wings that sprout from the back of the wielder’s bodysuit. All kinds of spears may be created by the Relic, although unlike more typical examples of spears produced by Symphogears, Tobokiri’s are more designed for cutting than thrusting. On top of that, the bodysuit possesses an ambulatory ‘tail’ that may grasp it’s spears and act as a crude sting for the user, and can sprout additional insectoid features if they wish.

Tonbokiri belongs to the group of ‘living’ Gears that actively seek symbiosis with their wielders, regardless of implantation status, which is reflected in it’s Swan Song. The user sprouts chitinous armor, and temporarily the restored spear emerges from their sting, sharp enough that it emits heat from simple contact with the air.

Strangely enough, Tonbokiri’s style and movements seem... a bit ridiculous at times. Flash stepping, running on water and other feats that’d seem more beelievable if they were in some anime.

Gáe Bulg, Cúchulainn’s spear. While only one of the original barbs remains, it still carries the traits of the original spear, with the short, bone-like protrusions the Gear is capable of producing still coursing through the body of enemies it pierces into and tearing them apart. By snapping off a bone growth and burying it in water or the ground, a massive ‘swordfish’ drone spawns – really an extended bone outcropping held inside a ring drone, with the same properties as a normal spine. Combat relies then on a balance between falling back to spawn additional drones and taking the offensive when drones are in surplus.

The spear’s Swan Song revives the original sea monster – a massive, bone-y serpent named Coinchenn – but not as a pet to be controlled or commanded. Instead, Coinchenn allows itself to be used as a massive version of the spear it was eventually made into, flying with unnatural speed and precision for something so large, with the curse spreading through everything present at the location it strikes.

By providing all the power the Gear needs and more, the user no longer has to sing, and the Gear gains Anti-Ignite properties, being able to shut them down and in fact reflect all of it’s damage back on the user. The pendant of the Gear will become slightly bigger as a result, with an optional alternative form as a different crystalline accessory, such an as a gun. There is one catch, though. Due to alchemical properties of the Philosopher Stone, a Faust Robe can only be worn by women, as- and I quote, “proper dick placement” is required to activate it. As in, a complete lack of one.

Instead of creating explosions and structures that would shake the world, they enhance the musculature of stormvermin with circuitry and steel. 

You’re one of these detail-oriented rat-men, able to get flesh and metal to work together when ordinarily the victim subject would be either weakened or killed. As well, the skaven field of ‘bionics’ can increase both physical strength and, in a Warlock-Engineer’s case, the strength of their spellcraft.

It does not hold together a dream, it does not allow the user to bend time, it does even wake the wind at your command. On the other hand, it does act as a key to most of the Lokomo’s technology, allowing those without their innate understanding of magitech to use it without too much difficulty.

In addition to the rod itself you will get a few different statues that can be controlled by the rod, some of them large in size and capable of wielding weapons. The Spinner is a sort of gear-like mechanism that one can ride on. It’s best used on special grooves that it can use to move at high speeds, but it can also be ridden normally and can cross quicksand and patches of ice easily. It can also soften one’s fall if they happen to be riding it when they go over a cliff or something. Finally, the Clawshot is essentially a grappling-hook that allows one to attach to various objects pulling them closer to you (or you closer to them, if they weight more than you do). It fires with enough force to kill small enemies, but against larger ones it may only stun, if it does anything at all.

Or, if you wish, you could extract information from your Akasha to share with others using a specialised helmet that comes with these. You have received a few of these Capsules, including one of the illusive combat-class knowledge capsules, known to boost one's combat abilities.

405,,250,Blaster System ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"Coming from the same roots as the Fulldrive mode on some Devices, the Blaster System is designed to increase the power available to a Mage in combat. However, unlike the Fulldrive mode, the Blaster System does not only disengage the performance limiters on the Device, it also directly sacrifices the user’s life for power. When a Blaster System is in use, the Mage receives direct, physical damage to themselves relative to whichever one of the three Blaster levels they are using, along with backlash damage to the Device itself. It is analogous to overclocking the Device with power, rather than simply letting it perform at its maximum specifications, as with Fulldrive.

Blaster One and Two are both relatively safe if only used in short bursts, being able to instantly charge nearly any spell, or push its power to the class above it. The tradeoff is the immediate overheating of the Device, along with burns, cuts and ruptured blood vessels on any flesh in contact with the Device during operation. Blaster Three, on the other hand, causes immediate damage and warping to the Device, along with potentially breaking the operator’s bones and causing the same damage from Blaster One and Two all over their body. In exchange, the power of spells are massively multiplied, completely bypassing even the most potent Anti-Magic Fields and still coming out with extra power. 

It should be noted that in some cases, the damage caused by a Blaster System can in fact be preferable to the damage potentially caused by Fulldrive. The simple truth of the matter is that it’s faster and easier to treat blunt trauma such a broken bones and cuts compared to the internal damage caused by Fulldrive, which has a tendency to ‘add up’ before it’s noticed. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first. )"
406,,250,Bits System ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"In its original design, the Blaster System included a subsystem called Blaster Bits. At Blasters Two and Three, the system would generate two and four sets of ‘bits’, respectively. These bits bear some resemblance to the Standalone Flight Mode, being independent, flight-capable drones that can cast magic on their own, but they do not possess any of the intelligence or independence that would be found with the Standalone mode. Each bit acts as a vector from which spells can be cast, essentially giving the caster more directions to attack from, as well as potentially acting as force multipliers.

Like the Standalone Flight Mode, bits possess limitations on range, becoming proportionally less efficient the greater the distance between them and the user, in a way that is fundamentally similar to how Familiars share their master’s mana reserves. Their range is also smaller, between one or two city blocks.

The first purchase of this system grants the control system, along with two bits, with additional bits being purchasable for 50DP per bit. If the Device also has the Blaster System installed, then each of the bits are upgraded into Blaster Bits. In Blaster Two or above, the limitations on range and efficiency are temporarily released, and the bits begin acting as perfect force multipliers, duplicating any spell cast by the main Device at no additional cost, but only so long as Blaster Mode is engaged. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)"
407,,300,Vorpal Laserblaster of Pittenweem,Gloryhammer,Magitek,"Where did you get this? This unique energy “rifle” is the long-lost third legendary relic of the Starlords. When fired, it projects a thin blade of pure cosmic infinity up to a thousand feet. These invisible blades are powerful enough to cut through almost any physical object as if it weren’t even there. It is not known if even the Hammer of Glory could withstand more than one or two blasts from this rifle."
408,,300,Gadgeteer ,Blazblue,Magitek,"Ars Magus aren't the solution to every problem, and more often than not end up causing more than they solve. You have training in ""Traditional"" science, and can create purely mechanical devices and weapons, such as magnetism-powered gauntlets."
409,,300,Pitchfork ,Demon: The Descent,Magitek,"Ah. Can’t beat the classics. This particular Gadget takes the form of a red pitchfork tattoo that appears somewhere on your body. It can also be manifested as the classic red demonic trident (with some gears in odd places that don’t affect its balance). While it is an almost indestructible, finely balanced and wickedly sharp weapon it’s most important trait is that it lets you shoot blasts of hellfire with the approximate range of a bazooka and far greater lethality to anything hit by it. Any angel running into the wielder is going to have a very, very bad day-because this weapon’s secondary function is to blunt incoming force with telekinetic blows, and make you as skilled and lucky as an action movie hero while wielding it."
410,,300,The Dreaming Machine ,Demon: The Descent,Magitek,"Resembling a large upright piano with a case made of chrome and copper, with seems that pass through one another amongst a body of glass. This piano’s bewildering array of circuitry, cogwheels, lamps and even stranger things belie it’s true purpose. It’s music summons thick clouds from nowhere, raining drops of highly flammable clear oil for hundreds of yards that wreck buildings, the environment and supernatural beings (except the player)-but merely put humans to sleep. When they awaken, those humans have the power to see the God-Machine’s machinations-and everything that comes with it. Skilful playing can even daze angels too much to notice you at all.

In future jumps, this piano similarly awakens humans from reality-obscuring or illusory effects."

In a pinch, other projectile attacks such as rocket launchers or spells can be redirected too."
412,,300,Infinite Multitool ,Demon: The Descent,Magitek,"Six inches long, the colour of bleached bone and tipped with a cluster of microchips as well as what looks like a polished ball bearing at each end-this tool can be practically anything you need. At will, it flows like liquid metal to form screwdrivers, wrenches-even simple weapons like knives, batons or crowbars as well as something as complex as a computer chip. Always top of the line quality by modern Earth standards, too."
413,,300,Wormwood,Demon: The Descent,Magitek,"This old fashioned music box (gilded with cog motifs, inlaid in what looks like mercury under glass) was built by a demon who appreciated the Biblical Revelations. Inside of it are a hundred mechanical locusts made of brass and clockwork, with stingers that drip with stinging explosive blue liquid. Open the box, and unleash the swarm against enemies who probably regret being there. The box creates new locusts over the course of a few hours."
414,,300,Prototype MT Legionary Armour,Final Fantasy XV Kingsglaive,Magitek,"A special project even within the Niflheim research and development groups, it would seem that the Legionary Armour was never intended to be mass produced. The improvement that this armour can bestow upon an individual is enough that a normal man can be made to rival an entire battalion of Glaives. However, the strain that the armour inflicts upon its user seems to be rather substantial – perhaps the reason why it was never mass produced to begin with.

Though the strength of the prototype isn’t as substantial as the variant issued to officers, its drawbacks also aren’t as severe – so the individual wearing the suit shouldn’t have to worry about Starscourge poisoning. As with most pieces of Niflheim technology, magic and technology are both weaved into the suit – the magical component allows the suit to be conjured at any time, whereas the technology component lies in the armour’s inertial dampening and physical amplifiers. With the airship grade thrusters installed on the suit, having the inertial dampening will be pretty handy, unless you happen to enjoy high g-force maneuverers. As the suit acts like an extension of your body, manipulating the thrusters and the barrier is just a matter of thought.

Naturally being a piece of Imperial war technology, an Imperial has the highest affinity with this – and thus it’s only normal that they gain 5 Crystals of Change for modification instead of 2. You probably shouldn’t depend on it too much though – Imperials seem to have a tendency for letting power get to their heads.

With this Lantern, despite exploring infinite possible universes and infinite possible timelines, he was always able to find his way back to the true, prime reality. This lantern is now yours, and can perform a similar function: No matter what situation you may be in, if your perspective on reality is altered or interfered with in any way, this device can lead you back to truth. You could be stuck in an illusion crafted by the Witch Queen, lost inside layers of layers of simulations made by the Vex, blinded by the Darkness, or simply unsure of the truth of the reality in which you stand.

Its specialization, however, is in the opening of locks both electronic and analog, and there has not yet been seen a limit to this technology, as the Young Wolf used it to rampage across many Fallen Pirate fleets, and the Drifter used it to attempt to steal many artifacts from the Cryptarchy. In this and future Jumps, this item will be capable of opening any lock, mundane or magical, although the more complex the lock, the more time it will take."
418,,300,"Atlas, Right Arm",Final Fantasy XIII-2,Magitek,"It's...actually there's nothing there. At least there's nothing there until a massive fist punches you and bowls you over. The dealer laughs uproariously, even as you withhold the urge to give him a good punch. He points to a mark on his right arm and makes a grabbing motion. That's when you see it, a large holographic arm mimics his action.

""There used to be a beast called Atlas...or was it, there will be a beast called Atlas? Hrm. I dunno. But anyways, we used technology to mimic his arm. Or his hand and a small portion of his arm."" The mark, when attached to your hand, basically gives you an extra phantom arm. While it can't hold things, it can stay manifested for as long as you want. Good for those who are lacking an arm - though strangely enough, it only works on the right arm. The dealer just shakes his head when you ask why.

""We goofed up. But hey, two right hands are better than one right?"""
419,,300,Time Gate [Experimental] ,Final Fantasy XIII-2,Magitek,"It's a time gate! Not unlike the ones you'll be using to move between different time locales. Except...this one is apparently not connected to anywhere, and doesn't actually move through time. You're about to ask why it's even called a time gate when the dealer shows you another digital recording. (You're starting to wonder how he got people to volunteer for these promo recordings.) It seems to suck the three closest people to it and those people disappear. It takes a while before they reappear again, and they reappear all at different times. The dealer explains that the prisoners are sucked into a realm where they have to solve peculiar clock puzzles - a Temporal Rift apparently. It can only hold people for up to ten minutes before it spits them back out afterwards, and never more than three. You don't quite understand, but you nod anyways - maybe you'll try sucking yourself into there once in a while."

Choose a subject such as “foreign languages” or “insect beast taming”. As the user completes tasks (tailored to his or her existing knowledge) and learns the subject, the system provides magical techniques enhancing memory and mental prowess to encourage further learning. Once the subject is mastered, the system financially rewards the user for further accomplishments in the field. Each jump, you may choose a different subject and the rewards adjust accordingly.

For an additional 200 CP, discounted to Junior Cultivators, the chosen subject can be broader such as “humanities” or “cultivation”."
421,,300,YPA-GB49 “Corona“ ,Final Fantasy XII,Magitek,"The Shopkeeper leads you out into the hangar behind the shop. A medium sized airship is sitting there. It looks sleek, and could probably fit 10 people rather nicely. You notice the paint job on it seems rather fresh. The Shopkeeper nods approvingly. “That there is the Corona, one of the YPA guild’s reject models. We built her and gave her a little touch up.”

“Her sister, the Strahl, has a passive invisibility field, but we felt this lass needed a personal touch. So we put in a magicite focusing array in front. Just turn it on, and not only will this pretty lady be able to block any frontal assault – she’ll also be able to ram people head on.”

“Of course, you could just use her to fly around – without the ramming.”"
422,,300,GARMENT GRID [JC] VARIATION,Final Fantasy X,Magitek,"An otherworldly garment grid – perhaps a lingering sentiment from the farplane...or perhaps a relic from even further beyond, at first glance it seems to have all the standard functions of a garment grid, but there’s something amiss with the way it is set up. It’s as though the grid was made to be capable of change, capable of growth. Though the number of slots for dress spheres remains at five, as you access different spheres along the grid the nature of this garment grid will become apparent to you.

As you change from one sphere to another, one of the grid’s passive effects will activate – one for each unique change you make. The maximum amount of passive effects is always at (n-1), n being the amount of spheres slotted in the grid itself.

Therefore, in order to access the highest tier abilities, you’ll have to change through every single dress sphere.

When you take this item, you may decide what skills you choose, but the choice is permanent – so choose carefully. In order to pick a second tier effect, you must have first picked a first tier effect, a third tier effect requires having picked a second tier effect – and so forth. However, once a tier is unlocked, you may pick it multiple times. Remember, you may pick up to (n-1) effects, n being the total amount of sphere slots available to you – which is initially 5.

In general, abilities activate whenever you change between dress spheres – effectively a “jump” between spheres. However, unless you take specific modifications – a jump between two spheres is only counted once (so you can’t just jump back and forth between two spheres). Can’t really visualize it? Here’s what the grid itself looks like. Each connection in between is a “jump”.

Jump from 1 sphere to another, and you’ll activate the first tier of effects – and so forth, until you’ve expended every single connection. When this happens, the entire process resets and upon another jump, you’ll lose temporary effects from the grid to start over fresh. With the grid above it would go as follows:

First Connection: Activate 1st Effect
Second Connection: Activate 2nd Effect
Third Connection: Activate 3rd Effect 
Fourth Connection: Activate 4th Effect
All Connections Expended – “Fifth”: Connection All effects disappear, Activates 1st Effect again.

Curious to see what options are available? Well, I’ve compiled a list if you’re curious.

423,,300,"PROTOTYPE Γ, “JAGD PANZER” ",Final Fantasy X,Magitek,"Truly the pinnacle of experimental Machina technology – it’s probably for the best if you don’t let the Yevon clergy know that you possess this. For one thing, they have a very tight grip on machina technology, and it’s not something they care to relinquish to anyone, even if you happen to be within the clergy itself. Machina use needs to be strictly controlled after all.

A tank like machina capable of sending out small flying units to act as reconnaissance drones – these drones serve two purposes, the collection of combat data as well as acting as the machina’s primary form of long ranged detection and observation. Initially, it comes with nine drones, definitely enough to be sent in all of the cardinal directions even while leaving one around for close range surveillance.

Its primary armament is a giant magic cannon, the properties of which can change, depending on the data received from the drones. Observing enough fire elemental attacks will cause the cannon to adopt fire properties, and so forth. Unfortunately, machina is still machina at the end of the day, so its replicated capabilities aren’t as amazing as you would probably hope – essentially lesser replicas of whatever it sees. Like all machina, you can definitely

That being said, its flexibility doesn’t lie with the surveillance drones...but with the modifications which can be made to it."
424,,300,Rings of Power,Library of Ruina V1.0,Magitek,"A small set of rings with differently coloured gems. Although pretty in their own right, they are imbued with miniature singularities, granting the wearer with incredible power. These rings work from their own self-contained power which slowly regenerates when not in use. Strong uses of a ring (say, using telekinesis to leave a wide crater) may take minutes to recharge. If the wearer contains their own energy pool, they may fuel these rings simply through touch."
425,,300,Will of the City,Library of Ruina V1.0,Magitek,"A giant golden pendulum with unbreakable rope. Dig a spacious room underneath a village or city and hang this up, and the next day the pendulum will be surrounded by multitudes of spinning wheels and looms. Like a seismograph by feeling the vibrations of the city, the pendulum will swing, the wheels will turn and the Weavers will interpret them. This all works together to give you an encoded but detailed census of the city. Or if you have specific questions, this will provide answers, right down to knowing an individual person's feelings on a matter. It is unknown if this an actual sentient being or will of the city or is simply natural motions that come from the city itself. Either way, no secrets will escape you from within this city's limits."
426,,300,Singularity Database,Library of Ruina V1.0,Magitek,"Singularities are technologies designed to defy the laws of physics, pulling off feats one could describe as magical. Each Wing desperately protects the secrets of their singularity, and any kind of leak could lead to disastrous results. Meanwhile, you have a database which contains every singularity developed in this realm and software needed to access it. If you somehow also lack a tool to use the software, a laptop is provided. With this information, a crafty person could develop their own variations of these singularities. The database will include a guide describing how to convert or replicate these technologies when you move to a realm with possibly differing physics."
427,,300,Emergency Teleport,Library of Ruina V1.0,Magitek,"A small round device that latches onto a person or their clothing. This device watches the lifesigns of the one wearing it, activating when it detects an incoming blow that would put them in critical condition. Upon activation, it creates a quick protective shield around the wearer before teleporting them to a designated safe spot. If the wearer is somehow in a different dimension or plane to the safe spot when it activates, it will teleport to the same dimension as the safe spot, but in a random location. Once it successfully performs its task, the device breaks down. A replacement will appear in your storage after a month."
428,,300,Black Silence Gloves ,Library of Ruina V1.0,Magitek,"Supernatural gloves used by the legendary Black Silence. Sync these gloves with any number of weapons, and they will gain the ability to temporarily summon them in hand. A weapon only materialises for a second, enough to get a good hit in, and then that weapon will need a few seconds of cooldown afterwards. If the wearer manages to summon every weapon at least once, they will have access to perform the Furioso. The Furioso can be best described as a continual stream of attacks using every weapon one after another, giving opponents no reprieve. Once the Furioso has been performed, every weapon will need to be summoned at least once again."
429,,300,City-Regulated Firearm,Library of Ruina V1.0,Magitek,"A customisable assault rifle that can be modified to become as powerful and indiscriminate as a blunderbuss or have the precision and reach of a sniper. It starts each day with several clips of various ammunition available (e.g. incendiary or frost bolts). Performing tricks or using the gun as a melee weapon will refill the magazine, with more ammunition for trickier stunts and/or more damage."

431,,300,Divine Weapon,Asura’s Wrath,Magitek,"You have a legendary weapon forged by the smiths of heaven or found in the hot blood of the earth. In either case, it is nigh-­unbreakable and has a unique quality or power.

As an example Wailing Dark, Argus’s sword, can extend to an outlandish length and with sufficient mantra, cut through a moon. Moon­cutting feats require Mantra Level 5 at minimum."
432,,300,Mechanical Genius,Final Fantasy IV,Magitek,"Your ability to understand machinery is on a different level entirely. Working with a metal you’ve never touched to brace a machine? Cakewalk. New attachments on a precariously balanced airship? Might take a day, less with an assistant. You know machines, and exactly how to calibrate them to your exact specifications inherently without needing to actually run the numbers. It just works."
433,,300,Godwalker(Tier 2),Godbound,Magitek,"A relic of ancient theotechnical research, godwalkers are an offshoot of the arts that forged the Made Gods. Once, these great war machines of polished steel and glowing sigils laid waste to the battlefields of the Former Empires. Few now remain in any kind of good condition-and the machine you now wield is an exception among exceptions. Operating by drawing divine sympathies between their shape, their function and their pilots each Godwalker has two key components: A chakra engine, the locus of its divine fire and the interface between its artifices and the celestial forces that power it which determines what manner of and how many divine components can be attached to it. And a sacred armature, the basic chassis of the godwalker which can provide different advantages through the symbolic principles it reifies-including vast transport space, integral flight ability or simple sturdy construction. A godwalker shaped like a vehicle is peerless in transporting its writers and destroying those who impede it’s path, while some experimental varieties were even designed as thrones or libraries.

As for the armaments of the godwalkers, it is no exaggeration to say their component can mimic many lesser Gifts on a scale greater than mankind. While some components simply permit a godwalker to emulate any Gift related to perception, communication, movement, transformation, creation, alteration, defence and protection or attacking and certain forms of harm including the universal smitings of Godbound centred on the great machine itself more unique abilities of a similar scale have also been created. Some examples are provided below:
- Anchor of the Holy Gate: The godwalker acts as the destination node of a teleportation gateway. After 24 hours of ritual purification that must be free of all blasphemous behaviour, with a day’s commitment of divine effort a godwalker can let in up to a hundred infantrymen’s worth of mass at a time to a designation location.
- Devourer of Armies: Torrents of lethal sacred energy blast from the godwalker, scorching entire battalions to death.
- Banner of Zeal: The godwalker ignites an invincible defence against any mental effect that would stop the pilot from attacking enemies, and bolsters the valor of nearby allies
- Force Projection Jewel: The godwalker strikes down targets with pinpoint precision, up to a mile
- Halo of Wrath: The godwalker sears nearby enemies with a penumbra of coruscating divine energies.
- Advance of the Iron Tide: So long as the godwalker moves in a straight line, they have an invincible defence against all hostile effects and can phase harmlessly through solid barriers. This invincibility can be maintained as long as it does nothing but keep moving forward until, presumably, it’s enemies are destroyed.
- Clavis of Night: After ten minutes to “load”, the godwalker punches a hole into Uncreated Night. It is advisable to first scout out the theurgic coordinates of your desired destination through which you can use the godwalker to arrive at over a week’s journey in exchange for bypassing the usual obstacles, lest you risk eternally wandering within the void.
- Kinetic Sump Vortex: The godwalker halves the movement rate and dampens the initiative of all nearby foes, though powerful ones may be able to resist it for a short while.
- Noble Path Generator: The godwalker generates solid footing regardless of the substance or lack thereof beneath it. Oceans and empty pits alike are no obstacle to its passage.
- Pious Construction Array: The godwalker’s capacity for fixing or building mundane structures and goods is enhanced, permitting it to do the work of hundreds of skilled craftsmen.
- Rainbow Bridge Emitter: The godwalker uses divine effort to summon a thirty-foot wide bridge between any two points in sight within 1000 feet of each other that shares it’s durability. The bridge permits travel no matter how steep it is, and users cannot be knocked off while they are alive.
- Reactive Adaption Unit: The godwalker wields divine effort to make it immune to a specific Gift or other power for a scene.
- Stiletto Sutra Projector: The resonances of a ruinous sacred text open gaping holes of nonbeing into a living being within 2000 feet. While highly effective, it is too inefficient to wield against entire armies and is ineffective on unliving targets.
- The Awl of Shifting Space: The godwalker can teleport at a distance up to twice its normal movement rate, to anywhere it can see or has formerly occupied. This teleportation leaves behind physical bindings or restraints, but not magical ones-at least of this world.
- Transmutation Field: With time and sacred mudras, the godwalker can transform large amounts of non-magical matter into another non-magical, non precious substance of equal mass. This ability generally takes 12 hours or so of labour.
- Polymorphic Shaping Core: The godwalker can alter its shape within its general dimensions, gaining a faster travel rate by land or sea by sprouting wheels or propellers for example. It can also stretch out it’s matter to form long ranged manipulators, or form into a defensive tank-like shape. While this component is not sophisticated enough to permit flight, it can shrink the entire godwalker down into something the size of a horse.
- Volley Negation Shield: When attacked by multiple strikes in rapid succession, only the first can strike the godwalker-and even then, if a foe dedicates it’s full focus on the great machine. The others automatically miss.
- Trump of Judgement: The godwalker launches a building-flattening sonic barrage out at everything within 200 feet, crumbling any non-magical solid construction to powder and dealing severe harm to all nearby living beings.
- Wingcutter Malediction: A beam of congealed curses strikes down airborne enemies, whether they come in flocks or as individuals. For some reason this weapon cannot be evaded by mundane means, but cannot be targeted at terrestrial foes.
- Wingjet Propulsion Unit: The godwalker can fly at its normal movement rate, including the ability to hover in place if present. This ability is not powerful enough to be equipped on the larger godwalkers.

For 300 CP your godwalker may be akin to Without Repining, an ancient Ren invasion weapon that once overwhelmed Khamite armies or Gentleman Who Holds the Whip which serves better as a transport vehicle. Such vehicles have 6 components sorted into two or so broad categories of general purpose such as offence, mobility or defence. 

Last but not least, while normally godwalkers require a sophisticated theotechnical facility and a team of extremely well-trained engineers or a Godbound with the word Artifice to be properly maintained, through your investment here some mysterious benefactor has installed a Godwalker Repair Bay on any you buy here, fully functional without impacting other systems in defiance of conventional construction procedures. This set of tools permits the godwalker to perform a daily maintenance cycle on itself or another godwalker over the course of 6 hours of downtime-and in a pinch fully overhaul another godwalker or itself in a week, with no additional personnel or resources.

The she sword already looks like it’s made of fire and lightning, and is especially effective on ‘monsters’, with the wounds it inflicts on them only getting worse if untreated.

Four guns created by an unknown civilization, these laser guns work by shooting the target with an energy that has a high chance of locking the target in place.

You can also adjust the frequency so that it only hurts magical beings such as mermaids, while the user and regular humans are immune to the effects."
439,,300,Fulldrive ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"Performance limiters are used in mass-based technologies such as fighter craft and guns to prevent their users from killing themselves, due to either excessive G-forces, or injury from intense recoil, essentially preventing the user from passing a certain range where injury is potentially lethal. When it comes to magic, however, acceleration damage and recoil are often mitigated concerns, usually factored out during the design of the spell. The performance limiters in place are to prevent internal injury to a mage from overexertion on their Linker Core, which can damage it.

Fulldrive throws these limiters out the window, massively increasing power intake to run at the peak of what the Device is capable of, rather than it’s operator. Due to magic’s nature, this isn’t as immediately lethal as it is with mass-based technology, but the trade off for the massively increased power, speed and durability is a much higher chance for self-injury. Additionally, Fulldrive is a unique mode all it’s own, combining the benefits of all of the Device’s modes at once in a way that simply wouldn’t be possible under normal performance limitations. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)"

You’ve learned the secret of changing biological forms into machines, converting them into stronger metallic bodies and opening their forms to easy augmentation with the power of science. This allows them to easily have technology built into them and to have the benefits of being a tireless, powerful machine with none of the downsides to being just an average meatbag...of course, the subject will retain their original personality from the change. Unless you make some ‘modifications’, of course. As with the others, this process takes time to accomplish, and those you try to mold into drones will likely resist. Violently. What do you plan on using this for, I wonder...?"
444,,400,Poppiswappi,Xenoblade Chronicles 2,Magitek,"One of the biggest advantages an artificial Blade has over their natural counterparts is how customizable they are, with a skilled creator being able to swap out their parts to alter their capabilities between battles. You can even do this to yourself if you have some engineering skill, reconfiguring your abilities as a Blade such as the element of your ether furnace, your physical appearance, your weapon of choice, or your raw specs, such as whether you’re configured for an attack, defense, or support role. It takes a few minutes of downtime to finish this kind of delicate work so it’s best not to try doing it in the middle of battle."
445,,400,Specialized Equipment ,MORTAL KOMBAT 9-10,Magitek,"Outworld is mostly medieval and primitive; however, there are still some modern weapons and technologies there- most supplied by black market organizations, such as the Black Dragon. While you might not understand the science behind them, you can adapt to them- getting a general understanding not only of how they are used, but how you can make something similar at a lower technological level with a little effort and research of your own. Using a rifle to improve the quality of a crossbow, or making grenades that use sand instead of shrapnel are examples of what can be done with this; no matter how strange the items you make, you’ll find that you can use them effectively. What’s more, you can use a little Outworld ingenuity (and magic) to give the things you’re making minor special effects, like your sand grenades having enough sand in them to shoot out of your enemy’s eyes and mouth if you stuck one in their gut."
446,,400,Numerian Education,Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous,Magitek,"The Technic League are loath to let the secrets of Silver Mount out of Numeria, yet you’ve managed a full education despite that. Part of the League yourself, maybe. These secrets you’ve grasped have shown you all the workings of the technology used by the Technic League, far in advance of what the rest of Golarion has access too. Electricity powered machines, computers, powerful robot guardians, cybernetics, laser weaponry, rudimentary artificial intelligence and more. The advanced extra- terrestrial tech is costly and difficult to obtain outside of Numeria, making your knowledge a valuable asset to many factions. 

But while the deepest secrets of the God Machines are far from your grasp, you have realised methods to combine the arts of the supernatural and the technological. You can comprehend how to mix the two into working or even superior products. Adding cybernetics to the flesh of a Demon, powering electrical weaponry with magical energy or even affecting the soul with surgical steel. With the right knowledge, even the path to divine machines might not be out of sight."
447,,400,Telemechanics,The Free Universe,Magitek,"A unique form of telekinetic power, you are able to control and operate machines (digital and analog) with fine precision, using only your mind. You’re also able to construct machines using materials around you, as long as you can think of how things are generally meant to fit together they’ll do so. For slapdash combinations of junk with no finesse it’ll hold together as long as you focus on it - falling apart at the seams otherwise. If you’re more careful this can be a way to construct tools and solutions with little to no effort."
448,,400,Zero Generators,Anima Ark Of Sinners,Magitek,Powerful generators made with the greatest advances in technology and supernatural of the Ark. These three generators can be used to power anything you may want by producing a field of frozen time. You may connect these generators to the Heart of Eternity item. You receive a new batch each month.
449,,400,Smartphone,American Gods,Magitek,"The weapon of the modern age. This is your very own smartphone, a device fit for a God of this age. It has unlimited memory and battery life, and internet connectivity as fast as it needs to be, entirely unaffected by things like ‘coverage’. It’s only ever restrained by the devices on the other end, honestly. Also, you can interface with it with your mind, without any question of obstruction or detection.

It can also interface with any and all electronic devices, regardless of how much sense that makes, and by ‘interface’ it means ‘control’. No matter how powerful the computer or how advanced the system, if something is electronic you can take utter control of it using this phone. It has unlimited processing power, can run any and all programs no matter what OS they’re designed for, and there’s no virus or malware in the world, any world, that can come close to affecting it without your will.’"
450,,400,God-Forged Weaponry ,Grant Morrison’s 18 Days,Magitek,"Not to be confused with an Astra, this is an immensely powerful, exquisitely well-crafted Yajnatek weapon of your own, the kind of thing any god would be proud to own. Something similar to the Kalabhairava forged by Shiva himself, Arjuna’s Gandiva, or even Krishna’s Sudarshan, though clearly not those three, as they are spoken for. But a twin of one of them, perhaps? Well, maybe not the Kalabhairava. If you want that, you’ll need to buy it special.

You can get a new weapon of your own design or any seen on-screen, with three exceptions listed ahead. It can be any weapon at all, since everything from a wheel to a plough has been a weapon in these lands. But whatever it is, the spells, psionics and technology involved in its constructions are absolutely top-notch, better than the vast majority of weapons that can be found these days."
451,,400,Personal Vimana,Grant Morrison’s 18 Days,Magitek,"And one of the very best in the world, too. This is your own personal Vimana, an incredibly powerful, fast and all-around magnificent piece of art for your use. At first look it’s just an Aircraft, but that’s not unlike saying that Arjuna is just a soldier. This is one of the finest pieces of Yajnatek in existence, and it’s evident in its beauty and power.

Capable of moving at close to the speed of light, this Vimana can traverse across all Lokas, moving perfectly fine through the air, in the depth of space, and deep underwater, in any environmental conditions. Its life support systems keep everyone inside alive and healthy no matter what, and it has space for over a dozen people apart from you.

More than just a means of travel, this is a finely crafted weapon of war, with immensely powerful Magitek artillery arrays, laser weapons, and armor that can hold off anything short of Astras and God-Forged weapons. Its targeting systems would let you shoot wings off of flies at a hundred kilometers, and the sheer power of its weapons can melt mountains with sustained barrages."
452,,400,Yajnatek Mysteries,Grant Morrison’s 18 Days,Magitek,"In ancient fires, and with flesh screaming, a blood price can be paid to merge body with arcane songs and hammer blows. You know the ancient rituals and mantras involved in making the very greatest works possible, things like the Astras, Celestial Armors or Weapons, or other miraculous crafts. From the sutras needed to get gods to bless things to the exact schematics for the greatest and most terrible weapons, your knowledge could save the world... or cause it to die screaming.

Nor are the Astras the limit of your power. It’s a little known secret that the Superwarriors, the perfect Demigods that stride the world, were engineered in the Second Age, enhanced through genetics, psionic and magical technology, blessed with divine powers and magic, and countless other measures besides. All of these secrets lie within your knowledge now, just waiting to be made reality.

One thing to note, oh Great One. Even the least of the things you know will take tremendous, utterly horrific quantities of time, energy, and personal effort to make, such that even the greatest kingdoms of this era would struggle to put together, barring surprises on your end. And while your knowledge does mean you can make these things, it does not necessarily let you branch out or apply the same principles to other things, being essentially only knowledge."
453,,400,Great Engine,Warhammer 40K: The Warp ,Magitek,"Within your possession is a technological marvel possessed by a Warp being. This is a powerful Daemon Engine of your choice, a machine altered and inhabited by a Greater Daemon or its non-Chaos equivalent. This one is under your full control, and you may order it around to harvest souls or other tasks. For 200 CP, this engine will be something on the level of a Venomcrawler or Defiler, for 300 a Kytan or Lord of Skulls and for 400 a possessed Titan."
454,,400,Craftsman of Souls,Warhammer 40K: The Warp ,Magitek,"The infernal masters of the Forge of Souls are renowned for the potency and artistry of their craft. Perhaps you once studied at their foot, or had the opportunity to extensively observe their creations. In any case, you have the same skills in working with Warp and technology alike to devastating effect. From powerful Daemon engines to the much vaunted Soul Grinders, you are able to create magnificent examples of Warp tainted technology. You can enhance technology with the unholy powers of Daemons, binding them inside to both operate and empower the resulting marvel. In future settings, you have an especially great talent in the workings of combining magic and souls with technology, rapidly learning new ways for the two to work together."
455,,400,Incinerator,Sundered,Magitek,"Unlike a normal incinerator, this takes in any material and burns it as fuel to produce energy. Even fragments of eldritch power can be put in and destroyed, the incinerator won’t even flinch."
456,,400,4N0N,Yo-Kai Watch,Magitek,"Jibanyan’s lifespan was greatly increased when he turned into a yo-kai, but Nate passed away long before Jibanyan’s time came, and after a close friend of his was lost, he underwent a procedure that turned him into Robonyan. You now have the knowledge on how to perform this procedure, not just to yo-kai but to anything that can be considered a sentient being. These new robot bodies are hard as steel, and can accept plenty of upgrades of any type ranging from rocket fists to a built in megaphone to having a chocobar factory inside them to whatever you can make possible. The downsides are that the raw procedure will void the subject of any and all emotions and personality, and these robot bodies eat up energy like crazy even before the upgrades, so you might want to get, like, a power plant or make some adjustments first."
457,,400,Disc Developer,Hyperdimension Neptunia,Magitek,"You can create Disks to empower yourself. A Disc consists of up to 3 “chips”, each of which gives a special effect like minor regeneration, increasing your rate of mana restoration, making any attack you make poison your targets, increases your rate of learning, or protects you from harm from physical or magical sources. While creating a Disc consists of nothing more than writing to it in whatever format you use for writing to a data storage device, the chips will take you a small amount of time and effort to create. More powerful chips will take you more time and effort to create."
458,,400,Nitori Express Hotline,Touhou Luna Nights,Magitek,"This reusable, bulky, old-style mobile phone allows you to call in a friendly Kappa merchant to sell you upgrades to your powers at ever-increasing costs in exchange for gold, and she will also trade gemstones for gold. Alternatively, you can give this to someone else to allow them to bring you from anywhere else in the same dimension upon use. You are free to choose a suitably dramatic entrance."
459,,400,Vending Machine ,Touhou Luna Nights,Magitek,"You have a large, vending machine that freely vends cans of soda. Drinking from the soda gives you a one-use full restore of all your injuries and roughly trebles your regeneration of “mana” until it is fully refreshed – this does not stack with itself. It needs to be left alone for a few seconds between uses to recharge, and it is still a big, heavy soda machine; don’t expect to easily lug it everywhere and it needs to be plugged in to work. It also comes with a small recycling basket which will reward you with ten gold if you toss an empty can into it."
460,,400,Prime Angel Shell,Kill Six Billion Demons,Magitek,"The shell of a long dead prime angel, this shell is now inhabited by Unbound Devils, this is commonly used as a war-machine, due to its size. The Shell can take a ludicrous amount of punishment, though it is slow in returning it."
461,,400,Technomancer,Kill Six Billion Demons,Magitek,"Sometimes, but rarely, magic is used to enhance technology. You possess this odd skill, and with it, you can make some magical technology, like the Glyphosphere of Mammon’s design."
462,,400,Voidship ,Mage: The Ascension,Magitek,"This Void Engineer Voidship, Etherite Ethership, or other type of flying vehicle (the Progenitors have grown a living bioship for example) is a true marvel. It has many integrated Wonders beyond its own ability to function as a dimension/planet traveling ship, based around allowing passengers to thrive and to attack or defend against hostile vessels or beings. Pity the whole thing would be horribly Paradox prone on Earth."
463,,400,Sector,Mage: The Ascension,Magitek,"The Digital Web is a world of pure data. It begins as hazy unformatted Virgin Web, but a visitor can format it according to their will and the limits of their magickal talent, setting certain constraints on what can exist or be done there. The sky’s the limit on what you can imagine: a bar, a beautiful tropical beach, an intentionally digital looking mindscape out of Tron. You receive your own Sector that has been formatted with whatever Parameters you want, as definable by up to 9 in all Spheres. If allowed to, it will suck in Quintessence from anyone who uses communications technology (or magic or psychic hiveminds or whatever) in future jumps, making them all slightly tired and sickly in exchange for fueling its growth, generating new Virgin Web for you. Most of these new sectors will be automatically formatted based on what people are using the web for, such as forum sectors where you can speak to other people and have your words automatically posted on a website or sectors where companies store their data which you can steal, bust some will stay open for you. In this way, you can bring your own Digital Web with you into future jumps.

Entering the web can be done in a few ways. Standard virtual reality gear can allow you to sense it if you know how, though you’ll be at a disadvantage at doing anything there, as if you were having to manipulate everything with tongs. You can astrally project yourself into it with Correspondence magic, leaving your body in the real world but feeling the whole Web fully. Either of these will replace your strength and dexterity with your intelligence and quick-wittedness respectively, as you interact with the world purely mentally. Greater Correspondence allows one to digitize themselves into a computer to physically enter the Digital Web, while Spirit magick can perform the same journey directly. The greater your level of immersion, the more damage you’ll receive from being killed on the Web, from nothing but a headache, to brain damage, to actually being killed for real if you fully entered the Web through digitization or dimensional travel."
464,,400,Coffins        ,A Certain Scientific Accelerator,Magitek,"You have a mobile console that controls three of Hishigata’s “coffin” mecha, which are a strange combination between science, magic, and esper. They’re large and bulky, but besides being a three story robot, each one has access to a Level 5 esper power, which puts it on par with a battle cruiser, and they can become even more effective by networking with one another. Oh, and they can copy people’s memories. These Coffins retain upgrades, and come preinstalled with whatever three powers you want them to, though you may swap the bodies out later if you think better of one."
465,,400,Evil Spirit of the Number,A Certain Scientific Accelerator,Magitek,"Whether or not you’re actually a particularly powerful, artificial pseudo-soul in a human corpse, you have the benefits and powers thereof. Your strength, speed, and stamina are clearly superhuman. You are preternaturally aware of your physical condition, and can simulate various scenarios in your mind. You still need air and sustenance, but are unbothered by pain. You also have some neat tricks, like interfacing with technology and rewiring your brain to supercharge your senses. Furthermore, being effectively dead already, you’re very hard to actually kill."
466,,400,The Forwarding Device ,Final Fantasy Tactics,Magitek,"This astonishing wonder of technology is able to, given a power source strong enough to support its ravenous demand, punch a hole through the very fabric of space-time in a way no known magic of Ivalice has managed. If used correctly it could allow one to traverse the local multiverse of a world. There is some evidence in many treasures that shows that this kind of device was used to produce artifacts of another world known as Materia in Ivalice. It’s grander mysteries are still yet to be seen."
467,,400,Inquest Notes,Guild Wars 2,Magitek,"A large collection of experimental notes made by the Inquest and their rather unorthodox experimental ethics. Contains dozens of advancements in all fields, if you can stomach reading through the exceedingly detailed descriptions of how they were acquired."
468,,400,Celestial Technology,Darksiders,Magitek,"Though they are not makers, the angels are a force of creation. This perk grants you their knowledge in supernatural technology they use. Holy armour, lances that shoot beams of light and all manner of technology that repels darkness and creatures of evil. You also become more skilled in the use of holy weapons. "
469,,400,Karakura-Raizer Team Watches,Bleach,Magitek,"Make way for the Karakura Raizers! The Karakura Raizers are Karakura’s own elite super heroes, or at least they will be! Using special watches developed by Urahara Kisuke, an otherwise normal human can transform into a superhero able to contend even with low level Arrancar, or at least be sorta useful when confronting one! The watches number five in total, and can be handed out to others. The watches are blank at first, unlike the originals, only becoming set after being used by someone for the first time. The costume and powers they provide on transformation depend on the person it now belongs too. 

A hot blooded karate practitioner could get a combat gi along with flaming punches and kicks that could tear right through normal hollows, while a whiny coward may be bestowed the power to run away really fast! Just remember whenever transforming or using SPECIAL ATTACKS to correctly pose, or you will be painfully electrocuted! Bwahahahaha! [Karakura-Raizer Team Watches are insured against damages and will be replaced in the event of destruction or world transition.]"
470,,400,Stocked Facilities,Bleach,Magitek,"Science is a glorious thing, with the proper brilliance and methods producing limitless potential benefits. Artificial lifeforms, modification of souls, almost instantaneous analysis of exotic structures, individuals such as Urahara, Mayuri, and some lesser extent Szayel, are terrifying in what they’re capable of; but that’s only with the proper tools and resources on hand. With this purchase, you will at least have those tools and resources. Equivalent to the Shinigami Research and Development Institute, you’ll receive a sprawling complex filled with fearful yet industrious research staff all manner of soul based technologies. Facilities for surgery, dissection, chemical analysis, and more can be found scattered throughout. The proper knowledge could even use this place to develop artificial souls and soul lifeforms in one of the many, many tanks of anomalous, glowing fluids."
471,,400,Life Sciences,Bleach,Magitek,"Some believe that each species is but a component of a greater whole, that hybrids who draw on multiple sources of power ascend to a higher dimension of existence. How true that is may be unclear but the concepts behind the mixing of the races pays worthy dividends. You’re well versed in the science of species, from simply biological knowledge to a wide variety of ways to combine or infuse their unique powers. The science behind the various methods involved as well as the technology to make it happen feels natural to you, allowing you to rapidly make progress in the field. 

You’re able to successfully cross-breed entirely separate species even despite biological incompatibilities. Adding the spiritual nature or make-up of a Hollow into a Shinigami, or vice versa, is a complicated but quite possible process. Analysing and understanding the unique abilities of a newly discovered race is simple, while you even have the potential to find ways to bind unique racial abilities into devices or consumable items. A pill to temporarily hollowify a Shinigami for anti-Quincy combat, perhaps? The potential of life is limitless, when you have such varieties of life to draw on."
472,,400,Spirit Manipulator,Bleach,Magitek,"In a world where spirit particles are the basis of reality and power, it should be no surprise that the tools to manipulate those particles are most important. While the science to do with the soul itself directly is beyond you yet, your specialty lies in creating tools that manipulate, expand or empower souls and spirit particles. Gigai or objects to contain souls, the Tenshintai that allows rapid Bankai unlocking even in rookie Shinigami, methods to fuse souls and physical objects together, Reiatsu amplifiers and more are just the start. To look into Reishi itself, you know how to create artificial senkaimon or dangai barriers, even weapons that focus and expel spiritual energy on their own. You won’t be changing the nature of a soul or creating new ones from nothing but you are a master at creating technology powered by spiritual energy or souls, as well as devices that can enhance or control them. Much of this knowledge is already available to you but you have the talent to continuously push it to greater heights, with the right resources."
473,,400,Knife of Evil,Gloryhammer,Magitek,"This long, black-bladed knife is one of the three legendary relics of the Starlords. When stabbed into a creature’s flesh, anti-telharsic energies flow from the dagger into the victim’s veins. The unholy power quickly travels to their brain, altering their personality and irreversibly corrupting them toward evil (provided they survive the stab wound). Creatures corrupted by the knife will serve whoever holds it, though they will chafe under and eventually betray an insufficiently evil master. The knife’s power works on any creature with blood, regardless of the victim’s strength or willpower."
474,,400,Ancestral Laserdragon,Gloryhammer,Magitek,"This is a dragon-like metal beast (or, in the ancient dialect of the Starlords, “mechanised security drone”) the size of an elephant, with massive claws and wings made of astral magic-infused steel. It can fly, reaching supersonic speeds while in-atmosphere, and is incredibly deadly in combat. The astral enchantments laid on it create a permeable envelope of air around it, allowing you to safely breach the atmosphere while riding it and fly into space. Once free of the atmosphere, the dragon is capable of much higher speeds, allowing you to traverse the solar system in only a few days."
475,,400,Smith of Legend,Gloryhammer,Magitek,"You have been inducted into the secrets of dwarven craftsmen, studying the lore of the Starlords. With time and access to resources, you are able to reproduce some fraction of the ancients’ arsenal—swords made from enchanted steel, crystalline battle axes powered by laser grids, and even mighty dragons made of metal capable of flying between worlds."
476,,400,Hellish Adaptation,Ultrakill,Magitek,"It seems you’ve taken a page out of the book of the Mindflayer, and your chassis has adapted to Hell and gained the ability to channel and utilize mass amounts of Hell Energy in combat. Create swarms of homing projectiles to overwhelm foes from multiple angles, channel lasers of pure death to streak across hordes, and be able to warp a short distance away in but a moment once foes begin to close in for the kill. Show them that demons and Husks aren’t the only ones who can twist Hell for their own means."
477,,400,Aether Cartridge,Honkai: Star Rail,Magitek,"An Aether Cartridge is a device used by hackers to edit the fabric of reality itself. This would be useless in the hands of someone unskilled at hacking, but to someone well-versed in the crime this is a powerful weapon. You could use it to create swords or laser beams, and even edit the weaknesses of enemies to make them vulnerable to your attacks."
478,,400,Orbital Laser,Honkai: Star Rail,Magitek,"You now own a small satellite that will be put into outer space when you start each of your jumps, and will follow your position on any planet you go to. This satellite is connected to your mental commands, and at any time you can order it to fire a laser down at a precise location from orbit. This laser is very destructive, but it takes about twenty seconds to warm up and around two minutes to cool down again, so it cannot be used in rapid succession."
479,,400,Stellar Hephaestus,Honkai: Star Rail,Magitek,"You are now an engineering prodigy. You could create war machines that can rival the likes of Svarog or even the Engine of Creation, constructs powerful enough to combat armies. You also become adept at creating mechanical prosthetics like Luka’s right arm."
480,,400,Deus Ex Machina,Honkai: Star Rail,Magitek,"Your genius is now so truly incredible that you could create a device that can simulate reality itself, as well as the minds and actions of beings beyond human comprehension, such as the Aeons. This remarkable feat cements you as one of the greatest minds the universe has ever seen."
481,,400,Blank Memory Crystals ,Stranger Of Paradise - Final Fantasy Origins,Magitek,Memory crystals that are given to people chosen as Strangers to go fight the darkness in Cornelia. It can store their memories so that they only remember the purposes you have given them. You get 5 crystals and receive 5 more each week.
482,,400,Lufenian Technology,Stranger Of Paradise - Final Fantasy Origins,Magitek,The technology developped by the Lufenians is quite impressive. It would thus be a shame to live it all behind. This grants you all the knowledge required to create and use Lufenian technology including the one that allowed them to create the crystals that can control the elements and the one used to twist lifeforms into the various monsters seen in the game but not the cycles. This updates post-jump with similarly in depth information of highly advanced technology that exists within the jump. Also guarantees that your creations are loyal to you.
483,,400,Gadgeteer,Demon: The Descent,Magitek,"Building Gadgets is risky at the best of time for most demons. Not so for you, though. Such things built reliably with almost no chance of going awry, and you can apply triggers to their use or modify them on the fly simply by forcing in more Aether. Even the normally treacherous Lambda Gadgets integrate quickly and securely in your hands, waiving their normal volatility-and if you choose to bind a Gadget into your body, it fits as smoothly and naturally as an extension of your body. This translates to all other magitech as well, and lets you develop similar Gadget-like magitech with any other magic you come across by forcing it and Aether into a suitable construct. The God-Machine has truly lost one of its most useful tools in you."
484,,400,Contagion Vector,Demon: The Descent,Magitek,"Sometimes a gear within the God-Machine springs loose. Sometimes it’s inscrutable processes of resource production and arcane operations malfunction. When that happens, what is known as the Contagion emerges: A supernatural disease with unpredictable effects on supernatural beings and their powers. And not necessarily a conventional disease either: It can be a plague that warps werewolves into even more powerful deformed horrors yes, but also a cult that drives adherents into rapturous worship. A song that drives mages to the left-handed path. Somehow, one such strain has formed a symbiotic relationship with you. You are an asymptomatic vector for it. At will, you can spread it from your touch, your voice, your presence. Those infected exhibit the usual symptoms, including self-destructive ones if necessary, but never attack you; whether they shower you in deference or simply avoid you in the grip of their transformation depends on how focused the contagion is on subverting their will. You are a watching glitch in the God-Machine’s system...and it seems either blind, or helpless to do anything about it.

One example Contagion is the First Language. It is nothing less than the code that governs the God-Machine's programming, the Celestial Ladder, and the essence of Creation-now improperly released through you as a vessel. It transcends time and space, and those who first mastered it tore it into a thousand pieces so none could follow them on this path to ascendant power. As the root of all languages it allows the speaker to communicate in and understand flawlessly any language known to man, but with experimentation other abilities can potentially be unlocked from it. When an arcane construct released in the time of the Olmecs it sucked up prayers intended for true gods, drove kings to madness and greatness before slowly foretelling their demise, and drove entire civilisations to disaster with feverish obsession. This was its Contagion: it trapped the city between the erratic extremes of obsession until it consumed all else-outliving the Olmecs and compelling future artists to speak and express it through all manner of media. It will take significant experimentation beyond all but the most dedicated demons to do anything more with it, though. But in time, perhaps a path to higher realms could be built from it, or perhaps the other supernatural forces of this world could be replicated in unprecedented ways-even to recreate a godlike being for a specific purpose.

Another, a plague of manifest dreams. A hallucination-inducing zone of madness released from broken infrastructure, that at first obliterates identity-and over time causes the Astral Realm where thoughts and ideas manifest as spirits to bleed over into the physical world. Had the Uratha (werewolves) not intervened, gods of dream (or dreams of gods) could have invaded the world. Perhaps with significant Gadgets and Infrastructure to amplify it, these beings could be bound to certain tasks in exchange for easier entrance.

A third, an onslaught of rapid evolutionary mutation distantly linked to the creation of one of the Zeka, the nuclear Prometheans. It warps deer into massive albinos and transforms wolf populations into abnormally large, thriving communities-lifeforms strong enough to contend with some supernatural beings. Perhaps trees as strong as steel, too. Though evolutionary beneficial as a consistent trait, this biodiversity can quickly become dangerous to humans. Even spirits are subject to its warping effects, formerly natural entities becoming two-headed deer with human faces or fist-sized bugs that let out babies’ cries. What would happen if such a power were turned on one of the supernatural beings of this world, or even the children of demons with humans, is yet unknown."
485,,400,Fallen Ruin,Final Fantasy XVI,Magitek,"You have found a Fallen ruin, it is a remnant of an advanced ancient civilization. It seems that the security system and various machines around it do not see you as an intruder. You may find many blueprints and records on various research done here including possibly one that tried to create a manmade god/Eikon known as Omega. It retains any upgrade you make to it."
486,,400,The Enterprise,Final Fantasy XVI,Magitek,"You receive a copy of Mid’s ship known as the Enterprise. It is a marvel of magitek with a hull made of Fallen technology that could very well make it unbreakable, it is also quite possibly the fastest ship in the setting. It is staffed by a competent crew that is loyal to you.It retains any upgrade you make to it."
487,,400,Reverie Tower,Final Fantasy XVI,Magitek,"You receive a copy of the Reverie Tower, Barnabas’ personal desmene where he fought Clive for the final time. It is filled with Akashics and robots/machines dating back to the era of the Fallen civilization. They are all loyal to you. It retains upgrades you make to it and you may attack it to your warehouse or one of your properties in future jumps."
488,,400,Master Craftsman and Engineer,Final Fantasy XVI,Magitek,"Blackthorne, Cid and Mid, the hideout is certainly not a stranger to highly skilled craftsmen and enginners. This grants you skill and knownledge in smithing matching Blackthorne’s that allows to craft all weapons within the game and refining them to higher levels of power. Furthermore, you gain the combined skill and knownledge in engineering of both Cid and Mid. This includes the ability to repurpose engines and artifacts from a bygone age like Mid as well as a guarantee that whatever you make will always end up being useful to you down the line. The skills and knowledge update each jump making you a blacksmith and engineer of equivalent skill."
489,,400,Automated Defense Gear,The Elder Scrolls - Online,Magitek,"The heavy armor. Created based on schematics recovered from the Halls of Fabrication, this almost unreasonably thick suit of clockwork armor made from some sort of brass-like metal reinforced with rubedite exists for one reason and one reason only – to provide the near-perfect defense. Reactive kinetic displacement disperses force from incoming impacts while systemic dampening technology preserves the wearer's physical integrity beyond what would normally be possible as positive daedron amplification arrays speed Restoration effects along its nano-circuits and disperses excess energons generated by the wearer in the form of a Lullian kenetio-lumen field. In layman's terms for those of you not affiliated with the Clockwork King, it's really good armor that gives you a magitech hard-light shield, boosts your vitality and regeneration, and temporarily grants a stronger shield to you and your allies when you use anything that could be classified as an ""Ultimate"" ability. It's essentially the Elder Scrolls equivalent of power armor. Alternatively, you can add these mechanical marvels to any armor or mech you own."
490,,400,Last Stand Of Humanity ,Fate/Grand Order Part 2,Magitek,"Chaldea was raided and destroyed, and yet the Master of Chaldea still managed to escape with their life and work to destroy the Lostbelts. The reason they survived is this large car that you now find in your possession. Called the Shadow Border, it’s several times tougher than most modern tanks, comes equipped with an immense amount of technological and magical sensors and systems, and comes equipped with the Logic Formula in its hull and the 20cm in diameter bronze disc that is the Paper Moon in the navigation room. Apart from being an incredibly tough vehicle, its Paper Moon allows it to dive into Void Space, a theoretical dimension that only exists while you’re actively verifying it with the Shadow Border’s systems, and that lies outside of reality.

You can do a superficial dive, which lets you stick ‘close’ enough to reality that you cover actual distances and have a corresponding coordinate in reality, letting the Shadow Border ‘peek’ into reality in a manner of speaking, or you can do a deep dive, entirely separating yourself from things like space or time, letting you change travel times to be directly proportional to how much of a metaphorical connection you have to your destination instead of distance, and risking being plopped down months or years into the future instead of the amount of time you felt passing within the Shadow Border. Of course, the Logic Formula in its hull is the reason the Shadow Border can maintain its existence in Void Space, so be sure to repair it if it’s broken.

Additionally, if things go as in canon and the Storm Border is created, it’ll be included in this item. A lot larger than the Shadow Border, which is usually stored in the hangar bay, the Storm Border is little different than the Shadow Border, mainly having better overall performance and durability. That said, due to being larger and constructed using mystical means, it is a lot more receptive to modification, such as implanting the formula for the Holy Sword into it to act as one giant Excalibur. Finally, this item is automatically discounted to you if you’ve bought the Fenis Chaldea item."
491,,400,Science Of A Sage,Fate/Grand Order Part 2,Magitek,"The Lostbelts are stagnant histories. Timelines that for some reason or other became unable to branch out into different histories themselves, and as such were pruned away by the World. That is not to say that scientific advancement stopped in such hypotheticals brought back by the Trees of Fantasy. Indeed, the progress of civilization has nothing to do with pruning. And with this purchase, you may gain access to the complete techbase of one such pruned timeline, as of its equivalent of the year 2018 AD. Specifically, that of the Synchronized Intellect Nation; SIN, the third Lostbelt Chaldea will destroy. This alternate history had focused its full scientific prowess for the benefit of a singular man, and as such things like efficiency, miniaturization, electricity, and so on were never even considered.

Of course, you truly understand the knowledge you’ll be given, instead of just getting blueprints for everything downloaded into your mind. Innovation might not be easy without ways to enhance your mind, but it won’t be impossible either. Following will be plenty of examples of what Qin Shi Huang, the only true man in his empire, accomplished.

The pillar of his empire was a modified form of wheat, being immensely nutritious and delicious, immensely sturdy to all kinds of climates and weather conditions to the point it could be planted globally with no issue, and incredibly efficient to use as burning fuel. Another example of this technology’s incredible bioengineering is the Benediction, a special drug that reduces the intelligence of people and kills them only when they have reached old age, in exchange for making them quite happy, as well as immensely enhancing their immune system such that diseases and illnesses are non-existent in the empire. And the downsides of such a drug are intentional, so if you wished you could easily design one with the benefits that doesn’t kill or make people empty-headed.

Another pillar of the empire is the emperor’s body itself. Constructed as a gigantic mountain-sized supercomputer that can float in the air without physical aid, it works off of burning biomass, making use of all the super-wheat being grown across the whole world in his timeline. And you could move your soul and mind into such a vessel after constructing it, in case that needs be said. Additionally, the warriors, generals, and other various legendary figures of this timeline have been cryogenically frozen in a massive facility under a mountain, to be unfrozen later, perhaps centuries afterwards, with little issues beyond a risk of confusion and some small berserk rage when waking up. Additionally, Qin Shi Huang utilized specially constructed cannons to launch his Benedictions all across the planet, for swift delivery to his subjects world-wide.

One of the most impressive achievements made with this technology is the three century long construction of a massive ring around the Earth, an orbital Great Wall if you will, serving as defense for cosmic invaders and allowing you to disconnect certain sections to make them fall to the Earth like a meteor, should you wish to wipe out a town. A more small-scale but no less impressive process would be granting people spiritual and physical immortality like that of the Zhenren of China, and scanners able to obtain full information on any objects with enough scans are also possible.

One of the more ostentatious shows of power Qin Shi Huang performed was the projection of magnetic waves, in such a way as to make any sufficiently hard object vibrate and produce sound as if he was physically present and talking, down to the precision of a singular human skull from across the planet, as well as sufficiently thorough surveillance equipment he could use such magnetic communication to hold a full conversation as long as the other party was exposed to the sky.

And finally, this technology can allow you to mass-produce Low Rank mechanized infantry, for the purposes of war, as well as produce and maintain an immensely powerful android warrior the likes of Xiang Yu, as expensive as he is. And finally, due to this technology having been developed by learning all sage arts from the Fusang Tree, you could feasibly create a human body for yourself, one powerful enough to be on the level of the Grand Rank. Of course, all these examples were done by an emperor with full and total control over an entire planet for thousands of years, with the developed infrastructure to match. That said, you do possess all the knowledge that the Lostbelt Qin Shi Huang possessed, so perhaps all you need to start catching up is an empire of your own."
492,,400,Red Queen,DMC 5,Magitek,"The Red Queen is a heavily customized version of the Durandal, an anti- demon weapon for officer's of the Order of the Sword. It is a a mechanical sword with a powerful fuel injection system in the form of a combustion engine. The propellant sprayed onto the blade allows it to unleash attacks of great power, and revving the hilt activates the Exceed system, which coats the blade in flames to set foes ablaze. The Red Queen's complex customizations means only you are capable of controlling it."
493,,400,Devil Breakers,DMC 5,Magitek,"These may come in handy. What you have here are a series of cybernetic arms that would have been created by Nico Goldstein. You have five of each of the 13 different Devil Breakers, some of which are created using fragments of defeated demons to bestow them with certain abilities, such as slowing down time. These are also far more durable than the originals, allowing for high output performance without having them break easily, but should any Devil Breaker be destroyed, then they will return, fully repaired, a minute later. These may also come in gauntlet forms, allowing you to use them without needing to lose your arm."
494,,400,Engineering Gunsmith,DMC 5,Magitek,"You are an extremely talented engineer, surpassing even Nico, who has created some of Lady’s Guns and all of Nero’s prosthetics. Your gunsmithing skills are even better, surpassing even Nell Goldstein. You even know the trick in how to make guns have infinite ammo. You are also able to deduce how the abilities of demons work and replicate them through technology and alchemy."
495,,400,Isolated Oil Rig,Fate/Grand Order Part 1,Magitek,"One of the biggest assets that Marisbury Animusphere possessed was Seraphix, an oil rig in the North Atlantic Ocean, that acted as an ordinary oil rig by day and was the seedbed for some of his most important (and most unethical) experiments at night. And with this purchase, you get a copy of it, ideally in a different ocean entirely. The oil rig is built as a mobile, submersible, double-layered platform. The topmost platform serves as the normal oil rig facilities (and also has a church for some reason), but the true purpose of the facility lies in the second platform. Hidden in locked chambers accessible only to those who are permitted entrance, is a powerful magical generator that powers all manners of spiritron-based equipment, such as leyline sensors that allow you to map what are effectively the brainwaves of the Planet you are on.

Thanks to its secrecy and ability to be isolated from civilization by submerging itself underwater, as well as a special Mystic Code that prevents divination from peering into the insides of the facility, this is a perfect workshop for experiments that would get you hunted down by the Clock Tower. Marisbury was conducting research into connecting the souls of humans with that of the Planet by synchronizing their Magic Circuits with the oceanic leylines, and used failed Master candidates as living biological circuits kept in stasis. Ultimately, Marisbury’s research was a success. And now you have your very own Seraphix facility to perform experiments with. Will you keep utilizing it for its intended purpose, perform some other kind of experiment, or dismantle the whole thing to repurpose it into something less unethical? You are the owner, so the choice is yours."
496,,400,Time Travel But Not Really,Fate/Grand Order Part 1,Magitek,"The Singularities are distortions in the timeline of the world. Appropriately, you must travel to their time in order to enter them. Chaldea’s solution for such a thing was a specific piece of technology, that of Rayshifting. Developed by Marisbury Animusphere, the process is fundamentally that of transforming a human into spiritrons, and sending them into the past, allowing them to alter it. Unfortunately, not everyone is compatible with the process, a compatibility that is needed to survive the Rayshifting, and the standard defenses of this World immediately undo any changes made to the timeline, should they not be protected by a powerful artifact like a Holy Grail.

Additionally, an unfortunate quirk of time travel is that those who are Rayshifted are not recognized by reality as belonging, marking them as an “unknown”, and resulting in an ambiguous existence. This is accounted for with the Rayshifting technology, coming attached to equipment that can monitor the existential values of those Rayshifted, correct any drift, and continuously confirm the existence of whoever is Rayshifted. If this was not done, the Rayshifted individual might find themselves changing ever so slightly, like a character whose characterization isn’t being kept consistent by the author, to use a literary metaphor.

With this purchase, you obtain enough equipment to Rayshift a team of up to 12 people. The magical energy generator it comes attached to is only enough to maintain those Rayshifts, so if you want to do something like send a Master with multiple Servants, you’ll need another source of additional magical energy to sustain those Servants. Still, this is as close to time travel as a cosmos that automatically corrects the timeline can get, and perhaps in future worlds, worlds where the timeline doesn’t fix itself without some powerful artifact blocking it, Rayshifting could function as true time travel?"
497,,400,Generalized CAD,The Irregular at Magic Highschool,Magitek,"This CAD can take almost any form you want, from a bracelet to a pendant to a stick, and store up to 99 different Activation Sequences though it’s usually less precise than a specialized CAD."
498,,400,Specialized CAD,The Irregular at Magic Highschool,Magitek,"Specialized CADs are often faster in execution over Generalized CADs, at the detriment of their Activation Sequence capacity, only supporting up to 9 different Sequences from a single system of Magic from the 4 Great Systems. This CAD can take almost any form you want although its basic shape is that of a gun with auxiliary aiming systems integrated into the barrel."
499,,400,Thought-Controlled CAD,The Irregular at Magic Highschool,Magitek,"This type of CAD uses Non-Systematic Type Magic as an input instead of manual input through buttons or triggers, rendering often more convenient than traditional CADs. This enable hands-free casting of Magic Sequences through thought alone."
500,,400,Weaponized-Integrated CAD,The Irregular at Magic Highschool,Magitek,"This is a weapon with an integrated CAD, often specialized and with built-in Magic Sequences for rapid-action. Choose a type of weapon, it will have spell designed to enhance its properties (i.e: a sword will have cutting spells, a gun shooting spells, hammer strength spells, etc)."
501,,400,Motorcycle,Final Fantasy XV Royal Edition,Magitek,"You might be asking yourself “Why would I want a motorcycle when the Regalia is right down there for the same price?” Well, because this armored beast can reach a top speed of 400 mph in seconds, has traction that lets you climb walls and run across ceilings, handles like a dream, brakes very efficient no matter the terrain, ignore the laws of physics, uses both non-returning throttle and dual throttle system, has hip-based turning system, can accelerate and brake by the pedals, compartment for weapons, has room for other passenger, built-in autopilot and best of all, it comes with the ability to pilot this beast worthy of legend, you can fight while driving without any problems. For an additional 100 CP the armor is reinforced and dual machine guns are added to the front and back capable of taking down an Iron Giant in 6 seconds; for 50 CP more it can function as a snowmobile; for 50 CP there is a sidecar that can be easily attached and removed from the vehicle, may have a built-in machine gun with 100 CP option. The upgrades are independent of each other and still can grow further, no need for fuel."
502,,400,Spirit Stabilizer,Generic Angels and Demons,Magitek,"A Nephalem, tired of years of suffering caused by their self-contradictory nature, mixed technology and angelic magic to build an armor-like device to prevent their holy and unholy energies from countering each other. While they might or not have succeeded in this goal, you acquired a similar functional device, built and perfected by your own Benefactor. Instead of being a potentially restrictive armor, the device was redesigned to be a gauntlet, but, despite its different form, its main function remains the same. It’s made to force your inner energies to stay stable and don’t collapse or cause some other damage, working not only with demonic and angelic energy but also with any and all kinds of inner energy its user have, like Nen, Ki, Chakra, Viral Energy, among several others. It even grants you a greater resistance against external influence that might attempt to destabilize your energies while wielding the device. Additionally, it doesn’t prevent you from willingly destabilizing your energy to generate some effect, like mixing angelic and demonic power to generate chaos energy for example. Unfortunately, the gauntlet is pretty much mundane in terms of durability, so it might be destroyed with some ease if you aren’t cautious."
503,,400,Assuming Control ,Final Fantasy XIV,Magitek,"Well, now you have an army of automatons, and they’re ready with commands to perform sweeping patrols and eliminate intruders. But that’s probably not all that you want out of them, and when it comes time that you need to take control of a situation, there are plenty of cases where manual control is far preferable to automatic subroutines.

You may freely control an automaton of yours directly. Should they have a visual recognition routine, you can see through it. Should they be capable of vocal expression, you can speak through them. The remainder of their capabilities which you can assume is often dependent on what kind of automaton you make, and what features those automaton possess."
504,,400,Schema,Final Fantasy XIII-3,Magitek,"The AMP technology predates Nova Chrysalia, but traces of it still remain in the clothing and equipment that the people of Nova Chrysalia use today. In sets, their equipment seems to exhibit strange properties. Closer investigation – or rather, reading through the database – reveals that equipment such as garbs, shields, and weapons were made intentionally to work together in sets.

Reproducing that was not hard; though mimicking the effect completely seemed a bit redundant, so you tried a bit of experimentation. By assembling a set of five equipment pieces together, the full set seems to share properties. You’ve identified that at the very least, elemental properties and anything that might trigger from an action are shared amongst each piece of equipment. Having it so that it adapted an elemental defense and converted to an elemental attack took a lot of rabbits to perfect, but you’ve managed to do it. The test sword in your hand finally managed to use all the elements that your armour defended against.

The set however, is wildly unstable – given that you’re exposing it to foreign equipment it’s entirely understandable – and as a result if one part of the set is removed the effect is temporarily lost until the set is put back together again.

You’ve proven with further experimentation that it is possible to have multiple sets established - though only a single set is active at once. Switching elements of the set is possible on the fly, but it requires a bit more time as the system adapts."
505,,400,The Relic,The Destiny Universe,Magitek,"Discovered with the return of Mars during Savathun’s attempt to steal away the Traveler into her Throne World, the Relic is a Darkness artifact capable of taking the memories of objects and artifacts placed within it, and bringing them back into reality, just as they had once been. The Young Wolf used this to create the glaive Enigma from its ancient and damaged component parts, and from there, Guardians used it to create custom-made weapons from the patterns they introduced to it. For your purposes, you may place upon the Relic any weapon you possess, even if that possession is only temporary; the Relic will read that weapon’s past, and from then on, you can create an exact, 1:1 replica of the original version of that weapon. This extends even to fragments of weapons or broken and destroyed ones, it matters not, for the Dark remembers what the Light forgets. Furthermore, as you use weapons crafted by the Relic, you can return them to it and leverage your newfound experience with and attachment to them to customize them as you see fit."
506,,400,Anti-Magic ,The Destiny Universe,Magitek,"The Cabal are further unique in that unlike every single known race in the universe: They have such a scientific supremacy that they are capable of outright suppressing paracausal powers technologically - a feat even the Vex have been unable to achieve. From enormous ‘cages’ capable of entrapping the Traveler and completely severing its connection to the Guardians, to tinier devices that can be attached to Ghosts to sever an individual Guardian’s powers, the Cabal have made great use of conventional science and technology to completely override and eliminate paracausal forces’ powers. This even, as shown by Calus during his invasion of Neomuna, and Cabal forces during Savathun’s activities after receiving the Light, extends to powers of the Darkness.

While you may not have an understanding of how to quantify paracausal and other-such ‘magical’ abilities scientifically, you at least understand the concepts enough to take local resources and technology and create suppression tech that can enforce causality in a given area. No matter the ability or its source, you can learn to suppress it, and with time, even remove it - and bring even the most powerful down to mortality. "
507,,400,Black Armorer(Tier 1)         ,The Destiny Universe,Magitek,"A weapons foundry held in the closest confidence until it was forced to reveal itself to the Tower, the Black Armory was known as the most puissant weapons forge Humanity had ever known, the Black Armory’s weapons were myths unto themselves for their killing power. You now have the same skill as the Black Armory’s greatest smiths and forges, and are a master unto yourself. Any weapon you create is guaranteed to be lethal to the extreme. Arm a civilian population with your weapons, and even without training they could very well hold out against a fireteam of Guardians. From the smallest pistol to the greatest rocket launcher, a humble combat knife to the mightiest sword, every single weapon you create will be of unparalleled lethality and unbeatable quality, destined to be discussed by weaponsmiths for generations to some. A gun made by you could be left in the swamps of Venus for centuries, and when it is pulled out of the muck it would still function perfectly.

For an extra 200 CP, you will no longer be limited to simple, mundane weapons - with the help of some Paracausal resources, you can even weave the Light and Darkness itself into your weapons. Submachine guns that fire Arc rounds, shotguns that fire stasis slugs, hand cannons that literally shoot solar fire, you already excelled in creating instruments of death, but now your weapons have a paracausal edge to them. "
508,,400,(Not) Giving Up the Ghost ,The Destiny Universe,Magitek,"You, like all Risen, understand one thing above all: your Ghost is the source of your incredible prowess and is the only reason for your continued existence. However, unlike the Guardians, you haven’t forgotten this fact—rather, you’ve embraced it as a core principle of your second life. Whether your Ghost is your closest friend or just another tool for the job, you know you need to keep it safe and secure at all costs—lest your immortal life be cut tragically short.

This perk grants you a couple notable benefits. Firstly, it gives you the knowledge and technical skills necessary to begin modifying your Ghost’s shell. Though the exact nature of these modifications may vary depending on your race, at the very least you will be able to do things like improve its durability, give it the ability to hide itself, or even weaponize it to provide direct fire support. More importantly, your Ghost now has some method of reviving you that does not place it in direct peril. Perhaps your Ghost has access to Vex transmat technology or ancient Hive runes that can teleport your body out of harm's way—allowing you to escape mortal danger at the cost of immediately ending the fight. Or maybe the two of you have invented a means of ensuring that your body always disintegrates on death—allowing your Ghost to potentially resurrect you from anywhere. Whatever the case, this perk is reflective of your overriding focus on survival. Your Ghost is your life, and nothing is more important than keeping it—and by extension, you—alive."
509,,400,Merging Magic and Technology,Epic of Leviathan,Magitek,"There are many systems and energies that do not play nice with others. A common example of this is magic and technology. You however, seem to be extremely skilled at merging these into one source. You can freely combine designs, systems, and energies into a working product. For example you could create a magic satellite network capable of ignoring wards."
510,,400,Necrotech,Magnagothica: Maleghast,Magitek,"C.A.R.C.A.S.S. has made its contract with the Bone Carapace Devil, and used the abilities gained from that dark bargain to create all manner of useful tools. You now share in this ability to fuse dark magic and technology, allowing you to create guns from shaped bone, black magic to summon flashbangs, create ammo goblins to vomit up more bullets, or even create constructions comparable to the EGIS Weapon; a mech made of guns, bone and necromantic sorcery. This skill extends more broadly into fusing magic and tech as well - though you’ll always be a bit better when working with dark magic, by whatever metric applies in the setting."
511,,400,Bleeding Meat ,Kult: Divinity Lost,Magitek,"Inferno has a predilection to obscene augmentation, of which you’re something of an artist. When you physical torture others, a dark magic born from your victims’ agony and degradation permits you to add normally impossible mechanical augmentations to their bodies. While this comes with great experience in the nightmarish procedures used to create razides or keep men alive well past the point they should have expired, your ability to create suitable prosthetics is dwarfed by your ability to brute force those to work for victims mutilated under hand and knife. It is common for Hell to make towering juggernauts with armour welded to their skin and the mystic arts at their fingertips out of its victims, and with your depraved ingenuity there is little doubt that you could extend the process to work on other supernatural beings like lictors-or even other nepharites, if you have the ruthlessness to turn on your own kind."
512,,400,Chained In Your Skin,Kult: Divinity Lost,Magitek,"Few mourned the tyrants of the Metropolis upon their fall, for it was their way to not just bring civilisations to their knees but cruelly reshape their bodies, minds and souls with complex machines to be better servants. You now have an elaborate series of cybernetic attachments similar to a Tekron, without sacrificing any of your sapience. Your components can manifest practically any gear a modern society could provide-grenades, a class cutter, a knock-out drug-on short notice, though frequent use of disposables risks depleting you until you’ve rested and replenished yourself.

The attachments may seem grotesque and cover more than half your body, but they protect you from smoke, poisons, gases and pain equally well while letting you connect to computers and machines like an extension of yourself. You also have the power to mystically merge with mechanism, either adding them to your body or fusing with them temporarily, enough that you could control the electricity in them directly. More creative forms of this control may let you modify and improve yourself beyond the nonsentient caretakers of the Metropolis.

As a sidenote should you be a being like an Azghoul, this technopathic affinity will let you prevent your own parasitic cybernetics from controlling you."
513,,400,Keeper of Flesh,Kult: Divinity Lost,Magitek,"The biomechanical Keepers are tall, grey beings of flesh, metal and plastic who being unable to create more of their own kind, love their midwifed children unconditionally. Whether or not you, you now have their power to help life find a way even in conditions as bleak as the Fallen Realms. You know how to construct and manage the grisly Birth Chambers: Vaults with containers of nutritional solution, cryotubes and electric fields where DNA can be interwoven with new genetic material, and protected from the cloying oblivion of Achlys that emanates from below-and you know the techniques that can be used to recreate nearly any denizen of the Fallen Realms. With further study, you might be able to find a more humane alternative to the traditional, grisly means of reproduction left to those the Children of the Underworld must resort to: Lobotomizing humans and hooking them up to the Chambers’ biomechanical machines, to harvest their reproductive material. 

As well as being biologically immortal if you were not already, your own body has a unique adaption to support the creation of children somehow. Perhaps like the Keepers, you possess a womb that can carry children safely to term who as foetuses were created in the Birth Chambers. Perhaps you simply produce some form of secretion that greatly improves the chances of fertility. Either way, whether they know it or not you’re the best chance for a lot of desperate beings’ survival on the edge of nothingness."
514,,400,The Industrial-Titanomachy Complex,Scion ,Magitek,"Like Prometheus, you’ve been touched by the fires of progress. Such is your divine skill at the forge that you can forge technology capable of both withstanding the sweltering interior of Titans-and doing considerable damage to the strongholds of the gods. Beyond mere intelligence, your skill jumps to dizzying heights even without a formal understanding of your work and your powers naturally converge or develop new abilities to stoke the forge, enchant the blade and perform numerous other tasks even as your mind buzzes with intuitive leaps about constructing wonders. From tanks capable of blasting holes in Acopa’s defences, to assault rifles that can survive a siege of Olympus’ slopes you can fashion all manner of marvellous, deadly devices capable of multiplying the force of a fire giant horde considerably. The elemental intensity of Titans or gods can even be used to reinforce such weapons, to the extent that you could even build a giant robot capable of devastating Asgard that can remain under layers of lava indefinitely, with an iron bridge as it’s miles-long sword. Incidentally, if you lacked the innate ability to forge Birthrights as Tengu and dwarves are able to from divinely touched materials this perk definitely grants you that power.

And should you already have considerable supernatural prowess with the forge as a Scion or Titan, you would be considered talented enough to serve as a worthy apprentice to Hephaestus himself. It would still take time to learn all the ways of his craft. But what is time to an immortal? Already you can build automatons sophisticated enough to imitate human beings-and weapons capable of felling gods or Titans."
515,,400,Oracle Drive,Final Fantasy XIII-2,Magitek,"The Oracle Drive of Pulse is a machine used to record events and possibly look into the future. You've tweaked that a little, and now you have a device that can play back events that had happened before in the local vicinity of where it is placed. The playback is real enough to fool the vast majority of onlookers, and will naturally draw any passer-bys in.

However, your Oracle Drive has a more sinister purpose. For all the onlookers which are gathered by the playback, it will copy all of their memories and proceed to wipe out the oldest one. While the playback is short, and does not repeat until you reset it, you can freely access their memories afterwards, and typically several months’ worth of memories will be forgotten entirely.

It then gets worse, if you activate the final option on the Oracle Drive. Rather than displaying the past of a local vicinity, it will take the most traumatic memories of individuals close by and replay them. It seems if you work on it enough you could probably replay something else seeing as it only distinguishes based on how substantial the memory is in the target's mind."
516,,400,7th Ark,Final Fantasy XIII,Magitek,"An ancient defence platform, kept afloat by a graviton core. There’s nothing inside except the core keeping it afloat, life support systems and sensors to show the surroundings. With the right knowledge you might be able to get it to move, but there’s nothing it has for defences except...oh...

A metallic cactuar rests in a dark corner of the Ark. It appears the 7th Ark was a battle platform, designed to mass manufacture and air drop Cactuars onto a specified location. If you had the energy for it, it could create 10 – 15 cactuars per hour, and store a total of 500 cactuars in its docking bays."
517,,400,Beacon of Counterattack,Final Fantasy XIII,Magitek,"You have a spare beacon that you can deploy, and all allies in the vicinity are immediately placed under the effect of a short lasting inertial barrier. The barrier is weak, but for a short time it absorbs damage and heals the ally. 

Might just be what it takes to turn the tide."
518,,400,Strike Team,Final Fantasy XIII,Magitek,"If it was not enough to just send you, your commanding office just airdropped three drones onto the field. The three drones have excellent formation combat tactics (equivalent to a full offensive paradigm shift), use SMGs and grenades – but they’ll adapt to your orders accordingly.

They won’t do anything too sophisticated though, so you can’t order them to pillage corpses or something hideous."
519,,400,Cannon Construct,Cradle V1,Magitek,"You gain one of Madame Geisha’s personal constructs, a cannon that uses 8 different bindings to fire the first giant cluster grenade cradle has ever seen. Reloads once a jump."
520,,400,Architect of Death,Dies Irae,Magitek,"The dead need not remain such. Not entirely. You may not have the power of the Gold but you can make a cruel facsimile of life, provided you have the right materials available. You have the ability to re-animate the dead with science, with just their bodies or by placing a spare soul into that body. The bodies will possess the abilities they did in life and the souls emplaced into a dead body will also transfer their abilities over, though if all you desire is mindlessly loyal soldiers you should avoid mucking with souls. It’s possible to use this process to combine multiply bodies and even multiple souls into a single form, combining their power and abilities and create a hive mind of sorts, though only one soul can be in command at a time. "
521,,400,Dust Bomb,RWBY,Magitek,"This cylindrical shaped Bomb was developed by top Atlesian Scientists. It has distinct similarities with the ones used by the White Fang but is much bigger and MUCH more destructive. Its interface is made of Hard-Light Dust, similar to that of a Scroll, in which the bomb could be set for release, but can also be detonated remotely. It has a large and devastating blast radius, being capable of destroying all of Mantle in one go. You get one Bomb and after being used, you gain a new one in the next Jump."
522,,400,Dust Working,RWBY,Magitek,"Dust isn’t just to be used to fight and combat the darkness of the World. It has so much more potential than that. It is able to power machines, yes entire Kingdoms by itself and can have so much more utility outside even that. And you know how to do that. You know how to work with Dust in optimal ways. This includes imbuing it into machines and using it for other technological advancements. However should the situation call for it, you can also imbue weapons with it and even weave it into clothing. It is still pretty useful for blowing stuff up after all. Post-Jump this translates to any other sort of fantastical energy source or magical material."
523,,400,P.E.N.N.Y.,RWBY,Magitek,"Oh? Well this is curious. You are neither Human, nor Faunus, nor Grimm. You are an Android. Created by a Mastermind of an Atlesian Scientist, you are a machine with the sentience of a human and even the soul of one, allowing you to use Aura. This has given you many gifts. First of, your strength and durability matches and even exceeds that of seasoned Huntsman, being capable of even pushing Amity Tower. You can fly with a set of Rocket Thrusters on your feet, have night and infrared vision and can survive injuries as severe as dismemberment and even decapitation, so long as your cores storing your personality and memory remain intact. Should you do die however, you may be resurrected by your Creator, a process which drains their Aura however so its unlikely you will be able to come back more than once. Your body can keep on being upgraded, potentially making you even more powerful with a bright mind to help you. As a Weapon you can wield a set of 10 small Swords, linked to you by thin cables and allowing you to manipulate them in combat, even making it possible to channel a beam of energy powerful enough to pulverize many kinds of Grimm. Lastly you possess a self destruct mode... perhaps you will find some use for it someday? Lets hope not. There are some downsides to this however. Being an Android you are susceptible to being hacked by outside forces. Amplifying your Aura and an extraordinary amount of willpower would help keep these hacking attempts at bay but the risk is there. You might want to amp up your firewalls. As a Drop-In this will surely make you stand out but should you opt to have a history in this World, you will be the sibling of one Penny Polendina, the only other of your kind. Like Grimm and Faunus, this body becomes an Alt Form."
524,,400,Silhouette Gear,Knight’s and Magic,Magitek,"A powered-suit that is fitting for a person as it amplifies the user's strength and speed while wearing it. It allows the user to carry items that weighs several tonnes and run at subsonic speeds. It is also equipped with weapons suitable for sieging fortified fortress and thrusters which allows it to jump from ground to the roof of a several floor building. Unlike the original, it has its own built-in internal engine allowing the user to use it without wasting their own mana reserves."
525,,400,Junction System,Final Fantasy VIII,Magitek,"Invented by the legendary scientist Dr. Odine, the Junction System is a method by which a normal human draws special energy from draw points or monsters to gain a magic like force called para-magic. Para-magic can be cast as spells, but each draw only grants a limited amount of casts per spell, per monster. These spells run the full range of what you'd expect from combat magic, including healing, attacking, status inflicting, and buffing spells of various kinds and strengths, along with a few more exotic spells. Para-magic can be stored indefinitely. A more advanced application is the Junctioning itself, in which a person attaches a Guardian Force (GF), a kind of elemental spirit, to themselves and uses their power to Junction specific para-magic stocks to their individual 'stats', using the magic to greatly boost their attributes or apply special effects like poison or sleep to their attacks, all of which can be swapped around or removed at will.

The increase is tied directly to how many casts of a particular spell are stored, up to a total of 100, which are not consumed or otherwise diminished while Junctioned. However, what stats can be boosted are determined by the experience and strength of the GF, which must be increased through frequent summoning and training, and which are restricted to the limited stats supported by the Junction System. Unfortunately, the GFs take up residence inside of the user's mind in the portion where they store their memories, slowly eroding the details of their history until it has induced total amnesia of events predating five years or so in the past. There have even been cases where the user forgot they had a GF Junctioned at all. This drawback has made Junctioning controversial and unpopular outside of SeeD. On the bright side, you get 2 GFs of your own with this purchase. See the companion section for details."
526,,400,Mana Detector Satellite,Solo Leveling,Magitek,"A marvelous piece of magitech developed by the Japanese government. This machine allows for real time reading of the mana levels in any location throughout the world. This is very useful in a world where walking natural disasters and two-legged weapons of mass-destruction emit very distinctive quantities of mana, allowing not only to point their location at all times, but also to measure their level of power.

This satellite will be deployed in any future worlds you visit, and you can access and direct it through any computer or phone you have, by an already preinstalled application. Additionally, in future worlds, the satellite will tune to detect any kind of super-natural energies and entities, functioning in the same way as it treats mana in this world."
527,,400,Singular Purpose,Library of Ruina: HamHamPangPang,Magitek,"Now, this is dangerous, you somehow managed to get your hands on not just a Singularity of a Wing, past or present, but also its full specifications in intricate detail. Whether this is something like F Corp’s “Fairies”, R Corp’s Hatchery design, or however the hell T Corp’s singularity works, the Singularity is fully revealed to you with the Wing and Beholders currently none the wiser but if you reveal that you know about it then chances are the Beholders will find out, and you really don’t want the Head to know you have this if it’s from an existing Wing. Regardless if they do find out then get ready to either run to the Outskirts or be constantly hounded by Arbiters, Claws, and legions of corporate security and Fixers. Though if you pick a fallen Wing’s singularity then you probably won’t be in as much danger, the Head still wants you to pay up for the right to have that, but you aren’t worth sending Arbiters or Claws immediately.

There’s a list of Singularities in the Notes, each purchase lets you choose one of them, and you cannot pick any of the Head’s Singularities(A, B, and C Corp)."
528,,400,Ironclad Brother ,Library of Ruina: HamHamPangPang,Magitek,"Bionics are just as important to the Workshops as making weapons and armor, for Fixers and syndicates using them accelerates or skips the process of getting used to a weapon or learning how to best use it. Remember though, the City can’t run on only Fixers and Syndicates, so really anybody who can afford new organs or limbs can get one tailored specifically for their line of work. Your models are pretty high-end, at least internally, from an outside perspective they look completely normal, perhaps too much like from a medical textbook. But when you need to do so these organs can perform their function at about ten times the effectiveness or efficiency of their natural counterparts. You get six organs/limbs with the first purchase and four each later purchase, for each you can pick whether it gets more effective or efficient.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
529,,400,Scientific Complex,Bibliomania,Magitek,"This is a massive sub dimension containing a massive multistore scientific complex which updates every jump to contain more scientific resources, advanced tech to work with and has several ways things can be stored. The complex is the size of New York City with the height and width but is much more complex, containing automaton assistants and a loyal AI to assist with any experiments and construction. Just with the base automation of this complex you can have the place build massive tanker ships by the dozen every 3 months. The resources in this complex are infinite and updated with any and all scientific resources and tech in the worlds you jump into, though nothing that is unique to the point only 1 or 2 of them exist, though 3 or more of any tech is automatically added to the archives and can be built rapidly. The AI automatically makes use of any new tech to enhance the complex fully and within 2 weeks teh whole place will be as advanced as they can be and will always be more efficient. The complex also has a 10 to 1 time dilation making 10 hours in the complex only 1 out of it. There are various garages, hangars and mech/spaceship shelter complexes within the complex allowing you to take out anything you build up to the size of 300 meters in radius. The place always has power and has various rest rooms, break rooms and sleeping quarters. It also enhances scientific curiosity and learning rate for scientific endevors. While it will update any time a new scientific or mundane material is made/discovers in the jumps you are in, magical and mythical materials have to be manually added but once added they gain an infinite supply like all other materials(effectively if you add a gram of Vibranium, you’d effectively have more than all of Wakanda.)"
530,,400,Hardy-Daytona,Final Fantasy VII: Remake,Magitek,"Every knight needs a loyal steed. This custom-designed motorcycle is durable enough to shrug off small-arms fire, fast enough to outrun killer robots, and maneuverable enough to turn on a dime. You may control this cycle like an extension of your own body, and combat undertaken while riding this magnificent bike will not hinder you in the slightest. It’s powerful engine is fueled by a mako fuel cell, ensuring you’ll never run out of gas. Your balance, perception, and reaction time will all be in sync with this motorcycle, no matter what your enemies throw at you. Ride hard!"
531,,400,Guard Dog,Final Fantasy VII: Remake,Magitek,"Shinra has decided to protect their investment...by giving you one of their advanced attack robots! You can model your mechanical minion after any of Shinra’s creations, such as the Scorpion Sentinel, the high-speed MotorBall, or even the titanic Airbuster. All robots are formidable weapons platforms, but you can choose to trade heavy armor for enhanced mobility and visa-versa. Perfect for protecting one of Shinra’s top assets; you!

Alternatively, you might want a more organic guardian. Maybe Rufus bred two war hounds, or perhaps Dr. Hojo cooked up something else for you. Either way, your new animal friend has been enhanced by either cybernetics, magic, or both. Whether you want a Darkstar with a Materia collar, a rocket-powered Chocobo, or something else entirely, your loyal companion will serve as a potent protector."
532,,400,Getting With The Times,High School DxD,Magitek,"The whole ‘brimstone and fire’ thing is great and all, but the sad fact is that humans have changed much over the centuries, and so it falls onto the supernatural world to change with them. You’re something of a pioneer, able to combine both technology and magic together seamlessly to create unique inventions of superscience...things like a hatred-powered robot, or blueprints for something based off of the Evil Piece system. With a little time and ingenuity, who knows what you’ll put together?"
533,,400,Drone Hub,Final Fantasy VII,Magitek,"Interesting choice. Are you familiar with Cait Sith, Jumper? The little cat riding on the back of a fat Moogle that claims to be a fortune teller? He's actually one of the leads of Shrina mentally controlling a robotic double. Taking from his example, this item consists of two portions. First, it's a psychically-linked mental interface you attach to yourself, letting you mentally control and direct a robot linked to the device. The second thing is the robot in question, which can be any sort of appearance or design matching the choices of the Unusual Biology perk. This robot will behave with a personality mirroring yours when left on automatic, but will otherwise follow mental commands and directions as though they were an extension of your body. In addition, they share all of your combat skills and abilities, though obviously they can only use equipment on their person. I hope you have the multitasking needed to make good use of this. "
534,,400,Mako Reactor Blueprints,Final Fantasy VII,Magitek,"Gaia bleeds her lifeblood to fuel Shinra's engine of luxuries and military power, a course that may well spell doom for the Planet and all life on it in the distant future. Why not add future worlds to that grim total? You receive a special copy of Mako Reactor blueprints, detailing their construction and how to apply their principles to any planet with life on it. Even without the Lifestream existing in future worlds, you know how to make these reactors draw Mako out of worlds they are built on, slowly killing said world as you gain a convenient energy source. Build enough at a high enough output and the world will not be able to recover, eventually dying completely. These can also be adapted to instead produce energy from specific resources, although it tends to generate much less efficient results. You care about your bottom line, don't you?"
535,,400,Spirit Origin Enhancement Device,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Magitek,"A relic stolen away by one of the worst rogues in Saber history. The Spirit Origin Enhancement Device is a portable chamber, small enough to fit in a ship’s lounge, that is powered by large amounts of Artorium. With enough fuel, it can create an exact copy of any Spirit Origin placed within, allowing it to create full clones of any Servant or other spiritual being. What? It doesn’t work on anyone but a Saber? That doesn’t seem like much of an issue. Who would want to make a clone of anything but another Saber? Especially when copies are able to combine to increase the power of the original, as clones can be programmed to lack wills of their own. Allowing such power in the hands of a dirty lancer is just unthinkable."
536,,400,My Stallion 2,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Magitek,"A proper space-age rocketship! It’s as valuable as all of England and moves as fast as you’d expect! It might look kinda junky but this ship can cross the galaxy in just weeks without warping and it’s warp drive is really top of the line! It only crashes now and then, usually into some alternate timeline or strange situation. You lost the instructions but it’s entirely possible the warp drive actually does work for time travel, if you can figure out what all the buttons do. 

The ship also comes with cooking and laundry facilities but they don’t really live up to what you hoped for in such a cutting edge rocketship. The weapons sure do though, powerful auto-cannons and missile launchers that can obliterate most servants on a direct hit. There’s even a wrist-bound remote targeter for you to call in artillery from the ship. "
537,,400,Dread Captain Nikola,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Magitek,"Technology has gotten a little eclectic, given that it almost always comes from the deranged minds of the various Casters across the galaxy. You might cross one sector and go from seeing shining space-age metropoli on one world to a steampunk space empire on another. You’ve a mind to keep up with the various genii found across the stars, with a general understanding of most common cosmic-age technology. You do have the usual specialty though, a field in which you can produce all kinds of wonders. 

An outdated electrical studies major who somehow took the inferior to Artorium energy and created technology to terrorise half the galaxy, raining down lightning as if like Zeus himself. A steam obsessed scientist who revived the ancient art to create a star empire of steam powered robots and ships. Even a Servant scientist who studies the Saint Graphs themselves, to learn to modify and manipulate such things. There’s not much a smart man can’t accomplish in this galaxy and age, not with enough time and resources. And since everyone is immortal, is it much wonder that every genius seems to end up a pirate or super villain?"
538,,400,Project Bunny        ,Honkai Impact 3rd,Magitek,"A blue and silver robot that appears to be somewhat similar to a floating torso. It appears behind you in the air whenever you summon it or whenever you’re in impending danger. It is capable of transforming into a motorcycle capable of ramming right through a Honkai Beast and ripping its head straight off. It is also capable of generating its own tracks. It also has fabricators and micro-perpetual reactors inside of it to fuel its functions. It is able to create temporary Honkai Energy Constructs, and can produce solid matter from said Honkai Energy when desired. Finally, Project Bunny is controlled by your thoughts via a neural interface."
539,,400,Honkai Legacy,Honkai Impact 3rd,Magitek,"The true, absolute legacy of the previous era is not all of this, however – it is Project EMBER, the upliftment of the present era to allow them to match the glory of the past era. Thus, when Dr. MEI came to me to offer a deal, this was the result. Instead of just granting you a tech-base of only the Past Era of Humanity in this world, I have decided to give you a much greater boon. This is a complete, self-updating archive of all technology to ever exist in the past, present, and future in this universe. It updates with each world you go to, and always contains step-by-step guides to building anything in the archive, no matter how difficult or seemingly impossible it is."
540,,400,Fourth Generation Battlesuit ,Honkai Impact 3rd,Magitek,"The peak of modern battlesuit technology generated by Shicksal's scientists, this has all the amenities a Valkyrie could ask for... Except for a cup holder. The suit is extensive enough to warrant bare minimum a month of training in its use, one can be expected to take a year even. Fortunately for you, this suit comes with its own training.

The battlesuit comes with all the latest post-modern functionality, integrated comms, energy readings, signal hijacking, holo displays for information and video calls, the works. Additionally, this suit provides flight and substantial physical increases on top of energy regeneration. It comes with two functions unique to this battlesuit: The first of which is a skin layer barrier at all times preventing a slip in attention from breaking through your guard. The second of which is an ‘ultimate attack’.

After you have reached your peak, you can push past it and drive into an even further ultimate state. While the state is unique to you and enhances every aspect of your powers, this is a high-risk high-reward activation. It rapidly drains the battlesuit’s power, giving you limited time to put this state to use, after which it will be no more effective than a normal battlesuit until it has had time to recharge. Furthermore, this battlesuit puts a very heavy strain on the users body and can rapidly drain the unprepared of their energy and cause them to collapse until they are used to it."
541,,400,Personal Guardian,Honkai Impact 3rd,Magitek,"A personalized mecha suit made to protect you. It has a rudimentary AI installed in it so it can follow your orders, but it’s at its strongest when you are personally piloting it. It comes in three varieties; Agility, Brute, and Artillery. If you have the knowhow, you could swap it between the types, given some time. The mecha is very comfortable for you to ride and comes in your personalized colors. In terms of strength, it’s very powerful, being able to go toe to toe with even the stronger Honkai Beasts and destroy lesser ones like they barely were a concern. With the right knowledge and skills, you can upgrade it even further..."
542,,400,Soulium Clones ,Honkai Impact 3rd,Magitek,"If you’re a clone, what’s to say you can’t have clones made of yourself? Sure, they’re not flesh-and-blood copies of yourself, but autonomous humanoid soulium constructs that replicate your body, consciousness and powers perfectly should be pretty close, no? If you agree, then good, because if you pick this, then you get a huge army of clones (10,000). They respawn automatically in the next jump if killed somehow. Additionally, if your main body dies, your consciousness automatically goes to one of these clones, and converts said clone into an exact copy of your original body, down to the conceptual level. These clones can also convert themselves into an exact copy of any person they touch, down to the genetic and behavioral data.

Note: This doesn’t affect their loyalty or synchronicity with you, only how they act while they are transformed. And if said person that the clones are imitating dies while the clone is imitating them, their consciousness will transfer over to the clone body instead.

Note #2: I don’t know how, but the Soulium Clones can fool genetic tests, as they seem to have the exact genetic data you have, but do not even have truly flesh-and-blood bodies, as their bodies are composed of Soulium."
543,,400,Moon Ring,Honkai Impact 3rd,Magitek,"How did you- you know what, never mind, there’s enough shenanigans going on as is. Anyways, this is a prototype that won’t be conceived until a few years in the future, based on the Selene; a band that can be worn either on the arm or wrist that converts excess Honkai energy into regular electric energy.

While it can serve as a glorified battery or alleviate a Honkai infection long enough for medical attention, its primary combat purpose is to enhance the wearer’s capabilities via one of its four cores, which are charged by said conversion, then being able to be manually triggered before having to recharge again. Think of this White Heat as a “super mode” of sorts, though they can’t be switched between in the midst of combat as the systems need a bit of time to readjust to the new configuration.
- The Basic ATK core simply empowers your basic strikes, letting you hit much harder and faster and possibly expand your moveset as well. It’s simple but effective.
- The Ultimate core instead charges up high-power moves and techniques, sometimes adding additional effects (somehow) and otherwise letting those high-commitment moves hit well above their weight class.
- The QTE core is variable, based on your equipment; the better and more advanced it is, the bigger the boost it does. As for what it does, generally speaking it’ll let you interfere with and enter fights better, though how it manifests tends to be different based on the loadout.
- The Evasion core rounds out the Moon Ring, and boosts your evasive and counterattack skills. Rather simple, I know...

But these boosts, even on their own, are massive, especially for a Valkyrie, can easily overwhelm even one of the Sky People, and if you aren’t satisfied it also comes with slots for custom chips that give passive effects (a set of which is included) to give some variety to each core.

Your Moon Ring is further upgraded on top of that; it doesn’t just allow a Honkai-afflicted person to fight as per normal, but can outright stop any further corruption and degradation while it’s on. The anonymous genius who did it even made it so that you could even have all four cores active at once in White Heat alongside a vastly more efficient battery (bordering on downright infinite for all but the most prolonged of conflicts) eventually with some of your own tinkering, but you can’t exactly be wily-nily with sharing; once someone wears a Moon Ring, it locks onto their genetics and does not allow anyone else to use it.

They seem to have accounted for this and have hooked you up with a once-in-a-lifetime deal of one new Moon Ring each month."
544,,400,Improved Body Modification ,Library of Ruina V1.0,Magitek,"Body modification isn't a far fetched concept out there in the city. Fork out the cash and you can replace whole body parts, even your own head, with robotics. If metal isn't your thing, how about attaching bionic equipment? This perk ensures that modifications made to your body safely come across with a 100% success rate. No matter what changes are made to you, you will not suffer body dimorphism and can operate as if you've always been this way. This goes both ways: You'll also have advanced knowledge on the human body and the sciences behind this kind of modification, so this perk comes into effect on the people you work on."
545,,400,Blueprint Cache,Final Fantasy VI,Magitek,"This large collection of tubes contain what is likely to be the single most valuable horde of treasure to anyone with a hint of ambition and technical skill. Each one holds the blueprints necessary to recreate a piece of the Gestahlian Empire’s Makitek might. Magitek Armored suits, steam engines that require neither fire nor water, even bits and pieces of their factory that drains and processes captive Espers. Given the proper materials, a few extra hands, and enough time, someone armed with these blueprints could rival the prowess of Cid himself."
546,,400,Natural Inventor,Final Fantasy VI,Magitek,"The World of Balance has gone through a technological renaissance since the times of the ancient war. It had to so that it could replace the gap that magic left behind. So, naturally, those with the smarts and creativity to cram two gears together could easily make a name for themselves. You’ve got a marvelous mind when it comes to advancing the plodding pace of technological advancements. You see possibilities in ideas that others would miss, even when it comes to completely foreign substances or machines. Now if only you had the skills to make your imagination into reality."
547,,400,I Wish Everyone Could Use It        ,DxD Universe,Magitek,"Wow now you actually know science! Magic science to be more specific and to be even more specific science that gives you the ability to turn something that very few people have to something available to the common folk! Sure you might have to kill a few kids along the way, but hey now everyone gets a holy sword, or the power of destruction, or holy energy in general, the list goes on."
548,,400,RECON MECH OR A-POD TRANSPORT,CthulhuTech,Magitek,"You own a recon mech such as a Rapier, Saber, Eclipse, or Hurricane. If you have the Engel Synthesis Interface, this is upgraded to a recon Engel, such as Aral or Auphan. Alternatively, you can have an A-500 A-pod commercial air transport that can carry up 500 passengers or 58 tons of cargo at up to 600mph."
549,,400,POWERED ARMOR ,CthulhuTech,Magitek,"A set of power armor such as Centurion, Crusader, Borealis, or Gale. Makes you stronger and protects you. Won't let you win against a tank, but it should make you near immune to small arms."
550,,400,THINGS MAN WAS MEANT TO KNOW,CthulhuTech,Magitek,"You have a few advanced degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics areas. You can engineer any technological (but not technomagical) wonder that exists in this jump. In future jumps you will be able to engineer any standard technologies of the setting."
551,,400,Mantra Reactor,Asura’s Wrath,Magitek,"The most advanced personal mantra device is installed in your cyborg body, further amplifying your ability to wield Mantra. Assuming you can arrange for it, you are capable of wielding an more than a civilization's worth of focused Mantra without hurting yourself.

You gain a new Mantra Form: Mantra [Your Name]. Increases your Maximum Mantra Level by 3.

552,,400,Cyborg Hindu Godbody,Asura’s Wrath,Magitek,"You have a genetically, cybernetically and magically enhanced physiology, and the knowledge to propagate this technology. Your capacity to wield Mantra is enhanced, both accepting general Mantra as well as your primary association.

This constructed body can heal itself, or be repaired by yourself or others. Your magical physiology is obvious, but always aesthetically pleasing. You can survive in space without a suit, endure planet-­busting attacks with sufficient Mantra, and are otherwise ageless. 

This increases your maximum Mantra Level by 2."
553,,400,Demigod Atelier,Asura’s Wrath,Magitek,"You know the secret science of Mantra technology, and can build custom devices that are powered by prayer or emotion. Further, you can enhance or upgrade items from other jumps to use this same power source. If you take Cyborg Hindu Godbody, you may construct Demigod cybernetics for other people. After the jump concludes, you may also build Mantra Reactors.

Demigod Atelier allows you to create any mantra-­powered or integrated device, up to and including the vast fleets of Shinkoku Tratstrium, the heavenly vessels of the divine armies, and even the anti­Gohma platform Brahmastra. The latter however would require millennia of effort, and was never completed even in the scope of the original setting."
554,,400,TimeTrack’s Tremendous Tick Tock Box (and Torture Toy),Library of Ruina,Magitek,"Time can be a terrible tire, can’t it? Never taking proper tempo, throwing trials too fast to track. Well, no more! This train themed treasure trove is here for your temporal troubles. This box is constantly being fed TimeTrack’s end product: collected time. For each real-time second that passes, it gains a second of time to be spent in enclosed and treated spaces. At least, a second proportional to a modest room. It can be compressed into smaller spaces for rushing artistry, or spread thinly across larger ones for more industrial purposes. As a bonus, there are a few smaller scale blueprints included to use your reserves. The first is forsomething resembling a stun gun, which injects copious time into those on the receiving end's mind. This is poor for mental health, barring non- human mentalities which can process however many years of isolation compressed into an instant properly. The second is more civilian: boxes within which to age whatever needs aging, like wines or cheeses. They’re self sanitizing, and keep interior conditions consistent. "
555,,400,Augmentation: Star of the City,Library of Ruina,Magitek,"This is the point where the cybernetics find themselves less limited due to availability, and more due to the fact that if they were to be implanted in a normal person they’d be torn to pieces. Though these also tend to be masterpieces, single works of art unlikely to be replicated. At this point you probably have at least some bits of a singularity involved, as your attacks sweep the entire battlefield into a sea of flame under your control, or your gloves hold a near endless array of the finest weapons from numerous workshops and can be overclocked to deliver a truly stupendous barrage of attacks upon a single foe from all the weapons contained within. Whatever your chosen gimmick is, it will be taken to true extremes, allowing you to face down entire offices of lesser fixers without breaking a sweat."
556,,400,Geronimo’s Cadillac ,HighSchool DxD,Magitek,"Sure, being a hero is nice and all, but we gotta refill the common soldiers. And what better soldier than a clone of someone with high specs? Nothing. Here I give you a cloning facility with a training station attached. With enough DNA samples (can be yours or from anyone), you can make a clone or a hundred, they will inherit all the basic powers and talents from the original. The machinery allows for preventive modifications, in case you want them to start with certain knowledge, rapidly grow up to their prime age, change their original sex, or just make them more submissive to your authority. Not very heroic, but very effective."
557,,400,Greater Cross,HighSchool DxD,Magitek,"Sacred Gears are prized pieces of power and sought by more than a few, however they can’t be taken out just like that - the inherent bond between them and the souls of their users means that extracting the gears is not only very difficult, but it also means killing the user. But that seems a bit problematic, so I’ll give you this modified extractor, which is based on the cross used by some Fallen to extract sacred gears, except this one does it faster, more efficiently, and non-lethally... unless you feel like killing someone."
558,,400,Code Black 0000,HighSchool DxD,Magitek,"An old, rusted key. A lost piece of machinery by ancient gods forgotten by time itself. It has a very strange effect, one that goes both ways. You see, it can be used to ‘free’ whatever soul or spirit is being trapped in some item, like a Sacred Gear, for example. However, this can also be used in living beings with their permission, at which point it would transform and ‘trap’ them into some item to augment others, like a wolf familiar becoming a collar that makes the user into a werewolf, or a phoenix bird could become a ring that gives the wearer fire magic and night-eternal regeneration powers."
559,,400,Clockwork Nightmare,HighSchool DxD,Magitek,"You are a genius when it comes to mathematics, natural science, and magical engineering. Your brainpower is increased to make you a prime sorcerer, capable of multi-casting several high-end spells at the same time, without a single error in your calculations. Furthermore, you have learned a way to intertwine the magic you have mastered with the technological advancements of humanity to increase your options in battle. And have become quite proficient at it, able to create trinkets that aid your magic, modern weaponry with ancient enchantments, or a smartphone with spells pre-coded in an app for rapid casting."
560,,400,Maverick Before Breakthrough,HighSchool DxD,Magitek,"More than just humanity being humanity and marching ever onwards, the supernatural community has been changing in recent years. You specially, are something of a pioneer, a researcher and visionary – one able to combine both technology and magic together seamlessly to create unique inventions that defy common sense. A driven mind in the same capacity as the leader of Grigori, Azazel, and quite able to match his inventions without issue. If focused enough, you could easily find ways to extract, modify, and even create artificial Sacred Gears. Although you could easily just use your time to make gender-swapping guns, giant robots, cloning machinery, or somesuch projects. As a bonus, you’re exceedingly good at finding funding and resources for your projects, either by meeting with well-connected individuals interested in your research, or by stumbling upon the ‘materials’ you need."
561,,400,False Soldiers ,Final Fantasy III,Magitek,"Takka, Refia’s adoptive father and the one who taught her smithing, would go on to create truly wondrous creations. Specifically mechanical soldiers capable of fighting with actual skill in combat. You now know the methods to create these soldiers, but lack the secret to giving them true intelligence."

Rather than damaging targets, the bullets disperse utility effects such as healing, providing shields and tranquilisation. When fired from the handgun, the bullets instantly warp to a target you can see, regardless of distance. While the number of bullets in the box starts off small, its capacity will slowly increase as you work for the company. The bullets themselves restock every hour. The gun does not accept conventional ammunition."
563,,400,The Blessings of Technology,Fate/Strange Fake,Magitek,"These are modern times, and while the enemies of the faith have adapted to them, it is only to be expected that the Lord’s devotees do the same. And thus, you were born to be the Lord’s iron fists.

Around seventy percent of your body has been replaced with a mix of near-futuristic technology hybridized with a vast collection of mystic codes. This makes you superhumanly strong, even more so than your average experienced executor, enough to tear through walls with ease, you can catch all the bullets from a machine gun fired at you with just a hand, and your arms can extend for a few meters, and you even have blessed rocket launchers and Black Key-like blades hidden inside of your extremities. One of your eyes has been replaced with an artificial eye that allows you to perfectly see from hundreds of meters of distance. What’s more, since this artificial Mystic Eye is powered by both technology and magic, you may only use the functionalities of the technological side to avoid being detected by magical senses when observing. This applies to all of your modifications: as they are both of technology and magic, it seems that you can hide them from all but the most powerful senses of both, until you reveal the true might of your blessed steel reinforced body. 

You are truly powerful even when facing humans, but when it comes to facing the enemies of mankind, specially those that fall under the bloodsucker category, your blows could be as devastating as a nuclear weapon would be to non mystical creatures, as one would expect from the origin of your body.

This blend of technology and sacred rites also confers you a special privilege: Befitting of an executor of the Lord’s will, you also have the knowledge of how every gadget on your body works, how to replicate the process in others, and even how to repair and improve your own body, integrating whatever new magics o technology you happen to know. Deliver the Lord’s wrath a steel punch at a time."
564,,400,The Cornerstone of Heaven ,Godbound,Magitek,"High within the halls of broken Heaven are the engines of the world. These enigmatic devices maintain the natural laws of the realms and preserve them against the constant hunger of Uncreated Night. Once they were tended by the angelic Host, legion upon legion of celestial beings to preserve their perfect function and mystic order. Now they run down in slowing cycles, those that have not been broken, scavenged, or sabotaged by Heaven's bitter exiles.

Each engine maintains a particular natural law or geographic structure for a particular realm. There may be an engine for a particular mountain, or for the natural progression of seasons, or for the happiness that wells in a mother's heart at her newborn infant's smile. Engines can stand responsible for vast concepts such as ""gravity"" or tiny details such as the color of sunlight on gold. This is such an engine, fully functioning. Though if you wish, it may be a minor one, for say the sound of the Letter J on your ears.

You could possibly study it, or perhaps salvage it for spare parts if you’re really so desperate. And while the divine energy the engine constantly outputs cannot be channelled into Dominion, perhaps in time you may find other uses for it like recreating a safer form of the power parasite gods obtain or enhancing existing artifacts.

You may purchase additional engines.

565,,400,Godwalker(Tier 3),Godbound,Magitek,"A relic of ancient theotechnical research, godwalkers are an offshoot of the arts that forged the Made Gods. Once, these great war machines of polished steel and glowing sigils laid waste to the battlefields of the Former Empires. Few now remain in any kind of good condition-and the machine you now wield is an exception among exceptions. Operating by drawing divine sympathies between their shape, their function and their pilots each Godwalker has two key components: A chakra engine, the locus of its divine fire and the interface between its artifices and the celestial forces that power it which determines what manner of and how many divine components can be attached to it. And a sacred armature, the basic chassis of the godwalker which can provide different advantages through the symbolic principles it reifies-including vast transport space, integral flight ability or simple sturdy construction. A godwalker shaped like a vehicle is peerless in transporting its writers and destroying those who impede it’s path, while some experimental varieties were even designed as thrones or libraries.

As for the armaments of the godwalkers, it is no exaggeration to say their component can mimic many lesser Gifts on a scale greater than mankind. While some components simply permit a godwalker to emulate any Gift related to perception, communication, movement, transformation, creation, alteration, defence and protection or attacking and certain forms of harm including the universal smitings of Godbound centred on the great machine itself more unique abilities of a similar scale have also been created. Some examples are provided below:
- Anchor of the Holy Gate: The godwalker acts as the destination node of a teleportation gateway. After 24 hours of ritual purification that must be free of all blasphemous behaviour, with a day’s commitment of divine effort a godwalker can let in up to a hundred infantrymen’s worth of mass at a time to a designation location.
- Devourer of Armies: Torrents of lethal sacred energy blast from the godwalker, scorching entire battalions to death.
- Banner of Zeal: The godwalker ignites an invincible defence against any mental effect that would stop the pilot from attacking enemies, and bolsters the valor of nearby allies
- Force Projection Jewel: The godwalker strikes down targets with pinpoint precision, up to a mile
- Halo of Wrath: The godwalker sears nearby enemies with a penumbra of coruscating divine energies.
- Advance of the Iron Tide: So long as the godwalker moves in a straight line, they have an invincible defence against all hostile effects and can phase harmlessly through solid barriers. This invincibility can be maintained as long as it does nothing but keep moving forward until, presumably, it’s enemies are destroyed.
- Clavis of Night: After ten minutes to “load”, the godwalker punches a hole into Uncreated Night. It is advisable to first scout out the theurgic coordinates of your desired destination through which you can use the godwalker to arrive at over a week’s journey in exchange for bypassing the usual obstacles, lest you risk eternally wandering within the void.
- Kinetic Sump Vortex: The godwalker halves the movement rate and dampens the initiative of all nearby foes, though powerful ones may be able to resist it for a short while.
- Noble Path Generator: The godwalker generates solid footing regardless of the substance or lack thereof beneath it. Oceans and empty pits alike are no obstacle to its passage.
- Pious Construction Array: The godwalker’s capacity for fixing or building mundane structures and goods is enhanced, permitting it to do the work of hundreds of skilled craftsmen.
- Rainbow Bridge Emitter: The godwalker uses divine effort to summon a thirty-foot wide bridge between any two points in sight within 1000 feet of each other that shares it’s durability. The bridge permits travel no matter how steep it is, and users cannot be knocked off while they are alive.
- Reactive Adaption Unit: The godwalker wields divine effort to make it immune to a specific Gift or other power for a scene.
- Stiletto Sutra Projector: The resonances of a ruinous sacred text open gaping holes of nonbeing into a living being within 2000 feet. While highly effective, it is too inefficient to wield against entire armies and is ineffective on unliving targets.
- The Awl of Shifting Space: The godwalker can teleport at a distance up to twice its normal movement rate, to anywhere it can see or has formerly occupied. This teleportation leaves behind physical bindings or restraints, but not magical ones-at least of this world.
- Transmutation Field: With time and sacred mudras, the godwalker can transform large amounts of non-magical matter into another non-magical, non precious substance of equal mass. This ability generally takes 12 hours or so of labour.
- Polymorphic Shaping Core: The godwalker can alter its shape within its general dimensions, gaining a faster travel rate by land or sea by sprouting wheels or propellers for example. It can also stretch out it’s matter to form long ranged manipulators, or form into a defensive tank-like shape. While this component is not sophisticated enough to permit flight, it can shrink the entire godwalker down into something the size of a horse.
- Volley Negation Shield: When attacked by multiple strikes in rapid succession, only the first can strike the godwalker-and even then, if a foe dedicates it’s full focus on the great machine. The others automatically miss.
- Trump of Judgement: The godwalker launches a building-flattening sonic barrage out at everything within 200 feet, crumbling any non-magical solid construction to powder and dealing severe harm to all nearby living beings.
- Wingcutter Malediction: A beam of congealed curses strikes down airborne enemies, whether they come in flocks or as individuals. For some reason this weapon cannot be evaded by mundane means, but cannot be targeted at terrestrial foes.
- Wingjet Propulsion Unit: The godwalker can fly at its normal movement rate, including the ability to hover in place if present. This ability is not powerful enough to be equipped on the larger godwalkers.

And for 400 CP your godwalker is at least as powerful as The Gatekeeper, the vehicle of an undying guardian created by a Made God who uses it to protect his trove of celestial shards. Built to repel armies led by mortal heroes or theurges, such a being’s powerful engine can have it move fast enough to strike thrice where most men can strike once and boast 8 divine components that can be of any variety. While nigh-insurmountable to the foes the Made God predicted would assail it, against multiple Godbound even such a machine would require assistance from nearby automatons to hold its own. And of course, you may repurchase this item if you wish to own multiple godwalkers. A few special considerations should be noted here. Damage inflicted on a godwalker inflicts a kind of backlash onto its pilot. Godwalkers were also never intended to be piloted by divine beings such as Godbound and while piloting one they find themselves unable to use divine powers from this world which require a conscious divine effort (though constant effects remain active, and affect the godwalker as well.

Last but not least, while normally godwalkers require a sophisticated theotechnical facility and a team of extremely well-trained engineers or a Godbound with the word Artifice to be properly maintained, through your investment here some mysterious benefactor has installed a Godwalker Repair Bay on any you buy here, fully functional without impacting other systems in defiance of conventional construction procedures. This set of tools permits the godwalker to perform a daily maintenance cycle on itself or another godwalker over the course of 6 hours of downtime-and in a pinch fully overhaul another godwalker or itself in a week, with no additional personnel or resources.

566,,400,Man of Steel ,Godbound,Magitek,"There are only two major powers in Arcem that can offer cybernetic augmentations to the rich and influential. One is the Bright Republic, whose miniaturised cybernetic marvels cost greatly to “harden” enough to function away from the island’s etheric power nodes. The other is Vissio, through its clockwork maestros capable of producing often beautiful and baroque prosthetics that work as well as the Bright Republic’s implants without needing a power source. And if you hail from neither country, you yourself are the third. You’re an extremely skilled artificer, capable of devising cybernetics or mechanical prosthetics of such high calibre they can match a lesser gift’s effects for short periods, under specific circumstances or at a substantial cost to the user’s vitality or Effort to overcharge them.

What you do blurs the line between magic and hard science. It’s within your talent to recreate the Iron Tzar’s Autocossacks: Wherein a man’s lower body is removed and replaced with a four-legged mechanical platform that moves faster than any mortal horse and can take on entire bands of mortal men. But your talents also lend themselves to more ethereal ends, like implanting an eidolon that can keep a man on the brink of death’s body functional for a few minutes-long enough potentially to bring him back through first aid, a killing glare that can leave foes as dried corpses or even short ranged telekinetic force capable of forming shields and manipulating objects as if by hand. Among mortal men, your designs already push the boundary of what’s possible for the current line of cybernetics and with a bit of work you could easily improve on existing designs or innovate new ones.

If you also have an existing occupation as an artificer or somesuch as a Man of the Trades, your skill has advanced to the point where you’re one of the rare few capable of performing the arduous, exhausting maintenance needed to keep a godwalker in shape. While this alone does not grant the sorcerous arts incorporated into the godwalkers’ functionality, your mechanical expertise and theoretical knowledge of the armaments, engines and other components that make up these divine sympathy-empowered giant robots is second to none. With any degree of Eldritch Sorcerer in your grasp as well as the relevant Man of the Trades vocation and this perk, your insights glean even deeper secrets. It would be within your skill to modify a godwalker to harmonise with a Godbound or other divine being, lessening the strain of interface and permitting them to channel their divine powers through those machines of war. Even more tantalisingly is your deepest secret: Some knowledge on how to create a Made God. Whether through divine artifacts, reifying a symbol into a physical entity or augmentation of a living being the resource costs are likely phenomenal-but the results potentially world-changing."
567,,400,Magical Utilities Directed By Leaning On Ordinary Devices,Wizarding World,Magitek,"Or M.U.D.B.L.O.O.D. for short. Say what you will about Muggles, but they have thrived despite their lack of magic. Or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that they thrived because of it. But that begs the question? Why not use both?

Making Muggle devices work within magic-rich environments such as Hogwarts and the like will be child’s play for you. With just a little bit of practice, you could make it so that your own gadgets and machinery can run on magic. And you can even do the same in reverse, using technology so that your magical enchantments and potions can be made as if they were made in an automated factory. Maybe one day, you’ll eventually create your own magical nuke! Eventually. After a long, LONG time of research, experimentation... and explosions!

As a final bonus, you now find yourself with a rather nifty talent when it comes to making up acronyms and other such abbreviations. Why not look up one Hermion Granger when you arrive? It seems like you’ll have a few things in common."
568,,400,Magineering,Gummi Bears,Magitek,"Are you building large scale projects? Well now it's trivially easy for you to integrate construction, engineering and magic together in a seamless whole. Build things like floating cities or cities with integrated magic shields, perhaps a holy enchantment on an entire city. Well whatever you're building you know how to make it better with magic and how to make it last for centuries."

570,,400,Little Ben ,Marry Poppins Returns,Magitek,"Kitschy? Yes. Useless? Far from it. After all, this wind-up statuette of Big Ben does more than just make funny noises - it can turn back the clock. No, it does rewind time, so don’t get so excited. It can, however, interfere with the operation of any clock in a 5m radius around it, allowing it to stop, rewind, or fast-forward the operation of any timekeeping devices around it. This ability is capable of affecting anything that might remotely resemble a clock, no matter how eldritch or advanced it might be. Its ability, which is triggered by winding-up the statuette, lasts for exactly five minutes, and can be used to selectively target any timepiece in its area of effect. Word to the wise - you can only use it once per day, so it’s probably best if you save it for emergencies."
571,,400,Martag ,Atlantis - The Lost Empire,Magitek,"If the two vehicles above are like motorcycles or cars to the Atlanteans, then the Martag is possibly the equivalent of a tank- a bulky, piranha shaped vehicle that soars through the air, and is capable of firing destructive blasts of energy akin to the Leviathan on a smaller scale- which is still enough to vaporize human bodies and destroy flying planes in a single shot, while being much faster than the ones available to the rest of the early 20th century world."
572,,400,Genius Inventor ,Black Clover,Magitek,"Sally of the Midnight Sun is many things, insane, partially psychotic and most of all a genius inventor capable of creating wonders such as magic tools that could increase a mages powers a hundred-fold, creating perfect artificial bodies for disembodied souls that were identical to how they were in their first life, merging 2 bodies with opposite attributes into stable whole, the list goes on. Now you too possess this monstrous penchant for inventing that Sally seems to possess, able to create wonders of both magic and science, with only a little time the sky's the limit."
573,,400,Kadingir ,Symphogear,Magitek,"A gigantic particle ion cannon designed to destroy the moon, hidden underground. This version unfortunately lacks a power source, but it still contains Section Two’s underground facilities. You may optionally further combine this with another property so there’s something visible on the surface."
574,,400,Sakurai Theories ,Symphogear,Magitek,"You have intimate knowledge of Relics and Symphogears, able to maintain Relics and even construct Symphogears. However, you can now use Phonic Gain to fuel and enhance things other than heretical technology, both indirectly and innately. With knowledge of otherworldly magic, you might create a Symphogear that amplifies it. This ability works best with fragments of power. If you absorbed a piece of a great power, your song would let it rival the complete, original ability. Wherever, whenever you end up, keep believing in the song of your heart."
575,,400,Fundamental Principles,Symphogear,Magitek,"The manufacturing of Symphogears is now a lost art, but Elfnein sure makes a lot of repairs and adjustments just with just her alchemy skills. You can now perform similar adjustments to any technology, and even repair them from a non-functional state so long as it’s not missing too many pieces. This is more for things like repairing the Airgetlam Symphogear. Recreating a Complete Relic from a shard would require equivalently grand materials."
576,,400,Magitech Armor ,Marvel Magic,Magitek,"What kind of fool would walk into danger without proper protection? Certainly not you. This is a suit of armor that bears a resemblance to that worn by a certain Latvian dictator, having a rather crude appearance. It is nonetheless a highly advanced union of magic and technology. Powered by a miniature fusion reactor in addition to being able to draw on magical energy for power, this armor is equipped with a number of tools and weapons including standard energy blasts, flight, personal shields, and a teleportation system. The armor also serves to increase the strength and durability of the wearer, allowing them to throw cars and shrug off even large-sized explosives. But perhaps the most interesting feature is in its ability to record spells cast near the wearer, allowing them to replicate the features and incantations to cast the spells immediately – though likely with less effectiveness than someone trained in their use.

If you wish then you may import a suit of armor you possess, be it traditional or power armor, to gain these qualities."
577,,400,Mechamage’s Armor        ,Avengers-Thunderbolts,Magitek,"This suit of powered armor doesn’t provide superhuman strength, though it will provide roughly peak human strength, and isn’t going to make you tougher than a tank. What it does have is sorcerous circuitry which makes it an excellent conduit for spells capable of acting as a magical focus similar to a wand, sensors for identifying magical energies and spells, and an onboard dumb AI which assists you in combat. This AI serves multiple functions. It has threat assessment programming, able to be programmed to recognize certain threats, including accessing the sensors for magical energies to identify spells and suggest proper countermeasures. It is capable of going a step further, and automatically casting magical spells, using your magical energy. It is probably best for you to have it stick to simpler spells, as it is still ultimately a dumb AI and anything that requires focus or active control would be beyond its ability to perform."
578,,400,Sword of Might ,Avengers-Thunderbolts,Magitek,"Perhaps Brian Braddock and his Meggan gave you a choice, perhaps you got it from Roma or even Merlyn, though when they ran things choosing the sword was an instant failure, maybe you’re not related to Avalon in any way. However it happened, you possess a copy of the Sword of Might.

This sword is magically indestructible, and magically sharp. It is able to cut through up to a foot of steel with ease, at least with the strength the accompanying costume grants you. The sword allows you to summon the costume of the Captain Britain Corps (and you may import another costume into this one). This magitech suit uses mystical circuitry to channel magical energy. This magical energy reinforces your body, granting you super strength on the level of Warbird, the ability to fly, and the ability to project this magical energy as offensive blasts or a fairly powerful force field. Just remember this is a normal Captain Britain suit, it won’t be matching Brian Braddock’s feats, and isn’t powered by your confidence; the need to be close to Britain is long gone, though."
579,,400,Fine line between Reality and Illusion,Marvel Cosmic,Magitek,The separation of reality from illusion is only so many words. Your scientific research has unlocked the mysteries and secrets of both. You can create technology that interfaces with both reality and illusion and can easily turn illusions into real objects and make real objects illusory. You can create fully realistic illusions that might as well be reality. You can create machines that simply wave away any mystic’s illusions no matter how skilled they might be. Reality is what you and your machines say it is. The limits to this ability is your technological prowess and understanding of a particular setting’s illusory magics/psionics/what have you. This perk gives you a very high baseline for manipulation. You also have a deep innate sense for what is reality and what is illusion and can always tell the difference.
580,,400,The Level Upper,Toaruverse,Magitek,"An audio file stored inside a portable music player when one listens to it, it can turn a level zero into a level one within a week for one hour of listening per day. The abilities the user gains tends to be the abilities that they want one way or another. Unlike the original this version of the Level Upper has no nasty-side effects and traps and the only downside is it takes time for one to increase their level once they become a level one. Once someone becomes a level one it would take ten years to reach level five with one hour of listening per day as additional hours would have no effect and you can also spread the audio file if you want. Post-jump you can use this to give a normal person with Esper ability that they want and they would only need to listen for an hour to become a level one but the time needed to reach the level five is still the same."
581,,400,Umbran Armor,Bayonetta,Magitek,"Why is there a mech here? What is it even here for? Oh forget it, it's awesome. It's armed with Miniguns on the arms, shotguns on the legs, capable of channeling your magic and it's piloted like a motorcycle. To make things even better you can channel your magic through it, turning the mech into a veritable force of destruction... though if you want, you can have its aesthetics changed to a Lumen Sage variant! Go nuts with it."
582,,400,Hextech Gunblade ,League of Legends ,Magitek,"This hextech revolver is affixed with a large blade on the barrel, and holds a powerful electric enchantment. When the trigger is pulled, instead of firing a bullet the Gunblade fires bolts of lightning, damaging foes and slowing them. In addition, the Hextech gunblade will heal the user for 15% of all the damage they deal, whether magical or physical."
583,,400,Hextechnician,Arcane,Magitek,"Hextech is a bold new field of scientific endeavour, utilising power drawn from magical gemstones to put magic - once the domain only of those born to the power, or having somehow earned it - in the hands of the common man. At least, the common man wealthy enough to pay for it. Its potential is nearly-limitless, from delivering powerful strikes with Atlas Gauntlets to cutting through stone with beams of light to even warping space and time to propel airships far across Runeterra.

You have been extensively-trained in hextech engineering, and are capable both of building all common hextech devices in Piltover-Zaun, and of innovating upon them based on your knowledge of hextech and its principles. True, radical innovations like the Hexcore are somewhat beyond you, but you could approach such creations with a long-enough development scale and enough staff to help you - and ‘conventional’ hextech is nothing to sneeze at.

Moreover, you know how to use existing hex-crystals to produce new ones, albeit not as potent as the original, natural hex-crystals. Thus, you need not worry about your creations running out of power in new worlds."

You’re able to jury-rig and fix magitech as advanced as the airships of Thalassocracy, though not quite proficient enough to develop entirely new ones or build them from scratch. Perhaps as you grow, you may learn to even match the Serannians in their expertise…enough to develop an intelligent self-sufficient race such as the Machina."
586,,400,Adjustable Biology,Super Dragon Sword,Magitek,"It seems you’ve gone just beyond being odd in biology, you’ve started to mess with it outright! You have the capability of creating and using technology capable of shifting someone’s biology, changing their sex and general build as well as being capable of granting them the effect of “Stranger in a Strange Land.” If they already were manipulated this way, any new manipulations override their previous ones."
587,,400,That’s Just Asking For Trouble,Ben 10,Magitek,"When you make advanced technology far beyond what the locals are used to, it tends to make waves. Maybe your little DNA database is actually one of the greatest weapons ever created or an attempt to prove you can harness the fundamental forces of the universe ends up destroying a planet. The good news is you’re not stupid – it’s the Genius tree, not the Drooling Idiot tree! You have excellent insight into the moral implications and long-term effects of your inventions if they were used by others or made commonly available, especially when it would be a purely bad idea. Also, just to make sure nobody steals or misuses it, any sort of failsafe you make to keep it from being abused is unable to be hacked or bypassed...if you made a device that works only for a certain person, no amount of hacking or DNA swapping will make someone else pass off as that person. If you need two keys to unlock a certain feature, you bet only those two keys will work. This goes both ways – all your devices will come with a backdoor for you to take back control if someone does misuse it, and it will always succeed. Enjoy the look on the face of a wannabe thief when the superweapon they stole from you just shuts down in their hand."

But you have covered yourself in it, dived deep into the black oil to uncover its secrets, and it has made you stronger, whispered into your mind it's undeniable truths. You have gained insight into the functions of the Black Oil, becoming able to create it even without materials by secreting it from your body, and are immune to negative side effects from it- being covered in it making you remarkably stronger. You even have gained a more... “heretical” ability, being able to change the oil so it doesn't corrupt those it touches. Perhaps, with some research and time, you could make it corrupt towards something other than Phyrexia’s goals..."

Metal arms and legs, to replace ones lost to accident or battle, are but the tip of this iceberg. Entirely mechanical suits of armor, known as mechs, mecha, or mechsuits depending on who you ask, are their newest addition to the art of war. To that end, I would offer you one of these - perhaps you seek a High-Speed Hoverbike that would make most Reckoner gangs blush in envy, or the Mobilizer Mech that the Futurists use to control several suits at once. Of course, something more impressive could also be what you seek?

For 400 cp, you may take something worth six mana or more, a category that consists solely of the Thundersteel Colossus and the completed Mechtitan. Both are mildly impractical to actually get onto the battlefield, but no one can understate the sheer power they represent."
590,,400,Fog Of Despair,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Magitek,"The Myojin of Night’s Reach is as famous as she is feared, as powerful as she is hated. It was her blessing that allowed Toshiro Umezawa, the hero of the Kami War, to emerge triumphant and it was her wrath at misusing those blessings that haunted him for the rest of his days. What you have here is one of Kamigawa’s first biological weapons, an airborne curse designed to mimic her powers. Held inside a series of metal canisters that are also time bombs, the mists it spews out are extremely damaging - not only are they slightly acidic in nature to the point where it can chew through entire people in but a moment if they’re fool enough to be caught inside it, but it also actively degrades any magical effects within it’s range. Like the ones a Samurai would use to empower themselves, for example. I suggest being far, far away from it when it’s set to release, as the black fog cannot be controlled or countered bar sufficient dispersion. Anyone who can’t run away will know suffering. "
591,,400,Compleat Mastery Of Machines,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Magitek,"If there is one flaw in the Futurists' constant rush for bigger, better, and more advanced technologies that have yet to be discovered, it is that they don’t take the time needed to truly understand those things, to eke out every last drop of inspiration or perfection from them. And you? You have done just that. You rapidly adjust to new forms of technology, learning their ins and outs in days where others would need weeks, making minor modifications to them that allows you to pull 110% out of them. Older, more reliable technology is even better, with you quickly becoming able to rebuild it from the ground up to run at 200% after taking it apart a few times. Worst of all, at least for your foes, is that this understanding allows you to interface with technological artifacts from range, inserting a virus into a Samurai’s mech suit mid fight, or turning a Ninja’s fancy gadgets into glorified paperweights when they suddenly become glitchy. With enough knowledge, perhaps a device you created personally and know the precise measurements of every last bolt and soder? You could take complete control of it. "

In fact, they have their own special brand of technology that not even the Saiba have been able to replicate - one wonders how they could have made it, but that’s a lesson for another day. You have been entrusted with the knowledge of how to make disruptors, small devices that emit a field of pure nope that shuts down almost all technology with their range, and more than a small amount of magic as well. The range on these devices is not terribly large, but thankfully they aren’t terribly complicated to make for someone affiliated with the many many Kami that reside within the forests of Jukai. That may be why the Futurists have yet to replicate them, they insist on looking upwards when the answer lies behind them. You could, if you wished, mass produce enough of these devices to shut down all technology within a city block inside a day or two… And to explode normally as well. If you wanted. "
593,,400,Ark of the Stars,Fate/Extella,Magitek,"One of the ships used by the Anti-Cells sent out by Velber or at least a fragment of such. Six hundred meters wide and shaped like an almond, the cockpit is a dimensional pocket within the structure that automatically draws you in if you are nearby and wish to enter. It’s a fairly small space inside, enough for a group of humans to fit comfortably, but the ship automatically regulates the conditions inside and has no need for controls or seats. Instead, it operates according to your thoughts, able to rapidly travel extremely long distances, even between stars in short time periods. The Ark contains a useful treasure however, a disconnected piece of Velber’s code and power. Acknowledging you as the new controller, it is an extremely potent virus that can rapidly infect even large sections of the Moon Cell. Your fragment won’t be able to take over the entire virtual world but it is enough to forcibly brainwash most virtual beings you encounter, one on one. You’re even able to remove it if you need to insert the Velber corruption into a different target.

If you have bought the Zero Dark Sleeping Room as well, you can replace the cockpit of the Ark with that cavern. "

represents.

Depending on your desired theme, the armor will differ quite extensively. A believer in steam power
technology could receive a hulking tank of a machine, powered by gouts of boiling steam. The armor
could easily destroy even modern day armored vehicles and gives the user enough raw physical
power to smash a battleship into pieces in short order. The steam could be used for short ranged
attacks of boiling heat or overload the armor to gain enormously increased speed and striking power. Miscellaneous gadgets and devices linked to steam power may also be present, such as high speed
wheels on the armor’s boots that emulate a steam train. Alternatively, one might look into electricity
or firearms or evolution as a variety of sciences that the reality marble can be set to manifest, resulting in different forms, weaponry and abilities for the armor. 

Whatever the choice, the armor is able to produce smaller and weaker versions of itself over time, each powered by a rudimentary artificial intelligence that can take simple orders from you. Guarding
locations from all but specific intruders, attacking enemies, manual labor and so on. No import. "

596,,400,Implanted Relic ,Senki Zesshou Symphogear,Magitek,"Somehow, perhaps through an accident, a relic has become embedded in a part of your body. While this doesn't prevent you from using other relics you will find that your synchronization coefficient with that Relic has increased tenfold, making the blowback from Swan Songs and other exhaustive features far less severe, with Swan Songs only tiring you immensely. This Relic seems to be reacting differently than seen with Human-Relic Fusion Specimen no. 1, Hibiki Tachibana and Gungnir. It seems to be merging with your body far better than Gungnir ever did, not threatening your life and eventually resolving into something similar to what was achieved by Finé herself with the Nehushtan Armor. The Relic that has been implanted is one of the ones associated with your Origin, but once again you may pay 100cp to change it to a different one.

Argo, the ship that Jason and the Argonauts sailed on. The user is draped in sails, allowing them to drift effortlessly in the air. It can summon forth pieces of the original ship, casting great rods and nets of rigging at it's targets. Argo is mostly defense focused, being able to summon hulls as defensive shields and laying traps of rigging and rope. Further experience with Argo's creation allows the creation of small boats and jet skis.

The Argo does not possess an Armed Gear that can be wielded like a weapon in the normal sense, excepting the components of the ship, but it is capable of creating Argonauts; small spherical drones with an attached beam of energy. These drone are relatively fragile, but can overwhelm targets with sheer numbers. Specialized drones can be created with greater experience with the Gear.

Argo's Swan Song revives the original Argo, a flying heretical ship controlled by the will of the user. The Argo appears to turn and accelerate with no regards to propulsion or cornering, and can release swarms of the Argonauts. In addition to the swarms of loyal drones and it's extreme speed, the Argo's very presence creates a great typhoon that it and it's wielder are completely unaffected by.

Prometheus, the first flame. By calling forth embers of the original flame, a raging dimensional inferno can be started, burning both human and Noise alike. The flames spread and intensity can be limited by the wielder, and can be extinguished with a single thought, but left unchecked they burn incredibly violently. The wielder is protected from this raging heat by their Symphogear, and other Gears should have little trouble with the heat unless it is actively brought against them.

The chains wrapped around the wielders arms can be used like whips at their most basic level, heating to strike at foes, but Prometheus' true Armed Gear is the projection of these chains into disposable axes of all kinds, with its truest form being that of an ashen chainsaw. These weapons bear superheated blades and chains, being able to burn through even the toughest Noise's defenses if they can get in range.

Prometheus' Swan Song calls forth the full might of the stolen flame, engulfing all within a massive radius in an inferno that sears the flesh of enemies from bone while rejuvenating allies, bringing them back from the brink of death. Be warned however, fire is indiscriminate, and any targets that fail to be designated as allies will suffer the same fate as enemies.

Kibisis, the sack that contained the Medusa’s severed head. The concept of ‘sack’ is a slight misnomer, however. The user is given an elaborate combination of robes, cloak and hood that would be quite modest if the bodysuit wasn’t so skimpy. While unassuming, the fabric that makes up Kibisis is actually a portal to an enormous self-contained pocket dimension, with the user able to manipulate the fabric to make openings into and out of it.

This is as versatile and deadly as it sounds, as Kibisis is able to not only store objects, but also use the fabric to effectively ‘flash step’ by traveling along a thin corridor of silk, or create a razor thin portal along it’s edge to slice objects in half. Kibisis’ Swan Song generates a massive dimensional disturbance, manipulating space-time to instantly stretch and destroy huge areas, while also disrupting similar dimensional shenanigans.

Kaladanda, staff of the god of death. As intimidating as it sounds, Kaladanda’s Armed Gear is actually a metal pipe. In fact, Kaladanda may as well be the tool of a plumber, as it may plant and grow all manner of water works and plumbing from itself, naturally lending itself towards creating steam-powered mechanisms, such as gigantic steam hammers and saws. What makes these pipes unique, however, is the crimson water that flows freely from them, which carries a unique anti-life property that causes it to shred through all physical and philosophical protections, completing erasing it’s target from reality in a manner reminiscent of a certain mirror.

Kaladanda’s Swan Song calls forth the source of it’s deathly water – a colossal steam boiler which flashes a massive amount of it’s deadly contents into supercritical steam, which it forces into a tight, high-power beam to bore through even the toughest defenses. Be careful of friendly fire, although an attentive user can selectively halt the eroding effects of the steam on allies.

Thunderbird, caller of storms. The wielder appears to be cloaked in a stormy haze, obscuring them from view unless they choose to disperse it. Thunderbird is capable of recalling the original bird's talons, incredible sight and agility to the user.

Thunderbird's true power lies in its ability to generate 'feathers', razor-sharp shards that extend in whip-like wings from the wielder's body. They can generate electrical charge and control their own magnetism, allowing the wielder to levitate through repulsion and discharge anti-Noise lightning strikes with some buildup. It is also possible to use the wings as a conduit for a magnetic cannon.

Thunderbird's Swan Song causes the feathers to disperse, floating freely around the wielder as the haze expands into a storm cloud, from which the wielder can direct massive lightning strikes. Anything coming into the storm cloud will find themselves suffering from the lethal discharges within it unless the wielder directs it away from them itself.

The Holy Grail, the cup sought by King Arthur. Upon activation, one might notice that the Gear appears to be completely unarmed or protected aside from a standard (albeit slightly more armored) bodysuit provided by a Symphogear system, with the addition of what appears to be a cooking pot worn jauntily as a helmet. The Holy Grail is capable of generating cooking paraphernalia in all forms to serve in it's purpose of providing unlimited food and happiness to people. Cooking utensils that can, however, be easily used as lethal weapons. The Grail is semi-unique in that it's user can control it's implements remotely, starting with one or two implements at first, and growing to a few dozen with time.

The Holy Grail's Swan Song summons a massive stadium around the wielder, enclosing all in a several hundred meter radius inside a massive oven that heats to extremely high temperatures. Within, the wielder can control as many objects as they can manage, regardless of whether they came from her own Gear. The biggest risk comes from the massive size of the oven, carrying the risk of capturing innocent bystanders in the radius.

Enkidu, clay servitor. Instead of any sort of Armed Gear, Enkidu’s wielder is accompanied by a large, formless mass of technological ‘clay’ that emanates from fissures in the bodysuit armor. While limited in amount, the clay can be manipulated to take on different shapes and properties- provided it doesn’t stray too far from it’s wielder. One moment, it can be a rigid shield, then transform itself into a lethal explosive. Clay may be destroyed, but more is very slowly generated within the bodysuit.

Enkidu’s Swan Song temporarily re-enables the clay’s ability to self-replicate, allowing it to consume vast amounts of material to create a huge swarm of clay. For the duration of the Swan Song, the clay may be used as normal, explosively detonating or collapsing into dust once it ends.

Moly, the miracle herb grown from the blood of a giant. Mossy plants overtake the wearer’s hair, sprouting flowers and other sprouts in its place and down their arms- plants that the wielder can coincidentally fire and control like fine wires. Beyond the obvious application of monofilament cutters, these plants are capable of taking root in living things and draining their life force for energy, so long as a conduit exists back to the wielder. Stranger applications, such as plant-based exoskeletons or constructs, are also entirely possible.

The Swan Song of Moly causes all plants connected to Moly to begin flowering, releasing clouds of corrosive spores which eat into enemy armor, creating chinks for more plants to grow into, allowing them to rapidly drain them of life force. Exponential plant overgrow allows the collapsing of massive structures and even more points to dig into enemies from.

The Ark of the Covenant, the chest containing the ten commandments of God. Draped in papers displaying the ten commandments of God, the Ark displays the remarkable ability to boost or dampen phonic gain. Other wielders who sing alongside the Ark notice their power being boosted, with rising sync coefficients, while enemy wielders notice their synchronization ratio's plummeting. Against the Noise, the effect that disables their Phase Contrast Barrier is broadcast in a wide radius, effectively forcing all Noise around them into reality where mundane weapons will affect them.

The Ark of the Covenant's Armed Gear is actually the papers hanging from the wielder's body. They can extend and fold themselves, taking the shape of weapons or shields, anything that is possible with folded sheets of paper. While they can swing with great force, it's important to remember that it's still essentially paper, albeit far more durable than normal, but still paper. The strength, durability and length the paper can extend to increases with experience.

As another Relic made in the image of God, the Ark's Swan Song is capable of exerting similar forces to the Ruin's of Balal. By spreading the pages out like a dish, and holding themselves in a cross position, the wielder can rip away massive amounts of Phonic Gain from other wielders or people, gathering it to themselves and redistributing it to others. Unlike other Swan Songs, this has no practical combat capability on it's own, as it effectively immobilizes the wielder while it is in use and requires another wielder to direct Phonic Gain to. However, if the wielder can gather enough Phonic Gain, they may be able to activate X-Drive once the Swan Song ends...

The Left Hand of Christ, no, not a euphemism. His actual hand. The wearer is bestowed a much more heavily armored suit than most Symphogears, complete with a helmet and rectangular shield. Unlike most Symphogears, the Hand's Armed Gear cannot be duplicated endlessly, with only one or two available at anygiven moment, the tradeoff being that Hand's lance is extraordinarily powerful, doubling as a high energy laser cannon. The Hand’s shield can expand and reshape as needed, additionally being able to project an energy shield capable of protecting against Noise. The size and shape the energy shield can take begins as a simple single direction square barrier, but can be manipulated more with practice.

The Hand's Swan Song channels and amplifies the destructive power of the spear's laser cannon, sending a massive cross-shaped beam of energy in the direction of every thrust for the duration of the Swan Song. Striking the ground with the spear will produce a similar cross-shaped blast around the wielder. In addition to this, while the Swan Song is active, the defenses provided by the Gear have their power drastically increased.

Gleipnir, the chain that bound the great wolf. Gleipnir’s bodysuit appears to be of a different material than standard, with a leathery appearance and fur-trimming along it’s edge, and appears bound to the wearer by chains. Lengths of chains may be unshackled to beat and ensnare enemies, draining Phonic Gain by contact and potentially immobilizing other Relic users with enough contact.

The Relic’s Swan Song reveals that it is not just Gleipnir, but also the wolf the chain bound – Fenrir. All of the Gear’s chains fall away, and the wielder is surrounded by a recreation of the original wolf. While larger than the wielder and strong, this is not the full extent of the Swan Song. Fenrir reverses the direction of control, being able to take it’s chain and leash another Relic for temporary control over it, against any relevant user’s will for the duration of the Swan Song. If the chain is not used in this way, taking the form of Fenrir bears very little cost to the user, despite being a Swan Song.

The Axe of Perun, weapon of the lightning god. Perun’s bodysuit is studded with numerous contacts and power lines, which can be used to generate extreme voltages, short lightning strikes and manipulate circuitry in the manner one might expect. Instead of simply being able to generate voltage though, Perun is able to condense large amounts of its power into a physical form- that or axes, polearms and other axe-headed instruments, in addition to the lightning ‘arrows’ one might expect. The downside to this is that Perun requires far more energy per weapon created, making it’s use substantially heavier and deliberate versus the frenzy of other Gears.

Perun’s Swan Song calls all available energy in the surrounding atmosphere to the user, often causing the formation of a massive storm cell around it from the massive drop in pressure. The wielder is then able to create a massive axe, formed by both the storm and their own charge, which fully discharges into the location they strike as a titanic lightning strike.

Draupnir, the ring of Odin. It uses its ability of self multiplication to create disk shaped drones that are equipped with sensors and projectors capable of producing energy blasts or holograms. A largely utility focused Relic, Draupnir's defense is somewhat poor and mostly consists of using the drones to intercept attacks or form force fields. Further sync and experience with Daupnir allows the creation of specialized drones and use of formations or combinations of the drones to perform various other tasks of means of attack.

Draupnir's Swan Song causes the drones to multiply exponentially before surrounding the target in a dome and discharging all their energy in a single attack focused on the center of the dome. Draupnir's Swan Song is especially risky as it removes all drones from defense for a single Swan strike and the Symphogear takes a bit to reactivate the discharged drones, should the wielder survive.

Brahmastra, the bow of Brahma. Unlike its counterpart Ichival, Brahmastra's attacks are slower, more accurate and far more powerful, with it's Armed Gear taking the form of a heavy bow by default, although it can also take the form of a battle rifle or revolver. Built into Brahmastra's headset is a visor that provides targeting data and alternate vision modes to the wielder. While the weapons can be fired as fast as the wielder can manage or pull the trigger, the power of these attacks make friendly fire a serious concern.

The Swan Song of Brahmastra brings forth the full might of a weapon said to never miss and which completely annihilates it's target without fail. Summoning it's bow form again, Brahmastra unleashes a massive lance of energy at a specific target, traveling instantly and through all structures in it's way to annihilate that single target with force similar to a nuclear weapon.

A Will-o’-the-Wisp, an otherworldly beacon. On top of a tattered hood, the wielder is given an Armed Gear that takes the form of a small, handheld lantern. Will-o’-the-Wisp’s purview is that of lighting- lanterns, braziers, lamps, floodlights and in a more combat oriented-fashion, lasers. On top of direct fighting applications, the wielder may cause lights to fizzle out and produce small ‘wisps’ of energy, which they may redirect into other lights (or even other Relics) to boost their power or use directly as energy bullets.

Primarily, Will-o’-the-Wisp focuses on producing massive banks of lamps which it harvests for wisps to use in massive lasers, all of which leads into its Swan Song. Upon activation, Will-o’-the-Wisp becomes a miniature sun, glowing with an intense light and releasing untold amounts of wisps that can turn even household light bulbs into deadly area denial weapons.

Xiuhcoatl, weapon of the sun god. The wielder of Xiuhcoatl is accompanied by their own personal Noise- that takes the shape of a burning serpent protectively surrounding them. It also bears slight resemblance to corn, for some reason. By consuming other Noise, or fragments of Relics, Xiuhcoatl grows larger and stronger, although it can shed ‘accumulated’ size for speed, and a greater size is more taxing on the user to maintain. Like other Noise, Xiuhcoatl can phase in and out of reality unless ‘tuned’ by something like a Symphogear, and also possesses the Noise ability to instantly reduce organic life to ash on contact, although it may withhold at the discretion of it’s handler.

Instead of simply swelling Xiuhcoatl to a massive size – as it already does so – the Relic’s Swan Song allows Xiuhcoatl to subdivide into two snakes of a slightly reduced size, repeating as many times as wished for either a swarm of standard sized snakes or several titanic ones. This means that Xiuhcoatl’s Swan Song is generally most effective once it has swelled to a sufficient size, providing the most metaphorical ‘material’ to create additional minions from.

The Nemean Hide, trophy of Heracles. The Nemean Hide is an unusual relic, for it grants it's user some of the properties of Noise as it's primary ability. In addition to being an exceptionally resilient Symphogear the Nemean Hide allows its user to utilize the dimensional phasing ability of Noise, moving partially out of reality in order to ignore mundane assaults in exchange for a loss of movement speed and perception. The pelt is especially fearsome in that it can ignore the assaults of Symphogear users with significantly lesser Symphonic Gain than the wielder of the Hide, while utilizing the enemy's Barrier Coating to interact with them as if the user was fully material, although significantly stronger assaults can pierce this defense.

The Nemean Hide's Armed Gear consists of bracers with five claws situated on all four extremities of the user. The claws are versatile as weapons, having the offensive properties of Noise, allowing them to expend themselves to carbonize a normal human on contact or create a fairly potent explosion, the claws replenish fairly quickly and may be fired as ranged weapons. Finally, a claw may be inserted into a Noise to temporarily usurp control of it, although the claw won't regenerate so long as the Noise remains alive and controlled. Higher sync and experience with the Nemean Hide may allow manifestation of other parts of the Lion such as the fangs or tail, or manipulation of the claws, causing them to grow or otherwise shift to the user's will.

The Swan Song of the Nemean Hide is terrific in both senses of the word. The Hide uses the excess energy generated by the song to fully reform the invincible Lion Noise it was made from around the user. The Nemean ion is nigh indestructible to most assaults barring another Swan Song or attack of similar caliber and can control large swathes of nearby Noise to do it's will. The Lion is somewhat indiscriminate in it's rampage, only partially controlled by the wearer of the Hide and the Swan Song usually only lasts about a minute at most, meaning the best way to deal with the Lion is usually to simply run until it's exhausted.

Enlil, Lord of the Wind. While ordinarily the color scheme of a Symphogear seems to depend on the user, Enlil has yellow and black warning patterns included regardless of the user, along with a mining helmet. Enlil generates mining equipment of all kinds, pickaxes, drills, shovels, even industrial mining lasers. While the intended function is obvious, they still work as anti-Noise weapons, and most tools can be fired as projectiles using rockets. The size and complexity of summoned tools increases with experience with the Gear. The mining helmet's light also functions as an X-ray device, which feeds back to a visor that drops down from the helmet.

Upon triggering it's Swan Song, Enlil explodes into a massive mining train made from a mishmash of industrial machinery and mining equipment. While plowing straight through the enemy at three hundred miles an hour is quite effective, it can also make use of it's crane arms to throw pieces of the scenery at opponents or fire the massive mining laser mounted to it's hull.

The Library of Alexandria, lost repository of knowledge. As would be expected of Pagan technology, the Library of Alexandria was never an actual library, instead taking the form of a small fragment of a once massive crystal which is... somewhat awkwardly wedged in the wielder’s chest. Kinky. The gear also seems to insist on projecting glasses as part of it’s armor, which becomes somewhat superfluous in light of it’s abilities.

Alexandria has no weapon generation capabilities. Instead, it draws machinery and electronics – anything more complicated than a light bulb, really – and weaves them into a massive amalgamation of parts and pieces from the absorbed components. Generally the exact specifications are overblown capabilities of the technology absorbed- superheated coils from a toaster, powerful hydraulics from a backhoe, but aren’t as fantastical as other Relics. The exact shape and size varies depending on the Relic’s read of the situation, but the wielder is always encased within a heavily armored shell at its core, directly fused into the controls through their Gear.
        
The Library’s Swan Song allows Alexandria to temporarily assimilate the armaments of other Relics into its mechanical titan, haphazardly crossing over discarded weapons from other Symphogears and Relics to create a temporary energy cannon.

Pandora’s Box, which unfortunately is just a box after it was opened. Thankfully, the box itself is still useful, which the wielder can attest to with their built-in bandanna with tracking code. The box can take forms from cardboard boxes to steel shipping containers to box up and ship enemies to oblivion, or box cutters, nail guns and other shipping paraphernalia. Duct tape, warehouse drones and a very large boxcutter can help make sure death is delivered to enemies, and the constructs only get worse from there.

Once the Swan Song is triggered, enemies within range are drawn backwards into a tiny box, like all the world’s evils, and then pulled into a massive shipping mechanism. Once processed, they are fired through a shipping accelerator against a hard surface, crushing the contents instantly and dealing massive damage. A minor property of Pandora’s Box is that it’s user exhibits a slight stealth effect, becoming extremely hard to notice. Moreso, if they hide within the Box.

Bajiaoshan, once thought to be a mighty wind fan. Instead, upon activation the wielder finds themselves holding a pair of handles which can sprout dozens of individual knives, holding them in the shape of fans. On the users command, the handle can explosively fire the knives at a high firing rate, essentially making them fully automatic ballistic knives.

The blades generated can be of several different types, including armor piercing, explosive and incendiary blades with any number of imaginative shapes and sizes. When the fight gets close to Bajiaoshan, the handles can project two superheated knives that are much more durable than the fragile projectiles and are fully capable of melting through most defenses.

It's Swan Song let's Bajiaoshan project a single, invisible knife that carries with it the force of a gale, and with a single thrust, can tear through a single point with incredible force, penetrating all enemies but leaving allies untouched.

Quetzalcoatl is a fragment of the feathered serpent that runs through the user’s body, causing many red-hot feathers to erupt from their bodysuit and merge into an armored coat to protect them. It also extends a superheated tail of molten metal from their spine, which can change shape and warp as they wish. Users of Quetzalcoatl should be cautious of these properties, as it, like the Nehushtan Armor, begins to merge with the user over time, although instead of growing into their wounds, Quetzalcoatl instead chooses to reside beneath the skin. A symbiotic relationship, as opposed to parasitic.

There is no true Armed Gear to Quetzalcoatl, with its user instead calling upon its tail and raw command over the power of the sun. Raw material fissures forth from within Quetzalcoatl, superheated metals and plasmatic gasses which it can launch in streams and use as whips or in other creative ways against its foes. It can also control light in a minor way, either blinding it’s enemies or concentrating it’s light against its foes like the sun against ants.

The Swan Song of Quetzalcoatl harnesses the power of nuclear fusion, generating a small sun roughly the size of one’s fist and launching it. Without the Gear to keep it under control, it quickly expands into a massive conflagration of fire, gas and light, destroying anything in its path.

Tonbokiri, the dragonfly cutter, is one of a few Gears that is capable of native flight thanks to the set of insectoid wings that sprout from the back of the wielder’s bodysuit. All kinds of spears may be created by the Relic, although unlike more typical examples of spears produced by Symphogears, Tobokiri’s are more designed for cutting than thrusting. On top of that, the bodysuit possesses an ambulatory ‘tail’ that may grasp it’s spears and act as a crude sting for the user, and can sprout additional insectoid features if they wish.

Tonbokiri belongs to the group of ‘living’ Gears that actively seek symbiosis with their wielders, regardless of implantation status, which is reflected in it’s Swan Song. The user sprouts chitinous armor, and temporarily the restored spear emerges from their sting, sharp enough that it emits heat from simple contact with the air.

Strangely enough, Tonbokiri’s style and movements seem... a bit ridiculous at times. Flash stepping, running on water and other feats that’d seem more beelievable if they were in some anime.

Gáe Bulg, Cúchulainn’s spear. While only one of the original barbs remains, it still carries the traits of the original spear, with the short, bone-like protrusions the Gear is capable of producing still coursing through the body of enemies it pierces into and tearing them apart. By snapping off a bone growth and burying it in water or the ground, a massive ‘swordfish’ drone spawns – really an extended bone outcropping held inside a ring drone, with the same properties as a normal spine. Combat relies then on a balance between falling back to spawn additional drones and taking the offensive when drones are in surplus.

The spear’s Swan Song revives the original sea monster – a massive, bone-y serpent named Coinchenn – but not as a pet to be controlled or commanded. Instead, Coinchenn allows itself to be used as a massive version of the spear it was eventually made into, flying with unnatural speed and precision for something so large, with the curse spreading through everything present at the location it strikes.

This also affects the following 600cp perks as follows:

The Power of Holding Hands – Now it becomes possible for you to take upon the backlash effects from multiple people, but on top of that, the backlash is reduced even further based upon the strength of your personal relationship with them, granting no benefit for random bystanders, but reducing a potentially lethal backlash to a minor tickle with true friendship, and all but negating the strain with a bond of love.

Superb Song – You know, just having people who believe in you can give you enough faith to survive the challenges thrown at you. Personal connections you have with other people now feed you a tiny bit of Phonic Gain based on the level of that friendship, providing a slight power boost.

Pagan Science – Looking through some of the notes made by Finé's reincarnation, you manage to glean the mechanism behind the energy-mass converter used to create the armor of a Symphogear. While you would still need a Relic to make a proper Symphogear, you can use this to store armor and weapons in the form of a small necklace, simply requiring that the user be able to sing the activation song to use.

Legends Reborn – Across time and space, some legends hold true in the hearts and minds of people, much like how Gungnir retained it’s properties as Longinus, despite becoming Gungnir later in life. When you have the original, real thing – an artifact with a strong legend known across entire populations for many decades – you may extract it’s legend and turn the artifact into a philosophical weapon, giving it properties from it’s associated legends, such as anti-god properties for a weapon used to slay a god in legend.

You will need actual technical skills to pull this off, but with a little bit of time, perhaps you can restore what is lost? Post-jump, this same insight applies to ‘lost’ or ‘forgotten’ technology, though you will likely need other sources of knowledge and abilities to truly restore it, depending on its complexity.

May or may not come with brief instances of acting and speaking like a resident of the Belkan Empire at random intervals.

605,,400,Dimensional Warship ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"Ohohoho, what do we have here? It’s a fully functional warship fresh from the docks of the Bureau, and its ready for its maiden voyage. It can be any model of TSAB ship that isn’t a MacGuffin or an experimental prototype, and has the ability to cross dimensions on its own, along with basic FTL travel. The downsides being that you can only cross dimensions in this particular world, or what passes for a ‘local multiverse’ in future jumps - which it may not always be able to do if one doesn’t exist. Post-Spark, this ship can visit past jumps and entirely new worlds as well. This requires a crew to fly - you’ll have to gather one or find a way to fly it on your own. I recommend picking a smaller vessel class if this is a problem.
"
606,,400,LiNKER Synthesis ,Senki Zesshou Symphogear,Magitek,"You know the formula for the LiNKER drug, both Anti and Normal varieties. The drug allows someone with little or no compatibility with Relics to force their link coefficient high enough to activate a Symphogear. However, the drug is toxic to the human body, and is only viable for use by a flushing mechanism developed by American biochemist John Ver. Maybe if you have enough time and funding, you'd be able to mitigate the side effects and develop a non-toxic alternative...
"
607,,400,Very Advanced Science ,Senki Zesshou Symphogear,Magitek,"When it comes to ‘re-engineering’ heretical technology, the Americans have mastered doing it in ways that leave others astounded. Recycling Relics into other forms of technology is nothing new. In fact, it’s the same technique that is used to create Symphogears, but this is on a completely different level. You can alter Relics so that they have completely different functions than what was intended, such as turning an aggressive heretical weapon into a berserker module, or a reflector into a giant laser beam."
608,,400,Backyard Nuclear Fusion ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Magitek,"Gensokyo is home to many things that have since died in the Outside World, including scientific theories. You can take advantage of this to treat any discredited scientific theory as true, but only for producing technology of your own. For instance, should you wish to revive a dead and disproved theory to create a nuclear fusion reactor, you will somehow manage to get it working even when it goes against established modern-day science.
"
609,,400,DOOOOOOOOMWHEEEEEEEEEEEL ,Warhammer Fantasy: Skaven,Magitek,"Skryre has made many deranged, demented, horrific machines of war and destruction; One would say their minds are wired specifically for such chaos. No machine so accurately displays this madness than the dreaded DOOMWHEEL, for it is at once so simple of a design yet so deceptively complex that only the skaven could have devised it. And now the brain-spawn of Ikit Claw is rapidly becoming a tide-turner in the war against the surface-world.

You’ve gained the ownership of one of these dreaded DOOMWHEELS, specially made for your seating. The massive, iron-enforced wheel is powered by two things: Along its inside, on a specially-made track, runs a swarm of drugged-up rats driven mad by the arcing warp-lightning and constant noise. At the center of the massive chassis, where the pilot’s seat is, is a warpstone generator that ensures the machine both keeps a steady pace (enough to run over and smash even armored dwarves and humans) and occasionally fires off the warp-lightning cannon that is attached to the front of the steel rims. Very few creatures are capable of stopping the DOOMWHEEL in its tracks, and for you there will likely be none: As its pilot, your magic also serves to charge the warpstone engine and warp-lightning cannon, allowing it to reach speeds only dreamed of by skaven brains and letting the warp-lightning cannon fire off the spells you cast as warp-lightning tainted explosions.
"
610,,400,Warp Booster ,Warhammer Fantasy: Skaven,Magitek,"Any Warlock-Engineer or Master is always searching for more power, be it of personal might or political prowess. But magical power is a type that all creatures respect, and so the engineers of Skavenblight have created a quick way to swiftly increase one’s magi-technological might. Warpstone-bronze pylons, installed along the spinal column, shoulders, and skull, that constantly tap into the power of Chaos and the Horned Rat’s realm of ruin. Any spell or ritual cast by a warlock with these pylons grafted into his flesh and bone sees significant enhancement, turning a simple bolt of warp-lightning into a cascading storm with the snap of clawed fingers.
"
611,,400,Technomancy ​,Mage: The Awakening(1st Edition),Magitek,"Fusing technology with magic is not a new practice, especially since technology has existed since man first made fire, or tied a stone to a stick and called it a spear. While there are many other mages who purport to merge technology and magic, you do so with such seamless efficiency that it is nearly impossible to tell where technology ends and magic begins. You could tie the triggering of a spell to a computer program, having it take effect when someone tries to open it. Or perhaps you could use your magic to improve the quality of machines, increasing their speed, effectiveness and overall power. Perhaps you could even write out a grimoire, a repository of magical knowledge into a simple graphing calculator. Whatever you do, it will likely be creative and never seen before as the disparate disciplines are masterfully merged under your guidance.
"
612,,400,It Is Written ,Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,Magitek,"The use of mystical runes for enchanted effects is well known by those with a passing interest in the magical arts, but...the Sheikah were unique. They were able to create a “language” from runes, that had conditional statements and effects. In short - the Sheikah could program with runes, thus allowing for “programs” to become “spells.” You have knowledge of this art as well - You are able to use Runes to code “programs” such as those used by the Sheikah Slate to perform its functions. This combined with “Sparking Innovation” would give you the groundwork to create your own variant of the Sheikah Slate with your own round of Runes...though magic doesn’t make something simple - you’ll need to create the code for these Slates yourself.
"
613,,400,Servant of the Spirits of Good ,Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks,Magitek,"I’m not actually 100% sure what the Lokomo are, but they seem to be either directly created by, or perhaps simply empowered by, the Spirits of Good. Not sure what those are either. Anyways, the primary difference between the Lokomo and the Sheikah seems to be that the Lokomo lean even more towards spirituality. Which is why you have the ability to empower and re-energize ancient artifacts and weapons simply by being around them. This isn’t a free effect, but the various issues and reasons why you shouldn’t be able to do so just don’t seem to apply. As long as you have energy to spare, you can fix them."
614,,400,Ancient Oocca Technology ,Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess,Magitek,"The ancient Oocca built many strange technologies, leaving them around Hyrule before they absconded to their new home in the sky. Somehow- either by learning from the artifacts they left behind, or perhaps by learning from one of their inventors yourself- you have learned a great deal about magic and technology, like the greatest of them, allowing you to make similar wonders. The clawshots and Dominion Rod are just two examples of what you can make; with enough resources, you could make something like the Sky Cannon, or even your own City in the Sky!"
615,,400,Dimensional Device ,Undertale,Magitek,"As useful as it is to upgrade technology, sometimes versatility in a gadget is what you need. But how does one fit a jetpack, two storage boxes, a wireless hotspot, a SOUL resonator, a keychain, and a working cellphone all into one? Why, Magic, of course! You know how to make dimensional spaces that allow technology to fold in on itself at about a 3:1 cubic ratio- You could take an average-sized car and fold it into a large piece of luggage you can wheel behind you, for example. You can also make Dimensional Boxes for storage that have 5 cubic feet of storage space and fit in your pocket, though you can't put living things in there."
616,,400,Technomancy ​,World Seed,Magitek,"Often hailed as the most innovative magic, users of Technomancy are capable of creating, controlling, scanning, and even assimilating technology with magic. And now you are one of them. But not just a normal one, oh no. Your talent with Technomancy can rightfully said to be quite monstrous. Whether it is commanding machines to do your bidding with just a thought, probing devices with your magic to discover their functions and any possible flaws, or disassembling and reassembling them, you can do it all with contemptuous ease. If you trained a bit, you could of course also create your own technology to use, entirely through magic, as long as you have any necessary materials before you. Another interesting ability of Technomancy is its function to let you interface with technology and use yourself as a medium for information to be displayed. So if you, for example, wrote a program to let something pass through your Aura, such as the hologram function of your companion bracelet, you could simply use Technomancy to establish a connection with the bracelet and yourself.But your biggest talent lies in the replication of implants and other technological marvels within yourself and others. You could for example quite easily copy the aura of a camera and adapt your eye to mirror it, or do the same to the auras of memory banks and computers to enhance your brain. With your skill, you don’t even have to worry about overloading your puny biological body by using technology that is too advanced. Beyond that, what you can do is up to you. After all, the potential of magic is only limited by its users ability, creativity, and skill. Though I’m sure that with your potential, you’ll manage to go quite far in the rat race of life. Concerning technology at least, social skills are not included in this package."
617,,400,Vain Practices ,Konosuba,Magitek,"This world’s been stuck in a bit of a rut, progressing very little compared to the speed that your original home world did. It’s not for lack of intelligence in the people here, just a curious lack of motivation. One you apparently don’t share. You have an incredible ability for both reverse engineering, capable of remaking normal or magical devices as the other with an appropriate amount of work to match their power or level of advancement, and also for mass production, allowing you to get things made thrice as fast as any other, even on a large scale so long as you’ve personally created the systems with which they are made."
618,,500,The Regalia,Final Fantasy XV Royal Edition,Magitek,"King Regis's car, Quartz Regalia, this is a custom classic convertible that handles well on any terrain a car can go over, but don't expect to go as fast in sand as it does in firmer ground, it's pretty tough and can take a few hits from some Daemons, has built-in autopilot and It is very spacious and can fit 6 people comfortably. For the price of 300 CP you get this car with all the upgrades including the off-roading Type-D and the flying Type-F, you can change between the different types while in the warehouse, also improved to be able to drift without consequences in the internal structure. For a total of 400 CP, repulsors will be added to allow the vehicle to start and remain floating in the air and have more control, plus they can give an emergency boost that provides near-instant acceleration and stealth technology will be added. For 100CP more, regardless of other upgrades, you can take the “Royal Vessel”, the royal family's yacht. All options had the need for fuel eradicated, by the power of the Fiat."
619,,500,The Phoenix ,Final Fantasy XII,Magitek,"There’s a tag, but you see no item. The Shopkeeper gestures for you to follow him, and you enter through a door in the back into the hangar once again. Except it’s not the Corona there – it’s a much bigger ship probably three times as long and twice as wide. You don’t see any weapons on the exterior.

The Shopkeeper beams. “The Cruiser class, but I call her the Phoenix. We retrofitted this little lady after she crashed and the crew bailed. The crash did her weapons systems in, but we took care of that by adding in automatic drones. She’ll start with four drones, and she can repair them too – but maybe you’ll be able to build a couple more?”

You want to inquire about other weapons, but the Shopkeeper beats you to the punch. “Before you ask, we couldn’t get the cannons up and running again, not after we installed the automatic piloting and the drones system – the little lady just didn’t have enough juice to support more than that. I figure you’ll need more power for the reactor before you can make any modifications. Maybe a new magicite reactor altogether would be best.”

The Phoenix comes with four combat drones, which she will automatically reconstruct if they are destroyed. With time and resources, she can autonomously operate twelve drones at once. However, the Phoenix will always seek to engage at her maximum range of 250 miles as she lacks weapon systems. Even if weapon systems are installed, she will still use her drones preferentially.

Besides the standard features of an airship, living quarters, a mess hall and a recreational deck – the Phoenix also has a massive maintenance bay which would make most Moogle engineers more than ecstatic. In order to support it all however, you would need to harvest a massive amount of magicite to form a stable core reactor. Or perhaps something else of equivalent power would suffice – the power once implanted cannot be removed."
620,,500,Cybershamanism,Marvel 2099,Magitek,"You are a practitioner of the spiritual-mystical art of cybershamanism. Combining modern technology, with shamanism understood through an anthropology by way of Hollywood lens, you possess the ability to disrupt electrical systems and technology. This ability is limited to your direct presence on your own, but it will scale to the transmission systems available to you; a major Hollywood system for global broadcast of holo entertainment could give you the ability to disrupt all electronics in a major city (like Hollywood) or possibly across California if you really tried.

These arts also allow you to summon forth spirits from cyberspace - or other similar computer information networks such as the internet in future jumps - crafting them from the mass subconscious by way of electrical data created and exchanged. To do so will require spiritual or mystical energy, either gathered yourself, or drawn from the faith and belief of your followers, and the amount of energy available will determine the number and strength of cyber spirits that you can summon."
621,,500,Hextech Notebook,League of Legends,Magitek,"This thick, ornate book is a tome containing the research of some of the world's leading minds in the field of Hextech. From Heimerdinger's slick, efficient turrets to Ziggs' bombastic hexplosives to Rumble's ramshackle mech-suit, this book contains extensive notes on the magical theory and thaumatic construction behind many of the most famous hextech creations on Runeterra, up to and including Viktor's notes on the creation of the steam golem Blitzcrank. Learn what you will from these notes, just don't let anyone else know you have them- Most of these inventor-types guard their secrets jealously."
622,,500,Beast In A Bottle,BlazBlue: Phase Zero,Magitek,"Do you recall those weapons that Nine made, using a second Black Beast as a power source? The power source wasn’t actually made by her, but by Eight and Seven of the Ten Sages. It involved killing her sister, so you can imagine her reaction. Regardless, after taking it for herself she split in half, and the second half in eight. Each one of these fragments was used in the creation of the nine Arch Enemy Event Weapons. But apparently we have a tenth, because I’ve one for you if you want it. And trust me, it’ll give you a massive upgrade. A cutting enhancement now cuts through damn near anything. A flame enchantment creates a firestorm. A gun enchanted to split it’s bullets in half suddenly shoots dozens of bullets from a single round of ammunition."
623,,500,Elemental Affinity ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"Some Mages possess a trait called a mana conversion affinity, which allows them to easily convert mana into a certain type of energy, common ones including lightning, ice and fire. Due to the fact that it’s relatively rare, along with the overwhelming preference for pure mana-based techniques, it is very uncommon to see them truly used in combat outside of sports or certain magical traditions. Taking this will allow you to add a channel to the Device’s casting processes that strictly favors a certain elemental affinity, including but not exclusive to the examples listed above. This will make spells within the affinity far, far easier to cast, with a much greater kick to them, but carries the downside of making elements not included in the affinity suffer from reduced power and efficiency as they have to go through the regular, non-streamlined channel. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)
"
624,,500,Perfume Package ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"This is... an incredibly strange system, to say the least. Four ‘globes’ are added to the main body of your device, or alternatively, two to the back of each of your hands. While not inherently magical themselves, they are based on magic hardware and- it’s a very strange system, again. Each of the globes contains perfume-like chemicals that... are actually explosives. That’s right, mass-based explosives. Completely non-magical and somehow legal. The system is capable of mixing the chemicals in the globes without them reacting in a negative way - i.e. exploding – and somehow produces various effects with this, such as producing remotely-triggered mines, smoke screens or simple explosive projectiles.

Even more strangely, your Device now seems to possess chemical batteries, now. Not magical batteries, these are fuel cells that provide electrical power. It doesn’t seem to contribute to the casting of any spells, but it powers the mixing and projecting system, along with erecting some manner of defensive field for you, as long as it possesses power, which supplements your Barrier Jacket. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)"
625,,500,Rite of Consumption ,Endless Legend,Magitek,"You know a terrible secret. A forbidden kind of magic. You know how to turn a living soul into Dust, and bind it to armor. Everything about that soul carries over to the new body, so it will remember everything before it happens. This allows you to turn anyone into a Broken Lord. It takes a substantial amount of Dust to make a suit of armor, and the ritual takes a day to perform. Did I mention some people consider Broken Lords monsters? Undergoing this Rite does not kill you, so you may freely become a Broken Lord without fear of losing the jump.

626,,500,Pillars of Authority ,Endless Legend,Magitek,"You know how to build and how to power Arcana Pillars, massive floating stone foci for magic. They create huge, mile wide fields of influence, their effects changing depending on the Arcana you have selected. May be taken as many times as you take Arcana of (Index) The amount of focus and endurance it takes to power these stones is enough to totally immolate lesser beings. Only the most skilled of Ardent Mages can use them without risk of death.

Authority: You gain access to mind affecting magic, able to compel others to listen to you and implant thoughts not their own into their minds. With a pillar, you could brainwash entire districts and demoralize armies without lifting a hand. (CG Note: Requires Arcana of Authority first.)"
627,,500,Pillars of Materializing ,Endless Legend,Magitek,"You know how to build and how to power Arcana Pillars, massive floating stone foci for magic. They create huge, mile wide fields of influence, their effects changing depending on the Arcana you have selected. May be taken as many times as you take Arcana of (Index) The amount of focus and endurance it takes to power these stones is enough to totally immolate lesser beings. Only the most skilled of Ardent Mages can use them without risk of death.

Materializing: You can command Dust. Through it, you learn the many, many ways to use it to harm your foes. Fire, lightning, ice, acid, every stranger things can be compelled out from the Dust. With a Pillar... These are the true siege weapons of the Ardent Mages, able to fire beams of searing fire and abominable cold at tremendous range. (CG Note: Requires Arcana of Materializing first.)"
628,,500,Pillars of Renewal ,Endless Legend,Magitek,"You know how to build and how to power Arcana Pillars, massive floating stone foci for magic.

May be taken as many times as you take Arcana of (Index) The amount of focus and endurance it takes to power these stones is enough to totally immolate lesser beings. Only the most skilled of Ardent Mages can use them without risk of death.

Renewal: How do you think the Ardent's survive being strapped to pillars and burned? Because the same power they call upon to destroy can be used to heal. A Pillar becomes a bastion of good health, where the sick travel from all around to bask in the healing glow. It’s a giant floating regeneration beacon. (CG Note: Requires Arcana of Renewal first.)"

Only the most skilled of Ardent Mages can use them without risk of death.

Matter: Dust is everything. You simply need to tell it what to become. With this Arcana, you can turn a handful into any portable object, a bag into something it'd take a couple people to lift, or an entire barrel into a hasty fortification. With a Pillar, you could turn a fortune of Dust into a castle in mere minutes. (CG Note: Requires Arcana of Matter first.)"
630,,600,The New Babylon,Shin Megami Tensei II,Magitek,"No matter what others tell you, it wasn’t the will of God or a demonic invasion that decided the fate of the world, it was a single human wanting to let others decide for themselves how they wanted to live. If Demons can be summoned and bound by a program, then imagine what they could do with just a little more than that? This is a previously- abandoned laboratory once belonging to a fellow in a wheelchair, now given to you as a property or warehouse attachment. While in need of some repairs and maintenance, this lab contains detailed notes on how to combine the properties of the supernatural with science, letting you make things like the Demon Summoning Program and portals to other dimensions. With time, perhaps you could synthesize a better version of Magnetite or invent weapons that damage Demons just as badly as a powerful spell. Once the laboratory is functional again, all items you construct within it have a much higher success rate and integrate spells and devices together with ease. The keys to this world are yours, Jumper...what will you do with it?"
631,,600,Hole To Hell,Shin Megami Tensei II,Magitek,"This is what starts all of it, every time. A human discovers a brand new dimension of power and possibility, an expanse waiting to be claimed and conquered by ingenuity...and then suddenly, the world is flooded with demons. The world is cleansed in fire by the apocalyptic conflict between God and Lucifer until nothing is left but dust and ashes, the world is reborn, rinse and repeat. Now you have your own little gate to hell within your Warehouse.

A technological take on a powerful ritual chamber, this is a gateway into the realm where demons originate. Its simplest and most obvious use is that even once you’ve left this world far behind, you can still call forth demons of this universe within this chamber to either battle or be subdued for later summoning. The most major figures of this world – the likes of YHVH and his Avatars, Satan, and Lucifer – aren’t included in this roster, but the majority of the others are available. You may summon any particular demon in said roster simply by inputting its name into the computer.

A second use is that this portal works as a two-way gateway into the Demon world, an Abyss where Demons live their own lives in a surprisingly similar way to humans – they even have things like casinos and towns in there. One could perhaps find a way to utilize this Abyss and its unique properties to gain things like a steady supply of Magnetite or maybe a constant energy source...though you’d need to be a technological genius to make something like the latter. Its geography and inhabitants change slightly with each jump, gaining new Demons based on the beliefs and mythologies of where you’ve been.

Finally, you may simply sign the death warrant of a particular world by disabling the safeties on this Gate and causing Demons to flood into the world. Even without YHVH or Lucifer to call the shots, the conflict of Law and Chaos will continue in wherever you seek to unleash it, spelling doom and eventual apocalypse for those who partake in it. I certainly hope they are prepared for it."
632,,600,Different Dimension Savant,Duel Monsters – The Shadow Realm,Magitek,"A riddle for you - are these memories of your world empowered by the Different Dimension, or just echoes of a distant land reverberating in your mind? Whatever the answer, I leave to philosophers - you have a very keen understanding of advanced technology from another world. Laser cannons, propulsion devices, even some robotics...you know how to make many advanced wonders of science. But aside from that, you know how to make technology that taps into or travels into the Different Dimension, from a Dimensional Breach that leads unwary foes into it, or even a teleporter that works akin to an Assailant’s power. Not only is the Different Dimension a hostile dimension where only the hardy and stubborn can survive, but those trapped within cannot be accessed again by the outside world...the dead within cannot be resurrected, the victims trapped cannot be called back by magic, or seen by the Gods. The only way for them to be free of the Different Dimension is to escape on their own...or for someone with similar technological prowess to retrieve whatever is left of them.

While your chain is in progress, you cannot use the Different Dimension to cross into other worlds. Once your chain ends, this lock is removed, though you can only visit your home world and the other worlds of Duel Monsters this way. Should you obtain the Spark, this limitation is removed, and the Different Dimension can be used for quick transportation between the infinite worlds of the multiverse freely."
633,,600,More Brains than Sense,Kate Daniel ,Magitek,"Magic and tech are mutually exclusive but not for you. You specialize in making things that are not hampered by magic whether with magic or tech. This will work on anything from cars to buildings. At the higher points of your craft, you could make an entirely modern high rise that works perfectly during magic just by making magic think it was a rock with sufficiently powerful illusion or making tech that can manipulate magic such as draining it from an area.

Boosted: You do not make technology anymore you now only make magitech. Anything you make will come enchanted and as a mechanical marvel. If not planned or proposed the enchantments are crowded and inefficient but only assist in the function of the thing you are making. Magic engines and the like are finger painting in comparison to your craft.

They are power. You have begun to reverse engineer them, learning to recreated the weaker ones, and to create your own derivations. The Wissenschaft would love to have you within it’s ranks, and the powers in the shadows shift uncomfortably as you gain more and more knowledge of ancient artifacts, simply by laying your hand upon them, and hearing the songs within your blood. Buying this perk grants Ancient Blood free."
635,,600,Jumper Buster,Xenoblade Chronicles 2,Magitek,"Science pushes ever onwards, never satisfied with yesterday’s genius, always reaching for the next great advancement. For you, the next leap forward is simple: “Let’s put our robot inside an even bigger robot!” You’ve been outfitted with the experimental technology of the Poppi Buster, allowing you to take control of other machines and pilot them remotely through your own systems as if they were merely an extension of yourself. Taking control of a machine merely requires you to make physical contact and establish an ether link with it, after which point it becomes slaved to your will. Machines with their own wills can reject control and you’ll have to fight them mentally for administration rights before you can take control of them. While controlling other machines you can use your own ether arts and abilities through them without any loss in performance."
636,,600,Mode Swapper,Xenoblade Chronicles 2,Magitek,"The design of artificial Blades is a very young field of engineering but even so you’re likely to go down in history as one of the most revolutionary machines ever built, not only because you’re a sentient robot but because you’re several robots in a single chassis. You can transform between multiple distinct modes as if you were several Blades in one, much like Poppi’s Alpha, QT, and QTπ transformations, allowing you to reconfigure yourself on the fly to adapt to new situations. You can have up to three different modes, each one with different specialties and configurations, including any of your ether furnace configurations from Poppiswappi if you have it. These transformations are swift, taking mere seconds and surrounding you with a protective barrier to guard against unwanted interruptions."
637,,600,Unparalleled Genius,Xenoblade Chronicles 2,Magitek,"Science is the greatest power that humans possess, the spark of brilliance to understand their world and what makes it tick, and turn those things to their advantage with all manner of miraculous devices. You’re able to make artificial versions of anything you can see and understand which occurs in nature, whether it be the workings of ether energy or the nature of Blades and Titans or the seemingly-magical powers of all the various monsters you might encounter. As your knowledge grows, ideas on how to replicate what you see through artificial means begin to naturally piece themselves together in your mind in strokes of sheer ingenuity. Once you have a solid understanding of a thing or process you can build a working replica of it, though the cost to do so may be outrageous depending on what it is you are trying to replicate. This perk is the secret to building your own artificial blades, but given enough time and resources who knows what else you could do with it? Perhaps your magnum opus could be a mechanical Titan? An artificial Aegis?"
638,,600,Positron Rife,Castlevania - Aria of Sorrow,Magitek,"...we were doing so well with keeping in-theme, too. This is a futuristic cannon that is surprisingly easy to carry and deploy, and it fires what manual likes to call ‘positive electrons’...or in this case, a thin, disintegrating beam of light that doesn’t discriminate between monsters or solid objects, tearing an open hole through both most physical defences with ease. Int doesn’t have any ammo limitations, either. Try not to shoot it around too wildly. You may import a gun you already own instead to gain this effect, if desired."
639,,600,Jakyou Manor,Shin Megami Tensei ,Magitek,"A church of respectable size filled with machinery and computers, with a small area set aside for regular tools for both mundane and magical research. The main attraction here, so to say, is the fusion mechanism. By placing two to three demons within separate pods in the center of this building, a new stronger demon may be created. Here, you’ll just call up another pre-existing critter, but in other worlds your creations will need heavy research to even function, both on the physical, mental, and metaphysical sides. That tiny laboratory might get dusty if you’re not the proactive sort, but you’ll be glad you have it once you’re out of this universe. Of course, if you have magnetite to spare, the computers here may be used to record the form of demons you catch. Here you’ll be able to summon up real demons, but in other universes you’ll just get empty bodies. The flesh is there, and most of the spirit is there, but there’s no real spark of being. That puts a damper on the most obvious uses of this feature, sadly. Post-jump, the entire place becomes a Cosmic Warehouse attachment. If you work better with some background noise, I would like to point out that (for whatever reason) the computers here have some haunting piano and organ tunes available."

Its barrel is twice as long as the average man is tall, and it has been enchanted to have infinite ammunition, though specialized projectiles may still be loaded. Using a self-replenishing mystic core as its power source, shots reaching a bit shy of three thousand meters per second can be released every other moment, with no real recoil. So long as you don’t miss, this thing will kill even Giants or Liches to death real good."

An evil thing, made with sacrifices and heretical techno-sorceries most foul, a blow from it would surely kill even a hero of the age.

This is a copy of the original, and just like the original, it draws upon the wielder’s own strengths to further magnify its destructive capabilities. No prophecies, luck, or divine providence can ever intervene to save any it’s swung at, and no gods, short of directly intervening, can protect those you would kill with it. The victim’s own skill or ability might protect them, so it’s not a guarantee, but it’s a start.

Remaining inviolable and indestructible no matter the use it is put to, this Mace embodies the cruelty and avariciousness of Duryodhana. Whenever you strike down an enemy with this, it takes in their very soul, all that made them what they were, and grants it to you instead. 

While it never works on any gods, and the powers you take this way are transitory and fleeting, they nonetheless can grant you powers few others in this world can imagine."
642,,600,Markandeya,Grant Morrison’s 18 Days,Magitek,"Markandeya The Great Archive Rishi. This massive construct knows the true past, and being able to see into the cycles that have come before, is able to predict the future in broad swaths. It
tells all things in metaphor and stories, and records all events, no matter how small or hidden. 

It also holds within its data banks all the knowledge of the bygone ages, the greatest technological insights, histories and magical arts. Any knowledge that was an absolute, terrible secret, like the secret names of God or such are exempt from his reach, but anything less than that, Markandeya knows and will tell you if asked.

The Great Machine Sage will take up residence in your warehouse and provide sage advice whenever asked, but its truths are always deeper than you might at first think. It claims to be a teller of tales, not a soothsayer of their meaning.

Markandeya is also an AI beyond anything most worlds have ever seen. He is indestructible and incorruptible, and possesses unbreakable connections to any and all information systems that exist in future worlds. Including files stored in cabinets, yes. While the last cannot be changed by him like the others can, they can indeed be read at will. Because yes, the entire notion of any machine that is not transcendent itself hiding anything from Markandeya is laughable at best.

He can also be used to calibrate or control magic and technology of any and all kinds, such as maintaining the spells on your weapons inventories or defenses on your properties. While it is beneath the dignity of the great Machine Sage to stoop to such base deeds, he will obey if you ask it.

In future worlds too, Markandeya’s Archives update with all the knowledge of the world, especially the lost and hidden, and he gains connections to whatever information systems exist. The connections to the systems in previous worlds remain, but nothing can be written, only read. The past is, after all, the past."
643,,600,Philosopher Scientist,Grant Morrison’s 18 Days,Magitek,"In the Silver Age, the Great Sage Vishwamitra decreed that Trishanku (born Satyavrata of the Solar Dynasty), the King of Ayodhya, was to be let into heaven with his mortal body. When denied this by the gods, Vishwamitra crafted a new heaven for Trishanku to rule over as the new Indra. Only the beseechments by the gods prevented this from becoming reality.

You are not quite the equal of Vishwamitra, for he was a giant among men even in the Days of Silver. But you are among the closest that exist in this base era. Yours is the mastery of all the sciences and arts of the world, from the biological expertise to the chemical and the magical, needed to craft all the wonders and miracles that exist in this time and place.

With this blessing your intelligence, speed of thought, and aptitude towards any and all fields of science and magic both are heightened to tremendous, absurd degrees. Your memory is limitless and unalterable, and your ability to recall it instant and flawless. You can think and do any number of things at once, possessing truly unlimited multitasking.

Combined with Yajnatek, you will be able to summon and bind gods, lay down bindings of fate in
the forms of boons and curses, craft great works of magic that make and break empires, and
more. At the same time, your scientific aptitude would let you craft gadgets and wonders like the Vimanas, Godly weapons and armor any deity or Super warrior would be proud to wield, or even wonders like the Rishi Computer Markandeya, or even works like the Maya Mahal, the palace of wonders from where Yudish once ruled.

You can also combine any and all of your gifts, crafting together technology, psionics and magic into works that can do anything either can, as well as machines to cast magic, and others that combine the best of both worlds to achieve even greater results."
644,,600,Android Replica,Twisted-Wonderland ,Magitek,"An android replica of... someone. Maybe it’s you, maybe it’s your long-dead brother - up to you, really. The thing is, once per Jump, if you die, you will wake up in this mechanical body with all your perks intact. Comes with a lot of customizable Gears!"
645,,600,Technological Augmentation,Sundered,Magitek,"The Valkyrie thought that they could harness the Shining Trapezohedron, and possibly augment it for their own uses. You know they were right, after all, you could too.

You are able to use technology to harness magical energy sources safely and augment magical items with technology. This even extends to blending magic and technology to bring them both to new heights."
646,,600,Yo-Kai Watch,Yo-Kai Watch,Magitek,"Alright let’s be honest, the only reason you’re here is for this little trinket. For those of you who don’t know what it is, allow me to explain. This is a device that allows the person wearing it to see yo-kai. In order to do this, they shine a built in light on the spirit, making them visible and allowing the two to communicate and interact with each other. Not only that, but yo-kai will be able to give you their yo-kai medals. When inserted into the yo-kai watch, the wearer will be able to summon the yo-kai from anywhere in the multiverse to their side. Post jump this will also work with any other spiritual being, both the light and the medal function.

Note: Watch build in the associated jump doc."
647,,600,Yopple Employee,Yo-Kai Watch,Magitek,"You really are a yo-kai researcher. Yopple is a company in the yo-kai world responsible for creating the best of yo-kai technology, run by supergenius Steve Jaws. You’re one of the engineers taught the arts of their craft, and are capable of making the strange spiritech that they are capable of, creating things such as sentient machinery or turning model toys into giant mecha, maybe even coming up with a way to create robots that replicate existing yo-kai. With enough time and the right parts, you might even be able to create your own models of the yo-kai watch, or possibly put your own twist on the blueprints."
648,,600,Lowee’s Magitech,Hyperdimension Neptunia,Magitek,"Lowee, unlike the other nations chooses to focus on the magical instead of just technology. Your products are magitech, and this experience allows you to easily convert between magic and technology, turning magic items into high technology, and high technology into magic items."
649,,600,Alchemist’s Laboratory,Valkyrie Anatomia,Magitek,"Although this is called a laboratory, it actually takes any shape or form that would be suitable for you to perform an experiment or engage in the study of technology and magic, both the recovery of lost techniques and the development of new ones. It is fitted with everything that you could need for such tasks and has a built-in library with functions for the repair and creation of new homunculi, though you will need to recover the necessary... parts for new ones on your own. Should you ever move location, such as being requested to serve a court or need to go into hiding, then this will move with you inconspicuously. It is also protected by various magical barriers, so you needn’t worry about experiments getting too noisy, being interrupted or losing track of it."
650,,600,God Breaker ,Warhammer 40K: Necrons,Magitek,"To spend all of eternity locked away in soulless unfeeling husks of metal still leaves your kind better than the defiled wretches of Chaos or the extinction found in the ravenous hunger of the C’tan, and perhaps it is only fitting that they are the only forces that your kind call true enemies. You one of the minds whose prowess enabled the humbling of the C’tan and the design of the technologies that even now fend off Chaos at the Eye of Terror. When faced with the godlike beings or supernatural phenomenon you have the impossible brilliance to swiftly understand them and create countermeasures or weapons to oppose or thwart them. While this requires time, effort, and resources matching the scale of your opponent you will find yourself swiftly uncovering and mastering the needed esoterica to engineer entirely new technologies and fields of science, forging the necessary devices and constructions, all with a surety that the result will be something that will humble gods. From the pylons that deny Chaos hegemony, the weapons that scarred the universe and broke the C’tan, and the prisons that enslaved their remains so long as you live no titan is truly safe. Lesser races shall kneel at the feet of gods, yours shall laugh victoriously on the dirt of their tombs."
651,,600,Marivel's Myke,Wild Arms 2,Magitek,"This mic is like a dog’s whistle but instead of dogs it summons demons. Any monsters who hear you will immediately attack you. Magical seals will degrade and hidden monsters will also not resist the urge to attack during your songs. Curiously, any monster defeated shortly after hearing your song will pass through a metamorphosis and leave behind some kind of artifact or trinket much better than anything made in this world or having unique magical abilities."
652,,600,Jumper Chateau,Wild Arms 2,Magitek,"Your very own country house or castle, fully populated with helpers that take care of the place for you and keep it stocked. If you activate the generator in the basement you can turn it into a mobile castle with the anti-gravity devices installed around the chateau. However it requires a very specific ground in order to land without damaging the devices or the chateau itself."
653,,600,Personal Temple,Wild Arms 2,Magitek,"This facility can be a part of your warehouse or placed somewhere in the world you arrive at. It comes with all the tools necessary to maintain or upgrade your cybernetics or advanced prosthesis. Its workers accept any kind of currency to perform their services and could be convinced to work on other projects with the right incentive.

Projects funded by you and built on this workshop can benefit from any crafting advantage that you have (like your crafting perks) if you choose for it."
654,,600,Handheld Railgun,Wild Arms 2,Magitek,"This specially made Railgun has been adapted to use by infantry (though it can be adapted into vehicle-mounted), it normally requires great physique since it's unwieldy and heavy, but in your hands it's easily usable just like any of your limbs. This weapon boasts an incredible range and unreasonable firepower, not many monsters or buildings can survive a shot from this, though it has a limit of shots before overheating, but some tinkering can increase this limit. Get this now and receive a flare gun with unlimited ammunition!"
655,,600,Tinkering Hobby,Wild Arms 2,Magitek,"You have a wealth of knowledge about engineering, mechanics and some about biology, enough to mess with cybernetics and the like. You are a technological wiz capable of building mechas, flying mansions and other ancient devices, you just need time and resources and all these and more are possible."
656,,600,Avalonian Engineering ,Cereza and the Stray Demon,Magitek,"Puca’s merits as a king are...questionable, at best. But one thing absolutely not in doubt is his genius for magitech-a gifted mind you now share. Under his iron rule, fairies advanced from a medieval society to a fully industrialised one over several human generations. Simply by studying the ways of humans he was able to harness the fairies’ natural magic to build advanced fortresses of red stone, the soul-harvesting deployable pocket dimensions known as Tír na nÓgs, the magic-strengthening elemental engines as well as the constellation-like halls guarding them, numerous steam and clockwork automatons that serve the fairies’ whims and gears that can amplify even small amounts of magic into far greater output-at the cost of considerable fragility. As well as the intellect and familiarity needed to replicate all of Avalon’s new mechanical wonders, you’ll find yourself able to apply a similar approach to enhanced other forms of magic by harnessing it with the power of technology. Perhaps with enough training in the dark arts, you could build a demonic robot?"
657,,600,Abomatron,The Owl House V1,Magitek,"Introducing the Abomatron. It's seven hundred snorse-power, has two fairy-power jetpacks, and comes in several shades of lilac. It has abilities such as: Malleability (thanks to the abomination goo they are made from, Abomatrons are malleable and can alter their bodies for various tasks), Arm extension (much like the Abomaton, the Abomatron can extend its arms), Blaster arm (by default, the Abomatron's right arm can shoot blasts of abomination goo), Jetpack (the Abomatron has a built-in jetpack on its back that can be used for flight), Shield (the Abomatron has the ability to generate a translucent shield around the cockpit, protecting the pilot) and Bubble (the Abomatron is able to generate a small spherical bubble, similar to the cockpit shield, which can be used to restrain enemies).

Boosted: The Titan Blood upgraded this powerful weapon to a new level, increasing its speed as well as its strength, the Abomatron is now capable of dealing more damage in less time. Its blasts of abomination goo now have an impact so concentrated that it could actually be lethal (think of how Sasori can condense the streams into water jet cutters that can slice through rocks). Now the built-in jetpack was improved and became a built-in teleportation, allowing the Abomatron to teleport to anywhere in a radius of 30 meters. Its shield can now nullify the Collector's Magic, while the Bubble is now capable of restraining that little guy too.

658,,600,"What is ""impossible""?",The Owl House V1,Magitek,"That's a genuine question. If you asked a man in the Middle Ages if humans can send a message from one country to the other and receive a message back in less than an hour, without using magic, that man would say that's impossible. But you need merely look at what you are using to read this to know that's incorrect. You have the incredible power to apply innovations in pretty much anything related to technology and magic, perhaps even a mixture of those two. You can take a city with a medieval level of technology and help them develop it to 21st century level, although this would take at least 5 years; magic innovation is on the same level. You shall be the one to uncover the cure for terrible diseases (maybe even curses), to develop new ways of transportation and to fuse both magic and technology with the purpose of achieving even more effective results. Now go, and next time someone tells you something is impossible, say to that person/being: ""Impossible? Or unlikely?!!!""

Boosted: The Titan Blood's purpose in The Owl House is to make what's considered impossible, possible. So it's no surprise that imbuing you with said Blood would increase your ability to make the ""impossible"". You can take a city with a medieval level of technology and help them develop it to 21st century level in a year, magic and technomagic innovations being on the same level.

659,,600,Coffin Technician,A Certain Scientific Accelerator,Magitek,"You are very good at combining technology and magic, and tend to get more out of it than most. You can safely use magic inside an AIM field, and teach others to do the same, even indirectly. Furthermore, you know the technological and magical principles behind Hishigata’s “coffins,” which are mecha which can tap into and boost a dead esper’s psychic powers. You can relatively easily adapt these weapons to other superhumans, but you also know everything necessary to run your own Power Curriculum Program, though your knowledge is slightly truncated, such that attempts to create espers as devastating as Shundan Kimi will simply fail."
660,,600,G.O.L.E.M. 1.7 ,Guild Wars 2,Magitek,"A prototype golem that can be worn as power armor, or piloted remotely. It is immensely powerful, and can stand up to Champions from the Elder Dragons, though you might take a while to learn how to pilot it properly."
661,,600,Integration and Iteration,Guild Wars 2,Magitek,"Much like the Pact, you have mastered the means to merge disjoined technology from wildly different backgrounds (such as Asura and Sylvari tech) into a seamless whole that functions better than the sum of its parts. This allows you to do things such as build a laser gun that absorbs energy from the light of the sun like a plant to power its own shots."
662,,600,Jōkaishō,Bleach,Magitek,"Used long ago by scientists that predated the current Shinigami Research Institute, the Jōkaishō is an immensely powerful reishi generator and regulator. The central unit appears as a massive red orb with power cables simply being able to melt into its surface as needed. Like a spiritual nuclear power plant, the Jōkaishō generates great amounts of energy, but can also melt down and produce terrible destruction, potentially wiping out a tenth of Seireitei in one go. Its purpose as far as research goes is the regulation and control of spirit energy, with attached interfaces allowing you to have a direct hand in influencing the spirit energy of anything the Jōkaishō is connected to with an excessively fine amount of detail."
663,,600,Evolution of the Soul,Bleach,Magitek,"At the heart of all things is the soul, the holy grail from which the world can be manipulated and controlled. To create and alter the soul, and life in general, could be said to be the highest and most worthy form of science. Your knowledge of alteration and even creation of souls or biological life is a match for the greats, men like Urahara and Kurotsuchi. Provided you have the tools, it is entirely possible for you to craft new beings from spirit particles, designed to your specifications down to the molecular level. 

Such a project is grand even for you, meaning that lesser modifications or enhancements are quite simple. Giving someone the ability to melt into liquid and reform in a safe location? Rudimentary. Altering the appearance of a Zanpakuto Spirit or potentially even it’s abilities? Possible, enough to offer it as a paid service. New species entirely, such as the Gikon or the Bount, would never be accidental creations but the results of purposeful development in your lab. You’re not all that good at fixing the injured compared to a healer of your level but you’re very much able to make people into terrifyingly powerful bio-spiritual monsters, if they’re not too squeamish. 

Though beyond you now, the potential lies even for you to discover the secrets of resurrection, resuscitating lost or mostly destroyed souls and lives even hours after they have passed on. Interfering with the cycle in such a form may bring trouble your way but...the science of the soul calls to you and what greater expression can there be? It’s only natural to progress, as your existing mastery is complemented with the sort of incredible talent that got you here in the first place. Who knows what sort of grand spirits or monsters you might create in time."
664,,600,Cyborg,Gloryhammer,Magitek,"While to a casual observer you appear completely human, you are in fact a cyborg—all of your bones and internal organs have been replaced with highly-advanced technology. This makes you significantly stronger, faster and tougher (easily twice as strong as a peak human), your eyesight is three times better than a human’s, you are completely immune to mundane poisons or diseases.

Your internal mechanics are powered by an incredibly powerful battery—a captured and compressed neutron star. This essentially provides a steady stream of limitless power. With a little work, you could hook your internal battery up to power something external to you, but its output is limited to about 1000 MW/hour.

If you wish to, you can activate a self-destruct that explosively decompresses your neutron star battery, causing a supermassive neutronic transnova detonation powerful enough to obliterate an entire planet. You are killed in the process (warning: it is not advisable to use this unless you have a 1-up and the ability to survive in space). You may only use this ability once per Jump."
665,,600,ULTIMATE MECHAJUMPER MODE: ABSOLUTE,Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Magitek,WHO THE HELL EXPECTED GIANT ROBOTS TO SOMEHOW COME INTO PLAY????? Because damn is it awesome. You have a giant robot that can drain a full day's worth of your energy all at once. This can work three times a day if you somehow regenerate enough of it to work again. This lets you do some cool things like shoot giant laser beams and utilize simple domains within the cockpit. You can also modify this thing with other technology so that it can get even stronger. Depending on the energy you use it might even be able to use magic.
666,,600,Astral Express ,Honkai: Star Rail,Magitek,"You may now take the Astral Express with you to your future jumps. This large train has many cars, enough for any and all of your companions to have their own room. The Express is a spacecraft, and can easily travel extremely far distances in very short time, as well as being able to beam passengers down to the surface from outer space. You may mentally control wherever the Express’s destination is, and instinctively know how long it will take to get there."

Now you too possess the knowledge and ability of that entity as you can create technology and crystals to set up time loops.

Boosted: Shinryu

Oh my, it would seem you have gone beyond what the Lufenians could have ever achieved. Now you too can gain power from the loops much as Shinryu did in Dissidia and as the mysterious Lufenian collaborator who can take the energy of loops. With a few loops you could rise to godhood.

669,,600,Heretic-Engineer,Demon: The Descent,Magitek,"Like the demon going by Wednesday, you have somehow learned to build the things of the God-Machine yourself. You can construct occult matrices by entangling mundane and supernatural forces into fixed patterns. You can build Infrastructure out of said occult matrices, creating buildings with supernatural capabilities. You can generate output from them-primarily the Aether demons are sustained on, but potentially other supernatural resources such as Essence too. You can even design angels wholly loyal to you using the above. The skill is not entirely reliable (if the God-Machine itself has failed to build a truly perfect system, how much harder is it for it’s components to do so?), but with enough dedication your mastery of arcane physics can let you tailor make calamitous fates or alternate timelines, and enact greater schemes like programming the humanity of this world with enough psychic pressure to usurp the supernatural forces around them by truly Awakening to the glory that is their birthright. What will you do with this gift? Will you liberate others with your works, or set yourself up as a nascent God-Machine?"
670,,600,Damocles,Demon: The Descent,Magitek,"Among Unchained and the God-Machine’s servants, the name Damocles inspires dread in the most reckless Saboteurs and the most indoctrinated cultists. He was said to end an age belonging to strange giants that nearly tore the Machine from the earth. He was said to have smote the first Fallen. He was said to have fallen only because he found no enemy worthy of his full attention. And the best lies are built on a bedrock of truth, because the truth is that the ultimate Destroyer is not a single entity. It is a template, constantly upgraded for higher peaks of performance. You are the current iteration of the Damocles Project. Your demonic form is an almighty juggernaut, more akin to something on par with a giant fighting robot than most demons, capable of levelling city blocks and toppling buildings. It has some of the greatest weapons known to demonkind, whether processes that let you rain hellfire over vast swathes of terrain, or a crushing maw capable of chewing steel into powder. Even in human form you can conjure a sword powerful enough to fell the great behemoths and elder horrors that once walked this world. You are also supernaturally talented at creating Gadgets suited for war, easily creating things like bullets that sap Essence from spiritual beings or a revolver that incites friendly fire among your enemies.

Somewhere out there is an Analyst who is using your name and title to eke a living.

He would be most alarmed to realise his claim to it is weaker than he thinks."
671,,600,Augmented Goddess,Shin Megami Tensei V,Magitek,"These are a set of devices with the purpose of gathering Magatsuhi at a constant rate from their surroundings and sending them towards one individual. This Individual will than be empowered by the constant stream, to the degree where they could rival a Queen of Heaven before the God of Law robbed her of power. You get 7 which when all active will give you that level of power and you also get the knowledge to repair them if someone destroyed them or turned them off. Sufficient knowledge in Magitec should allow you to make more."
672,,600,Science Of A God,Fate/Grand Order Part 2,Magitek,"Humanity is not the only one who gets to progress technologically. There’s no real contact with alien races, but the Twelve Gods of Olympus are the remnants of one such advanced alien species, one who attained technology far and beyond that of Earth, and met their conclusion as a species. And with this purchase, you get the entire techbase of the 5th Lostbelt downloaded into your head, in the form of genuine understanding of all the principles and knowledge bases involved, letting you potentially innovate on this technology should you have the right infrastructure, creativity, and resources. Do keep in mind that the examples given were all taken from a civilization whose gods had access to a fully developed infrastructure ready to construct whatever they wanted.

We will start with the lower scale technologies shown, such as metallic ships that utilize hard light and large ballistate that shoot glowing energy bolts instead of cannonballs. Likewise there is food that actively changes flavor once or twice while being chewed to result in being delicious to everyone that eats them. But most of the rest of the technology is built on top of one thing: nanomachines. They’re called Klironomia by the gods and their followers, and they are absurdly flexible, allowing the construction of all the technology presented here, as well as increasing the lifespans of humans to 800 years (complete with slowed aging so teenagehood lasts a century), and enhancing them to mildly superhuman levels.

Alternatively, for the case of non-degraded and obsolete Klironomia (yes, LB5 is advanced enough that some kinds of nanomachines are obsolete), gift humans with entirely eternal lifespans, even being unkillable unless someone with the permission to kill them does so, like the gods, in the sense of repairing any damage their body receives in seconds but also reconstructing their body should their previous one have been destroyed. And all this on top of being enhanced to the point of High Rank power, although only in terms of raw physical capability. For actual equipment, strong and reliable armor and weapons can be produced easily enough to outfit an army of hundreds of thousands, or even produce one immensely durable set of armor utilizing conceptual defenses, able to attack with energy beams shot from the hands or from small drones attached to the back. For slightly larger scale combat, giants the size of skyscrapers operating kinda like mecha can be made, whether sleek and white and wielding energy weapons primarily, or focused on physical damage with thick limbs. Regardless, the self-repair capabilities of Klironomia are immense, possibly even repairing a broken-down giant in a manner of hours should the core not have been destroyed.

And of course, for more large-scale warfare, there is the prototype Echidna, capable of creating large amounts of specially designed monsters constantly, maybe even creating immensely strong monsters like Cerberus with powerful materials. That said, that particular bit of technology is not fully developed yet, so perhaps you could smooth over some of the issues with some work. And of course, Klironomia factories that also act as storage, small enough to fit inside a relatively normal religious temple. Oh, and of course, these Klironomia work on spiritual beings just as easily as physical ones. The technology uses some conceptual principles, of course it’d be able to mess with spirits. As a side note, these Klironomia look like fluid mercury to the unaided eye, at least when not integrated into something, which makes them impossible to detect without proper magical or technological sensors.

And finally, there’s the interstellar mountain city, Olympus itself. It is a gigantic space colony that houses the gods and their followers. The actually habitable part of it is actually only like a third, with the rest of its mass being titanic crystal mountains that serve as immensely powerful energy generators, although funnily enough their energy generation is somewhere between Holy Grails and Fantasy Trees instead of  blowing both out of the water. The city itself has two layers, the underground layer that takes care of repairs and maintenance, and the city itself which is separated into various massive districts each as large as a small country.

The city itself is quite futuristic, possessing all the amenities you might expect from incredibly wealthy modern cities and a bit beyond even, such as production towers making Ambrosia, a form of incredibly delicious food, with such nutritional value humans wouldn’t need to sustain themselves on any other food or drink. Additionally, whenever something wrecks the infrastructure, a number of large machines from the underground appear to repair all damage in mere days, even if it was as extensive as the entire city being flattened. And of course, as the capstone to top it all off, is the Cronus Crown, a massive ring surrounding the floating city the gods dwell that maintains all the technology in Olympus in peak working order against the ravages of time, completely removing the need to perform manual maintenance on anything in Olympus.

And of course, there’s the gods themselves. As data-based intelligences, what you would call ‘AI’ (surely an insulting term for the gods), they have immense computing power and can ‘inhabit’ powerful interstellar spaceships as their bodies. From combat ships wielding lasers powerful enough to obliterate whole islands with impunity and with enough of a range to smite people from orbit, to ‘tilling’ massive city sized areas with incredibly powerful shockwaves, to disrupting any minds in an entire city around you to go berserk an experience hallucinations, to wielding gravity manipulation strong enough to force Heroic Spirits to kneel, to full video surveillance of an area the size of a small continent, and even better audio surveillance of a similarly sized area, the powers that the Aletheia, the true forms of the gods, possess are truly worthy to be called divine. These Aletheia, as well as Olympus itself, can fly through space to travel between Planets and solar systems, even between universes, as their original intended purpose was to find a Planet fit for colonization.

And finally, the capstone to top it all off, there is Chaos. A Dyson Sphere using a sun as its power core. Capable of breaking open holes into other universes for the purposes of sending colonization ships elsewhere, shooting laser blasts that travel faster than light itself and powerful enough to completely annihilate even Grand Rank beings in a single shot, and even disassemble massive chunks of Planets it comes across both physically and conceptually to gather resources for itself, Chaos is truly the pinnacle of this form of technology. Unfortunately without certain choices, you won’t have access to the infrastructure necessary to start building any of this, so perhaps you should start small. Hopefully you have a solid explanation for your knowledge of this science to give to the gods of Olympus, if you aren’t one of them yourself."
673,,600,Fenis Chaldea ,Fate/Grand Order Part 1,Magitek,"The Security Organization For The Preservation Of Humanity is the magnum opus of a certain Marisbury Animusphere. Constructed over the course of a decade with aid from the wish of a Holy Grail, this little facility is one of the most important places in the World at the moment. And with this purchase, you shall be inserted into a position that will make you the director of Chaldea after the death of Olga Marie Animusphere, Marisbury’s daughter. As the director, you of course decide the direction of Chaldea as an organization, although it’s still recommended you point the Last Master of Chaldea at the Singularities and help them defeat Goetia.

Now, some elaboration on what this facility entails. First, Chaldea lies in Antarctica, built into a mountain 6 km above sea level. The very core of the facility is CHALDEAS, a conceptual model of the Earth. It is such a faithful recreation that it projects a magnetic field that protects the whole facility (and the mountain it’s in) from destructive cosmic forces, such as the entirety of time being incinerated. In future jumps, you’ll find that the facility will survive any form of cosmic disaster or destruction (as long as it’s not specifically targeted), and provide you with an opportunity to repair the damage done to the universe somehow, as hopeless as it might seem sometimes.

There might be something weird going on with CHALDEAS too, but nothing will really happen during your stay in this jump if you don’t use the Cosmos In The Lostbelt Addon, and without utilizing the Addon, you’ll find out that nothing comes of the pseudo-Planet’s weirdness in future jumps.

Another important thing is the Near-Future Observation Lens, also called Sheba. Aside from operating as a surveillance system for the facility, it is also used to observe CHALDEAS, observing the true Planet Earth by proxy. It is with this Observation Lens that the staff at Chaldea can observe the timeline and obtain coordinates for Rayshift destinations. Additionally, it comes with Rayshifting technology, and enough Rayshifting Coffins to transport a few dozen people. Well, used to at least, as most of the Coffins were heavily damaged in the explosion that sabotaged the first mission.

Additionally, it also comes with simulation technology, able to simulate any battle you have data for, and thanks to the spiritron nature of the simulation, able to have your enemies drop real magical materials on defeat. Perfect for grinding, no?

Chaldea’s summoning system can also record the Saint Graphs of powerful people you meet, although if they are too powerful, they might not be summonable at their full power. On top of this, it has databases that can store the Saint Graphs and bonds of Servants you’ve summoned or even simply made contracts with, so that you don’t lose your friends even if you have to unsummon them. You can also simply have your Servants roam around the facility in low-power mode, as weak as a human but requiring next to no upkeep. And finally, all this is powered by the Fire of Prometheus generator, a magical energy generator that strangely always seems to be able to provide as much energy as the Chaldea facilities require. Perhaps a certain immortal mage is behind this. As the director of Chaldea, you’ll be in the middle of the coming conflict. Stay safe, and remember to take care of your new facility."
674,,600,The Future Is Now,Fate/Grand Order Part 1,Magitek,"CHALDEAS, a conceptual model of the Earth. Sheba, an Observation Lens that deserves the capitalization, used to observe the timeline through CHALDEAS. Rayshifting, a form of time travel involving a conversion into spiritrons. All these technologies were developed by Marisbury Animusphere, a Magus with a vision and a project to complete. With this purchase, you come to share this man's sheer unbridled genius. The secrets to spiritron based technology are yours, something that most people would term ""magitech"". As seen with the examples given previously, the potential of this form of technology is utterly absurd. With enough time and funding, not even the sky might be the limit to the kinds of devices you can develop. And this genius also lets you figure out how to combine your technology with other magical forces you might come across, to vastly expand the possibilities of what you could develop. Of course, as mentioned before, you are still limited by the time you spend in R&D, and the funding available to you. You might not have much of either thing, but it seems that a certain wish has rubbed off on you that could help solve that.

A big pile of money, that is the wish that Marisbury made on the Holy Grail. Of course, instead of a literal big pile of money, he instead received great fortune. Like him, you'll inexplicably find yourself with immense amounts of funds whenever you set out to develop some piece of technology, enough to comfortably afford whatever project(s) you are working on and have plenty left over for other projects. What's more, if you focus all of your funding into one project instead of saving the excess for later, you can massively shorten the amount of time any given project would take. As a reference, Marisbury used this to turn an almost century-long R&D cycle of multiple projects into a bit less than a single decade. Whatever it is that you set out to make, it's almost certain to shape the history of humanity for millenia to come."

The lab also functions as its own MT factory. Any of the MT is fair game: from axemans to assassins to MA types and Magitek monsters like Diamond Weapon and Immortalis, guaranteed not to go berserk against your will."

This is a special project of Niflheim whose goal was to raise the individual's competence to the level that he alone could rival a battalion of the most powerful ""army"" in the world, the Kingsglaives. This customizable colored liquid metal forms one of the few and most powerful armors in this world, the combination of magic and technology is impressive enough in itself: instant armor summoning; physical amplifiers; inertial dampening; energy barrier; thrusters that allow you to take off and propel through the air; but what makes it special is the use of Starscourge, with any risk removed by fiat, the benefits have been manifested to the fullest, all features have been enhanced, the armor that was once limited by shape can now be mutated into any other, and has also gained a self-awareness, that allows it to move alone and fight alongside you, in a way the suit acts as symbiote, the synchronicity and loyalty is only matched by strength, it just likes you... too much.

In short, the suit acts like an extension of your body, each function is totally controlled by thought, the suit multiplies the wearer's strength allowing a notable warrior to keep up with the Lucii, a normal person can too but lacks the ability to do so; the barrier can block any attacks that are below the King's level; The suit can craft a weapon from the same material; the color can also be controlled, do you understand why the Power Rangers? Unfortunately, the suit has diminished returns when it reaches the level of the Astrals, only tripling its strength, fortunately the suit is self-evolving and any improvements are easily applied."

All of Nifheim's magiteknology knowledge is now yours, you can create the Troops, Rifles, Aircraft, Wallbreaker Wave, Diamond Weapons and you can go much further. You've already gone further and found a way to control these artificial Daemons, the only tricky thing is getting an alternative to the miasma, but you should be able to.

Maybe you're a Genius scientist from Solheim who was in suspended animation during the events leading up to its destruction and recently awakened, everything Niflheim has ever created doesn't compare to what you know, creating artificial daemons? Piece of cake. Developing an alternate source for miasma? The Crystal already gives you the means for this but even if not, you could develop it. Creating a formula that gives immortality or improving humans to the level of Daemons? Is possible; Developing Omega by yourself, one of Solheim's greatest inventions capable of taking down even the Astrals, will be difficult but it's just a matter of time.

682,,600,Clockwerk Phantom,D.Y.N. Freaks,Magitek,"A terrible thing indeed. Towering above you is a machine of nigh infinite power and you can feel just that radiating out from it. Formerly a possession of Nyarlathotep, this mecha was once used in a great war against a being known only as ‘D’. It fought against that being outside of reality, its blows threatening to destroy all of existence. Yet still it was defeated. Now it rests here, ready for its new master- you. Clockwerk Phantom is a powerful mecha capable of standing against some of the strongest beings in the multiverse, or at least what it used to be. Capable of powerful magic that can warp reality on a massive level, it was considered to be a worthy steed even to one of the Outer Gods, something that should indicate exactly how powerful it is. On the other hand, the machine is awfully complex and it may take you quite some time to learn how to operate it properly, as well as how to use many of its’ functions to the fullest. And without the same raw power as its’ original owner, yours will be a little lacking in sheer magnitude, if still the sort of thing that can make entire universes tremble in fear."
683,,600,The Science of Mysticism,D.Y.N. Freaks,Magitek,"The wonders of human ingenuity will never cease, even in a supposedly cruel world like this. You’ve gained the knowledge to convert magical spells into data format and upload them into technological devices, allowing those devices to cast those spells by drawing on the power the device runs on. As they have been turned into code, you are able to also alter the way the spells work to a great extent by interacting with and altering that code. Whilst you do not have unlimited freedom with these changes, it’s impossible to make the spell many times as powerful as before or take away the drawbacks entirely or turn it into an entirely different spell, you can alter many of its’ mechanics and rules to better suit your purposes. Make a shield spell automatically activate in certain conditions or change an elemental spell from controlling fire into one controlling another of the basic elements such as wind or water."
684,,600,[King] Autoturret,Final Fantasy XIV,Magitek,"But each profession experiences a never ending demand for improvement, and as Machinists develop further into the field, they soon realize the limitations of having a single production facility and even the limitations of a single designer and controller.

The [King] Autoturret is a misnomer. It actually has no turret attached, and serves no offensive purpose. However, it serves as a mobile factory, producing out of a fixed design which you provide to it. The synthesis process doesn’t work off of physical materials as you might expect, but rather the magical energy which you provide to the autoturret. Each autoturret that you create and imbue will take a portion of your energy, and in order to create more complex designs, you’ll need to give it more energy.

It might be a little draining, but now you can dedicate yourself to other ventures as your little mobile production facility churns away."
685,,600,Leashed Overlord,Hazbin Hotel,Magitek,"Don't let the bravado and sheer power fool you, some people around here in spite of their might and fearsome reputation, still are stuck in a deal. Still have a leash around their neck. And now you can be the one holding the Leash.

This Item takes the form of an unbreakable deal with a major individual of the Jumps setting. This individual has considerable power and influence, but for one reason or another is stuck obeying your will.

There are some things to consider. For starters this will never be the one at the top of the food chain, only someone of considerable power. Let us take this Jump for example: You could use this Item on Alastor or one of the V’s but not on Charlie, Lucifer, Adam or someone above them in station.

How they feel about the deal is up to your choice. They might hate every minute and would do anything to get out of the deal, or they might actually be pretty content with it."
686,,600,Via Resolutio,Final Fantasy XIII-3,Magitek,"There’s a report attached to this file in the Drop In dossier related to this specific enhancement it seems. After careful analysis of that pink haired girl and her tendency to hop in and out of Nova Chrysalia, we can only conclude that it is a super-advanced form of AMP assisted teleportation.

The report details the researchers’ efforts to determine specifically how the teleportation tendency occurred, but it is the last note that catches your eye. If ever there was a time to say that sufficiently advanced science is no different from magic certainly now would be fitting.

It took multiple trials. More like an extreme amount of trials, but you’ve managed to perfect the “hopping” for yourself. Opening the conduit and moving through was one thing, but when you exited the pocket dimension, you realized you were a ways away, even though you only took a single step. It seems like the pocket dimension isn’t very well aligned with the normal dimension.

The rabbits that you tried to take along with you...unfortunately they’ve just completely disappeared. To be on the safe side, you decide that taking living beings along with you probably isn’t the best idea. Inanimate objects thankfully don’t seem to vanish entirely, they merely vanish momentarily, before reappearing shortly afterwards.

Still, considering how draining it was to open the pathway, you decide that testing further probably isn’t worth it as rigorous testing would take far too much time."
687,,600,Synaptic Spear,The Destiny Universe,Magitek,"A very situational, yet nevertheless useful weapon made by the Cabal through expanding their understanding of Light Suppression technology. The Synaptic Spear is capable of disrupting the Light, but the effect is weak in the material world, and the maximum effect is gained only through complex and narrow situations. For maximum effect, it must be used in a situation in which one Light Bearer is battling another, and is able to inflict such fear upon that Light Bearer that they truly fear they shall die, and must be used in an area already charged with psionic energy, and must be used in conjunction with the ability to psionically enter the mind of the target, should those conditions be met, the spear will manifest within the mind of the target, alongside the target’s own manifestation of their Light. Doing battle with the target in their mind, and defeating them with the spear, will suppress their ability to use the Light in the material world. To wit: It can lobotomize Risen. Although the use case for this is narrow due to its requirements, purchasing this with CP will widen the use case a bit, allowing you to use it in reality and in wider contexts. It will only be effective against paracausal foes, but each strike against them shall weaken their ability to use their powers, and defeating them will suppress these abilities entirely, allowing you to capture or kill them. Like with the Cage Item, in future settings this can be expanded to anyone with powers beyond the ken of mortal men, but unlike the Cage, this is permanent, and cannot be undone. Furthermore, unlike the Cage, this weapon requires defeating the opponent in battle, whereas the Cage could theoretically be used with surprise."
688,,600,The Cage ,The Destiny Universe,Magitek,"Light suppression technology created by the Cabal, the original Cage was a gigantic armature that, when deployed upon the Traveler, was capable of severing its connection to all of its Ghosts, completely depowering all of the Guardians and initiating the Red War. The Häkke weapon foundry secretly acquired fragments of the original Cage, and began studying it for future use. The prototypes were eventually stolen by Psions, who perfected the design into smaller Cages that could be deployed against individual Ghosts, severing their link to the Traveler and rendering their Guardians mortal. For 400 CP, you can acquire a cache of 20 miniature Cages that refresh 24 hours after using the last one; for 600 total CP, you can also acquire the original, enormous Cage that was capable of covering the Traveler. In future settings, the function of your Cages are fiat-backed such that they can be used to lock away the powers of your target, regardless of what their source may be, rendering them as weak and as mortal as any average Human. The full-sized cage, in future settings, can, should one exist or be accessible, be attached to the source of these powers, and resultantly depower anyone that draws power from this source. For convenience’s sake, the full-size Cage can be scaled up or down in size as needed, without sacrificing its higher power."
689,,600,Derma-Circuitry,Miracleman,Magitek,"When you were born in the distant Gulf Worlds, derma-circuitry was implanted beneath your skin. The bioengineering used to produce it was first used to create the black Warpsmiths, who then created the lower castes.

With a mere gesture to activate the biotechnology, you can teleport any person or object to any point in the universe, with a few restrictions. You have to have a clear view of what you’re moving in at least one of your senses, including memory and live footage, and you can’t move anything with more mass than your weight limit. The default caps at roughly that of a small island, but Black Warpsmiths can move entire continents at a time. Anything under your weight limit, roughly that of a small island, can be teleported effortlessly, but trying to go beyond your limit simply doesn’t work. Your derma-circuitry cancels the warp to avoid destroying itself under the strain.

A lesser-used ability of the Warpsmith derma-circuitry is the opening of portals. While less time efficient than teleportation, you do have the ability to set the portals to only admit certain things through. For example, by opening portals to the bottom of a deep-sea trench and only allowing light to pass through, you could watch anything happening there without being blasted by high-pressure water. You’d need a light source, though."
690,,600,The Son Box Armor ,Epic of Leviathan,Magitek,The Son Box Armor as known as the Final Suit is the most powerful suit of armor ever used by the Dark Knight. The Final Suit is made using Metron’s Mobius chair and Element X. This suit is strong enough to survive attacks from some of the strongest beings in the DC multiverse. This suit possesses all of the abilities used by Mother Boxes as well as a number of additional abilities. The two main powers it has are the reactionary adaptation system and the ability to alter minds and shape them to your desires. The reactionary adaptations allowed Batman to easily defeat one of the strongest versions of the Justice League with ease by adjusting to deal with each opponent. The mind altering ability is capable of manipulating beings on a molecular level essentially allowing you to redesign them at will. Batman used this method to create a perfect utopia straight out of his dreams. You will be able to do all of this and potentially more as we have only seen the suit in action for a short period of time.
691,,600,Prometheus’ Spare Workshop ,Scion ,Magitek,"A great basalt box with skylights and black iron pillars from the outside, and a brutalist Greek temple from the inside, this is one of many outposts from which Prometheus has accelerated Muspelheim’s technological standards into a full scale post-industrial revolution compared to the fire giants’ Gigantes and Jotun cousins still basically living in Viking-era halls at best-and literal holes in the ground at worst. Scaled up for a giant, there are gigantic draftsman’s desks, black iron slide rules the size of war clubs and a lot of harried fire giant assistants anxiously awaiting your orders-though as a concession, these tools may be resized on touch for your needs. This particular outpost can be divided into two sections: A massive factory that can produce munitions, firearms, ballistic missiles and even artillery on a scale grand enough to meaningfully contribute to Muspelheim’s war machine-and a more personal atelier full of divine crafter’s tools favoured by the Titan avatar for personal projects. With the right knowledge, this section is the far deadlier side of the workshop; it’s the kind of place from which Prometheus could forge a link of the old chains that bound him and a chip from the mountainside he was imprisoned on into not only a means of compelling or restraining others, but metaphysically binding yourself to that person in order to avoid any effect that would influence a greater being you were part of. Like say, the trinket Prometheus awaits a “worthy bearer” for that would immunise him to the death or binding of Muspelheim as a whole. This is the cradle for the vision of fire-wrought progress that he who earned the title Forge-Cunning among the fire giants would see for the whole world. Perhaps in time, it would even be possible to amplify the devastating effects of nuclear bombs with Muspelheim’s undying flames."
692,,600,Synthetic Duplication ,Final Fantasy XIII-2,Magitek,"The science of synthetic duplication allows for the creation of doppelgangers, simulacrums of their original with a minute fraction of their abilities. Though the energy source required for effective duplication is extreme, and the issue of inserting memories still remains, once established with a continuous energy source it becomes possible to pump out low grade doppelgangers. Unfortunately, these doppelgangers cannot survive the stress of crossing past spatial boundaries and are as such confined to the world they are created in. Additionally, the template required for the doppelganger requires a willing test subject and a sufficiently long amount of analysis to ensure success."
693,,600,Rapid Response Unit - Cavalry -,Final Fantasy XIII,Magitek,"When it is time to make sure nothing survives the sweep – there’s always the Cavalry to call upon.

Three cruiser class airships emerge, raining laser fire over the battlefield in a fifty metre area which you designate by a nifty lighter device that also functions as a laser. It appears that the cruisers are constructs though, because they don’t ever interact with you besides to destroy your target.

Sheesh, Sanctum technology has gone a ways for sure. The constructs weaken however, if you repeatedly use them in succession in the day. Perhaps you need to give the constructs a bit of time to recharge?"
694,,600,Proudclad – Prototype –,Final Fantasy XIII,Magitek,"A prototype model of what will eventually become one of the most notable battlesuits in PSICOM employ. A hidden program was installed in the prototype to help its first trial runs however, and so it can run autonomously.

The AI is a bit quirky, likes to abuse the fact that it carries eight laser cannons, and apparently considers a strafing run a necessary precaution to any enemy group larger than three people.

You could tell the AI to go away, but then it actually seems to sound sad when you do so..."
695,,600,Overload,Final Fantasy XI,Magitek,"Sometimes the power of your automaton is just not enough to finish the job, when the time comes for you to do or die you have an answer. You can cause your automaton or really any machine you control to temporarily gain a massive power boost making its abilities skyrocket twice to even three times as much as the would bormally be for a short period of time. For a few moments, from minutes to an hour depending on how much of an increase the automaton recieves, your automaton will be able to accomplish things that would normally be impossible for it. Of course such a skill must come with a downside, your machine will overheat after use and be unable to use this skill again for at least a day though it will still be able to work as normal during this cool down period."
696,,600,"PROTOTYPE Ω, “THE ANCIENT COUNTERMEASURE”         ",Final Fantasy X,Magitek,"Not much is known about this machina to be honest. From what we do know of it, it may be a sufficient counter to beasts of massive size – and seems to be designed specifically to counter monsters of significant magical prowess and size. You’ll note that these are only blueprints – making the actual machine is going to be a challenge you’ll have to tackle yourself.

Not unlike the Panzer unit, its main armament is a cannon, though its control scheme is...very strange to say the least. All we can really gather is that the ancients considered musical instruments as valid control devices. The machine itself is massive however – so it can easily serve as a mobile attack and defence platform. If you would consider the Panzer to be a tank sized machina, this monstrosity is essentially a flying battle cruiser. At least with all of its autonomous defence lasers you won’t have to worry at all about its safety!

Be wary of one thing – the destruction guarantee only applies to a single unit built from this blueprint – and the whole “identify friend/foe malfunction” that plagued it? Well, you’re probably going to want to attach an IFF system onboard. There are still plenty of secrets to be discovered with this monster...so good luck."
697,,600,Garment Grid Reformatting,Final Fantasy X,Magitek,"Don’t care about adding additional sphere slots, and you simply want to have more connections? While this doesn’t have a substantial effect on the other garment grids, with the [JC] variation this has a very substantial effect of doubling the amount of connections – and also doubling the number of effects that you can choose by changing the garment grid configuration from its default configuration to the following configuration:

This shifts the number of connections/jumps from 4 to 8, and also allows you to select up to 8 effects rather than the basic choice of 4. You still have to actually make each jump between the dress spheres to activate the effects of course.

698,,600,1000 Years After...,Final Fantasy X,Magitek,"There are those who have come to understand the potential that rests within the Farplane – and so it shouldn’t come as a surprise that there are those who have chosen to initiate research into this energy. The timing isn’t quite right, the research is still under wraps, but there will be development...it’s not in human nature to leave such things undisturbed.

Considering all the energy that rests within the Farplane, within that stream of energy you could see as Life itself, sooner or later someone will consider harvesting it. The equipment for such practices will be largely experimental – but you’ll be able to put it together with sufficient time and effort...allowing to pull life energy out of the world around you. Perhaps...enough energy to even put down a creature like Sin, provided you had a way to channel it."
699,,600,Aura Transfer Machine,RWBY,Magitek,"Ah now this is an interesting piece of technology. These chambers are able to drain Aura from one being and store it or transfer it to another. Maybe ethically questionable but Pietro did manage to create Penny with this kind of procedure. Not to mention that it would have been able to transfer the Maiden Powers of the Fall Maiden to Pyrrha. You get two of these chambers one to drain one to receive.

This USB-Stick holds all knowledge and plans on the procedure that made Penny and of the manipulation of Aura into synthetic, sentient beings, alongside notes of Pietro himself on the creation of his daughter. Perhaps in time, you will be able to replicate this feat, of giving souls to the soulless and creating such marvels of technology that Penny was.

701,,600,Amity Arena,RWBY,Magitek,"Amity Colosseum is a marvel of technology, flying proudly as a symbol of the 4 Kingdoms unity and created to hold the battles for the Vytal Festival. Crafted with resources from all of Remnant, it is a humongous Arena, capable of holding hundreds of spectators with ease.

The fighting itself takes place in a large octagonal which is capable of changing its environment into several different ""biomes"", including grasslands, forest, fire and ice, geyser fields, stormy mountains, desert, an ocean and beach with a wooden ship, and a few others. The arena also has artificial weather effects, such as thunderstorms and an artificial sun, as well as being able to raise platforms with gravity dust functions. The central part remains the same regardless of the biome. Any spectators are protected by a force field of hard light dust from stray shots (or visiting Nevermores). You gain your own version of this Arena, to train and perhaps hold your own Festivals. Any training you do in this Arena will be more effective than it otherwise would be and you can even launch ‘simulations’ of opponents you encountered in your Journey to practice against. Dying won't be an issue either as long as no party actually wants the other to die, or it's only against a simulation."
702,,600,Atlesian Genius,RWBY,Magitek,"With Dust truly marvels of technology are possible but it would all be pointless junk if no one ever came up with the idea on what to do. Now you are one of the individuals in Remnant, gifted with an incredibly intellect like Arthur Watts and Pietro Polendina. You could hack yourself into advanced Kingdoms, create prosthetics that seamlessly function and work with their wielder without dampening their capabilities, come up with machines of War like the Paladins or perhaps even the process of transferring Aura to humanoid robots and give them such developed AI they are impossible to tell apart from a normal person. The wonders of science and technology this world offers are open to you Jumper."
703,,600,Forge Born,Knight’s and Magic,Magitek,"You were made to make Giant Robots and Levitate Ships. You are now immune to heat and fire, making forges a much less dangerous environment for you. Your ability to shape metal and craft machines have reached a major boost almost like you’ve been blessed by Hephaestus. Your greatest talent, however, is making Giant Mecha or Airships and being able to upgrade them to do things that don’t seem possible to anyone except you. You can give your Mechas or Airships abilities based magics from other worlds. The greater care and higher quality materials the better your mechas or airships performance is. This caps out at 1000x better compared to those made out of the same materials."
704,,600,Sufficiently Analyzed Magic,Final Fantasy VIII,Magitek,"If magic is a science, then why can't you research ways to replicate it? With this and the example of the renowned Dr. Odine (he sure is prolific), you've made an astonishing breakthrough. With just a little application of science, you're capable of building a device that can harness almost any kind of energy using wearable devices to produce your own brand of para-magic. Want to cast spells using friction, explosions, or nuclear power? All are possible, and you're even capable of storing the spells made from this energy for later use. Of course, the strength of the magic depends entirely on how much energy you can produce, and it takes more than just a thought and a wish to harness energy into magic. You'll have to put in some good, honest work and study to figure out how it works, and how it can be used to create your own system of magic. The resulting spells you can create depend on the energy harvested too, for good or for ill. Expect explosion magic to tend towards large explosions of force, and magic created from water power to manipulate that element or the energy of waves, for example. It can be a boon or a curse, though creativity could be used to utilize this aspect to its full potential and power or mitigate the drawbacks of it. It's a long and difficult road full of countless hours in books and labs, but what kind of scientist would have it any other way?"
705,,600,A Doll: Refitted Sword        ,Avesta of Black and White,Magitek,"An android, almost indistinguishable from a regular human besides some of her interior parts. Similar to Quinn, this is another creation of the Forge of Ruin made in the image of Ahura Mazda, the Divine Blade. But while Quinn didn't know of her original capabilities, this android is fully aware of her true nature, and this one seems to have been prepared more for combat than for connecting with others.

She is capable of freely switching between her existence as an android that doesn't really require any of the attentions of a human, and a replica of the Divine Blade, a holy weapon that carries the trait of immutability, making it basically indestructible. Not only that, but she also increases her wilder’s power and their skill with the blade immensely.

This blade is however special from its other versions. It seems that she has been designed specially with you in mind. Not only she herself seems to be completely devoted to you, albeit her personality is still being developed, but her prayer collecting capabilities have been switched to gathering strength from the number of your followers. The more people that follow and believe in you, regardless of their alignment or intentions, the stronger you become while wielding the blade, increasing even further the previous boost in power.

Even if the blade or her human avatar was somehow destroyed, you could always get a new vessel for it by just grabbing another sword of high craftsmanship. At that point, it would gain all the capabilities of the Divine Blade, for her true essence rests inside you. As such, she doesn’t count as a companion even in her human form and can be taken with you as a follower, albeit if you wish you may import her as a companion, changing that."
706,,600,Man Made World,Fate/Grand Order,Magitek,"When Nikola Tesla took the secret of lightning to humanity, he spat in the face of Gods and Magicians alike. He had taken the divine and made it mundane for the sake of humanity and that act gave him genuine, immense power. While some may point how the ridiculousness of his science becoming supernatural, one can’t ignore the power that technology gained, especially against the supernatural. You are a true creator in the same vein as Tesla himself now. The technology you create is supernaturally empowered, becoming more and more so the wider spread your technology is in the world you are in and the more your technology advances that world. If you created and spread around the world the secret of electricity, which revolutionised the entire world, you would then be able to create electrical devices that allowed you to do battle with even some of the mightiest Servants in history. Your technology is also imbued with even greater power than normal when used against Divine opponents, as the Gods seem to have an innate aversion to the progress you bring.

Boosted: Your inventions and the changes they brought to the world are unforgettable. Why should being away from your great efforts cut you off from their benefit? The impressions you leave behind are so great that your technology boost from the base perk is no longer limited to the current world and time that you are in. Even being in a different world or a time before you made your inventions doesn’t remove your boost, as it is now judged from the total weight of the changes you have made over your lifetime rather than that of the world you are in.

707,,600,Gear-Clad Indoctrinator,Library of Ruina: HamHamPangPang,Magitek,"A researcher once had an idea, the people in the City all seem to lack purpose, they just go through their lives clueless to the suffering all around them like they’re gears, just spinning for their assigned purpose. He was killed by the Black Silence during his rampage, but the scientist’s work lives on, both through his daughter picking up from where he left, and you with the fruits of his labor. This is a chair, perhaps reminiscent of one you can see in a hair salon with a device on an arm going on top of someone’s head, though this doesn’t dry your hair of course, it’s the City after all. Instead, the person sitting in the chair will be killed and converted into a gear, which can be surgically attached to another person to empower them, with the chair being able to perform the process. Most people become meat gears that enhance physical strength in the user or an ally, while more intelligent people become thought gears that grant better intellect, reaction times, and psychic abilities in larger quantities. Gears can be individually removed and attached to different people, though they can also be destroyed by physical methods and break quickly if attacked."
708,,600,Extirpation Equipment        ,Library of Ruina: HamHamPangPang,Magitek,"The Claws can be seen as the brutality of the City made manifest, imposing masked figures with strange and extremely powerful technology at their beck and call. Sent by a shadowy organization to kill anyone they deem a threat or whoever dares to challenge their authority, be it a random Backstreets resident just trying to survive or a rogue Wing trying to upend the City’s order.

You might or might not be among the ranks of the Head’s executioners, but you have the equipment of one regardless, and thankfully without the Head knowing, most obviously is the massive clawed arm that can tear through even Singularity based armors and the mask which nullifies a single powerful strike before needing to recharge, more importantly, the augments within you are of a quality to which even colors will have trouble keeping up with your might and speed. A pack of three injectors though is probably the greatest weapon in your arsenal; the orange injector, Serum R, gives you a massive burst of speed and adrenaline; the green injector, Serum K, heals you to a point where using one on the brink of death will have you at about halfway to peak condition; and the blue one, Serum W, will give you the ability to break through dimensional spaces and teleport for a short while, catching any targets off guard and forcefully pulling them through spatial rifts if they survive. Injecting all three Serums at once creates a cocktail with the effects of all three, healing you while giving a massive burst of energy and dimension tearing power, but injections can be interrupted by taking too much damage while using one, and being stopped will leave you vulnerable for a few seconds, the serums recharge in a few minutes of being used and each vial can store enough for about 5 doses each."

A Corp’s Arbiters are infused with enough singularities to the point where they can use them at will, specifically they focus on nullifying the abilities of their enemies by removing enhancement effects or throwing off their focus by sheer power. Some of the singularities they have access to are:

F Corp’s Fairy which makes slashes in the air and works as a skeleton key while also attaching onto people to cause more damage,

J Corp’s Lock which works on people’s minds or conceptual ideas, as well as making chains, pillars, and massive shockwaves, don’t feel limited by these singularities, there is a list of them in the notes. You get access to 5 singularities with each purchase, note that these are only weaponized versions of the singularities so it’s impossible to reverse engineer them or apply them in less damaging ways.

Beholders on the other hand are B Corp’s surveillance specialists, who are capable of remotely viewing and otherwise sensing places across the City, they are also used to remove Impurities by relocating them into the Outskirts with capabilities of teleporting massive structures across multiple districts. You can pick either the abilities of an Arbiter or Beholder and another purchase gives you the other one or an extra 5 singularities if you already picked an Arbiter’s power.

713,,600,Neon Genesis Mechamaru,Jujutsu Kaisen,Magitek,"A giant, mechanical cursed corpse, coated in thick metal armour and standing dozens of metres tall. This one functions a bit differently from most, though: instead of acting autonomously or controlled from a distance, the user pilots this cursed energy-powered mecha from a cockpit inside of its head. It’s incredibly easy to use, too: just through your intent and pulling a few levers, you can manoeuvre as if it were an extension of yourself.

Its physical abilities are incredible, as could be expected of a construct of its size. Its strong enough to shatter dams of solid stone and leave great craters in the wake of its every punch, tough enough to tank several blows of that same level of strength before its armour starts breaking, and fast enough to bound and sprint across the land with surprising speed, all without any expenditure of energy. When one does begin to use cursed energy, though? It becomes capable of feats far beyond this, most often in the form of beams of concentrated cursed energy. At its absolute greatest, its able to fire off multiple blasts of energy at once that home in on their target, each of which has the power to completely obliterate vast swathes of land wherever they hit, and are on par with a special grade sorcerer’s output.

Of course, this consumes enormous amounts of cursed energy, enough that your average sorcerer wouldn’t even be able to fire one without a good year or more of preparation. Fortunately, even if you don’t have ridiculous levels of cursed energy to power it, this mecha’s reserves have already been topped up with huge amounts of the stuff, enough to fire off over a dozen blasts before running out. This energy recharges to full at the end of each year.

It does have one extra feature on top of this: four tubes that can be manually loaded from the cockpit, then fired from the mecha’s hand like shells. These tubes are charges imbued with a cursed technique, which activates as soon as it makes contact with something. By default, these are loaded with Simple Domain, allowing them to injure the very soul of those they strike, though you may imbue them with a technique of your own, or that of one of your allies. These charges likewise replenish after a year, though you can make more if you wish."
714,,600,Under a Microscope,Final Fantasy VII,Magitek,"The source of most of this world's grief lies with, you guessed it, Shinra. It was Shinra who discovered the Planet's very own life force could be harnessed into an easily accessible and potent power source, long-term consequences be damned. You have taken a page from this playbook, able to harness 'natural' and magical energies from the world and even the souls of other living beings into a usable energy source, several times more potent than regular-old electricity generators. This can also include genetic modification by using a dead creature as a template, or modifying living beings through this same energy.

Even if you have no interest in discovering your own variant, you also know how to extract Mako from a living planet, bleeding the world itself just to power your own sciences...or your coffee machines. However, if you're willing to go the extra mile, you can learn to make 'safe' substitutes for these energies by increasing its efficiency through experimentation, making it so comparatively small doses of Mako could power as much as a standard Reactor...or you could double down and work to bleed the world dry within a single generation. The possibilities are truly endless."
715,,600,The Machine,Final Fantasy VII,Magitek,"You know how to build the robots. Really, that's the core of what this offers. You were likely an employed scientist or engineer for Shinra, knowing how to build their computer technology, weapons, and their automated robots and assembly lines. They can function with a fairly simple AI, though they often lack sentience or complex problem-solving skills. With time, you can eventually make things like brainscans of living individuals to preserve their knowledge and personality, or construct weapons on the same scope as the Junon Cannon. You may even surpass what Shinra has built, someday...though I suggest finding another power source."

It also comes with most basic construction materials in an unlimited quantity, but you’ll have to use external resources if you want to mass produce something made of a rare or magical metal.

The best part? There’s no Will of the Pseudo-Honkai Energy, so you don’t have to worry about Pseudo-Herrschers popping up, and neither do you have to worry about Honkai Beasts with this generator. So, even if you generate a star’s worth of pseudo-Honkai Energy, you won’t accidentally summon a horde of Judgment-Class Honkai Beasts to its location."

Similar, yet different, from the ‘keys’ that Herrscher inherently possess themselves at times. Somehow, you’ve found one of these legendary relics. You may, within reason, design your own key, or choose an existing one, but if you do, keep in mind that there may be complications with the key of choice either due to a side effect or drawback, or simply that others might recognize the key."

Creator of the Divine Keys, the ICHOR augmentation system, Stigmatas, and... Frankly, quite a lot of things even Schicksal’s best minds can’t so much as decipher. Dr. MEI’s genius was, and still is, unrivaled to this very day. It may not have been enough to save her era, nor herself, but it was enough to ensure that there even was a tomorrow for humanity, and that they had warriors that could stand up to even a Herrscher, even for a short while.

Well, maybe that ‘unrivaled’ part is untrue.

Whether by random luck, or a secret preservation project, you have inherited the ingenuity and brilliance of Fire Moth’s greatest mind. Only one man comes even remotely close, and that man already has to juggle running a massive international organization alongside his own sinister plans. As for someone like you, you have a clarity that can revolutionize the technology of today, and perhaps even reclaim some of humanity’s lost progress. Do not mistake this for a perfect mind, however. There are still some projects even she couldn’t complete, nor even stomach.

Boosted: Now we’re talking! You’re an even greater genius scientist than Dr. MEI, being able to complete projects that she can’t even comprehend with effortless ease. Even the Divine Keys look as simplistic as what an unskilled amateur would make, and you can create replicas of them out of literal scrap (okay, maybe not quite as extreme as churning out an advanced armored mech-suit while in a cave with a box of scraps) in a matter of hours, instead of requiring a Herrscher Core and months of work just to create a single Key. Hell, you’ll probably be more than a match for the Sky People after a decade or so of refining your technological ability.

Demonstrated abilities include locking an opponent’s movements, concocting a solid pillar and launching it as a projectile, and covering opponents in painful “fairies” who open up wounds, making bleeding much worse.

With just water, fire, and a copious amount of gears, this castle employs amenities like no others. Except the original, of course. Fans provide heating and cooling capable of keeping the castle comfortable even in the heat of a desert. It also has piston driven lifts for those disinterested in stairs.

However, the Steamwork Castle harbors a secret that few would believe. With a flick of a switch, the side wings of the castle pull themselves against the main building. A second switch then causes the entire castle to dive below the ground. It is highly suggested you ensure everyone you want to stay alive to take shelter inside. Once underground, the mechanisms allow you to move the entire castle as if it were some sort of clockwork mole. It’s not the fastest traveller and it moves most easily through loose soil, but it can remain underground for days at a time before the oxygen starts to run out.

Engels are not just giant robots. At their base, they are a mixture of Human and monster DNA. Once grown, they are festooned with cybernetics, weapons and armor. One advantage over mecha is that they regenerate from damage that they take. For another, each Engel is equipped with A-pods for flight, melee attacks, and a plasma cannon. Finally, they have their own instincts, which means both that reaction times are faster, and when a pilot is knocked unconscious, the Engel can continue to act.

The ARAL and the AUPHAN are reconnaissance Engels. Both have excellent sensor suites, but are lightly armed for Engels. The ARAL also has a stealth system and a Grav Bomb, which can weaken enemies in an area. The AUPHAN has enhanced flight speed.

The TARSHISH and MALACH are battle Engels. Both have rocket pods. The MALACH has a sword. The TARSHISH has a lightning gun and is resistant to heat.

The SERAPH is a super-heavy Engel. It has a charge beam (a powerful, slow cycling energy attack) and rocket pods and is resistant to cold.

The SHINNAN is a battle Engel. It has two charge beams, but lacks the plasma cannon that other Engels all have.

731,,600,Playing with Syringes        ,Library of Ruina,Magitek,"And just as concerning to find you playing with, the toys of the Claw. Did they fall off the truck which brought you here, or did you steal them? Either way, you have the somewhat weaker, if more versatile, signature gear of the feared Claw Corporation: A set of full body, high grade armor of woodesque material (seemingly of a new make which does not need integration into the body), and a gauntlet that reaches down your dominant arm before ending in the titular claw, able to extend an energy blade similar to those used by R-Corp. All of this is, as the work of a Claw demands, of the finest make of any weapon in the city barring the truly great, such as weaponized Singularities or the stronger results of the E.G.O phenomenon. 

However, with a thought you can inject one of three singularity derived serums mounted on the armor and benefit from their effects, which certainly make up for any comparative deficiencies in material science. However, one without (purchase included) specialized augmentations uses these serums, they will rapidly degrade internally due to the concentration and singular nature, and burn from the inside out, dying shortly without significant medical intervention;

The Blue serum, or Serum W, is the most directly damaging, drawing on the Singularity of W corp to tear repeated portals through space before looping back to your origin. Dragging an opponent through these rapid tears inflicts incredible damage, as their body is warped internally by the rapid fluctuations in space and time process, and shredded by the edges of broken reality. Despite its weakness of being quite one use, a singular burst of short range teleportation is also possible once the main effect has passed, though this isn’t capable of much offense, only affecting you. 

The Orange Serum, or Serum R, is less directly offensive, but has greater staying power, granting a vicious and longer lasting strength through causing the rapid division of cells, pushing your body into a burst of short term survival of the fittest combined with the serum replacing what’s overexerted, until burning out in a few minutes. 

The last given with this is the Green serum, Serum K, a cocktail of healing nanomachines injected into the body to repair the user's physiological trauma rapidly enough to heal enough damage to kill a man without the Cities countless augments thrice over. 

After all three have been used a Tri-Serum cocktail can be formed within the body, allowing a flurry of devastating strikes using the last dregs in your system... 

With this purchase, you have enough of a replenishing supply to use these once a day each week. However, if this seems insufficient for your tastes, you seem to have something very important, and perhaps dangerous to own: The C-Corp Singularity based means to produce these vials from other Singularities, and the byproducts of similarly physics-violating, perhaps even maddening technology. Be careful who you let see you use these. As you well know by now, the Head’s very touchy about these things."
732,,600,Singular Weapons,Library of Ruina,Magitek,"...there’s no question as to what this is, the black-and-gold trim of an Arbiter is nothing if not memorable. The material alone eclipses the protective qualities of even Nuovo fabric, and while somewhat weakened in comparison to the real thing, this gear allows for the creation of energy projectiles that range from the weighty pillars of Binah to the lithe, thorny lines of Zena. Either type give seasoned colors pause, even if only through the sheer shock each strike I nflicts on the body and its faculties. 

But that alone could never be why the sight of an Arbiter is as good as a death knell. That shared honor falls down to the fact that these patterns mark you as someone who wields the might of dual Singularities in battle; a might you can partake in. Since an Arbiter is more akin to an assassin than a soldier, the Singularities they hold may very well change from mission to mission depending on the expected opposition, so you may choose to take any two Singularities from Wings past or present to use for the entirety of the jump, so long as the result is weaponizable and makes sense. 

To use a pertinent example of how an Arbiter would use their Singularities, Binah’s foray into L Corp led to her using Fairies and J Corp Locks in order to instigate a mass breakout of abnormalities (though other circumstances would waive this requirement) and lock down the facility to prevent employees escaping. In addition, the combat applications of unlocking skin to cause hemorrhages with movement, and locking down muscles to prevent movement were especially effective against the explosive combat style of the Red Mist. 

Another configuration could utilize G Corp’s Singularity alongside that of the L Corp that started the Smoke Wars should you be facing a crowd, as the force of gravity and caustic fumes are indiscriminate in their predations. Should you be facing one big, strong opponent - a Beast perhaps - you could use the Singularities of K Corp and P Corp, using the normally medicinal nanomachines to turn their flesh poisoned and cancerous while keeping yourself protected through the same methods that keep the Shelter from the 27th of March so impregnable. 

The Singularities given for use are heavily blackboxed, as is to be expected. The Head would be loath to let them be used for anything other than their intended purpose. But it would be a shame if these prizes were to lose their lustre, thus in future jumps the power of the Singularities will scale to match that of the highest quality weapons in the setting produced by humans as long as the seal hasn’t been tampered with. At least as long as their nature is nominally scientific rather than magical or psychological. You may also change which two Singularities are in use at the start of each year, in order to target a different foe. Unless, again, the black box is opened. Just be careful with this, it would be a rare few who wouldn’t take notice of someone dressed like an Arbiter."
733,,600,Workshop Membership,Library of Ruina,Magitek,"Workshops, or Ateliers as they’re sometimes known, are vital parts of any City organization, no matter that each is nominally or factually independent of them; without a workshop to manufacture and sell arms, armor and all manner of devices everything from Grade 9 Offices to the Five Fingers would fold like paper. Of course both sorts go to different types of workshops, as while there are countless smaller establishments ready and willing to cater to the masses, there are far fewer ready to cater to a more demanding and well paying type of clientele. Those of the highest calibre may even limit their buyers through memberships, letting a mere few peruse their wares. 

Only the richest and most influential can find membership in the best workshops, you might not necessarily fit this category but in your hands is a formal looking sheaf of papers that denotes your membership to an Atelier no one else has heard of entirely staffed by animated teddy bears - all legally distinct from a similar Atelier in District 14 - who take orders from you as their sole client. 

Assuming nothing untoward occurs, the bears will produce eleven pieces of gear per week. This might not seem like much, but not only are the bears and their assembly lines uncannily efficient with the barest scraps of material, what they produce is invariably of the highest quality anything unassisted by EGO or a Singularity can achieve; family members could and do kill each other over such masterworks. 

The quantity produced rarely slows down either, so with enough time you could equip an army with exosuits with enough strength to punch through tanks, or lances that repeatedly detonate explosive payloads in opponents without compromising their own construction. Your workshop is even one of those lucky few with a firearms licence, so recreating and improving on the armor piercing, burning and freezing ammunition types of the Thumb is not out of the question. 

The bears also double as security for the workshop facility itself, as these teddy bears lack vital organs and sport enough strength to crush skulls in their fuzzy paws. Your workshop will follow you to future worlds, updating its designs and documentation to keep up with local weaponry and the regulations that allow their production. Even in locales with harsh controls on armaments they always seem to find a way."
734,,600,EGO Machine        ,Library of Ruina,Magitek,"A perfected version of the research of a former associate of Lobotomy Corporation, this machine draws in the volatile forms of Light emanating from those progressing towards distortion, and concentrates them. This has the effect of reducing the impact of their fears and traumas upon their thought process, but more importantly it refines and concentrates the Light, creating armor and weapons themed after the polluted mindsets it takes in. These items are more akin to the EGO of Lobotomy Corporation, allowing one to wield them with no prior training, so long as their mental fortitude is great enough to overcome the embodied trauma. These weapons lack the potential for growth of a personal EGO, shorn as they are of context and stripped from their originator. Still, with enough trauma and loss, one could even make EGOs equivalent to those of Lobotomy Corporation’s Alephs. 

As a side note, whereas the original machines were less than healthy for those they were used on, these ones do have safeties to ensure that those used as fuel for the device will remain fully cognizant. Of course, if those safeties were to be disengaged, the process would be somewhat more efficient."

But what you can be sure of is the use of this silver saucer. You yourself are perfectly comfortable inside of it, even as it rains down destructive flames, powerful enough to incinerate an army. It can also take the form of a Silver Torus and be used akin to a bike if that is more your style, still able to summon down the barrage of light beams."
737,,600,A Forge of Great Renown,Godbound,Magitek,"This iron bulb can expand into a mighty, citadel- sized forge that draws raw materials from the depths of the earth. At will the entire complex can be folded up back into the seed by its rightful owner, even safely coiling around any living beings within. It contains a great many lost forms of artifice and engineering from the Former Empires, including the facilities necessary to design and craft godwalkers: Large theotechnological war machines piloted by a mortal. These machines allow mortals to even match godbound and divine monsters, though they require being ‘recharged’ with the unique chakra generated at this Forge depending on how intensively they’re used, how large their battery capacity is and how well designed their chakra engines are. Less glamorous conveyer belts also provide excellent facilities for producing theotechnological cybernetics or clockworks, though the greatest prize lies in the most securely locked vaults found within: The blueprints for several different makes of Made Gods. Needless to say the sorcery, components and test subjects needed for these procedures are all precious by this world’s current standard but there are also many volumes of the theory for such complex constructs’ theotechnological basis."
738,,600,Fundamentals,The Owl House,Magitek,"While most of the Boiling Isles’ inhabitants practice magic the traditional way, a few have found a newer, more powerful method. The basis of this knowledge can be seen in the Potion Coven’s alchemy, which blends magic and chemistry to create stable, reproducible magical effects. But Emperor Belos hoards other secrets that provide even greater power. Both the harvesting of magic directly from local fauna and the strange technology that defends Belos’ castle show that much can be accomplished by combining modern cunning with ancient arcane knowledge.

Now, you too can blend science with sorcery. Whether you are brewing alchemical concoctions, harvesting biological material from magical creatures, or merging magic with your own technology, you’ll accomplish far more than any single discipline would allow. This WILL get the attention of the Emperor if you’re not careful, so try to keep your head down. In future worlds, you’ll find similar ways of melding new magic systems with your existing understanding of science."
739,,600,Dear Doctor,Hellsing Ultimate Abridged,Magitek,"What kind of sick, twisted community college gave you your degree? Careful study and copious amounts of experimentation has turned you into a genius when it comes to modifying existing biology. Whether you’re building cybernetic kill-switches into your minions, grafting unholy abilities onto your foot soldiers, or pushing the limits of what can be accomplished by blending technology and the occult, few can match your intellect. Unfortunately, we’re going on Naruto rules here, so there is a bit of a trade-off when it comes to quality and quantity. Want to outfit your entire army with the powers of the damned? You’ll need to water those powers down first. Want to turn your boss into an immortal biomechanical statement on transhumanism? You’ll probably only manage the operation once or twice."
740,,600,Doktor Jumper ,Hellsing,Magitek,"No longer an assistant, you’re a peer to the good Doktor in his greatest achievements. A genius, of course, but it is the science of the supernatural that allowed the Doktor to guide Millennium into the undead force it is tonight. The fields of supernatural biology and unnatural physics are your darlings, where advancing science and humanity as a whole becomes ever so easy. Using traces of a true vampire’s blood to create an army of enhanced artificial vampires might take a few years of experimentation but it remains more than possible. Immortality, mutated creations, even the use of unnatural plagues and biological weapons like the ghouls. 

These secrets unveil to your gleaming eyes, particularly so when you have a subject from which to attempt to directly understand and remake many supernatural traits or abilities. The work may often be messy and require much in the way of human resources but for the sake of humanity, it is worth it. Additionally, it appears that such extensive study of the life sciences taught you to be quite the good cook, especially when it comes to meat. Practicing your steak searing must’ve been quite the strange way to pass the time in the laboratory."
741,,600,Holy Warrior,Hellsing,Magitek,"Though their faith remains strong, the Vatican is well aware of the need to keep up with the changing times. At least, when it comes to the destruction of heathens, heretics and monsters. Both holy blessings and the miracles of science have gone into enhancing your form, turning you into a crusader against even the foulest demons of this world. 

Your body has been greatly empowered, such that only a werewolf would have greater strength and speed than you, while also gaining natural regenerative abilities. A bullet through the head heals in moments without trouble, even losing a limb or chunks of your skull take seconds before being fully restored. The process has left you almost tireless, able to fight without rest for days with ease, and your aging has slowed enough that even fifty years passing shows no signs of getting older. The same blessings that empower your body directly also transfer to your blows and the weapons you wield. As if soaked in water blessed by the Pope himself, you burn and smite unholy creatures with righteous power, even more than what your incredible physical strength might indicate. 

As a crusader like Anderson, you also have a similar level of experience in the field. While you are not a soldier skilled in a hundred different specialisations or an eastern warrior with superhuman martial arts, you can still brawl and throwdown well enough to take on almost any equal foe. Your honed instincts, combat experience and talent for beating things to death with your bare hands and anything tough enough to swing around leaves you a deadly foe even for a ancient vampire or elder werewolf."
742,,600,Time Machine,Wizards of Waverly Place,Magitek,"A time travel mechanism that allows Wizards to travel back or forward in time. You will need to set the date you want to travel to, and then pull the cord, just be mindful, changes to the timeline could be unpredictable, and you might end up causing drastic changes, such as renaming high five to Max, or less important changes like forgetting your best friend in the past."
743,,600,The Praying Gargoyle ,Atlantis - The Lost Empire,Magitek,"Well, this is a bit different- I’m not even really sure if you should be allowed to have this, but I suppose an exception can be made. This is a relic known as the Stone Gargoyle, a relic allegedly made from the skin of an actual Gargoyle- or Gorlois, as the Atlanteans call them- with an Atlantean crystal at its core. The sorcery imbued in the statue during its creation has given it the ability to animate stone gargoyles- as in, the statues, not the species- as mindless servants, wholly obedient to their masters, in much the same way that the Heart of Atlantis animates its stone guardians to defend the city. Allegedly, the Praying Gargoyle can work its magic over an entire city the size of Paris- which, if you consider the number of gargoyles on Notre Dame alone that will be converted into nigh-indestructible stone juggernauts, this could be quite useful in the right or wrong hands."
744,,600,Sorcerer/Scientist ,Atlantis - The Lost Empire,Magitek,"The art of creating, or even using, much of the technology that Atlanteans once took for granted in the past has been lost to the ages- a byproduct of the sudden shift from technologically advanced conquerors, to survivors huddling in the ruins of their former empire. The great upheaval, leading to the deaths of many by flood waters- and in the period of starvation that ensued- along with the king sealing away the Heart of Atlantis has led to the inescapable loss of the Atlantean written language. But not everyone forgets so easily. Although Kida was too young to have much of an understanding of Atlantean technology at her age, you have the knowledge that she lacks. Primitive looking and yet sophisticated on the inside, Atlantean technology is hewn from stone, metal, and crystal. The ability to fly at speeds that would put a bi-plane to shame are the least of what you can expect; beams of disintegrating energy and vast mechanical monsters that are best measured in miles may be created by you; the only issue is the matter of how you will power such things in large numbers… Although the Crystal Necklaces that Atlanteans possess will still work in future worlds, an alternative source of energy will likely be required for any sort of mass production."
745,,600,Genius Intellect ,Rapunzel’s Tangled Adventure,Magitek,Your intellect is expanded into the top percentile allowing you to learn new methodologies and principles at an astonishing rate and to adapt magic and scientific principles from one to the other or merge them when necessary for even greater creations. You could potentially perform feats of creation like building portals to other dimensions like Demanitus did to trap Zhan Tiri to imprison her within a netherworld-like dimension called the Lost Realm.
746,,600,The Mad Doctor,Disney Villains Victorious,Magitek,"They called you mad, and they were right - but they can’t call you stupid, no sir. Especially not when it works. You’re able to “fuse” physical objects and living creatures through mad science and near-mystical procedures, using a lot of ingenuity and engineering to make these hybrids work, even when they shouldn’t otherwise."
747,,600,Pentagram Tesseract,Marvel Britain,Magitek,"A techno-magical marvel, this is a cage that can hold anything. No matter the strength, physical, mystical or otherwise. If you can trick or force something into this pentagram that exists as a tesseract across multiple dimensions it will be trapped until you choose to release it. This prison has contained things like a Lord of Hell without strain, and could contain anything as long as it enters the prison."
748,,600,Last Action Hero ,Symphogear,Magitek,"So you want to be the Last Action Hero? Like Dr. Ver, one of your arms has now been injected with the Nephilim’s cell, granting you the that special arm and all its power. However, rather than just reprogramming heretical technology, you’re able to innately control just about any sufficiently advanced or supernatural technology, even if you don’t understand how it works. With this, you can become the worst kind of hero."
749,,600,Science and Sorcery,Marvel Magic,Magitek,"Ordinarily magic and science are anathema to one another. Magic is not so simple or subservient that it can be mapped out with laws and hypotheses and will often take offense to attempts to do so, spitefully refusing to cooperate just as you think you're beginning to understand. For you, however, this is an entirely different story. Not only do you find it easy to mimic the effects of technology with magic or vice-versa, but you are talented at melding the two together into something more than the sum of its parts."
750,,600,Raised By Witches,Marvel: What If...?,Magitek,"An upbringing among Frigga’s coven has left you with insight and power like no other. Whether you’re manipulating dark matter to transmute creatures or crafting illusions and communications, others would be forgiven for calling you a witch. Of course, you also have a grasp of the more mundane aspects of Asgardian “magic.” Hyper-advanced technology, such as the Bifrost and the Soul Forge, are well within your capabilities to construct, so long as you have the resources. Will you guard these ancient secrets greedily, or will you share them with all who would learn?"
751,,600,Occult Sciences,Marvel Noir,Magitek,"There are forces that science has not named, or tamed. But that won’t stop you, nor does that mean there is not power in these forces. You will let others play their occult games, though, after all true power comes from combining the occult with the scientific. And you are dangerously skilled at that.

You understand how to incorporate occult objects into your technology, and how to use technology to interface with them. This isn’t a perfect science, and can be rather dangerous, but you could build machines which interface with magical objects; being powered by them, weaponizing their energies, or even forcing them to function in ways that they were never intended to be used such as forcing a spider totem which normally bestows spider powers on those the spider god finds worthy to bestow bee powers to someone you designate. Just be careful as this can have side effects; Madame Swarm was physically and visibly mutated to be half bee instead of merely obtaining the powers of bees when she tried it. And this will require you to do the legwork, to research the object, and scientific methods to interact with it; this isn’t instant understanding, but the power to force magical objects to interface with science in ways they otherwise would not."
752,,600,The Bone Machine,Marvel 2099,Magitek,"This is a room sized occultech machine into which skulls can be plugged into as input, with an output that generally goes into someone’s head. This can be used to communicate with the spirits of the attached skulls, or even use them as an external source of magical energy.

The machine comes with a collection of sorcerer skulls dating back up to 3000 years willing to give you advice and share their knowledge in exchange for you carrying on their work. By default their work was fighting evil sorcerers, but if you’d prefer another mission for them you can select one. You can add more skulls to this collection, though getting them to work with you is up to you."
753,,600,As Much Sorcerer as Scientist ,Heroes Reborn,Magitek,"You are an expert at blending science and magic. You know how to combine the two in the form of magitech, and to use this sorcerous technology to perform feats that many fools would call impossible. This will even allow you to combine forms of magic with technology which normally would not play nicely with technological advancement.

You will also find that understanding one makes it easier for you to understand and learn the other; the greater your knowledge of science the more easily you will find it is to learn sorcery and the greater your knowledge of sorcery the more easily you will learn scientific and engineering skills. Coupled with the mind of a super scientist and you could show the world its place at your feet. This does not give you any ability to use sorcery on its own, though, merely to create magitech and to learn magic more quickly and easily; if a setting’s magic can only be learned by those who fulfill certain prerequisites and you do not fulfill them, then this alone won’t let you learn it, though you would pick up the theory more quickly."
754,,600,THE SIN MACHINE,Helltaker,Magitek,"You have a magitech machine of enormous proportions. Just like the puzzles, in-jump this is just an actual location in Hell, but post-jump you can consciously make the decision to send anyone you tap to this place. If you have “Chains Of Sin 2: Electric Boogaloo” then you can activate the SIN MACHINE through them. Inside, there’s a constant onslaught of attacks somehow related to your perks. There’s four phases, each harder than the last; if the target manages to survive all four phases then you can’t bring them back in until a year later. The attacks are guaranteed to be the most deadly they can and your perks will work together to great effect. Bonus Points if you activate it while yelling IGNITE THE SIN MACHINE! SUFFERING MUST BE MADE!"
755,,600,Technovore,Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Magitek,"Techies beware; you can absorb technology, mimicking its functionalities within your body to improve yourself. This process is slow, and can only be done with technology that is around the same size or smaller than your body; in addition, if a piece of technology has protections that prevent tampering with it you will need to find a way to work around them, and if it has non- technological components (including things like magitech and biological components) you will not be able to copy those aspects. You can choose how this technology “manifests”; for example, upon absorbing a laser pistol, you may shoot lasers from your hands, eyes, or mouth, or have your hand take on the appearance of the pistol; how it manifests is up to you, so long as it manifests as part of your body. Using abilities absorbed from technology tires you out equivalent to the power of the technology, and can cause you to be incapacitated for a while if you use too much power in one go."
756,,600,Solar Cannon,Ragna Crimson,Magitek,"A marvel of magitech and remotely controlled by a ring that you now own, this weapon allows you to call down artillery strikes that function by concentrating solar energy into one point to create a deadly laser. 

It’s highly stationary, but its power can even damage or even kill the Seija and it has a considerable range, at least a few dozen kilometers. It’s just that it’s pretty slow in its charging, so you better have some way to restrain those powerful enemies if you want to use it in a fight."
757,,600,A Relic of the Past ,Ragna Crimson,Magitek,"This world wasn’t always so ‘primitive’. Many years ago, during a time that only persists in the memories of the oldest beings, civilization flourished and science progressed to the point of making what nowadays would be considered magical wonders.

Whether you were present at that as one of those ancients, or that knowledge was passed onto you, the genius mind that you have been blessed with will surely be able to make great use of those technologies.

You are not only a master of all those ancient technologies, ranging from biotechnology to cybernetics and all fields of engineering, but you are adept at blending magic and science, allowing you to create even more impressive creations.

And with time you may even recreate the feats of magic through technological means, such as harnessing the space magic to create artificial pocket dimensions, or studying the time magic to create full time machines. Be warned that such a thing is likely to be a time consuming and expensive endeavor."
758,,600,Man of Progress,Arcane,Magitek,"For thousands of years, magic was thought to be the domain of the few privileged to be born with the talent, or willing to mortgage their souls to demons or celestial beings. Now, thanks to Jayce Talis, that power has been democratised - somewhat, at least. You share the same kind of innovative ability of Jayce and Viktor, able to make scientific leaps and bounds while others creep along at a steady pace behind you. Whatever fields of research you involve yourself in, you’ll find yourself making intuitive leaps, putting together disparate facts and seeing patterns where others only see noise. Besides your personal innovative abilities, you also have a knack for producing designs which can be adapted for mass production with relative ease and whose principles can be easily taught to others, so that you can uplift not only yourself, but those around you as well. Piltover is called the City of Progress, after all.

Your scientific prowess is at its height when you’re working based on some form of inspiration; perhaps trying to imitate some process seen in nature, or replicate spells and magic. Your inventions might not quite work the same as the original, but if you work long and hard enough, almost anything that can be done by natural or supernatural means can be measured, harnessed and controlled through the power of your scientific method."
759,,600,Extended Warranty ,Ben 10,Magitek,"Let’s get real for a second: You are a scientist, not a repair monkey. You shouldn’t have to teleport all the way from your home planet to fix something one of your assistants managed to break in the time you took your eyes off of them. As a result, your technology is now durable and long-lasting...you can go years without seeing a prototype of your creation before it actually needs you to fix it directly, even the most idiotic and primitive species being able to guesswork how to fix it even if they don’t know how it works. Also when I say durable, I mean the universe could collapse into nothingness and that device of yours would still be floating in the empty void that used to be said universe. Point being, technology you create is both insanely durable and is easily maintained. Now maybe you don’t have to handle everything yourself."
760,,600,Birthing Pod,MtG - New Phyrexia,Magitek,"This monstrous bio-metallic flower, when fed with well-preserved or preferably fresh corpses, will swallow and store them deep within its body as it gestates, turning the once uncorrupted body into a Phyrexian abomination, all around stronger and hardier, not losing their biological abilities-though the resulting beasts might not be able to use the more complex techniques or magic. However, it only seems to create mostly mindless, if loyal monsters, and you have almost no control over the final result. It is, however, a way to produce cheap and strong forces, perhaps enough to build an army, given sufficient time…"
761,,600,An Engine For A New Era ,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Magitek,"Deep in the halls of Otawara lies a blasphemy most foul, something the Empire and Order would seek to utterly erase not only it but all who had helped build it. Possibly even those who had laid eyes upon it. In the hopes of creating a mech that possessed more power, acted faster, was easier to use, one scientist bound a Kami into the frame of his machines. You have come into the possession of this machine, or perhaps a prototype or second model of it. Though bound, the mech is very much alive thanks to the unknown Kami of water within it. It truly does act and react as fast as the pilot can think… when it’s in tune with its pilot at least, something that may be hard to accomplish for someone who merely thinks of it as a machine. Still, if you open your heart and mind to it, then you will find that there is no machine on this plane that can stand up to your combined might. In addition to this machine itself, you may choose to trade it in at the end of each jump, gaining an equally powerful and heretical machine to wield in battle or dissect at your leisure."
762,,600,More Real Than Reality,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Magitek,"Phyrexia’s ability to conquer other worlds has always been held in check by the sheer difficulty inherent to traveling through the Blind Eternities. Without a planeswalker of their own, and unable to Compleat one without damaging their Spark somehow, their options have been limited. A Spark is not something you can touch, something you can modify. It is more of an idea. But what if there was a world where ideas could be touched, where beings made concepts and thoughts walked among us? And that is why the Phyexians have come to Kamigawa. And lucky you, having managed to get your hands on Jin-Gitaxias’s personal notes on the strange and unusual relationship this plane has between the spiritual and the physical. And, perhaps more importantly, the device Jin and Tezzeret created to allow them to interact with the Spark. Everything you would need to Compleat a Planeswalker, all in one neat little package. Isn’t it wonderful?"
763,,600,Architecting And Animating Reality ,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Magitek,"The greatest flaw in any machine, any artifact, any vehicle, is the user. If they don’t know how to use it, if they can’t power it, if they simply can’t react fast enough - or, arguably worse, if they’re faster and it can’t react fast enough. This is a focus of study that has consumed scientists for generations, and luckily enough, I think they’ve had a breakthrough. For that matter, so have you. You’ve learned how to incorporate science into your magic and magic into your science, using one to smooth out the flaws of the other. This provides you with a level of insight into supposedly impossible tasks and allows you to turn them into something that’s merely absurdly difficult. A compatriot of yours uses this same philosophy to turn the mechs he produces into something he can interact with telepathically, trying to push the mech’s reactions up to as fast as their pilots can think - though, his real claim to fame these days is being able to personally field a small army of them by himself. Given a few weeks of study, perhaps a day or two with a sample of his work, I'm sure you could copy that method for yourself, perhaps even make a few improvements on it. Be wary however - the golden goose of this train of thought would be to work a Kami into your art, and that is something the Empire would never allow."
764,,600,Skyship Jumperlight ,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Magitek,"But perhaps instead of new methods to travel between the planes, you maybe wish instead to go old school. The Jumperlight is your own personal version of the Skyship Weatherlight! It is basically a magical skyship 300 feet in length with a crew of forty men, though it could easily fit one hundred people. It has three decks, plenty of cargo room. It can fly at 110 mph when moving forward, 40 mph in reverse and has a forcefield and an engine powered by mana. It has a skeleton of Thran Metal and a Powerstone for a core. The best part of all if it wasn’t obvious, is that unlike the Planar Bridge this can carry living beings. Or rather it could before the Mending ruined its capability to Planar Travel, but this version doesn’t have that problem. This artifact is limited to the local multiverse until you ignite your Jumper Spark. It retains all modifications."
765,,600,Planar Bridge,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Magitek,"An immensely powerful artifact created purely by accident. This is the first artifact created since the mending that can be used to travel between the Planes. It also can transport much more than even the fantastic devices before the mending. Put simply, it can create a massive portal to another plane that could let through four giants at once and columns of men for as long as it is open. However, there is a catch, this wondrous gateway can only transfer nonliving, inorganic matter which is a true shame. If one could figure out a way to bring an army through this gate then they would have an enormous beachhead on another plane from which to resupply and reinforce. This artifact is limited to the local multiverse until you ignite your Jumper Spark. It retains all modifications."
766,,600,Scholar ,Warbreaker,Magitek,"You may not be one of the Five Scholars, but you’ve certainly taken inspiration from their example. You know that absolutely everything, even mysteries of Adonalsium, eventually yields to scientific inquiry, and you are very, very good at science. You can figure out the underlying mechanics of everything from magic to totally unknown technology, and in record time. You never chase blind alleys, and always find some practical use for your insights."
767,,600,The Accelerator ,Skulduggery Pleasant,Magitek,"This is a machine created by Dr. Rote which can boost the power of other mages to incredible new heights. The Accelerator draws its power from the Source of all magic. In the hands of ordinary mages, it could power them up to the level where they could destroy dozens of their fellows with ease, but in the hands of someone like Darquesse, the result is unthinkable. You now possess your own copy of this machine, located in your Warehouse or in a property you own. Before you get too excited, the boost the Accelerator provides is only temporary; after a while, that boost will start to slowly fade away, gradually returning the mage to their normal power level. Ordinarily, the Accelerator becomes a time bomb after being turned on, continuing to draw on magic until it explodes. The resulting explosion would deliver magic to every living being on the planet, including Mortals. Your version of the Accelerator will not explode, unless you want it to for some reason. Furthermore, unlike the original, yours will not require a willingly donated soul to be deactivated. If you decide to blow up your Accelerator, you will receive a new one at the start of the next Jump."
768,,600,Dungeon Master,Magi: The Adventure of Sinbad,Magitek,"During his adventures into the Dungeons, Lord Barbarossa came across many strange and horrifying monster with power far in excess of any creature in this world outside of the furthest reaches of the Dark Continent. Instead of recoiling in fear like most men, though, he saw an opportunity – by combining man and monster, he could create superhuman soldiers the likes of which the world had never seen. And through the aid of the shadowy cabal of Magicians known as Al-Thamen, he made his ideas reality.

Somehow, you have gained an exceptional understanding of this perverse science, allowing you to, with the right specimens and enough time, combine ordinary humans with supernatural beasts to create powerful hybrid monsters. You have enough skill to fine-tune the results, too, creating anything from mindless yet loyal soldiers with only the slightest semblance of their former humanity to people that are almost indistinguishable from their former selves yet possess incredible powers. Here, humans modified in this way gained powers ranging from incredible regeneration to blinding speed to gills and other aquatic adaptations, though what abilities can be awakened from fusing men with the monsters of other settings is for you to discover."
769,,600,Cauldron,BlazBlue: Phase Zero,Magitek,"A fun little story for you. In the future, the cities of the world will all be built on top of Cauldrons. The Magic City Ishana is built on one. Every base of the Void Bureau is or will be built on one. People just can’t seem to get enough of them. Well, I suppose they are useful. What exactly is a Cauldron? Well, it’s a portal into the Boundary. It leaks small amounts of magic, so you can use them as a power source. It’s also useful - but not required, under the right circumstances - to Smelt something, such as Nine’s Arch Enemy Event Weapons. If you’re really clever or really lucky, it can also be used to travel through time. Though, a warning. The Boundary is NOT welcoming to most life forms. Using it as a method of travel is just asking to have your soul torn apart. ...Well, moving on. Much like the Void Bureau and the cities of the future, you now have a Cauldron. Specifically, one under every major property you own. Please mad science responsibly."
770,,600,Susanoo Unit,BlazBlue: Phase Zero,Magitek,"The Susanoo Unit is the ‘sword’ that defends the Amaterasu Unit. That said, that information won’t be relevant for almost 90 years. More to the point, the Susanoo is technically a robot, and a quite powerful one. As of right now, it is without a pilot - a soul. Normally you’d have to sacrifice your body to get inside, but I’ve modified it to eat both and spit them back out when you’re done. The body has what amounts to near limitless amount of stamina, and enough physical power to stand on par with a Beastman. However, it’s true power is the ability to cut time. Ending any form of time manipulation, or even decreasing an opponent's lifespan with every swing - or cutting it away all at once to kill even an immortal being. Lastly, and once again time related, the Susanoo can cut through time to reach alternate timelines. Oh, and it’s completely immune to any form of paradox, as it can simply cut those to ribbons."
771,,600,Hack the World,Fate/Extella,Magitek,"The right position and enough time taught you far more than the Moon Cell may have intended for you to gain access to. The Moon Cell is nothing more than a hyper-complex computer system when you get to the very basics, a system you’ve become able to manipulate. A form of wizardry far and away beyond modern magus code casts, you’ve learned to hack into the reality around you. While large scale operations are time consuming, and difficult in a time when the Moon Cell isn’t being distracted from correcting your changes, you are very skilled in altering reality on the local scale. Replicating most magical effects is easy, even high level spells such as dimensional shields that can protect against anything short of a powerful Phantasm release. Changing how the laws of physics are working, directly upgrading or altering a Servant’s spiritual core and more. It only takes a bit of time to apply your newfound abilities to the reality outside of the Moon Cell. A benefit to how faithful the Moon Cell is to reality."
772,,600,Monolith,Fate/Extella,Magitek,"An alien relic, of unknown origin and purpose, though the benefits it grants you become clear quite quickly. The tall pillar, covered in strange sigils, is able to generate vast amounts of energy when needed, of almost any kind. Both magical and more technological sorts. Enough that if you had a way to channel it, you could cast spells across whole cities or even multiple at once. The pillar acts as a clear line of connection to any alien being that you know the rough identity of, connecting you directly to their closest means of communication when you lay hands on the monolith and wish it. It is also possible, with extensive study and interaction towards the relic, to use it to unlock astounding new knowledge or abilities in yourself. It takes time and rarely will this happen more than once or twice, but the databases of alien worlds or the ability to override the spiritual cores of other beings are examples of what could be gained. In future worlds, a new monolith will be present, based on an alien race that does or could exist in that new world."
773,,600,Murder Doll,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Magitek,"The unification of black magic and advanced technology makes it possible to create homunculi of
truly superb quality. You are the result of the same process that created the Katou Danzou puppet, fully freed of any creator and able to enjoy this immortal frame. Your body becomes that of a
techno-magical puppet, allowing you to translate any powers you have into a technological form
within your body now and in the future if desired. It only fits, as your body is already equipped with
a variety of impressive devices. Hidden blades of varying kinds, magically imbued wooden missile
launchers, ranged attacks from kunai to crossbows, even technology and mystic codes that can
create powerful vacuums or deliver dangerous curses. At the core, your physical body is also greatly
enhanced in parameters. While your senses and mind remain the same, you are strong enough to
contend with relatively powerful Oni and fast enough that even legendary swordsmen like Musashi
Miyamoto can struggle to keep pace with you. 

This is all supported by great skill with Genjutsu, the arts of illusion. Rather than actual magecraft, these are varieties of mundane techniques and skill at misdirection that let you disguise things as not
what they really are. The primary use of this is hiding the magi-tech devices and abilities you have as
mundane effects or concealing their presence at all. A magus will struggle to recognise the true
source of your vacuum attack that allows for ranged annihilation of foes, seeing it as just ‘erasing the
enemy form’ and becoming confused as to the true mechanism. Hiding the exact nature, functions
and mechanisms of your abilities becomes simple with these skills.
 
While you do not know how to create more of your kind, you are able to relatively easily repair your
body should it become damaged, even with fairly common materials. It appears your form has
several functions that aid this, instead of requiring your creators be present."
774,,600,Living Lightning,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Magitek ,"Maybe the position of Doctor isn’t the one you’re after. Were you a prototype of Frankenstein’s
design, miraculously gaining life despite being considered a failure? The results of another scientist
or magus of the age? No matter your source, your design is similar to Frankenstein’s own creation, albeit the methods and make may differ. An artificial lifeform, likely made of electrically re-animated
flesh, who has the immortal constitution only the non-living can possess. Your body is physically
strong enough to easily shatter solid stone or metal, fast enough to outrace most vehicles without
strain and tough enough to withstand your own blows. Enhanced by the ‘undead’ nature, your body
is largely unharmed even when damaged. Being cut in half only requires you to sew yourself
together again, the only organs of importance are your heart or core and your brain, which you rely
on to survive barring influence of other abilities. Most environments, poisons and chemicals lose
their effectiveness against such a body.

While clearly a very capable warrior, the science or magic that created you endowed much more
interesting abilities. A particular association with energy and electricity is present in you, taking form
as the Galvanism ability. You are able to absorb electricity on touch and convert magical energy
without material form, such as magical wind or fire or energy attacks, into more energy for
absorption. This energy can be used to replenish any biological needs, reinforce your physical body, significantly increasing all physical abilities, or rapidly regenerate any damaged portion of your form.
It can also be returned, unleashed powerful electrical blasts that can tear apart large stone golems in
a single blast. Unleashing this energy in overly large amounts can be dangerous however, potentially
burning out your core if you go too far beyond what your body can handle. Galvanism is not
unlimited and enormous amounts of energy might risk burning yourself out to absorb, while your
body can only be reinforced so far.

The electricity that hums in your core, animating your body, also contains your will with this ability
taken. So long as your will holds strong and this powerful spark within is not extinguished, you can survive even total bodily destruction. The potential to travel to a new body or even a machine and
live on exists, though those without intense willpower will unlikely be able to takeover their new
host."
775,,600,Wardenclyffe Warmachine,Fate/Legends - Strange New World,Magitek,"The culmination of Tesla’s life work, which would never have appeared in normal history. Yet here it stands, the Wardenclyffe Warmachine. A tool of science, progress and war. A large building is the form it takes, a mostly blocky and sturdy construction that serves as the base and generator for the large tower that sits atop the building. This tower has two purposes, each terrifying in their scale. It is capable of projecting electricity through the air over a great enough distance that were it placed on one coast of America, it could reach the other coast easily. This projected energy allows machines to be powered without plug or power source, as the energy is directed directly into the machine, and the amount of energy is so much that even an entire modern day city could be powered at once solely through Wardenclyffe’s output. The facility also has tools to turn this transmitted electricity into information. Less useful in this time but with more stations or in an era with some sort of information network across the world, startlingly powerful. 

But what will make every cower in fear is not the power this station can generate. It is the weapon that exists in this tower. A true Death Ray of sorts, called Teleforce, is what he made and while the exact mechanics are as yet a mystery that must be unlocked, the results cannot be missed. Instantaneous destruction of anything within 200 miles. An energy attack that can be made so fine and accurate as to slice the eyelashes off a man or so powerful as to reduce a city to ash or turn half a mountain into molten slag in seconds. The Teleforce draws heavily on Wardenclyffe’s generators to function and will inhibit power projection elsewhere while firing but the station appears to rapidly generate power without any apparent source. There are notes in the building, apparently left by Tesla himself, that detail a force known as the ionosphere but they are incomplete and appear to delve far more into the occult then was thought of the man. So much power and yet even more potential awaits the canny mind that finds this place. 

You may import a property into this."
776,,600,White Science ,Kamen Rider Neo-Heisei Part 2,Magitek,"Any sufficiently studied magic becomes an art as science. Your studies into the occult have allowed you to harness the powers of Hope and Despair. For one, you are able to create a Mage’s Belt, a weakened WizardDriver that is capable of channeling a person’s inner Mana through Wizard Rings to allow them to transform into a Kamen Rider Mage, as well as create the WizarSwordGun able to channel the power of the Wizard Rings through them for powerful attacks. These would both be fine, but you are able to utilize a few more pieces of forbidden science...including the creation of Artificial Phantoms. These Phantoms aren’t as powerful as a ‘natural’ phantom(only twice as troublesome as a Ghoul) but with sufficient ‘stored’ despair and the proper rituals on hand you will be able to make them, both a useful source of Mana and an excellent minion. As a gift, you may take a Mage Wizard Ring, a Driver On Wizard Ring, and a Connect wizard ring to use with one of these Drivers although you’ll need to provide your own Mana to activate them.

777,,600,Hologram Summer ,Tsukihime,Magitek,"All of these familiar places, familiar faces...ah, sorry, I was a little nostalgic. This is a space hidden away in either your Warehouse or a Property that you own. This room stores records of any person you’ve encountered, any experience you’ve had, and any battle you’ve fought. Everything down to the last cell of the moments you’ve had on this chain can be recreated in this room, as a sort of artificial ‘what-if’ machine...or a holodeck, if you’re a nerd. Whatever is in here cannot be taken out, as it is just a record of what was - still, if you have a particular battle or moment of your life you’d like to re-experience, you may do so, and even adjust the parameters to change the experience in a certain way to see how different choices might have played out."
778,,600,Mad Science Jumper,Tsukihime,Magitek,"...wait, what? Huh?! How does any of this have to do with being a maid?! I guess the robots could look like them or something, but...anyways, against all logic, you are an engineering genius who could put certain inventors to shame, able to construct fighting androids with comically effective artificial intelligence that will be completely loyal to you unless mistreated. These robots, with enough time and resources invested in them, could individually lay low Dead Apostles or other creatures with some effort, and are able to hold the armory of a small tank in a humanoid body, or otherwise putting a large amount of weaponry compared to the size of the robot within its arsenal. Given enough time and privacy to work, you could even make a self-sustaining factory that churns out an army of these robotic avengers...you ARE doing this for maid work, right?"
779,,600,Mind of God ,Tsukihime,Magitek,"The primary interest of Atlas is information and the manipulation thereof. This goes beyond simple precognition of day-to-day events or giving yourself an edge in combat - it is the manipulation of the progress of humankind as a whole,and prevention (or creation) of their extinction. A single human body cannot handle such information by itself - so instead, you made tools capable of accessing and storing the collective knowledge of humanity. You are capable of constructing devices that could create or manipulate pseudo-Spiritions, or virtual projections of the soul, and transmit that into a virtual space of your own designs as well. These devices are equal in magnitude and processing speed to a highly advanced Quantum Computer, and let you store or project a human consciousness,soul and all, into these spaces. With time and resources, you could recreate almost the entirety of planet Earth and the records of all its history, and store the whole of mankind within it...though doing such a strenuous, time-consuming process would take a lifetime by yourself.Recreating something such as a certain Moon-based digital space with this alone is a daunting,perhaps impossible prospect.

However, the ability to create such highly-advanced devices has come with a neat additional perk - namely, with the information it can calculate, it is possible to ‘observe’ the entirety of aworld’s history and several probable futures, along with the conditions needed to make those futures happen or even prevent them entirely. It could even provide instructions or probabilities of success with new advances or superweapons not yet within the world on aiding these potential futures, creating Mystic Codes or wonders few could even dream of beforehand. With resources and time, perhaps you could make a device that can make those probabilities real by command alone, though that requires energy and conditions that a lone human being can’t generate.  Finally, everything is here - the records of humanity can be preserved and made whole.

780,,600,Silver​ ​Millennium​ ​Technology​ ​,Sailor Moon,Magitek,"A database of humanities technology and magic used during the Silver Millennium. Given Enough time tinkering with this repository of knowledge you could replicate the technological feats that the Moon Kingdom used such as terraforming inhospitable planets, faster than light technology, create items power by emotional energy, and even scan a person's mind to create an AI that can guide the actions of those who use your technology. Some would say this technology is indistinguishable from magic, however you’ll find that magical things were also created during the Silver Millennium and you have access to that information as well. The creation of magical weaponry, the magical methods of creating something like the Sailor Cannon, and more are evidenced within this database beside the technological marvels. Whilst you can’t create something on the level of the Silver Crystal of Queen Serenity you do have access to the massive bulk of information that could help in the rebirth of a New Silver Millennium.
"
781,,600,The Books of Magic,Justice League Dark,Magitek,"Long rumored to be artifacts of immense power and quote possibly the source of magic itself. These legendary artifacts have been coveted for millenia by everyone from two-bit sorcerers yearning for more power to the greatest mages of all time, such as Merlin himself. Split into four volumes – Order, Chaos, Life, and Death – it is said that possessing these books would give the wielder near absolute power over those concepts and over magic itself.

However, contrary to their name and the rumors long spread about them, the Books of Magic are actually more science than magic. Forged long by a powerful mage known as the Hunter, he researched methods of fusing magic and technology in an attempt to escape the persecution of his people. The Books, in addition to serving as a gateway to Epoch, the Hunter's home world, also contain all of his research.

Armed with this knowledge, you would be able to become the world's foremost expert on fusing magic and technology.

782,,600,Starro-tech Notes ,Young Justice,Magitek,"These notes detail the research Professor Ivo, Brain, and Klarion the Witch Boy took in order to create Starro-tech; a combination of technology, magic, and an ancient alien organism. With time, and some studies of your own, you may be able to apply the principles of Starro-tech to your creations as well, creating technology and creatures that have features of living beings, magic, and technology.
"
783,,600,Praesi Engineering ​,A Practical Guide to Evil,Magitek,"If there is one thing that every Praesi Emperor has in common, it’s the ability to take insane and ridiculous ideas and turn them into reality. Flying cathedrals that rain death upon their foes? Sentient tigers? Man eating tapirs? Giant cliffs to throw the hero down? WHY THE HELL NOT! You are capable of taking even the stupid and most insane engineering designs and throwing large amounts of magic at them until they work. Sure, this might require sacrificing a few towns worth of peasants, but that’s the sort of thing that peasants are for.
"
784,,600,1973 Triumph Convertible ,Libriomancer,Magitek,"A sleek black car, perpetually clean and made of steel. Heavier and more durable than most modern cars but with all their speed ­ and then some. Its windshield is enchanted to remain perpetually clear and grant nightvision to the passengers, as well as act as a two­-way video call to whomever you are magically connected to. Its traction is good enough that it could be taken out snowmobiling on a frozen lake. Its anti-theft mechanisms are legion ­ ensuring it will never be taken without your say so. With its ability to transform into a boat, submarine, motorcycle and flying saucer, the oil slick, hidden machine guns and caltrops all just seem a little overkill.

785,,600,Fossil DNA ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Magitek,"A giant (as in as big as a skyscraper) DNA strand spliced from and stretching down to a large boulder containing the fossilized remains of the Ancient Ones buried in Antarctica. And it’s actually safe to use now. By injecting the DNA into living subjects, those individuals will begin to gradually acquire the special powers that the Ancient Ones held during their golden age.
"
786,,600,Magitech wizard ,Dog Days,Magitek,"You are able to easily combine magic and technology, letting you make things like radio antennae and signal boosters that rely on magic. Maybe you could replace ammunition with bolts of magic. With this you can replicate the effects of technology with magic, and it will likely be less complex too. This isn’t a one way process however, you may also replicate the effects of magic with technology. This will be much more complex than the alternative however.
"
787,,600,Device Meister ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"This is the real treasure of the TSAB’s technological capabilities - mixing the use of magic and technology in order to create Devices that can channel the energy outwards. You have a complete knowledge of how to build and maintain Devices, along with how to program AI for said Devices to use. While you can construct most Devices and similar items presented here, the ability to make Unison Devices isn’t included here - you’ll have to learn that one on your own, and many have tried and failed to do so in the past. You could, with some experimentation, combine different magical systems into Devices together, especially with the help of ‘Similar Principles’ to streamline the process...it will take some trial and error, but you could apply these principles and Devices to other systems if you work at it enough.
"
788,,600,In The Blood ,Lyrical Nanoha,Magitek,"That’s the key word, isn’t it? Legacy. You may or may not live forever yourself, but what about your creations? Your marvels? Your progeny? Whether or not you aspire to be a ruler yourself, you will find that there are ways to preserve your best traits, particularly within your own body or those of your descendants. You have learned the art of infusing mana into DNA, letting you create hereditary and unique magical abilities that are passed down from generation to generation, or specific individuals if you can’t be bothered to wait that long. Traits like a specific hair color, eye color, or body type is child’s play to you - and while complicated or powerful abilities may not always descend down the family tree, you could preserve the appearance and base talents of your bloodline for millennia to come. An affinity for a particular element, a talent for a set of skills, or even a unique magical ability tied specifically to the DNA of the user are valid examples for this. Whether you merely wish to experiment with magical DNA or begin a great dynasty, you will find that with the right motivation, your legacy could last forever.

789,,600,Pagan Science ,Senki Zesshou Symphogear,Magitek,"You've managed to uncover some of the secrets of old, the very same knowledge that underlies 'Sakurai Theory', the theoretical basis of the Symphogear system. With this knowledge, many of the more mysterious functions of the Symphogears become clear. You can repair and install new functions into Symphogears, that manipulate existing features, like forcing a berserk state or tuning it to raise synchronization coefficients. What's more, your glimpses into Sakurai theory indicate some possibilities of inducing Human-Relic fusion, but to complete the theory you'll need an existing test subject...

791,,600,The Inspiration of Madness ,Warhammer Fantasy: Skaven,Magitek,"Insanity is not something maligned amidst skaven society, as it is amidst the man-thing villages. Skryre’s Warlock-Engineers are, one and all to a member, the most addle-brained and unstable of the rat-men to date - yet it was their madness that led to the creation of so many technological marvels. The warp-lightning rails that connect the great under-cities, such as Under-Altdorf and Hell Pit. The Doomwheels. The Skitter-Gates. Ratling mini-guns and poison wind and augmentation chemicals and all the myriad of spells that make the Warlock-Engineers a minor apocalypse upon the field. All born from diseased minds.

You count yourself as “inspired” as these demented predecessors of yours - a madness coming over your brain-meats. While this madness may be debilitating in any day-to-day interaction, it shines when you set to work. The magics you use and the technologies you set to experiment with and create will seem to branch, weave, intersect, and spark in ways that would never occur to a healthier mind. In short, through your mad eyes and addled brain, you can create and discover new spells, machinery, scientific theories, and interactions between the three that would never occur naturally even through rigorous years of study and experimentation. Creations that mock the very idea of common sense and decency, and violate every sense and sensibility.

792,,600,Enlightened casting ​,Mage: The Awakening(1st Edition),Magitek,"The practical application of knowledge. You may now use the information you have acquired through normal scientific study to magecraft. This in turn makes your spells more powerful as their effects become stronger and produce more tangible results. For example, a strong understanding of physics may better allow you to increase the strength of matter or force spells. Knowledge of biology could increase the ease with which you use life spells or alter the cognitions and impulses of organisms through mind spells. The stronger your base knowledge in a scientific discipline, the more powerful and effective your spells will become.

793,,600,Atop the World ,Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,Magitek,"Walk this path carefully. This is the art that both saved, and destroyed Hyrule. You have unlocked knowledge of the greatest force multiplier the Sheikah were ever able to field - Large, walking, warmachines. You have a basic knowledge of the Sheikah’s art of automation and robotics, with this alone giving you the knowledge to craft the small Guardians utilized by Shrines in combat tests, with the right materials. However, with enough resources and development time...you could create constructs that could even rival the 4 great Divine Beasts. This is the pure expression of Power...just remember that Power must be tempered with Wisdom, and wielded with Courage. Power without restraint is the domain of Calamity Ganon, after all.
"
794,,600,A Test of Power ,Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,Magitek,"A lost art, this Guardian is without a mind or automaton-like programming to fight on its own. It can’t be subverted by Ganon like many of the others...because it’s hollow. You can utilize this Hollow Guardian as a vehicle, controlling it from within its hardy shell. Not only does it have all the power of its brothers, however, it can shift between “turret” mode by embedding itself into the ground, “walker mode” that is much like the ordinary Guardians in the wild, and “flying” guardians like the sentries that float around Ganon’s most important places of influence.
"
795,,600,Forgotten Divine Beast ,Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,Magitek,"A prototype lost to time, you may decide if this is a “Power” or “Speed” type Divine Beast. A “Power” type Divine Beast is the size of a Manor House, shaped like a mundane creature you decide and can move similarly to that creature in locomotion, having much the same processes and powers as its larger Divine Beast cousins-even the beam of destroying light! A “Speed” type Divine Beast is in many respects the sister to Master Cycle Zero, being an extremely fast, powerful and capable “steed” that can be fueled on any form of materials fed into its engine.
"
796,,600,Ancient Technology,Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword,Magitek,"But, skill at design aside, you do actually need to know how this stuff works do you not? It’s not as though there’s anybody left in this day and age to do the building for you. Or perhaps it might be better to say that all the ancient technology, the robots of Lanayru and the mining facility, need a source. You. Or whoever taught you this stuff, because it’s been fading away for the last two thousand years. Anyways, you have the scientific skills to create the Ancient Robots, all the way from the lowly mining robots to the mighty Koloktos. And of course, to work with the Timeshift stones that power them. Time, as a solid object, makes for a great building material. Unless a certain stimulus is triggered, something built out of them would literally last forever. It’s really quite useful when designing dungeons meant to last a thousand years or more.
"
797,,600,Here We Are ,Undertale,Magitek,"There's a lot of sciences that aren't wise for mere mortals to delve into. The SOUL is one of them... But that hasn't stopped you, has it? SOULs are fragile things, particularly monster SOULs, but you know how to work with them. Making a robot with a SOUL is a good example of what you're capable of. You're also knowledgeable about the element of the human soul dubbed DETERMINATION, and can extract it from human SOULs and inject it into other things using a machine that you know how to make. Just... Be careful. Nobody wants to see anyone melt."
798,,600,Technological Upgrade ,World Seed,Magitek,"Spaceship captains, rulers of both kingdoms and planets alike, and people similarly reigning over the masses or in possession of a vast amount of land have access to a special kind of system in Neolife. A sort of management menu, it allows people to upgrade their territories in two kinds of ways: the first is a technology upgrade, which a ruler could use to add irrigation to a field, or to increase the defence of a city. If there is a design provided, it will be instantly built once the upgrade finishes in around a week.

The second is a production speed upgrade. For example, after setting an order to increase agriculture, a burst of mana would sink into the ground and the growth of nearby fields and trees would instantly hasten, fruits and vegetables being grown overnight, and continuing to do so for several days. The mana to power both kinds of upgrades is drawn from both the people and the environment in the land affected by the upgrade, with the time needed for the upgrade increasing the more difficult and complex the upgrade is, due to it needing more mana. In your case, even if you might not be ruling over an area, your affinity with technology has granted you a similar ability.

You may spend mana to add new functions to technological devices and machinery, or improve already existing functions. The more complex or expansive the change is, and the larger o advanced the target object is, the more mana is required. Like with the management menu, you can also affect things that haven’t incorporated any technology in their function yet, such as the aforementioned irrigation added to a field.

This could be used to turn a mage staff entirely made out of natural material into magitech, or into a technological equivalent. Similarly, you may affect extremely large areas like cities or even planets after you become powerful enough, and may also order for the required mana to be drawn from the environment or any living beings in it. Beyond that, you also have a knack for upgrading things the old fashioned way with your own two hands."
799,,600,Magitech Master ,World Seed,Magitek,"If you looked at Neolife’s technology for only a bit, you’d be surprised to see that it is not technology at all. Well, not pure technology at least. Rather, the technological standard in the game is magitech, a fusion of magic and technology. And it looks like you’ve taken a shine to this kind of thing, evident by your new skillset.

First of all, you are able to build a technological equivalent of any magic or other supernatural ability, like a Psychic power, and vice versa. If you could cast a basic fireball or lightning bolt spell, you could build a gun that can do the same. If it’s something more complex than that, for example a whole skillset like fire magic, you might instead be able to build a nanite swarm or a glove that could grant it wholesale to other people, or a robot innately able to do it. The same goes for any technology you are able to build. If you had a device at your hand that could stabilize space in a radius, preventing any dimensional shenanigans, you’d be able to create a spell that could do the same. And if you studied a space ship, you could create a spell that would let you travel the void unhindered at the same speed and with the same protection.

But of course, you are also able to make actual magitech, using the strengths of both fields to negate their weaknesses and make something surpassing what you could do just using one of them. Whether it is space ships powered by magic and enchanted to be far sturdier and more powerful than their material makeup would suggest, ships powered by white holes that are contained through magic, warp gates allowing for unmolested travel throughout the galaxy once they are set up, or bombs that break open rifts to subspace, capable of easily scorching a planet through mana acting like antimatter rushing out of them, there’s no technology to be found in Neolife that is beyond your ability to create."
800,,600,Raiden Shogun,Genshin Impact,Magitek,"This is the Raiden Shogun. Well, not her specifically. Rather, you have come into possession of a product identical to her. A puppet created of ancient technology lost to war whose great power stands at the same level as the more powerful of gods. The appearance, personality, and indeed even elemental affinity of this mechanical god is one you can freely choose now, though these will become significantly harder to modify once established. To those unaware, this puppet will appear for all the world as if they are a living being. Only those already informed about their nature would know that they are different."
801,,600,The False God,Genshin Impact,Magitek,"The Island of Inazuma is presided over by the Raiden Shogun. She is their omnipresent god who rules over the land with a firm grip. What the people do not know is that the Raiden Shogun is a puppet made by and for the true Electro Archon. You have stumbled upon the notes of the ancient lost technology used to create her, perhaps left behind by Ei once she was done with them. With this technology at your fingertips you have the ability to create sentient puppets, ones whose might have the potential of rivalling the likes of the Gods themselves. Though doing so is no mean feat, Ei herself having discarded countless failed products before she arrived at the Raiden Shogun."
802,,600,Jewel Of Humankind,Genshin Impact,Magitek,"The civilisation of Khaenri’ah was the pinnacle of humanity more than 500 years ago, before it was ravaged by the gods of Teyvat. Their war machines, the ruin guards, still wander the world to this day, having spread to every corner of the land over the years. Today only the Abyssal Order still truly understands the workings of these machines. The Abyssal Order and you. At its peak, this technology has the potential to even create a mechanised god, albeit using the parts of another god. You won’t be doing that any time soon though. For now you’ll have to content yourself with the likes of the Field Tillers and Ruin Hunters."
803,,700,Magitek Engineer ,Drakengard and Nier,Magitek,"You know, for a supposedly medieval society, the Empire has some pretty advanced toys, huh. And now, so do you. Or at least, you will once you build them. You now know how to build the magitek machines used by the Empire. Provided you have the materials and the time, you can build anything from man-portable weapons to battleships. Or airships even. You can’t reach anything past a generally World War One level of technology, but thanks to the magic side of things, they'll generally outperform their real world equivalents. Magic cannon beats normal cannon, that’s all I’m saying.

804,,800,Vinashak,Grant Morrison’s 18 Days,Magitek,"Ever wanted a weapon of atomic fire, the living, beating, breathing heart of a star in convenient handheld form? Well that’s Vinashak, the personal sword of Master Drona. There is no mortal substance this blade cannot cut through, and even the substance of the Divine needs to fear this blade.

It can be as long as it needs to be, and has no weight. It vaporizes all projectiles that come near it and protects its wielder (and allies) from its own unstoppable heat. Any slain by this weapon die the true death, be they man or god, excepting one of the Trimurti, though in true Hindu fashion, it does not stop them from reincarnating as someone else. You can have it once Drona is done with it."
805,,800,Artificial Causality Weapon,Blazblue,Magitek,"A nonmagical imitation of the Nox Nyctores, an Artificial Causality Weapon replicates a Nox Nyctores' reality-altering abilities using atomic power rather than life energy. You can only purchase one Artifical Causality weapon, and you must choose from the table below. While it isn't quite as powerful as its real counterpart, it also won't influence your emotions.

Mucro Glaciei: Boreas - A sword that uses enhanced technology to forge its blade out of permafrost using ambient water vapor. The blade it forges is cold enough to destroy a human limb with just one cut, as the blade will cause all the blood in the arm to freeze and it'll die of frostbite within seconds. The sheath can also generate blasts of icy wind that covers anything it hits in freezing ice.

Arcum Dei: Odin - A pair of guns that do not fire bullets- Instead, they pierce through space and collapse it at a point in line with the barrel. Odin can even fire through walls and other obstructions. Using it properly requires excellent kinesthetic sense and the ability to estimate your distance from the target. Theoretically, you can use it at any distance, but this becomes more and more difficult the farther you get away due to the extreme precision required.

Mortalis Machina: Athena - A human-sized, feminine automaton that follows your orders and protects you to the best of its ability. It is extremely durable and stores a vareity of weapons inside its long arms. Athena also possesses the ability to teleport itself and its user short distances. Athena requires almost no maitenance whatsoever.

Mucro Regis: Takezo - A pair of samurai swords stored in a single sheath, one on each end of it. Takezo possesses no actual edge, but can cut anything the user wishes it to, even things that cannot normally be cut- Physical objects that are normally indestructible, magical barriers, and even abstract concepts can be cut with practice and focus.

Sonax Campana: Liberty - A long staff ending in a glowing orb. Liberty is capable of manifesting matter in almost any way the user can think of, albeit temporarily. The matter is projected from the orb at its end. Anything created by Liberty will invariably fade in a few seconds, and Liberty cannot create anything larger than a refrigerator. The only limit to Liberty's potential is the user's creativity. 

Aeternus Serpens: Nidhogg - A steel snake-head attached to a chain of seemingly infinite length. The snake-head can be launched out of a portal to attack, and the snake- head can attach itself to anything, even thin air. It can be used to propel the wielder around the field of battle, or to pull opponents closer to the wielder. Supposedly, it can also latch on to a victim's psyche, allowing the user to exploit psychological weaknesses and manipulate memories."
806,,800,Black Armory Forge,The Destiny Universe,Magitek,"You now possess a weapons forge of the Black Armory. Until Guardians began pouring their paracausal power into their weapons, and the Warmind Rasputin began releasing his personally crafted weapons, there simply never were stronger infantry weapons than those made by these forges. On its own, this Forge can create the highest quality weapons made of the highest quality materials, and more reliable than anything made before or after. Regardless of the weapon’s origin, be it from this world or others, any weapon you place inside of the Forge is scanned, its schematics uploaded to an internal database, and from then on, it is capable of creating copies of that weapon enhanced to the standards of the Black Armory. The limit, however, is that it cannot enhance upon perfection - giving the Forge a weapon already brought up to the standards of the Black Armory will not enhance it further. However, if you spend an extra 200 CP, you can add an artificial intelligence hand-designed by the original Black Armorers before the Collapse. Equipped with all of their knowledge and skill, and dedicated solely to the creation of ever more lethal killing instruments, it can enhance any and all weapons you give it, including those it has already improved before."
807,,800,The Impossible,The Destiny Universe,Magitek,"Ask anyone in the Humans’ Last City, and they would tell you it is impossible. They would provide endless evidence for the fact, and at least two examples they knew of where someone tried and failed, and yet even they cannot deny - it was your former Dominus that did what no one else could: He stole the Light. For a brief but glorious time, Dominus Ghaul did what the City would later fear the Witch Queen had done, and though his ascent ended in failure when the Traveler itself intervened and killed him, he nevertheless stole that which has only ever been given. Such is the unimaginable scientific and technological strength of the Cabal that, even for a brief moment, they succeeded at something no one else in the universe had ever done before.

Now this ability, now this understanding, is yours. You can do the unthinkable - you can replicate a feat only ever achieved by one man, and steal paracausal powers. From the Light, to the Darkness, from Awoken to Hive Magic, to anything you could find in future Jumps, you have the scientific and technological understanding and know-how to steal and replicate paracausal powers. Just be wary that, as Ghaul and later even Nezarec learned, some powers are governed by beings far above the ken of mortal minds, and may take offense to such blatant attempts at overriding their will - depending on what it is you stole, and from whom, you may find that your power is temporary, following the Human adage: The Candle that burns twice as bright lasts half as long. Your only saving grace in this respect is the CP you have spent to acquire this knowledge - it will protect you from the costs of your hubris, but only temporarily. As intelligent as you are, as advanced as your science may be, you are only mortal. But if you are able to go this far, how much further could you go as your own studies, and science at large, continues to advance?"
808,,800,Celestial Masterpiece,Godbound,Magitek,"Empires fall, mountains crumble, stars are snuffed out and yet the Celestial Engines turn ever-onward. You know this better than most, because by some caprice of the One’s designs you have somehow become metaphysically merged with a Celestial Engine-it’s divine mechanisms transmuted into principles and concepts manifested from your words, flesh and deeds. Sometimes briefly manifesting as a halo of starlight gears or contrails of radiant mechanisms when your divine power flares.

With significant divine effort, these semi-solid emanations of your Word can be manifested into tangible constructs-though this is greatly dependent on your existing might. A mortal would be lucky to conjure a single gear-shield, while a Godbound could boast unerringly accurate throwing disks or augment their normal weapons and armour with celestial gadgets-and a parasite god could even conjure localised environmental hazards, or a hovering wall of orbital shields that unerringly deflect incoming attacks. With greater divine power and experience with these facets of your being, comes even grander and more miraculous expressions of your mechanistic shadow-self. Perhaps in time, you’ll grind mountain ranges to fine power with your gears or sear the seas with the combustion engine in your soul.

You are bound to a Word more intrinsically than even a Godbound in many ways, developing miracles, Gifts, theurgic invocations and even a True Strife from it as instinctively as an animal hones it’s instincts-and having reflexive awareness and understanding of everywhere it touches. But your true power lies in the celestial mechanisms you can deploy. By reinforcing and fine-tuning the turning of the gears you may strengthen and reinforce reality, sealing Night Roads or quelling the efforts of enemy Godbound even more than the Cold Breath of the Uncreated. By improving your own divine power and wellbeing, you better the concept incorporated in your very being and destine it for greater things in the world. A Made God repairing itself could make Wind blow so powerfully it sheers mountaintops flat, form constant vortexes leading to the bottom of the sea and even form underground storms-yet craft exquisite palaces out of clouds that catch precious treasures from Heaven for example. It may even be possible for you to figure out how to repurpose your systems to generate Celestial Shards repeatedly, though the modifications you would require are far more complex and less straightforward than those needed for Chosen By The One to achieve mass production.

Your mechanisms affect the world on a level more fundamental than mere Gifts; not only can you attempt to block normally unblockable or instant death-inducing divine wrath with ablative shields of yourself but the energy released from your valves pierces through the normally invincible defences of relevant Words and nearly all other defences. And should you catch another between the invincible teeth of your gears, you may attempt to shear their divine powers from them-stealing miracles, Gifts and with enough mighty and cruelty perhaps entire Words from your merciless grip. With experimentation and attempts to channel your nature through True Strifes, existing Gifts theurgy, Word-based self-modification or other experiments you will discover new ways to weave and re-weave creation. In short, you are quite literally fated to be the axiom around which all worlds turn."
809,,800,Hextech,League of Legends ,Magitek,"You're an expert in the field of magical technology. By blending the two fields into one, Hextech accomplishes what neither field alone could. Using liquefied magic as fuel, Hextech can be used to create powerful death-lasers, transforming hammers, impossibly light weapons and aircraft, strength-augmenting bodysuits, the list goes on... Using this new, unlimited (and probably very volatile) power source, you can do just about anything so long as you build your devices sturdy enough to contain all that energy. Or don't, and watch it all explode in grandiose fashion. Whatever works!"
810,,900,Murakumo Unit,Blazblue,Magitek,"The Murakumo Units are artifical humans, created as weapons. As one of them yourself, you have no memories of your creation. Your memories and programming are dormant within your subconcious, but they can be awoken. Murakumo units are capable of summoning Nox Nyctores: Lux Sanctus, a huge sword that transforms into a set of armor and eight blades. The armor allows the unit to hover and fly short distances, as well as boosting defenses, strength, and agility. It comes with a built-in visor that lets the user scan the opponent to identify strengths and weaknesses, access combat diagnostics such as their physical condition, and review battle data to correct mistakes. The eight blades hover behind the user like wings, and move with a thought. Lux Sanctus also allows the user to summon blades made of energy out of seemingly nowhere, allowing a Murakumo unit to pressure an opponent even from far away. However, being a Murakumo Unit comes with a heavy price, for you have an unwanted attachment to a truly mad scientist..."
811,,900,YoRHa Design Specs ,Drakengard and Nier,Magitek,"You know what’s better than being a high-spec magitek android badass? Having your own army of high-spec magitex android badasses. Now you can build one. You know, provided you have the time and resources and the… Anyway, the point is that you’ve got the blueprints for every resource YoRHA has downloaded into your central processor/brain. This means that not only can you build each class of YoRHa android, including outdated models like the Attacker type, but also pods, the various YoRHa weapons, flight units and even the Bunker itself. With enough practice and creativity, you can even design your own android types, like an Infiltration-Type with a built in cloaking device or a Mage-Type capable of using magic without the aid of a pod. 

Of course, the hardest piece to produce are the Black Boxes required for Androids to run. Machine Cores are only available in Nier Universe after the aliens arrive and the Machine Wars begin, however you can substitute those for other materials. Obviously high-tech electronics would be best, but there are other options. You just need something capable of a human level of intelligence and emotional depth…

While we’re on that subject, or at least close by, YoRHa androids count as alive when it comes to magic and whether or not they have souls. If it walks like a human, talks like a human, feels despair like a human and goes insane like a human, it’s a human, at least as far as magic is concerned. They might be mechanical lifeforms but YoRHA androids are still alive.

812,,1000,Unknown Dictator,HighSchool DxD,Magitek,"This one is a big mystery. It holds the abilities to manipulate iron, as well as control and create electronic devices of the modern era, and take the form of different types of electronic devices, created by the wielder. Not much is known about it, except that its power doesn’t fall behind when compared to the other ones in this list."
813,,1000,Leviathan,Atlantis - The Lost Empire,Magitek,"An Atlantean war machine that is well over 3,000 feet long and features destructive beams of energy that can shoot straight through the steel hulls of any ship or submarine on or under the sea, the Leviathan guards the trench leading into Atlantis from any and all who dare to sail its waters. Although only one may remain today, at one point in time Atlantis built their fleets around these massive, lobster- shaped machines... and it seems like you’ve somehow gotten your mitts on the Leviathan’s twin. Now, it is an instrument of your will- programmed to follow your instructions, with even the safeties preventing it from attacking those bearing Atlantean crystals turned off, should you wish it. You can feel free to determine your own parameters for how this Leviathan’s automated systems will operate, and direct it to attack or guard anything you wish. In this day and age, there’s no military force capable of really fighting this thing... and to think, it’s not even the weapon that sank Atlantis in the first place."
814,,1000,Atlantean Spear,Atlantis - The Lost Empire,Magitek,"Referred to as both Gungnir and the Spear of Destiny, this Atlantean relic may look like nothing special compared to the things you’ve seen earlier in this section aside from being an Atlantean weapon of carved stone, but appearances can be deceiving as the spear is tipped with a massive crystal- small compared to the Heart of Atlantis, but far larger than the the fragments that went into making the crystal necklaces. This has given it an even deeper connection to the Heart of Atlantis, allowing one to wield a fraction of the great crystal’s power at will. This gives it several abilities of note, including the ability to force large structures and their foundations, like a castle, to float in the air- as well as telekinesis on a lesser level that allows one to strip away tile flooring with ease to reveal a perilous drop. It can fire blasts of energy powerful enough to send a person flying, and can instantly melt ice- even preserving whatever was frozen inside of it in its original state before being frozen, allowing for the unfreezing of living beings. It can change sizes to better suit its bearer, as well; going from an ordinary spear to something as large as a tower when wielded by a giant. Speaking of- the last, most notable ability that the Atlantean Spear possesses is the ability to create vast giants out of certain materials. In his quest for Ragnarock, Erik Hellstrom created the powerful ice and fire giants he dubbed Ymir and Surtr, respectively, charging them with the destruction of the world. However, there’s one problem- these giants are capable of thought, and while they’re loyal to the one holding the spear, the spear... is a spear, and is thus something that might be taken away. Should no one possess it, it is highly likely that the giants will rebel, or even try to take the spear for themselves- which would obviously be pretty bad. Should it be reunited with the Heart of Atlantis, the spear would also give the Heart of Atlantis the power surge it needs to raise the city back from the bottom of the ocean. "
815,,1200,Egg of the World,Library of Ruina,Magitek,"Singularities, that which make the existence of the City possible. Miracles beyond the limits of science, upon which countless citizens are sacrificed upon altars to maintain. You have obtained the understanding of certain sciences and reality bending theorems to manufacture one of your own. The technology you glean from this will start simple, perhaps as a method to create containers that are bigger on the inside. And yet, it is eager, almost alive (or possibly even literally so, like that of the L Corp before Lobotomy), With research seeing it expand and grow, happy to integrate new technology and exotic stimuli. Perhaps your expansion of space might develop into swords that can cut nearly anything,by simply creating space along the edge of the blade. Regardless of what precisely you make, it can be readily and relatively simply mass produced, or at least the end results can. 

However, the basic expansion and extreme eagerness to integrate technology of this strange and miraculous technology you’ve found pales in comparison to its thirst for blood and suffering. For the Wings of the World throw countless bodies into their everyday research, and it appears that your nature as a Jumper has crystallized that into a law for your own Singularity. Cruelty excites your insight into the strange mix of magic and technology you’ve found yourself the master of, causing it to grow entire new branches to follow down. Perhaps by unsafe experiments with unstable fields, you can make spaces where physical laws are altered. Or begin to expand time as well as space, inserting moments into the course of events. The greater the depravity, the more potent the end results, and if carried out on someone possessing their own supernatural powers, your singularity may grow its own mockeries of them, a blood fiend may see your fields become self sustaining by consuming the vitality of those within it, or that bring those within them under your thrall. Perhaps, with enough time and lives sacrificed on the altar, you might be able to create something that truly changes the face of the City, akin to Lobotomy Corporation’s Seed of Light plan. 

Finally, it appears that your origin title is no longer quite accurate. You’re no longer a mere employee of a Wing, instead being the head of one, other than A, B or C Corp. Countless employees are now yours to command, all dedicated to ensuring that your Singularity derived inventions are produced and distributed across the City. Truly desperate to keep the high standards of living in a Wing for them and their families, they’ll do practically anything for you,"
