1,,Free,Sorcerer ,Baldur's Gate 3,Source,"Let those wizards study their books and clerics pray to their deities for meagre pittance of magical might. Yours is the purest form of the Weave sorcerer, as you draw your power from deep within. Your blood or ancestry (up to your choice) grants you prodigious amounts of magical potential. Although you lack the versatility and wide range of abilities of wizards and the like, none can match your sheer might in arcane prowess. Also, you are the only class who can manipulate the nature of the very spells you cast."
2,,Free,Ki ,Anima Ark Of Sinners,Source,"Life in this world possesses a wondrous energy called ki that allows for incredible feats of strength,agility and martial prowess in general. This grants you a reserve of ki that regenerates over time. You also know several techniques to boost your abilities,extend both the reach and power of your swings etc...You can develop more abilities through time and training."
3,,Free,The Basics,Castlevania - Aria of Sorrow,Source,"Ordinary or not, you shouldn’t enter the Demon Castle without some important basics down. You have basic weapon training, the athleticism and acrobatics necessary to jump a few feet in the air, and a small pool of magical energy within your body that will grow in strength as you do. You’ll need this."
4,,Free,Runes of the Fallen,Elden Ring - Caelid Wilds,Source,"When the Elden Ring was shattered, countless fragments scattered across the Lands Between, and were taken in by those that lived there. From now on, you shall absorb the runes of those whom you slay as well as those who fall around you, to be used at your discretion. Whether you turn them into strength or use them as currency, know that the stronger the target, the more runes it will possess."
5,,Free,System,World of Final Fantasy: Mirage Keeper,Source,From now on you carry this world's leveling system into future worlds. You may also grant it to others at will. It integrates perfectly fine with all other systems you come across.
6,,Free,Fullbringer,Bleach,Source,"Humans with a little something special in their souls. As they were conceived, a shining golden fragment made contact with their newly born soul, a piece of the greatest soul that ever was. This royal shard would bring great spiritual potential later in life but unfortunately, it draws Hollows to attack the new human. Even before they are born. Those that survive are often left scarred by loss, others sacrificing themselves so that this Fullbringer, the name of what you are now, could live. 

Fullbringer’s possess a natural level of spiritual power and awareness, as well as the Fullbring ability. Using it, they can ‘pull’ on the souls of things around them. Move objects through telekinetic force by pulling on their soul, accelerate one’s movement by pulling on the air, even stand on water by forcing it to remain cohesive. With this and the natural uses of Reiryoku, Fullbringers can achieve the power of a Shinigami or Hollow despite their living bodies. Some Fullbringers, who feel affinity for an object, even find a greater power awaiting them. 

Fullbringers are naturally drawn together and doubtless, as a newly awakened Fullbringer, you’ll soon encounter at least a few others of your kind despite your rarity. They’re likely to at least give you a rundown on your abilities, as you have only the most rudimentary skill right now. Show a friendly face and you might get some useful lessons too. 

Note: Fullbring Build in Associated Jump Document. "
7,,Free,Style and Substance,Ultrakill,Source,"I mean, sure, you could just shoot foes normally, but where’s the fun in that? Where’s the pizzazz? The style? Why just shoot them when you could fling them into the air, flip a coin before punting it into the poor fool’s face? You now gain a ‘style’ meter, toggleable at will. For the more awesome and silly shit you do, the higher your score becomes. But to what end? Why, you’ll get paid, of course. Your ‘score’ can be spent like money. A couple a flashy kills in a middle of a fight might be enough for a pizza. But if you take it to extremes, big combos, hitting foes in mid-air while bouncing shots off of coins and constantly swapping weapons, you could probably get enough in a fight to purchase something in the three hundred dollar range. Maybe that doesn’t sound like much to a dimension hopper, but hey, it’s cash for the cost of being cool as hell. It’s a fair trade, if you ask me."
8,,Free,Phantoma Absorption,Final Fantasy Type-0,Source,"Foes you have killed seem to leave behind glowing energy fragments. With a thought, you can draw those fragments close to you and absorb them into yourself, recovering a small portion of magical strength. Regardless of the enemy's size, it appears the energy fragments remain small, a last vestige of their fading life force."
9,,Free,Missions ,Stranger Of Paradise - Final Fantasy Origins,Source,"You can replay through adventures you had as well as take missions that will send you to places you have visited to defeat various enemy types you have encountered, you can also find treasure chests containing loot on missions. You receive rewards when they are completed such as gear, consumable items etc..."
10,,Free,Ability Window,Final Fantasy XVI,Source,"You gain access to the Ability Window. It showcases your various skills, abilities, spells, supernatural powers etc... and allows you to train in their use in a mindspace. Furthermore, you now receive ability points whenever you complete quests, win a battle and level up. These points can be used to either upgrade your abilities, spells, supernatural powers etc... or buy new abilities, spells, supernatural powers... etc. Finally, you can at any time and without any cost reset the points invested in your upgrades and what you have bought to buy other abilities, upgrades etc..."
11,,Free,Quests ,Final Fantasy XVI,Source,"You can now receive quests from other people or taken from noticeboards. They can be as simple as delivering mushroom soup to customers to as difficult as slaying a challenging beast or helping a lost tribe. Regardless, you can expect to receive a reward appropriate to the difficulty of the quest as well as experience that allows you to grow stronger. You also gain a game-like window where you can freely check on your quests."
12,,Free,A Test of Faith,Final Fantasy XV Kingsglaive,Source,"In the distant past, when Astrals had a more prominent role in the world and the Starscourge was not so pressing a threat, Astral and man shared a much closer relationship than that which they possess today. A closer relationship does not necessarily indicate a more amicable one, but in comparison to the state of affairs now, there was certainly a greater deal of interaction between the two parties. It wasn’t unheard of either, for one to receive the blessing of an Astral.

Each Astral contains within them vast amounts of power – the power that the people of Eos calls magic was a gift bestowed upon man by the Astrals after all. Though many of the Astrals lie dormant now, awaiting the arrival of the Chosen King, it may still be possible to obtain a blessing from them, and in turn obtain the gift of magic.

In order to access these abilities however, you’ll have to submit yourself to the scrutiny of an Astral. Which one you choose is up to you...we’ve made notes accordingly on the six Astrals found in Eos at this time. Don’t worry, if you submit yourself to them, they’ll hunt you down sooner rather than later.

The nature of their magic is relatively simple – each Astral governs an element, and by withstanding their trials you’ll attain a basic mastery of said element, learning to wield it as a sword and as a shield. If you’re still curious, the Survey Team did indeed document a list of known Astrals. But while elemental magic is quite rare – really any form of magic is quite rare – there is still some possibility of growth, depending on what type of path you’d like to follow.

Naturally this will cost you a bit, seeing as the nature of these abilities goes beyond what one would consider as “natural magic” for a rudimentary mage in Eos. But of course, this was why the old man’s colleague had given you additional resources after all. You should find that the amount should suffice, but perhaps if it is necessary, you can submit yourself to further scrutiny to the Astrals and attain a greater boon?

The modifications of this line, once purchased, apply for every Astral that you’ve sworn service to. Might want to be careful how many Astrals you swear service to though...like we said, they don’t all get along too well with one another.

13,,Free,Impure Being,Generic Angels and Demons,Source,"Like any other hybrids, you inherited the supernatural power and energy from your parents, but, for a cursed being like you, this is both a blessing and a curse. First of all, starting with the blessing, as a hybrid born of Heaven and Hell, you have access to both the holy powers of your angel half and the infernal powers of your demon half, as well as having reserves to these two forms of energy and being as strong as any full-blooded angel or demon with a potential that surpasses the two races. But, with this also comes a curse: demonic energy and angelic energy are true antithesis and tend to counter each other in a violent way, now, imagine this happening all the time inside your own body. Due to your mere existence being self-contradictory, everytime you try to focus on strengthening just one of your sides or try to use both both angelic and demonic powers at once, the energies within you will conflict with each other, which at the start will causes strain and/or pain on your body but it can evolve to actually cause damage or even kill if you overuse them beyond your limit, so you need to maintain your opposite powers stable if you don’t want to suffer the consequences. Fortunately, if you keep the power of your halves around the same level and use one form of energy at once, you won’t suffer from these downsides, at least, not too much."
14,,Free,Infernal Heritage,Generic Angels and Demons,Source,"You’re the cursed child born from a mere mortal and an actual demon and, as such, you inherited the demonic power from your inhuman parent, making you able of using the same abilities, but in a limited way, as you’re now only around as half as you would be if you’re actually full-blooded demon. In a manner similar to what happens with Nephilims, training and time will help you to enhance your abilities, but your power and potential will always be limited due to your mortal half. Additionally, while you aren’t ageless, you have a long longevity, allowing you to stay in your prime even for a few centuries before starting to grow old, as the result of your enhanced physiology. Unfortunately, unlike what happens with other hybrids, your demon half is particularly influential over you and you’ll need to live with demonic instincts that will try to override any humanity you have."
15,,Free,Heavenly Heritage,Generic Angels and Demons,Source,"As a true offspring of an angel and a mortal, you inherited the divine light from your angelic parent and you’re even capable of using the same abilities, albeit to a lesser degree, as you’re now only around as half as you would be if you’re actually full-blooded angel. Training and time will help you to enhance your abilities, but your power and potential will always be limited due to your mortal half. Additionally, while you aren’t ageless, you have a very long longevity, on par with that of a primordial human, as a result of your enhanced physiology and your own holy power."
16,,Free,Valhalla Candidate,Fate/Legends - Voyage to Valhalla,Source,"Man used to be so much greater in these times, in ways so many can’t really begin to understand. As mystery faded with the fog of ages, so too did this potential but an average warrior is bound to at least have this. Physically you are relatively fit and well trained with the kind of hardiness to brave the cold Norse wilds. Your also capable of dealing with the cold much better, walking unimpeded through snowstorms with nothing but your pants on you. But there is so much greater potential within you.

You possess a set of 40 Magical Circuits, the kind to make you a capable Magus in more advanced times. In addition you have a, for now small, affinity for the unique magics of the Norse. Runes. You can understand their language and though you are a far cry from masters like Odin or Heroes like Sigurd, you have a basic enough understanding to replicate basic effects. Apply yourself and perhaps one day a Valkyrie will come for you."
17,,Free,Child of Akatosh,The Elder Scrolls: Dovah,Source,"Calling Dragons the Children of Akatosh is a bit misleading, as it possesses incorrect connotations. It would be more accurate to refer to them as Shards, the broken off splinters of the mighty oversoul of the time god. But all of that implies that the soul can be returned back to its original state, to have the thousands of shards join together as one. See, whenever you slay another Dovah, you will absorb its soul into yourself, adding it's knowledge and power to your own. This could vary from dragon to dragon, from entirely new Shouts or enhancing your understanding of existing ones, to gaining their understanding of how to utilize their reptilian form for combat, to just claiming their memories as your own. Though this should only apply to the Dovah found here, it can work on dragons from other settings, just with a lesser effect."
18,,Free,Laplace Factor,Mushoku Tensei ~ Jobless Reincarnation ~,Source,"While magical reserves are determined at birth, there are some exceptions like those with a Laplace Factor which allows them to grow and expand their magical reserves to a substantial amount during their childhood. As a jumper you also have this Laplace Factor dialed up to eleven and it won’t disappear once you’re grown. It lets you expand your magical reserves infinitely by simply depleting your magical reserves and allowing it to recover. It also grows with time doubling in amount every year even without doing anything. Furthermore, you also lack the disability of being unable to wear Battle Aura like most beings that have the original Laplace Factor possess. Should you have multiple types of energy pools, this would allow you to combine it into one energy pool that has all their advantages and devoid of their drawbacks though you can split them whenever you wish. By default you have an initial Mana Reserves that would allow you to cast a dozen Beginner-Rank Spells before being exhausted and as a bonus your children and their descendants also gain this version of Laplace Factor. Also if you possess any abilities that provide infinite Mana or extreme Mana regeneration or any similar abilities that stop you from properly using this perk, then you can toggle those abilities/perks on and off."
19,,Free,Psychic Abilities,Horus Heresy: The Primarchs,Source,"You are, even before any other purchases, a very strong psyker. However, your powers most likely manifest as latent abilities you have no particular influence over, and many Primarchs showed an... aversion to psychic powers that further limited their ability to develop them. If you were to deliberately apply yourself, learn to unlock your psychic potential and learn to safely use it, you could easily become an Alpha psyker at the very least. This is your raw potential and barring any other purchases in jump will begin entirely latent and untapped by yourself though it remains entirely possible you can awaken your gifts and reclaim your birthright as a mighty psychic demigod. Constant exposure to the Warp or the gifts of the Dark Gods may even empower you further..."
20,,Free,Aetherius’ Gift        ,Elder Scrolls Online – The Vestige,Source,"You, like everybody else, have magicka. It’s basically mana, a form of energy that mages use to power their spells. You have enough to be an average mage, but with training it could increase."
21,,Free,Hybrid(Tier 1),Marvel: Age of Krakoa,Source,"You’ve got a little something extra in you, a parent or grandparent who was something other than Earthling, or else were modeled on the same by your creator, or you’ve been infused with the essence of such a being. An alien, or some kind of supernatural creature. For free, you can have something akin to Abigail Brand’s half-alien heritage or the Braddock Family’s otherwordly ancestry, something with minor cosmetic effects or a negligible effect on your abilities. "
22,,Free,Connection to the Traveler,The Destiny Universe,Source,"To date, there is no known method of utilizing the Light except through a Ghost’s connection to the Traveler. This is why, even though Risen whose Ghosts have been destroyed could still utilize the Light, once they run out of their internal stores, they cannot use it any more, as they lack a Ghost to recharge their Light. You act as this connection, as the generator to your Risen’s battery. In future settings that lack a Traveler to connect to, you yourself will be the source of Light, ensuring that no matter what, as long as you exist, your Risen will always have the Light."
23,,Free,The Light of Creation,The Destiny Universe,Source,"The Light is a paracausal force whose laws are superordinate to material physics. Whereas normal fire requires heat, fuel, and oxygen to burn, paracausal fire can simply be willed into existence. Purchasing this perk grants you access to the Light along with a basic understanding of how to shape and use it at a beginner’s level. The Light, effectively magic, was the first force encountered by Humanity that demonstrated that the universe was governed by forces much more diverse than they ever could have imagined. While the Light exists in all things, its greatest source is the Traveler: a cosmic entity associated with creation, cooperation, and altruism. As a Lightbearer, you are able to draw on the Light of the Traveler through your Ghost.

The Light is an extremely versatile tool. With it, Guardians are able to exceed the greatest feats of human achievement, with examples including holding a building on their shoulders, winning fist fights with dragons, and wearing street clothes in lieu of armor plate. Merely having access to the Light grants you vastly increased strength and agility. By channeling your Light through weapons and armor, you can bolster their effectiveness with your own strength—allowing otherwise ordinary firearms to kill gods. Beyond this, the Light can be shaped into any physical object its wielder can imagine to form weapons such as swords or spears—with some even being able to create simple machines, like handguns.

The Risen typically wield their Light in the form of three elemental manifestations based off of fundamental forces—those being Solar, Arc, and Void Light, which are explained in more detail in the Paracausal Perk tree.

Beyond its active uses, the Light provides a wide range of innate defenses to its wielders. As a paracausal force, it is impossible for even the Vex to accurately simulate a Guardian’s actions—leading to the oft-repeated aphorism that Guardians make their own fate. As such, anything is possible for a sufficiently skilled, and powerful wielder of the Light. What many—even many Guardians—do not know is that there is more to the Light than just the three major spectrums. While all Guardians tend to favor certain specializations, schools of thought, and classes of abilities, the Light is, in many ways, limitless. The Traveler used it to terraform worlds, the Ghosts use it to heal and resurrect, the Warlock sage Osiris used it to clone himself and explore the infinite Forest, Ikora Rey could fly, and all Guardians become somewhat adept at using it to emote. The sky isn’t the limit here, but rather the lowest point at which one can exist. Given time, study, and experience, your mastery of the Light could transcend anything the Last City could ever dream of."
24,,Free,A Heroic Saga,Scion ,Source,"As mentioned earlier, initially the majority of Scions are not far above normal humans in terms of physical capability. While there is a tendency towards good health or at least hardiness, for the most part they are little changed at a first glance. Their divine powers are relatively modest. It is at this level that it is possible to pass through as much of a solid substance as a single step could take you, negate a single act of harm against the innocent or heal or inflict wounds miraculously as a kind of lay on hands effect. But in addition to those the mundane abilities and aspects of the Scions are elevated by association with their divine parent, inheriting a spark of Ptah’s wisdom or Aphrodite’s beauty. Even now a particularly fit Scion could pick up a car and hurl it hard enough to scatter thugs like bowling pins, while a particularly charming Scion could out short commands like “Freeze!” and a particularly intelligent one’s mind could function as a mental calculator as long as they know all the figures involved. The Purviews and defining abilities of your parent will define which abilities or Purviews are easiest for you to master, but all can be improved with time and great deeds."
25,,Free,Magic Circuits,Fate/Faerie Britain,Source,"Solomon never existed in this timeline, so how did you end up with Magic Circuits? Maybe you’re from outside Faerie Britain, or maybe you’re a freak of nature whose metaphysical makeup just happened to result in these, but you have a lot of Magic Circuits—and high-quality ones, too. It’s more than enough to put your potential in magic above that of Tohsaka Rin in the modern era of Proper Human History, at least in terms of raw mana output."
26,,Free,Runes of the Fallen,Elden Ring - Altus Plateau,Source,"When the Elden Ring was shattered, countless fragments scattered across the Lands Between, and were taken in by those that lived there. From now on, you shall absorb the runes of those whom you slay as well as those who fall around you, to be used at your discretion. Whether you turn them into strength or use them as currency, know that the stronger the target, the more runes it will possess."
27,,Free,Attribute,A Wild Last Boss Appeared!,Source,"The seven Attributes represent seven fundamental forces in the world of Midgard that everyone is attuned to. The attunement to an attribute represents both a strength and a weakness. The being in question will become more resilient to damage that comes from their attribute or sources that their attribute is strong against, but in turn they will become weaker and less effective against those of an attribute they are weak against.

The spells that one gains here will usually be based around these attributes they are attuned to, as well as their general skills will be manifested in some way related to these attributes. However, it is not impossible to acquire powers beyond your starting attribute, but it should be considerably harder for most individuals. Finally, the attunement to an attribute also usually reflects in some ways in their user’s personality. Those attuned to the Fire attribute are usually stubborn and prone to rushing things, those with the Moon attribute can be quite wicked and so on.

Pick your starting Attribute for a free from the following. 

-Wood: The Wood Attribute is associated with the control of nature, primarily by the means of manipulating wood and plant life, although it can also extend to controlling the wind, as it is considered a part of nature. It is strong against the Earth Attribute.

-Fire: As one would expect, the Fire Attribute relates to the manipulation and creation of fire and flames of various effects. It wouldn’t be entirely wrong to say that it is also the most attuned to direct destruction. It is strong against the Metal Attribute.

-Earth: The Earth element is related to the manipulation of the terrain and landscape. It can manipulate the ground if it is soil, but not if it is stone, as that is the domain of the Metal attribute. At its most extreme levels, it can also control gravity.

-Water: The element that controls water, as well as ice. It is also the element that contains the most powerful healing spells, including the ability to resurrect the shortly deceased. It is also the main attribute of the Goddess and her avatars. It is also useful against the Fire element.

-Metal: Also known as Gold element. It is associated with the manipulation of metallic and precious ores, as well as with reinforcing physical substances, such as making one’s body extremely more durable. It is the best counter against Wood Attribute.

-Moon: The Moon Attribute is mainly attuned to darkness and shadows. Its powers are ones based on debiliting one’s enemies, through a variety of effects including curses and other debuff type spells, and canceling their spells. It seems to be especially effective when it comes to interacting with Divine Magic.

-Sun: The Sun Attribute is based around light. While it is similar to the Fire Attribute, enough that its representing Ouroboros may get angry for how much the two are often confused, its powers are different. The Sun Attribute is rich in support skills, allowing those attuned to it to enhance both their allies and themselves to much greater levels."
28,,Free,Level(Tier 1),A Wild Last Boss Appeared!,Source,"As stated above, every being in this world can have their power measured in levels. The only way to increase one’s level in most cases is via the killing of other living beings, which will give you approximately a ten percent of their strength in experience points, or raw mana, in return. As you accumulate this energy, your body will transform and evolve further, increasing one’s stats as well as allowing you to gain more abilities thanks to being able to take more job levels. This growth in power as one increases their level is close to exponential.

Your starting level will be set on what you choose here, which of course may change in time. Your level will also reflect how much power you can draw from the perks listed below, as the more levels you have, the more strong and varied powers you can draw from at the same time based on your stats and job classes, and some super-skills will only reveal themselves as you advance further in your level. This means that some of the special skills of the perks below will only be available to you if you reach a high enough level, and in some cases, new skills may appear beyond what’s described if your level keeps increasing.

As reference, if we were using Eathling human terms, a level 1 being is a child, a level 2 is your average adult man, and a level 3 is your professional athlete. At level 5, you could be considered the strongest man on Earth. But in Midgard, the level 4 is barely the level acceptable for being able to fight. Regular knights and lowly adventures range from level 11 to 30, depending on their strength. From level 31 to the level 70, you would enter the top elite of your country.

You will be starting your time here at level 100 for free. This puts on the first step of transcending what is normally possible for humans in this world, a true living legend. At least among humans, as the more long lived demihumans or even the demons have been known to have many more elements on this level. It is not impossible to destroy a kingdom for you, albeit it would be extremely challenging and dependent on your exact abilities.

29,,Free,Receptacle​ ​of​ ​Faith​,Demon:​ ​The​ ​Fallen,Source,"You are a Demon, but none of your divine might matters if you do not have Faith. The faith of mankind sustained the fallen throughout a thousand years of war, but that fire has faded to a few glowing embers. The degree to which the fallen can store celestial energy is very limited, but having any within their being holds some distinct advantages. A demon is a marriage of celestial and mortal souls, and the demon’s spiritual nature allows them a wide range of passive abilities: the power to see through illusions, resistance to disease and poison, the capacity to hear his name being invoked, the capability to repair the injuries of their host body, the power to manifest their Apocalyptic form, and the power to evoke their Lore. Faith is gathered through followers known as Thralls, but performing miracles can be enough to invoke small amounts of faith from those that witness them."
30,,Free,Core and Madra Channels ,Cradle V1,Source,"You now have a beginner’s core and Madra channels. This core will store the aura you gather from the world, and channel it into your path. Your core begins at the Foundation stage and will progress as you pursue your chosen path."
31,,Free,Magic Circuits,Fate/Hollow Ataraxia,Source,"These are a psuedo-nervous system that spreads itself throughout one's body that allows one to perform Magecraft, converting Life Energy (Od) one naturally produces and the Mana in the air into usable Prana. All Origins except the Servant Origin start with 20 Magic Circuits of average quality for free. "
32,,Free,Heka,Egyptian Mythology,Source,"All great beings of this age possess heka, the divine power through which the gods work their wonders and magic, but which may also be learned by mortal priests, scribes, and witches.

As a mortal, you may have won this power from a god in a game of riddles, been rewarded for service to a particular god, or perhaps stole Thoth’s spellbook with wits and bravery. You cast magic spells by reciting the words of power or conducting rituals and prayers to perform the task you wish.

As a Neter, this power is either yours through birthright, materializing with it from the Waters of the Creation, or perhaps you stole it from another god through a crafty scheme or outright violence. As a rule, you cause magic and spells to happen by performing a symbolic action (such as spitting on the earth to start a shower of rain) or simply making a declaration (“You will forevermore taste all beer as mud.”). You may also work magic by speaking the words of power or carrying out rituals as mortals do.

The use of heka is an exertion upon you; a suitable analogy is to think of it like a muscle which may be weak or strong, tires with use, and grows or atrophies as you develop. Some beings and gods have great heka to bring forth a Sun in the sky, while others do not. Your heka may grow more powerful with practice and experience, but also derives its strength from the adoration and worship directed towards you.

Regardless of the origin of your heka, you begin as powerful as one of the lesser gods or a greater mortal practitioner; performing everyday miracles by speaking the words of power, like turning stones into scorpions, healing a wound with milk, producing illusions of beauty or fear, bidding the river to carry your boat swiftly against the current, or you may perform greater works less frequently, like causing the great Nile to flood countless miles of the land each year.

In time, with your research into the Secret Words, victories and rising strength, and growing worship by other mortals or the tribute of other gods to your strength, your heka may ascend like the sun to equal the stronger gods like Osiris, Horus, Set and so on. Such feats include creating new days of the year from stolen moonlight, making the mountains dance and shudder at your word, and even resurrecting yourself from death to walk the world again after being slain (provided your ahk is formed in the afterlife intact).

Feats of magic far beyond this scale, such as creating worlds and filling them with life or pulling the sun across the sky as the greatest of gods are said to do, are far beyond you for now but may eventually be reached in the long afternoon and twilight of your existence after many thousands of years and the adoration of nations."
33,,Free,Aura,RWBY,Source,"Every living thing, from humans to Faunus and even animals, have a Soul. Only the Creatures of Grimm are soulless and as such can’t make use of this power. For you though? You are now, thanks to the physics of this world, able to use your soul as a powerful tool called Aura. This has a variety of uses.

To begin with Aura at default works as a sort of energy shield against attacks and damage. You wont suffer direct harm while its active, but you will still feel sensations like pain and heat while your Aura is up. It requires training to always subconsciously have a cloak of Aura on. It can even protect you from climate conditions, like walking through a snow storm, though particular extreme conditions will damage Aura like combat damage would.

Aura can also be used to amplify your abilities, like your defence and strength making you essentially superhuman. IN addition to that just possessing Aura gives you a minor automatic healing, able to fix small wounds like scratches in seconds.

All tools and equipment’s are capable of being used as conduits for Aura, allowing a user to be capable of sending out crescent shaped energy slashes from their blade for example. Furthermore it can be used to enhance these things, allowing you to, for example, even use a loaf of bread as an effective weapon. Dust usages is also enabled by Aura.

Those already possessing Auras may also unlock someone else’s Aura. Doing so however takes a toll on the user, potentially weakening their own Aura for a while. Users with particular advanced experience in utilizing Aura may also be capable of other ‘higher-tier’ techniques. Examples would be to use Aura consciously as a shield, create shockwave like attacks, gain extrasensory perception and even sensing and identifying other peoples Auras.

That being said Aura alone does not make you invincible. Continued damage or attacks far
outweighing your Auras capabilities will be able to eventually break it. Using your Aura repeatedly also puts it at risk of decaying, to the point where the user can be left weakened and without Aura until they are able to rest. Aura being completely depleted is visually represented as a coloured sheen glowing along the length of a person's body or with coloured particles flying off the body, indicating that they can now be physically injured. Aura flickering means it is close to being depleted.

Still, it is a versatile tool that has helped humans and faunus alike over the years and now you as well. If you like... there are ways to enhance your Auras capabilities with the below options."
34,,Free,Magical Ability(Tier 1) ,Knight’s and Magic,Source,"Magic in this universe is like programming in ours, so it gets exponentially complex the more powerful a spell is to complete. You now have an average mana control and supply for someone of your age. "
35,,Free,Awakened,Solo Leveling,Source,"As an awakened being, you have the basic qualifications for being a Hunter. That means that you are capable of crossing Gates, fighting monsters, interacting with magical equipment and have an aura that surrounds you emitting mana. The larger your power, the more intense the mana aura is. Barring rare exceptions, such as double awakening or other special methods, Awakened beings are usually incapable of raising their power after they awaken.

Type
Choose a type to specialize in.

Fighter: The class for those with no real specialization, meaning that you don’t get any actual special abilities. On the other hand, your stats are equilibrated and you are able to use most magical items to fight.

Tank: Tanks specialize in taking damage for others, specially for the physically weaker members, as well as having abilities to gather the attention of enemies on you. Your physical stats are high, especially when it comes to absorbing damage, but your magic capabilities are reduced, as well as your agility.

Brawler: In exchange for a reduced ability to use magical items, brawlers gain an enhanced control over their mana to channel it through their own body, able to fight without the aid of any equipment. They lack any range and good capabilities, but make up for it with superior speed and strength.

Rogue: Rogue types specialize in agility maneuvers and long distance combat. As such, their ability to take damage is severely reduced, but they are capable of dealing devastating blows and make up for their low resistance by directly evading blows.

Assassin: This kind of Hunters specialize in using stealth and striking without being seen, usually combining their attacks with special skills that deal augmented damage to unknowing enemies or target weak points. Just like rogues, their main stat is agility, and while they lose in terms of strength, they make up for it with their skills and dexterity.

Healer: Healers specialize in basically just that, using magic to heal the wounds of their comrades. Typically, back-liners, their actual offensive and defensive abilities are low, but are still key for any successful dungeon raid.

Mage: Mages carry out a great offensive potential, usually taking after an elemental school, and while their physical abilities are low, as long as their mana holds up, they have the potential to be far more damaging and vastly more destructive than any other type.

Support: The utility version of the magic caster. Your specialty lies in casting useful spells to enhance the abilities of your allies via blessings, managing the battlefield setting traps or barriers, and casting curses over your enemies to debilitate them.

Note: You start at the level of a D Rank Hunter, or what you would best compare to, whichever is higher. Counter to the description, you can train to increase this if you wish. "

And so, you now have the ability to cast the magic of this wonderful wizarding world. And beyond its sheer versatility and might, you’ll find magic to have more than a few other benefits.

For one thing, you’re quite a bit more durable now, not overtly so but still. You could get struck in the head by a solid ball of iron barreling at you at over a hundred miles an hour, fall from your broomstick, and still be intact enough that with medical help, you’ll be up and about by the end of the week. In fact, so long as the injuries weren’t caused by certain kinds of magic, you can rest assured that wizards and witches will be able to heal it enough that it looked like it never happened in the first place.

You’ll also find that the magic coursing through has rendered you healthier by far. Any of the mundane diseases that plague Muggles may still take hold on you, but they can be just as easily cured as if they were nothing more than a simple case of the sniffles. You also have a hefty resistance against mundane poisons and venoms of every kind, enough that a scorpion sting that would no doubt slay a Muggle could comfortably survive with little more than bedrest, if even that.

is far from immune to bladed weapons, you find that the fists of normal folk feel like children on
your body. You even have some magical potential of note, being capable of manipulating a decent

modern day standards, it allows you to freely redesign your body within the styles of the characters

70,,Free,Origin and Element ,Kara no Kyokai,Source,"Origin and Element are attributes of the soul and one’s deepest being in this world. Everyone has one of each, some people have more, but this just helps you decide on the importance of your own ones. 

An Origin is like a concept, a word, that is at the core of your character. It might describe a secret side of you that you rarely show, it might show influence through every action you take or it might just be something you really love about yourself. Taboo for someone who feels a forbidden love, Worthlessness for someone who seems to be a complete failure, Nostalgia for a man who considers his memories dearly important. An Origin by itself doesn’t have much of an effect, merely lying unawakened. Some kinds of magecraft can eventually build on your Origin, such as a Taboo Origin Holder eventually learning to invest that effect into an item that inhibits the taboos of others. But these usually require quite high level skill and have subtle effects outside of extensive experimentation. You have an Origin of your choice, a normal one that is Unawakened and gives noreal boons but has no real hindrance either. 

An Element is more important, at least for a Magus. It describes something like your affinity for certain kinds of magic, significantly increasing talent in that area. Or rather, most Magi find it quite difficult to learn all but the most general magecraft outside of their Element. Far from impossible but much more inefficient. Most people have an Affinity for one of the five primary elements- Fire, Water, Earth, Air and Ether. These ascribe to much more than just basic elementalism. Fire might cover consumption, energy transfer or fuel. Earth may relate to cultivation and embedding of energy. Water covers the flow and cycle and combination of things. And so on. You have a moderately strong affinity for an Element of your choice. One of the primary five is recommended but if you know of an alternate choice, you can pick one, as long as it’s not superior to the primary five.

Magic Circuits reside within the soul and what is found in the body is a physical expression of them. The number of Magic circuits one possesses is determined at birth and cannot decrease or increase naturally. You gain twenty magical circuits of top quality and a further twenty each time you purchase this option.
74,,Free,Natural Potential ,Lyrical Nanoha,Source,"While magic does spread into the air, especially in the urban areas of magic-using nations and can be used from there, the most common source is a specialized organ called a Linker Core. Linker Cores are actual, physical organs situated in the chest, above the solar plexus, and are what take in and release mana. Naturally, Mages hold a certain potential, which is their capacity for storing and to an extent, actually processing that magic. This capacity can increase somewhat over time and with use, but it’s a very slow, trickling increase and does not exactly match up with what a Mage is capable of.

See, the capacity of a Linker Core to store magical power is graded on a scale going from F to SSS, seen on the table below, but the power of spells are also graded on the same rank. However, a Mage with A-rank power is not necessarily required to cast an A-ranked spell, and on top of that, there is also a skill based rank assigned to Mages on the same scale, which leads to the complicated example of an A-ranked Mage with A-rank power trying to cast a A-ranked spell. What’s the distinction?

While a spell may be A-ranked in power, it does not necessarily consume an A-rank in mana. Certain techniques, calculations and algorithms along with Devices and systems can increase the efficiency of spells, enabling low-potential Mages to cast above their metaphorical weight class. An A-ranked Mage is simply a Mage who is considered able to fight at a A-ranked combat level, usually involving the casting of A-ranked spells, hence the correlation. A-ranked capacity is far more nebulous, appearing to mean simply being able to provide the power for an A-ranked spell without collapsing, which makes it virtually indistinguishable from Mage Rank when it comes to Combat Mages.

But at any rate, to help you get a head start in this world, we’re going to grant you a natural A-rank potential. For your purposes, this is going to be virtually identical to your Mage Rank at first, unless you put the training in to improve your prowess. You may purchase to the indicated rank for the point cost listed below. Remember, raw power isn’t everything, skill is just as much the name of the game as anything, but raw power will certainly give you a leg up.

You can now tap into the Great Green and gain benefits as you are now a Greenskin, this only affects you and other Greenskins."

You have one of these robes demarking your station as one of the Grey, and a sturdy staff topped with the symbol of the Skaven society - the upside-down triangle. The stave also has a bell attached, and the entire thing serves as a passable magical focus for the Skaven Lores.

78,,Free,Gnosis ​(One Dot) ,Mage: The Awakening(1st Edition),Source,"The root of all magic. Gnosis is a measure of how close you are to the supernal world. Higher Gnosis provides many benefits; Rituals will take less time, your mana pool is larger, and you may learn higher levels of Arcana. As a Mage you have one rank in Gnosis free. You may obtain a maximum of five ranks here or over the course of the jump, but cannot reach archmastery (higher than five gnosis) until post­-spark. A higher Gnosis is also a danger as the higher it is the more likely a paradox is to occur when you use vulgar magic. When a paradox is invoked, its power will be equivalent to the level of your Gnosis.

Gnosis limits the level of Arcana you may know at a given time. For ease of reference a chart has been produced below listing what level your Gnosis must be to know a new arcanum (the top row of numbers indicate the order in which you learned your arcana). Your first and second Arcana will always be your ruling Arcana while your third is the one you chose to invest a single free rank into. The rest follow in order as you choose to purchase or learn them.

Maximum Arcana possible by Attained Gnosis

These same limitations on Gnosis and Arcana will persist after the jump, and while you may learn more Arcana and increase your Gnosis, they will always fall within the limitations provided by the chart to the right.

The Vision, or gods eye, appears like a coloured glass orb. It allows those it is gifted to to wield the elemental power of the god that granted it. It is only gained by those who have gained recognition of the Gods by their deeds or resolve. What is known only to the gods though is that every wielder of a Vision is one who can attain godhood and ascend to Celestia.

Your Health and Mana have been quantified, with a head’s-up display that can show you said numbers in the form of hearts or bars to keep track of them. The average Terrarian begins with 50 Health and 10 Mana, representing the rough average for a typical human. You may begin with more than this, depending on any other Perks or bonuses you have towards health and magic. Your body is in peak physical condition, capable of running and jumping for a few hours before you start to feel the slightest fatigue. 

You also possess an Inventory, a special extra-dimensional space within which you can store items. When prepping items for storage in your inventory, you can cause them to shrink down into a small, hand-sized chunk, shaped and colored to represent whatever they happen to be. Similar items can stack together, up to a certain amount depending on rarity. You have 50 ‘slots’ within which to store items or stacks of items, and you can store or retrieve items with just a thought. Upon beating enemies or destroying objects like jars, they will occasionally drop hearts which can heal your health, stars that can replenish your mana, or pre-shrunk items as loot that you can suck into your inventory. 

Finally, you are able to take stored items and use them to craft new items, though many such recipes require a special workbench or station to be nearby for you to actually make an item. However, if the correct station is nearby, and you have all needed materials, you will instantly be aware of whatever item you could potentially make. This starts with Terraria recipes, but it is possible for other recipes to be developed or discovered, given time."
83,,Free,The System ,World Seed,Source,"As the name suggests, this is the system that is in place in Neolife, and will soon be introduced to the real world as well. It allows people to do things such as cast spells, manipulate mana, use runes, cultivate affinities, increase their physical qualities beyond anything they could’ve dreamed of before, and so much more. After reaching the apex of their class or a skill they might possess, and grasping near the level cap of 999, one could throw entire mountains, move at massively hypersonic speeds, ignore whatever damage people with the same power output might dish out, create illusions that are more convincing than reality itself, and affect entire planets or even solar systems.

You gain access to this System for no charge, and may grant it to other people in any settings you might visit in the future. It will adapt itself to anything you encounter, allowing you to cultivate affinities not found in this universe, or create spells and maybe even entire schools of magics focusing on forces absent here. This includes things such as the Kingdom or Ship management menu some people here have access to, though you might freak people out if you use it and they don’t know of its existence. You’ll also gain the ability to introduce this world’s mana, including the System, monsters, Souls, and Auras, to other universes, though the consequences of doing this will fall upon you."
84,,Free,What’s in a Soul? ,World Seed,Source,"To anyone used to other kinds of souls, the composition of the soul in Neolife and beyond might seem strange, signifying the ability of something or someone to grow and learn within the bounds of the System in addition to also being their metaphysical essence. But there’s no need to worry, as instead of ending up with two or more different souls held together only by spiritual duct tape, you’ll be able to decide what aspect of this new kind of soul you’ll take on, either choosing just the best parts or those you desire, combine them into one functional whole better than the sum of its parts, or disregard some parts entirely.

Skill Points are gained by killing monsters or other living beings and are automatically collected from them when the deed is done. Gather enough and you will be able to level up on your adventurer’s card, increasing your base stats and learning or upgrading your existing Skills with your new points. You can’t learn something you don’t have the ability to learn, haven’t been taught or that isn’t part of your class. Ah, and Class? Another thing you’ll automatically receive. This’ll dictate your general stat growth through levelling up here and the sort of skills you can automatically learn and unlock via just skill points.

Certainly there are plenty of Daemons capable of manipulating the elements...but as far as humans go, this ability happens to be rather rare, and appears to be yet another gift of the Crystal.

By attuning your Crystal to a specific element, you can turn it into a source of elemental energy to draw magic out of. The basic modification alone is enough to sustain a spell caster’s needs, but it can be drained dry if drawn upon excessively. Each modification allows you to attune the Crystal to a specific element – though additional modifications to the same element will permit more people to draw upon the Crystal without draining it as quickly.

Desperation breeds strength, and when one is willing to put everything on the line, willing to sacrifice it all for a glimpse of a better tomorrow, the strength that answers them may be more than anything they’ve ever held.

For each time this modification is taken, your magic reserves increase by half of your base reserves.

Unlike inferior modern fuels, Artorium produces no pollution or dangers beyond the amount of energy contained, since it is clearly a completely clean energy source. It’s theorised that Artorium came about from the constant Excaliblasts of young heroines, given the amount of the particle that is generated by Sabers.

102,,50,Soul stone ​,Mage: The Awakening(1st Edition),Source,"The soul stone is a physical fragment of your soul, drawn out from the depths of your spirit during an act of deep meditation. It is not necessarily a stone but it is usually very small and thematically linked with your path. A Thyrssus mage might have a fang or flower, while an Obrimos mage might have a golden ring or rune­-covered key. Whatever it is, its effects are the same as it is a literally fragment of your soul made manifest in the fallen world. The soul stone is a powerful tool and may be used as a strong basis for creating an enhanced or imbued item.

Its true strength emerges only after someone has reached mastery in an arcana. Once this is done, the mage may choose to create a demesne; a ritually prepared area in the fallen world wherein vulgar magic does not induce paradox. The size of the demesne and the arcanum that may be cast there are limited by the number of soulstones that are willingly contributed to it, and the paths of the mages that those soul stones belonged to. A single soul­stone could be used to create a demesne large enough to cover a small apartment or underground chamber. By adding more soulstones from different mage’s (to a maximum of five) the demesne will extend over a sprawling estate or series of underground tunnels. While vulgar magic will not trigger a paradox in these hallowed realms, the spells themselves are still subject to disbelief and subsequent unraveling by sleepers observation.

Should someone get their hands on it however, they will be able to siphon magic away from the soulstones owner freely. Furthermore anyone who possesses it will have an incredibly powerful sympathetic link to its owner; allowing them to cast spells at a great distance on them with an extreme chance of success. Finally, soulstones are highly sought after by all sorts of nightmarish entities, from the Tremere Liches evil spirits and demons of the abyss, all of whom would happily destroy or devour the stone for their nefarious purposes. Soulstones are an extreme vulnerability and must be well guarded, lest their owners suffer terrible fates.

103,,50,Magical tools ​,Mage: The Awakening(1st Edition),Source,"Any mage worth their salt knows the importance of sympathy; like effects like etc. While a mage normally uses the sympathy between their own soul and their watchtower to channel magic, sometimes they require a bit of an extra “boost” to this power. This can be accomplished using physical objects associated with the materials and forms that are representative of their watchtower. You receive one wand, one sword (or knife), one cup, one coin and one mirror. You possess a sympathetic connection to each of these objects, which allow an easier flow of magic from the supernal realms to your hands. This decreases the chance of paradox and increases the effectiveness of your spells whenever you use them in conjunction with your magic."

The transformation process is simple, but the output of the Crystal becomes massive after the modification, allowing it to power a wide variety of constructs, machines, and spell casters all at once. It does however increase the Crystal’s size from something that could be held in your hand to something the size of a person, so be wary of where you store it...and of Niflheim’s likely attempts to steal it.

Outright power and skill is rarely granted, for this option has a vital purpose. To help represent the sheer breadth of characters present, this perk’s various tiers will represent general levels of ability and skill that you can buy immediate access to. 

There will be three tiers described in detail below, attempting to give you the best idea of what you have to work with. In general, each tier will provide an increased level of starting Reiryoku, power and skill in racial abilities and a general skillset. To some extent, you can focus more on certain abilities than others, losing in some to gain in others, but this should remain minor. True specialisation comes from the other options you buy. Skill given here tends to be mainstream and straightforward, with little talent included and no real tricks or unique abilities. You might be a extremely capable Kido caster but someone who buys the Kido perks will be a true master. If you have multiple races, you’ll divide the stated skill/mastery across the different abilities available, since you’ve got a lot more you need to study. 

Optionally, you can also gain an existing and fairly important place in the setting with each tier. This can help you represent being an established Captain, Espada or similar individual, with a history with the other main characters. You can’t have more than minor effects on the story nor replace anyone vital to the overall plot. 

Vice Captain:
A capable and well-proven member of your kind. You’re not the elite but you are far above the
common pack. You’re a dangerous fighter, with likely years to decades of experience depending on your species life expectancy. You’re generally capable with most of your race’s special techniques, a Shinigami would have decent skill in each of the four primary arts of Zanjutsu, Hoho, Hakuda and Kido. 

A Shinigami would be a weaker Vice Captain, perhaps new to the role. A Hollow would be at least Adjuchas class, possibly one of the older and weaker kinds of Arrancar that pulled off their own masks, such as the Privaron. A Quincy could be a lower ranked officer in the Quincy King’s army or match the traditionalist Ishida Uryu around the time he went to Hueco Mundo. A Fullbringer would have reached full affinity with his object of power, such as most members of Xcution and an Artificial Spirit could match any of the above. "

Captain:
Powerhouses of the spiritual worlds, this is the divide that separates the weak from the strong. Those at this level are the Captains, Espada and Stern Ritter of their kind, albeit the weaker and less experienced members of these august ranks. As one of the longer lived races, you may very well be a centuries old warrior, with a well rounded understanding of both combat and your races’ unique abilities. Highly capable in most areas, from combat to technique to racial magic. A Bankai, if not fully mastered, or Resurreccion is expected at this point. Your spiritual power has reached what most would consider the level of an ‘average’ Shinigami Captain and you’re likely to be a frontline fighter for any faction you join.

Some examples are thus. A Shinigami might be equal to Captain Komamura or Captain Hitsugaya early in the story, powerful but hardly the cream of the crop as they are now. A Hollow would be one of the lower Espada, an Adjuchas made Arrancar through the Hogyoko, such as Grimmjow or Nnoitra. Of the Quincy, the lesser Stern Ritter such as Candice Catnipp or Bazz B are a good example. Of the Fullbringers, Ginjo before he takes Ichigo Kurosaki’s powers is a capable representative and Artificial Spirits could look to powerful Bount like Jin Kariya or enhanced souls like Nemu.

112,,100,Power Levels,Seven Deadly Sins,Source,"In this series, a character’s Power Level measures their overall power level and is separated into three categories-
-Magic, which measures magical power and the strength of all Powers you possess from this jump. 
-Strength, which measures overall physical ability such as strength, speed and durability. 
-Spirit, which measures the control and willpower a person possesses. 

These three categories each have a certain number of points devoted to them which together make up the total score. A man with 10 points in each category would possess an overall Power Level of 30. This is by no means a hard measure and Power Level can change due to factors such as emotional state, physical and mental condition, compatibility between two fighters and overall skill in battle. Some of these factors, such as the influence of the environment on a battle or the strength of certain abilities that do not rely on raw power, cannot be measured at all and thus simply having a higher Power level does not mean certain victory. 

The strength of the average human adult is around 20-30, usually possessing a 0 in the Magic
category. To be a Holy Knight, you must have a Power Level of at least 300 and thus you gain that amount for free. Power levels are not slowly increasing measures. An average Holy Knight can cut through tens of trees with the pressure wave created by swinging their sword, instead of possessing just ten times the strength of the average man. A difference of just 1000-2000 points overall is often enough to render a battle against that stronger being suicidal. The Seven Deadly Sins and the Great Holy Knights, the general strongest characters for the first quarter of the series, have Power Levels in the upper 2000 to low 3000 ranges. The villains from the rest, the demonic Ten Commandments, start at 24,000 and go up to over 60,000. Near the end of the series, power levels can go into the hundreds of thousands, though they become much more inconsistent than earlier on. 

You begin with a Power Level of 300, the basic level for any full Holy Knight, divided between the three categories as you please. You may pay 100CP to get up to an additional 5000 points to your overall Power Level, which may be divided as you see fit as well as bought multiple times.

For 100 CP (or free) you are lucky enough to be Offspring gone stigmatic, an otherwise ordinary human slightly likely to manifest minor paranormal abilities that saw the activities of demons or the God-Machine and awoke a new set of powers. You can learn to use Embeds, sense the God-Machine’s machinations innately and manipulate Aether in unique ways-but generally to a lesser scope than true Embeds and Exploits. Alternatively you can be a Fractal, which in addition to the above can see through their demon parents’ cover, and a few additional unique abilities. Keep in mind that while more powerful, Fractals are also more likely to attract the God-Machine’s attention.

Alternatively, for 200 CP you may be a long lost, or even hypothetical, entity: A Nephilim, inheriting much more of your demonic nature. Apart from having access to Exploits as well as Embeds, they also have a crude version of the demonic form power. They can also absorb Aether as demons do. Unfortunately with such power comes instability; activating their demonic form or learning new Embeds/Exploits causes spiritual damage to them.

At times when all other magic fails, the Thaumaturge will still have a miniscule supply of magic, something to call on as a last resort.

But this Aether, extracted from one’s own body, is typically only usable with the use of a conduit and a mold. To even use it properly, one would need to be capable of manipulating arcane energies on a fundamental level.

Starting off, whenever you find yourself in desperate situations, you’ll always retain a miniscule amount of usable energy for magical purposes.

128,,100,Attribute(Second),A Wild Last Boss Appeared!,Source,"The seven Attributes represent seven fundamental forces in the world of Midgard that everyone is attuned to. The attunement to an attribute represents both a strength and a weakness. The being in question will become more resilient to damage that comes from their attribute or sources that their attribute is strong against, but in turn they will become weaker and less effective against those of an attribute they are weak against.

The spells that one gains here will usually be based around these attributes they are attuned to, as well as their general skills will be manifested in some way related to these attributes. However, it is not impossible to acquire powers beyond your starting attribute, but it should be considerably harder for most individuals. Finally, the attunement to an attribute also usually reflects in some ways in their user’s personality. Those attuned to the Fire attribute are usually stubborn and prone to rushing things, those with the Moon attribute can be quite wicked and so on.

Pick your starting Attribute for a free from the following. Optionally, you may gain a second Attribute for an extra 100 CP, to be like the Goddess’ own avatar and gain the benefits of both at the same time, also from the below selection.

-Wood: The Wood Attribute is associated with the control of nature, primarily by the means of manipulating wood and plant life, although it can also extend to controlling the wind, as it is considered a part of nature. It is strong against the Earth Attribute.

-Fire: As one would expect, the Fire Attribute relates to the manipulation and creation of fire and flames of various effects. It wouldn’t be entirely wrong to say that it is also the most attuned to direct destruction. It is strong against the Metal Attribute.

-Earth: The Earth element is related to the manipulation of the terrain and landscape. It can manipulate the ground if it is soil, but not if it is stone, as that is the domain of the Metal attribute. At its most extreme levels, it can also control gravity.

-Water: The element that controls water, as well as ice. It is also the element that contains the most powerful healing spells, including the ability to resurrect the shortly deceased. It is also the main attribute of the Goddess and her avatars. It is also useful against the Fire element.

-Metal: Also known as Gold element. It is associated with the manipulation of metallic and precious ores, as well as with reinforcing physical substances, such as making one’s body extremely more durable. It is the best counter against Wood Attribute.

-Moon: The Moon Attribute is mainly attuned to darkness and shadows. Its powers are ones based on debiliting one’s enemies, through a variety of effects including curses and other debuff type spells, and canceling their spells. It seems to be especially effective when it comes to interacting with Divine Magic.

-Sun: The Sun Attribute is based around light. While it is similar to the Fire Attribute, enough that its representing Ouroboros may get angry for how much the two are often confused, its powers are different. The Sun Attribute is rich in support skills, allowing those attuned to it to enhance both their allies and themselves to much greater levels.

The only way to increase one’s level in most cases is via the killing of other living beings, which will give you approximately a ten percent of their strength in experience points, or raw mana, in return. As you accumulate this energy, your body will transform and evolve further, increasing one’s stats as well as allowing you to gain more abilities thanks to being able to take more job levels. This growth in power as one increases their level is close to exponential.

Your starting level will be set on what you choose here, which of course may change in time. Your level will also reflect how much power you can draw from the perks listed below, as the more levels you have, the more strong and varied powers you can draw from at the same time based on your stats and job classes, and some super-skills will only reveal themselves as you advance further in your level. This means that some of the special skills of the perks below will only be available to you if you reach a high enough level, and in some cases, new skills may appear beyond what’s described if your level keeps increasing.

As reference, if we were using Eathling human terms, a level 1 being is a child, a level 2 is your average adult man, and a level 3 is your professional athlete. At level 5, you could be considered the strongest man on Earth. But in Midgard, the level 4 is barely the level acceptable for being able to fight. Regular knights and lowly adventures range from level 11 to 30, depending on their strength. From level 31 to the level 70, you would enter the top elite of your country.

For 100 CP instead, your level would be in the 200s. Now these are what could be called walking strategic-level weapons, capable of threatening entire kingdoms. Your running at this level is capable of putting you above the speed of sound. Your arcane magic would be able to burn down an entire forest in one go. Attacks with a sword could cleave the land itself leaving sizable fissures in the very earth.

In many other worlds, these individuals would be quite deserving of the title of final bosses. In an early 21st Century Earth, they would be able to fight against armies alone, although they would still be destroyed if they face nuclear weapon strikes.

In modern Earth’s terms, each of them would be comparable to the military of one of the major developed countries, discounting any nuclear arsenals. Albeit at this level, it is possible that a monster of this caliber may even survive a nuclear strike with severe damage if they are focused enough in defense or vitality.

Originally, the Seven Luminaries, the leaders of the demon invasion on the human countries, were thought to be of level 300. Of course, there are several among that group that surpass that level, and many more among the demonkind who sit around it.

Around this level, is it actually possible to follow a fight between those at the top of the world, those at level 1000, going all out. Even if they were attacked with a small scale nuclear weapon, they wouldn’t be killed and they would still be able to fight.

Even for those at level 100, it would be almost impossible to follow their movements if they are fighting seriously. Their resistance is such that, if the strongest of Earth’s nuclear weapons was to be detonated directly over them, they wouldn’t die from that.

Of course, there was an abnormal generation when many individuals approached this level, but that’s a thing that was unique to the generation of 200 years ago thanks to a certain Flugel.

This is the level that is considered the pinnacle of personal strength. While they lack the power to destroy the planet on one hit, those on this level can make it into a dead rock in an extremely short time. Capable of moving in the realm of ‘stopped time’, in which they move so fast that they perceive the rest of the world as if time had stopped, they could wipe out entire nations or even continents in a single move, and even if all the nuclear weapons of the modern world were to be launched at them, at best they would manage to make them suffer some small damage.

Still, even if your level cannot advance more than this via the conventional laws of this world, this is not the end of your growth. If you were to somehow train your stats even more after reaching this level, you might become a fearsome monster similar to or even above the majority of boss monsters, capable of fighting groups of level 1000 on your own.

With this, the amount of cursed energy you have utterly dwarfs that of almost any other sorcerer. While most sorcerers would completely exhaust themselves pulling off one powerful technique, you could perform the exact same feat a good several times over and still have energy to spare. For 300 CP, your levels of cursed energy are on par with Yuta Okkotsu, someone whose reserves exceed even that of Gojo’s by a significant margin. Although you can still run out of energy, it’d take you well and truly pushing yourself to even come close to that. For 400 CP, the amount of cursed energy you possess is at the very least double that of the prior option – the only person who could match you in terms of your reserves would be Sukuna.

These generate magical energy for the Magus to use as well as giving them the ability to manipulate it to actually cast magical spells. These tend to vary in quality and quantity, with the better of both of these being effectively better at Magecraft when excluding raw skill or other means. About 20 is about average for a Magus, which is what you start off with, of quite high quality. If you like, you can have 30 more for 100CP, and can pay for as many as you like.

There are eight Mantra affinities, Wrath, Violence, Vanity, Sloth, Melancholy, Lust, Greed, and Pride. Without a Mantra Affinity, you are denied the strength of emotion, and must subsist on ordinary Mantra. By taking this perk, your safe Mantra Level is set to 2, and you always count as having a minimum of Mantral Level 1 for purposes of determining such feats."
150,,100,Parchment & Ink,HighSchool DxD,Source,"Devils are closer to humanity than many other Factions, though this isn’t necessarily out of benevolence. By establishing a business arrangement, a Devil can gain more standing and power from giving a particular service to a human, nowadays the tasks these days usually boil down to ‘babysit my children’ or ‘dress up in cosplay for me’. Both parties have to agree to it and the Devil has to fulfill their end of the bargain to the satisfaction of the contracted, but once they do, they gain both more standing in Devil Society and a very slight increase in power. It would take decades if not centuries of contract work to reach the level of a Great Satan or legendary Devil this way, but you know what they say about investments, right?"

153,,100,Cursed Blessings Upon the World(Authorities) ,Fate/Strange Fake,Source,"Finally, there is your Authority. An Authority is a special ability to command the World granted to the Gods. They are abilities that command over a specific concept or Law of the world, and for Divine Spirits that were born from the personification of certain phenomena, it would also be the concept that they embody. Authorities manifest through the associated concept they command over, and through that concept they allow the user to achieve basically any effect as long as they can frame it through the concept associated with the Authority, and pay the appropriate magical energy price for the scale of the effect. Unlike regular magecraft or effects like Noble Phantasm, it doesn't require any other work, previous set up or via chantings, rituals and True Name releases, besides paying the energy cost for the effect. As logic would dictate, the more far reaching and/or powerful the effect, the costlier it will be. For example, a goddess of love could charm not only people, but also every grain of powder in a barrage of missiles, so they lose the ability to explode, or charm the leylines in order to use incredible amounts of mana at the expense of the land’s health.

You may also use your Authority as a form of magecraft from the Age of Gods, with lesser
cost but also a lesser scope, or even pass this down as a powerful magecraft to your ‘priests’, either boosting their innate magecraft or granting them spells with you as a ‘Foundation’.

You gain two Authorities with the purchase of this option, and may purchase more for a surcharge of 100 CP per extra two Authorities. After all, the Goddess Ishtar had at least seven of them.

With one purchase of this perk you may choose one of the following: the ability to derive greater amounts of energy from your fuel sources, allowing even a mountainous being to survive on a diet of scattered groups of sailors or whatever it is you actually eat; the ability to eat and metabolize unusual things, such as rocks, plastics, and pretty much anything else you can fit in your gullet; and finally, the ability to derive energy from something that isn’t even physical over a long period of time, such as human emotions or even souls! This can be purchased up to three times, each time giving you one of the described dietary plans- in the case of the “non-physical subsistence” option, you will need to choose what you will feed upon and whether this is benign (such as passively feeding off of emotions) or harmful (literally swallowing people’s souls).

162,,100,Evocation,A Certain Magical Index,Source,"You’re proficient in manifesting elements, energy, or something along those lines to attack your enemies quickly. Despite the fact that an incantation or a focus is often used among magicians, you don’t seem to feel the need to rely on them. As such, the inherent disadvantages of magic are lessened, and you don’t need as much preparation time to create a sword of fire, for example. Choose one or more elements to specialise in that befits your theme. You can still try to manipulate others, but they will be a lot weaker than your specialties. Also, the more specialties, the less powerful each of them is. Though evocation is the form of magic closest to what those with talent have, it is still slower than what an esper of equivalent skill could produce."

Through this perk, you gain access to a well of magic that would be considered a bit above average for a human magic wielder. It would allow a water based mage to control a pond’s worth of water, or a fire wielder to burn several normal human opponents to death in quick succession without exhausting themselves to the point of burnout, though they would be very tired.

On purchase, your hands gain the abilities of the Dark Hand, able to command black energy to enhance your melee attacks or project a weak shield of darkness from your hands. Enemies vulnerable to darkness will feel the full fury of your frightening fists. The shield on the other hand has no particular weaknesses or strengths, defending against everything to a reasonable degree but failing against anything truly strong."

169,,100,The Spoils Of Victory,MtG - Shandalar,Source ,"Most mage-duels in Shandalar still obey one of the old rules - each combatant must risk part of their magical knowledge in a fight, and the winner will claim the offered spells as their prize upon their victory. But Shandalar is but one place of many, and in the countless worlds you might visit in the multiverse one cannot rely on such gains... except you still can. Any time you emerge victorious in a fight, you will receive a new spell of some kind to commemorate your victory. This is not a spell taken directly from your opponents as it would be during Shandalar’s mage-duels, rather it is a sudden burst of insight that provides the reward. The nature of your new arcane knowledge is thematically appropriate for the battle you fought. Defeating a mighty dragon could see you learn a new spell that emulates that dragon’s fiery breath, for example, or you could even master a new summoning ritual to create a magical copy of the dragon to fight on your behalf."
170,,100,Mana Seism,MtG - Kamigawa,Source ,"Like with some other arts in the world this one draws power from the land and not the spirits or self. As some tell the tale, this is a power that gives no care for the future as it is deeply rooted in the immediacy of humanity. This power drags the Mana trapped within a land out and creates a charge of Mana which can be used to perform great feats of magic, however if this were to be used on a land that couldn’t be normally tapped by a shaman or a wizard for Mana then it will ruin the land as it takes all of the plant life within four miles to fuel a single mote of potent Mana and the land will only recover decades after the event in question. On Mana rich lands this magic can be used to gain more out of them at the side effect of it taking twice as long for the land to recover, during which you can pull even more Mana out of it but it would be affected as if it weren’t a Mana rich land at that point."
171,,100,Mana Geode,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Source ,"What a beautiful trinket! This simple trinket is a rainbow colored stone in a pendant, while some might think this to be a mundane accessory you can tell otherwise. This is a powerful artifact that can generate a land’s worth of mana of any color. In addition to this potent ability you can also use it to see the future to a certain degree, by looking at the stone you can see possible future events depending on what colors you focus on, though these events are blurry and may not always come to pass."
172,,100,Awakening ,Warbreaker,Source ,"The magic of Nalthis, each person has a single spark of divine Investiture, their Biochromatic Breath, which can be transferred to others and used to animate once-living matter. This drains color from the surrounding area or objects turning them grey, in fact, an Awakener cannot use their Breath if surrounded only by grey or white things.

Animal life (yes, including people) animated by Breath become monochrome Lifeless, and can follow complex and varied instructions. Plant-based things, like textiles, are animated with a single core command they will try to follow without distinction, but the Breath can be reclaimed when you are done with it. Even sheets and rugs will imitate the human form, like forming giant hands, and dolls and such are easier and cheaper in Breath to Awaken.

It takes roughly twenty-five Breath to animate a straw doll, fifty to create a Lifeless, only one if the corpse is properly prepared.

There are ten Heightenings, levels at which Awakeners develop secondary powers based on how much Breath they hold. Each purchase of this perk advances you one Heightening.
- First: Fifty Breath, enough to create one old-flavor lifeless or two decent plant-based entities. Adds a decade or so to life expectancy and grants a sense for Breath/life, letting you feel people and gauge how much Breath they have. Entry level for Awakeners, where most dabblers fall off.
- Second: Two hundred Breath, gain perfect pitch.
- Third: Six hundred Breath, perfect and instant identification of precise hues of color.
- Fourth: One thousand Breath. Life Sense reaches its maximum range and sensitivity.
- Fifth: Two thousand Breath. Agelessness. Awakeners at this level do not age, and are immune to all disease and most poisons. Colors within a hundred yards become far more bright and vivid.
- Sixth: Three thousand five hundred Breath. At this point you gain an intuitive and instinctive awareness of basic Awakening commands and the ability to use far more complex commands.
- Seventh: Five thousand Breath. You can see auras around objects in which Breath has been invested.
- Eighth: Ten thousand Breath. You gain the ability to break and override commands in moments instead of days. This takes intense focus and is exhausting to do.
- Ninth: Twenty thousand Breath. You don’t have to touch things to Awaken them, as long as your voice can reach them. You can Awaken metal and stone and other inorganic materials.
- Tenth: Fifty thousand Breath. You can impart commands mentally, drain objects of color all the way to white and create a rainbow aura of light around white objects.

173,,100,Born From Greatness,BlazBlue: Phase Zero,Source ,"Magic, as it may or may not surprise you to know, moves in family lines more often than not. From great wizards to their children, and occasionally to their students. Would it surprise you to know that two children belonging to one of the three scientists responsible for the Great Dark War both possessed magical powers in excess of the norm? One gathered magic to her, and the other nullified it. One of those children, who could become Nine of the Ten Sages, had a daughter who surpassed even her. Common ability or otherwise, those you teach, those you care for, and take under your wing, are just a tad bit prone to gaining rare powers and skills. With such an amazing mentor, how could they ever be ordinary?"
174,,100,Mixed Blood,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Source ,"The blood of beasts lies thickly in your veins, the sign of Oni-born ancestry in your family line. You
might be the direct child of an Oni coupling with a human or a distant descendant, part of a family of
Mixed Bloods who has awakened more of their heritage than normal. It’s gifted you with enhanced
physical abilities, enough to punch through brick walls or outrun light cavalry with ease. Your
constitution makes most poison of little danger, particularly so when it comes to alcohol, taking vast
amounts of the stuff to get tipsy. Apparently, this heritage also makes drink taste even more
wonderful than normal. Your blood makes it easier to understand and get along with even full Oni, as well as other mixed bloods, though this can be turned towards the more malicious purpose of
making it easier to track and find them for a hunt. You’re one of the lucky ones who does not suffer
overtly from any inversion impulses, your oni blood remaining quiet even in battle and not causing
violent rages. 

While it has not developed yet, the final gift of your heritage is that you have the potential to
develop a unique power from your ancestor. Further increases physical abilities, a death resistant
body, stealing heat or energy with a glance, telekinesis and many more abilities are all possible due
to the variety of Oni that call Japan their home. In time, you’ll gain access and continually strengthen
one such ability, growing alongside you as your magical power and mystery increases. 

Optionally, you may treat this as an option to be a full Oni but a very weak one, the main differences
merely being that you have the horns and inhuman appearance of an actual Oni. "
175,,100,Inhumanity,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Source ,"More than many countries, Japan was filled with mystery. Spirits, demons and monsters populated
these lands, feasting on the superstitions of it’s people. You’re just another of these hungry beings, a
youkai who calls Japan it’s home. Through this option, you are able to choose a inhuman creature
from Japanese folklore and make that your new kind. You’ll likely gain an inhuman form because of
it but will retain the ability to transform into a seemingly normal human at any time, allowing you to
disguise your nature at least cosmetically. The powers you gain from whatever race you choose are
not especially potent. It’s likely you’ll have superhuman physical abilities, enough that an ordinary
person has no real chance of fighting you, and several minor magical powers as well. A kitsune who
can naturally craft illusions and create fox-fire to burn hunters is a fine example. Whatever choice
you make, you will grow stronger and gain more varied abilities over time. While this has a limit far
below that of the Three Great Monsters, such as Tamamo no Mae or Shuten Douji, a few centuries
would make you a threat to a human army, a terror with potential magical powers. 

Oddly enough, it appears that dinosaurs are also able to be chosen through this option, even though
they’re not anything like a traditional youkai. The average Japanese villager probably won’t care
much for the difference between an Oni and a Tyrannosaurus Rex though. "
176,,100,Age of Monsters(Half Blood),Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Source ,"In the Age of Gods, humanity is just one of many great kinds of creature. Far from the rulers of the
planet, they share with many powerful creatures. Some as intelligent as they, some relying only on
raw power and strange abilities to get by. At times, these creatures can even mate with humans to
produce half-breeds with traits of both, a not uncommon sight in ancient times. The following perk
offers several different tiers to represent different species that you may become a part of.

You are the product of a human mating with a monster of some kind, an inhuman creature. Djinn, dragons, demons, spirits and many more have all taken part in this practice before. Most noticeable
are the physical traits it’s given you, as you appear as a human with several monstrous features. Large fluffy ears and tails, scales across your limbs and horns from your brow, that sort of thing. The
powers you gain are relatively minor. The child of a Djinn might have limited clairvoyance, a
resistance to the elements and the powers of spirits, as well as somewhat increased magical power. Some of these powers could be improved in time, especially with magical knowledge, and some may
not."

More circuits means more input and output of magical energies, though excessive use heats up and tires a human body due to theforeign nature of the powers involved.

Not always the situation and while this option will not get rid of that problem, it will serve to alleviate it greatly. Every purchase of this option adds a ring of stone obelisks in a circle around your tomb, each obelisk 5 kilometres away from the tomb. So long as you stay within the circle created by this ring of pillars, you will benefit from any effect that would require you to stay within the tomb, even ones you add or create yourself. Every additional purchase adds another ring of Obelisks, another 5 kilometres out from the first. (CG Note: Requires base Tomb - Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings first. Obviously.)

As long as the user accepts ownership of the charm, the powers of the pearl affect you as long as you are relatively close by, even if you set it down. When your emotions are too high, the pearl turns blue and cools your passion down. On the flipside, when the user becomes depressed, the gem turns red and makes him or her feel more upbeat. However, if the pearl is close to the opposite element of its current process (such as fire when it’s blue or water when it’s red), the user’s emotions become chaotic and uncontrollable. Furthermore, if the crystal becomes too overloaded and shatters, all of the concentrated, magically-enhanced emotions splash out onto the user and make him or her go berserk with passions. Fortunately, once the emotions are used up, the user will fall unconscious and gradually recover.

Spirits for mountains and rivers, spirits for forests and fields – all of them have had ample time to develop their spirituality.

You’re a bit of an odd case, while you’re a bit newer than the other guardian spirits, you still benefit from a similar boost to your magic capabilities. In addition to this, whenever you travel to a new area, you’ll be able to glean a little bit of information about it from the animals nearby. You could try talking to plants too, but you have to realize that plants generally don’t give you very much information, being static as they are.

187,,100,Fed by Fear ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Source,"You can replace all of your “needs” with fear or even just surprise, such as popping out behind a gravestone and shrieking at someone. Regularly terrifying or surprising people can entirely substitute your need for food or drink, though of course you can still drink and eat. You need not harm the people you feed off either, merely giving someone a good fright is enough to sate you for a week."
188,,100,Nautilus Shell ,Peter Pan,Source,"Every mermaid has her own nautilus shell that determines your rank and standing. For 100 additional CP each time, you can increase your nautilus’ size to gain a better position in the snobbish mermaid hierarchy. Just make sure you don’t have one larger than the Queen's, who starts out five sizes above you; that is just not allowed. Although most mermaids are only concerned with the cosmetics and snob potential of their nautiluses, the shell has other uses. If the shell is large enough for a mermaid to squeeze in, sleeping inside heals a mermaid's health. By sitting on it like a cushion, your water magic is strengthened, and by blowing into it like a musical instrument your singing power is amplified; the level of the enhancement increases with the size of the nautilus. If you are not a mermaid, expect mermaids to try to take it from you.

pick one element - a base component of the World - to have a magical affinity for. All
magic pertaining to this element - symbolically or literally - comes significantly easier.
Most mages have affinities relating to one of the Five Great Elements (fire, water, earth,
air, and ether) though some have more esoteric affinities like Imaginary Numbers or more
mundane affinities like Swords, so you may choose whatever you’d like."

Manipulators of Aqshy one and all, the Bright Wizards hold some form of flame with them at almost all times. Where do they get the fuel? Why, from the Wind of Fire itself.

Ghyran is at its height in summer and its lowest point in winter, and so are you. While your powers in particular do not fall below their base in the cold months, the vibrant summer sees you burst with scintillating jade energy, your spells of life and nature costing somewhat less to cast."

The second: Warpstone Tokens, that foul green rock melted down and used to mint coins. Skaven currency is simple, in comparison to the surface: The Empire has their gold crowns, silver shillings, and brass pennies; Bretonnia has their ecus and denniers; even the beard-things deal in gorls, silverns, and izors. The skaven have the one mint of token, incredibly valuable regardless of its amount and always printed with the three-sided sigil of the Horned Rat.

Unlike most adventures in Hyrule, the crystal currency is absent, and instead there’s a new item to collect: the mystical Force Gems! Force gems all contain magic within, allowing them to be used to empower mystical artifacts or repair broken spiritual items. You’d need quite a lot of them, though, like two-thousand to re-empower the Four Sword to break just one of Vaati’s barriers. Now, you can find these gems in future jumps as well! Aside from those scattered around, you can earn more through combos in battle. The bigger the combo, the more force gems you get!"

For most it would become a simple trinket, good for little other than decoration. However should someone ‘worthy’ pick up one of these Visions, they have a chance of reawakening it for themselves. You have collected several dead Visions. Seven in fact, one for each element. Each jump you will receive another seven, which you can distribute around to see if someone worthy awakens them."

Did the moon lie with an ancestor of yours, or were they perhaps seduced by a powerful dragon, or one of the Kami? Whoever you are descended from, a fraction of their power lies within you. Look in the notes for details on various bloodlines you can choose from. Each purchase of this perk grants you one bloodline.

Such a thing would weaken him immensely… unless Richter utterly curbstomped Dracula and thus the castle had less power to work with. As the heroes of the world are more successful, you will find your own affinity for light and the power of techniques that utilize it to rise. In an era where evil is vanquished and there are still heroes amongst men you would find yourself empowered by this light, made stronger by all that is good in the world. Be thankful that the opposite is not true, that you would be made weaker during eras of darkness, where monsters roam the land and crush all that oppose them."

218,,200,Average Power Levels(Elite Captain)        ,Bleach,Source,"For the most part, what will be present in the perk sections below will focus on new abilities, amazing talents and great potential. Outright power and skill is rarely granted, for this option has a vital purpose. To help represent the sheer breadth of characters present, this perk’s various tiers will represent general levels of ability and skill that you can buy immediate access to. 

There will be three tiers described in detail below, attempting to give you the best idea of what you have to work with. In general, each tier will provide an increased level of starting Reiryoku, power and skill in racial abilities and a general skillset. To some extent, you can focus more on certain abilities than others, losing in some to gain in others, but this should remain minor. True specialisation comes from the other options you buy. Skill given here tends to be mainstream and straightforward, with little talent included and no real tricks or unique abilities. You might be a extremely capable Kido caster but someone who buys the Kido perks will be a true master. If you have multiple races, you’ll divide the stated skill/mastery across the different abilities available, since you’ve got a lot more you need to study. 

Optionally, you can also gain an existing and fairly important place in the setting with each tier. This can help you represent being an established Captain, Espada or similar individual, with a history with the other main characters. You can’t have more than minor effects on the story nor replace anyone vital to the overall plot. 

Elite Captain:
The elite of each faction, albeit not the absolute peak of power. With this option, you’ll no doubt be considered quite famous, as either a brilliant young prodigy or a true veteran of nearly a millennia of action. Most core skills, to combat and racial techniques, are at the level of an expert user. In terms of Reiryoku, you’d have about twice as much as the average Captain and you’d be considered to have some level of mastery of your racial release state or unique power. 

Examples of this level are sparing but eye-catching. Byakuya Kuchiki of the Shinigami is an excellent showcase of the sort of overall level of skill and superb power available. A mighty warrior, skillful magician, intelligent leader and fine man. But clearly lesser than the true Shinigami veterans, such as Shunsui Kyoraku or Unohana Retsu. Among Hollows, the higher level Espada such as Starrk or Harribel are a clear example, likely making you a Vasto Lord yourself. To the Quincy, powerful Stern Ritter like Bambietta Basterbine or Mask de Masculine are your best choices. 

Make no mistake, you’re not the strongest with this or even on par with the second and third strongest tiers. The Royal Guard, the Quincy Schutzstaffel, thousand year old Shinigami Captains and more are all beyond you in power and skill. To say little of their leaders. But it makes an excellent starting point.

221,,200,Crusher,Dragon Ball Super,Source,"Defence is the best offence? Psh, it’s all about turning your opponents attacks back on themselves. That’s what is best in battle. You have the ability to absorb any kind of energy directed at you, converting it into Ki power that you can then utilise. Focus it into your fists to empower the damage you deal, spread it throughout your body to power up, use it to grow in size and power (Though at the cost of speed) or just fire it back at your opponent to hit them with their own power plus yours combined. Your absorption ability does have a limit, though it is hundreds of times beyond whatever your normal power capacity for Ki is, and hitting that limit will cause a sudden weakening as the power begins to slip out of your grasp and you are unable to absorb further energy attacks."

They possess an unlimited supply of Ki and physical energy, never running dry even if they constantly drain themselves at full output.

Incidentally, this limitless energy also removes the need to sleep or rest."
223,,200,Godly Ki,Dragon Ball Super,Source,"A special trait held only by the divine. Your species are apparently gods or descended from such, as they all possess Godly Ki. The benefits this grants are fairly significant, though far from enough to make one unbeatable.

The worse the injury and closer to death they get, the bigger the boost in power once they get back to a healthy state. It is more difficult, but not impossible, to receive the boost from self inflicted injuries.

226,,200,Power of Darkness,Stranger Of Paradise - Final Fantasy Origins,Source,"Something that is especially noteworthy in this world is that whenever someone receives a potent surge of darkness and/or chaos they get much more powerful but it requires a strong will to not be consumed by the negative emotions brought by such a state. This allows you to grow in power by absorbing darkness, chaos and negativity in your environment and from sources of them as well as granting you the unbreakable willpower that allowed Jack and his friends to go through all those cycles. This makes it so you can’t be corrupted no matter what nor can your emotions, mind or soul be manipulated in any way without your consent."
227,,200,Full Blood,The Seven Deadly Sins,Source,You have the ability to use your innate hybrid abilities even if they would normally be weaker as a hybrid. They operate on the same level as even a full blooded member of that race. It allows you to also always have the innate powers of your bloodline such as a Uchiha always having the Sharingan or some random magic bloodline having that magic. You can also use this to make yourself appear as one race and not a hybrid.

You're the epitome of what a Dragon-blooded is supposed to be like, and the blood of the Elemental Dragons flows thick in your veins. This gives you extra Essence to use (though not even remotely as much as the Abundant Essence perk), extra skill and ability in the use of your elementally aligned perks and magics (choose one of Wood, Water, Fire, Air, or Earth), and the guarantee that if any other Dragonblooded realize you have this (which they will if they bother looking at you for more than a moment) that suitors will be lining up for your hand in marriage. In fact if you're a Dynast it's an absolute certainty, you'll already have an arranged marriage to a 'suitable' Dragonblooded wife/husband (whom may be a companion if you buy that option) and be expected to make lots of babies. Lots of babies. What nobody besides you knows however is that your Legendary Breeding is inheritable.

All children you have are guaranteed to Exalt at some point around their 7th birthday as a Dragonblood of a random elemental type and they too will have Legendary Breeding just like yours, which is, again, inheritable. In future jumps this makes people look upon you as a member of the highest class of society, even if they can't particularly pin down why they think that way. If taken with Naturally Getting Your Way Maneuver people will roll out the red carpet at the merest hint of your presence, or the equivalent anyway, even if they wouldn’t normally give that kind of service to anyone outside of a very specific and select group of individuals.

This perk is restricted to Dragon-blooded Exalted, or Drop-Ins that choose to Exalt as Dragon-blooded, only.​ If Curseproof is purchased all children born of your lineage gain Curseproof for free. In case it wasn’t explicit enough this perk makes it so that everyone that is ever born of your bloodline will always have legendary breeding and will always exalt as a random elemental type dragonblood. Your bloodline will never become diluted no matter how many mortals are introduced into it."

233,,200,Evil Of Humanity,Fate/Grand Order Part 2,Source,"Uniquely, you have the option to become a Beast, an Evil of Humanity and one of the threats to the entire Human Order. However, choosing to become a Beast reduces the cp you can gain the Against The World drawback to +300cp. It is worth noting that you will begin as a Larval Beast. This means that you will possess some method of ‘maturing’, growing up to two Ranks in power to a maximum of the upper bounds of Celestial, but you will lose this power when you move to the next jump, returning to whatever Rank you’ve purchased and forcing you to ‘mature’ again to regain that power. That said, if you’ve managed to mature as a Beast, you likely won’t find doing so again to be too difficult. For more detailed information, please read the Beast section below.

Beast

Below is some information on three universal traits shared by all Beasts. Always remember, Beasts are meant to be obstacles for humanity to overcome, not the bringers of the end of humanity.

Authority of the Beast
First, Beasts obtain the Authority of the Beast, which rather than being a full Authority, it instead offers a damage boost against humans, whether physical or conceptual attacks. It is a flat boost that scales to the level of technological advancement of human civilization, although given that all Beasts are immensely powerful in their own right already, it’s actually kind of a footnote.

Nega Skill
Now this is the main ability that Beasts obtain when ascending to the position, and the main reason that some evil beings aim to become Beasts to begin with. This Nega Skill will be a parody of your nature; Goetia, as the most iconic familiar of King Solomon, obtained Nega-Summon, able to nullify the Noble Phantasms and other trump cards of Servants or other summoned beings. Kiara, as a twisted bodhisattva, obtained Nega-Saver, nullifying most of the mental defenses and resilience of enlightened monks. Tiamat, as the origin of all life, obtained Nega-Genesis, which nullifies Noble Phantasms and other powerful abilities or artifacts that originate from life descended from her, IE humanity. Koyanskaya, as the mother of a nascent World, obtained Nega-Self, prohibiting any life born from her from attaining an individual ego, growing up to become stronger, or reproducing and evolving. Likewise, once reaching maturity you’ll gain access to a similar Nega Skill of your very own, parodying and synergizing with your nature and temperament in the same way as the examples presented.

Grand Servants
And of course, Beasts are designated by the Human Order as obstacles to overcome, so such beings are hounded by Grand Servants summoned specifically to deal with them, with the right powerset to counter whatever the Beast utilizes. Likewise, whenever you succeed in maturing as a full Beast, a Grand Servant will be summoned somewhere in the same realm of existence you are in, and whatever their abilities are, they can and will shut most of your power down, leaving you at the Grand Rank at best. In future jumps, your nature as a Beast will likely attract other similar kinds of heroes to you, should there be any. However, these Grands are not unbeatable. Shutting down most of your power will leave them vulnerable and thus require allies to actually defeat you, and if you’re lucky they might get sidetracked and lose their Grand status, leaving you free of a Grand thorn in your side. Stay alert and you might be one of the Beasts who never had to fight the Grand summoned to deal with them.

234,,200,Divine Light,Diablo 3,Source,"The Light of the High Heavens and The Creator Anu is strong in you, allowing you to use it in a myriad of ways. Don it across your form to shine brighter and force Demons and their corruption away. Or use it to soothe your appearance for Mortals around you or even heal them slightly."
235,,200,Vial of Demon Blood,Generic Angels and Demons,Source,"Regardless of how you managed to actually acquire this, you’ve received a vial containing around half a liter of blood taken from demonic beasts, that, when consumed, temporarily enhances your demonic powers and instincts, with the full vial basically enhancing your power up to 50%. When drunk by someone without innate demonic abilities, it can also corrupt them and cause unwanted mutations, usually temporary unless they overuse it. The vial’s content is self-replenishing, taking around a week to fully replenish the demonic blood."
236,,200,Cursed By The Blood,Generic Angels and Demons,Source,"As a sign of your demonic heritage, your fangs became retractable and abnormally sharp and your instincts have expanded to also include a literal thirty for blood, human or not. This also grants you the ability to drink blood for power, healing you and temporarily strengthening your abilities. The more blood you consume, the stronger these effects will be, but, if you allow this ability to evolve by drinking more and more blood in short periods of time, you’ll slowly and progressively develop a vampiric essence within you, causing you to develop new strengths, abilities and weaknesses until the point that this essence will be fully developed, essentially turning you into a true vampire, with all the strengths and weaknesses it mean. If you limit the amount of blood you consume, you won’t need to worry about accidentally becoming more and more vampire-like if you don’t want it to happen."
237,,200,Deep Introspection,Final Fantasy XIV,Source,"The deeper you look inside of yourself, the more Aether you’ll find, but there is much more than just Aether inside of you. The more you travel, the more repressed memories, terrible impulses, unwanted secrets linger inside of you. As long as they continue to linger, you’ll always have to live with the fact that they’re present.

However, once you confront your demons and free your mind, your magic strength will slightly increase. Easily said, but not so easily done – and there are some demons that are so ingrained into your identity that they won’t go away with just mere contemplation."
238,,200,Boundless Stamina,Mushoku Tensei ~ Jobless Reincarnation ~,Source,"Unlike the magicians who tend to be stationary during combat, the warriors need and use more stamina in combat as they are more likely to run around the battlefield. With this, you have gained boundless stamina that will allow you to fight and train for a month without resting or sleeping and a year if you decide to push yourself. You would only need to rest or sleep an hour per month to fully recover your stamina and mental fatigue and return to peak condition and a full day should push yourself like fighting or training for an entire year. This also removes muscle pains and cramps from not exercising for too long or stretching first before doing a strenuous activity."
239,,200,Gamma Powered(Red),Marvel: Age of Krakoa,Source,"Regardless of which version you purchase, you can upgrade it. For 200 CP your gamma rays were augmented by primal kirbons, the tertiary form of cosmic rays, making you a Red Hulk. You can absorb just about any form of energy and store it within your body, consuming it to augment your already impressive strength or to release it all in one go in whatever form it was originally. Different forms of energy have their own “flavor” with more potent or exotic forms “tasting” better. Additionally, as you get angry a contained aura of heat and radiation will form around you growing more intense with your anger, burning or irradiating anything that makes contact with you.

240,,200,Consumption,Chinese Mythology,Source,"Yaoguai of all sorts consume humans in both flesh and spirit. In their bid to obtain immortality, many spirits and demons alike will take the spiritual power of their victims, empowering and reinforcing their own souls and bodies. You are able to consume other beings for their spiritual essence, adding their energy to your own, or drain them through intimate contact. The amount you gain from others depends on how powerful they spiritually are; an ordinary human might be equivalent to a few drops of power, while immortals and powerful yaoguai can grant much more. These increases in power can help enhance your magic and other soul related abilities as your soul power grows."
241,,200,Awoken Magic (Mara Sov),The Destiny Universe,Source,"Being born from a confluence of Light and Darkness, the entire Awoken species is ‘weakly paracausal.’ Save the exceptional few that command tremendous power and skill, your species will never stand against servants of the Light and Darkness in paracausal contests of power, but you nevertheless have an innate level of paracausal power, primarily taking the form of telekinesis and telepathy. For an extra 200, you can achieve the levels of strength seen by the Awoken Techeuns, who are able to interact with, physically enter, and alter the Ascendant Realm, and in proper numbers were able to locate and resurrect their queen after her death at the hands of the Taken King. For a further 200, 400 CP in total, you can now stand alongside your queen in terms of paracausal power. Mara Sov was capable of building a Throne World in the Light, was strong enough to be a tempting target for Savathun’s worm, and is even believed to have destroyed a Pyramid Ship on her own.

This will make you into a multiversal being. Like the previous option you may become the embodiment or incarnation of a concept. For example the Demiurge was the Incarnation of the Power of Creation itself.

244,,200,Food Energy ,Epic of Leviathan,Source,"In the Food Wars Bleach crossover world even the simplest dish is equivalent to a luxury dish from our world. This occurs due to the presence of food energy in this world which is passively infused into every dish. Taking this power allows you to generate your own food energy which can be actively infused into your dishes. This can grant them a variety of effects such as healing, strengthening your body, and a variety of other special effects. The more energy you infuse in your dishes and the higher the level of the ingredients you use the stronger the effects."

Angels possess the ability to use light based powers and gain sets of wings as they grow stronger. They start off with two wings and can have up to twelve. Similarly to Devils Angels possess powerful bodies much stronger than humans on average. For 200 CP you may choose to become a normal Angel or a Fallen Angel. Should you choose to be a normal Angel then you will not have to worry about falling and becoming a Fallen Angel. For 400 CP you may choose to directly become a Seraph on par with Gabriel and Michael. You may optionally be one of the original Seraphs created directly by God or you could be a recent addition that has someone appeared.

247,,200,Devil(Super Devil),Epic of Leviathan,Source,"Devils are a race of beings created by Lucifer after he rebelled against God and was cast down from heaven. Devils possess a life span of approximately 10,000 years. Devils are naturally stronger than humans and possess the ability to fly due to their bat-like wings. In addition all Devils have the ability to use Devil magic which is powered by imagination. For 100 CP you may become a Reincarnated Devil. Reincarnated Devils are members of other races who have been turned into devils through the use of an Evil Piece. Unfortunately they are not treated as well due to their impure status by many of the pureblood devils. For 200 CP you may become a pure blooded devil. You may choose to be a part of one of the 72 clans if you wish, including any extinct clans. For 400 CP you may become a Super Devil. Super Devils are incredibly powerful beings who possess strength far beyond that of a normal devil. For reference there are only three current Super Devils who have been born naturally.

248,,200,Choir of the Damned,Kult: Divinity Lost,Source,"Each flayed child, each cannibalism and impalement is more than a mere act of gratification in Inferno. It is nothing short of a true act of worship, from which it’s residents derive succulent nourishment. When you commit similar, brutally violent atrocities you’re particularly sensitive to the experiences and memories that the higher powers of Inferno value so much. Thoughts, sensations, desires and knowledge can literally be beaten out of your victims, your keen senses parsing them more adeptly than even most creatures of Inferno. More importantly, so long as suffering is inflicted by your own hands your mystical power and influence is steadily fed by a trickle of that power even without the ritual trappings of Inferno’s clergy. While miniscule, in the heat of battle or in a slaughterhouse you could swiftly gather enough power to make your peers think twice about challenging you."
249,,200,Creator’s Retreat ,Scion ,Source,"It is a curious thing that some of the oldest pantheonic leaders left behind their subordinates for mysterious reasons. Ahura Mazda has vanished sometime after turning the tide against Ahriman. Ometeotl, creator for the Aztecs has never been seen to leave the impermeable 13th Heaven. Perhaps Satyaloka, the abode of truth to which Brahma sometimes retreats, provides an answer. For it is an empty and mysterious place accessible only to Brahma, in which is trapped Truth in its absolute form. And now you too have a concept bound somewhere within a discrete subrealm near your residence. Bathed in the absolute expression of truth, absorbing its energy and expressions, Brahma emerges from his chamber empowered by the fire and insight of total Creation-and for 3000 years he has used to chamber to ready the mortal world for an incarnation without any Titanic influences. So too are you too enriched in ways that empower all your divine powers to create-although should you think it appropriate, the concept may instead endow you with the capacity to preserve, or destroy on a similar scale.

250,,200,A Fountain of Amrita,Scion ,Source,"It is the nectar of the gods. Their nourishment, and a refreshing break even from the hardships only a god can know. It’s damn delicious, if that needed to be said-and you have a whole fountain of this delicious, creamy golden liquid. Where even the god Indra himself has a special flask to hoard this morsel, you have a magnificent fountain of the purest grade Amrita mounted either in your Warehouse, in a property you own or simply somewhere convenient in this world. The Amrita which issues straight from the central fountain is the purest grade stuff, directly restoring Legend with each cup, but pools just beneath it capture and dilute it into the Amrita that merely restores one’s will with sheer delight and even lower pools reduce it to a delicacy capable of healing supernaturally grievous wounds. Lethal to Titanspawn, this ichor can have devastating effects on mortals and non-Legend-touched animals. You could drive the Devas to envy merely by making known your ownership of this wonder-or their friendship by sharing it with them."
251,,200,Legendary Devourer,Scion ,Source,"It goes without saying that monsters are infamous for killing and eating those around them, but what many fail to consider is the benefits some gain from their untamed appetites. Like the mythical gashadokuro, you can regain your reserve of Legend simply by killing and completely devouring mortals and divine beings alike. Divine flesh yields far greater Legend than mortals of course, unless done on a very significant scale this is unlikely to increase your overall Legend ranking and do keep in mind you need to eat the whole corpse to get the benefits. Still, it’s a quick and easy way to recoup your resources if you like the taste of long pork."
252,,200,The Power of Love,Fate/Faerie Britain,Source,"There are few forces stronger than a yearning heart. You are able to take your own feelings of love—or, indeed, simply the strength of your desire for love—and convert the power of this emotion into magical energy. This magical energy can be used to supplement your own, or you can turn it to a more offensive use like Cnoc na Riabh, turning it directly into beams and projectiles of raw power to blast your enemies into oblivion.

You can also use it as a vitalizing agent, imbuing its power into others to energize and empower them—this is accordingly more powerful the more affection you feel for the beneficiary of its effects."
253,,200,Fae Vampirism,Fate/Faerie Britain,Source,"Some rare faeries are vampiric in nature, and have the urge to feed on human blood (although any blood will do, in a pinch). But while you won’t earn any friends if this is found out (as such faeries are highly, and in some cases lethally, discriminated against), drinking blood does come with some advantages. Along with blood, you can drain an enemy of power, weakening their magical or spiritual abilities in return for recharging your own supply of energy."

Granted, that hazing often comes after the juniors exercise poor judgement, and isn’t embarrassment a good teaching tool? Oddly enough, for you, it is. When you’re put into an embarrassing or shameful situation, you seem to get a boost to pretty much everything from your ability to learn to your combat power."

A legacy of Poseidon might be able to talk to horses but nothing else, for example, while a legacy of Hephaestus would find themselves working with machines easier than the average joe but still below the level of an actual Demigod of that parentage.

No, that would require taking both Godly Scorn and Daddy/Mommy Issues for no points in order for such an affront to their vows to occur...

You may also take only Godly Scorn instead if you wish to be a child of one of the Big Three, at least guaranteeing you the love of your own parents unless you choose to pick otherwise on your own."

Through your interactions with the spirits your body has taken on a part of their dreamlike quality. This manifests itself by giving you a far larger mana pool than others to draw from. Where a normal person may have enough mana to heal or harm a small group of people at once you easily have enough to do twice that."
267,,200,Limit(200),Dies Irae,Source,"An important limitation to the above, detailed here for ease of use. The users of Die Ewigkeit are not all born with the same potential. The number of souls that one can contain depends on an innate potential, which varies from person to person. Lower quality souls can be stored in greater number, though they of course give less power. Some might be able to contain no more than a few handfuls, while others have limitless potential. By default, you start off fairly gifted in this area. Similar to Wilhelm Ehrenburg, you can contain several thousand average souls at your maximum. Enough to be a potent warrior, if not to ever truly challenge those on the Commanders level. Paying an additional 200CP will bring your limit to an astonishing high, equal to the three Commanders. Tens of thousands to over a hundred thousand souls can be contained at this scale.

Not that you have attained it quite yet. You’d need some sort of immense arcane ritual to kick you over from the Briah stage to the Aztiluth stage, likely alongside a tremendous sacrifice of souls. But those things are far from impossible to set up and what do you know, someone’s setting one up right here in Suwahara City. Maybe you can steal a spot.

Whether you feed on mundane forms of energy such as heat and electricity or rely on something like the life energy of other living beings, you are able to draw it into your body to both grant yourself sustenance, taking the place of food, air, drink and sleep, or use it to empower yourself further. As your overall power grows, so too will the range at which you can draw in energy and the speed of your intake, as at first you will only be able to devour what you can touch and it is still possible to be overwhelmed by too much at once. You may purchase this option multiple times, with secondary and onwards purchases being discounted.

The Farplane is the spirit world – there’s no denying that you are far more in tune with its workings and its behaviour than most in Spira. When it comes to spiritual energy and the manipulation of spiritual energy, you’ll see a rather large boost to your existing reserves. Developing these is also somewhat easier."

When injected into the body, this substance will temporarily form into magical circuits that the host may then use as if they were naturally their own. A single injector, of which you have around ten, would allow a normal person to go up against an average trained magus with just the raw power of these temporary artificial circuits. It provides as big a boost in raw power to existing Magi but they likely can make much more use of it with their existing skills. These temporary circuits only last a few hours before harmlessly dissolving, though be careful not to stretch them too far in their active use. You’ll find each injector replenishes a week after its made use of. "
274,,200,Grudge Match,Jujutsu Kaisen,Source,"Death is a frequent occurrence for jujutsu sorcerers. Cursed spirits aren’t exactly inclined towards mercy or holding back, so every fight tends to be kill or be killed. Yet oftentimes, when one sees their companions brutally slain before their eyes, they don’t become demoralised – no, they become stronger. Cursed energy is fuelled by negative emotions, after all, so intense feelings of grief or rage will bolster it to beyond one’s normal limits.

For you, it’s not just your cursed energy that benefits from your negative emotions – it’s all of your powers. Any supernatural ability you wield will become stronger whenever anger, hatred, and the like fill you, with the boost you gain being greater the more intense these feelings are. Your control over your abilities becomes refined, and your blows pack that much more of a punch. This won’t be an enormous boost – it won’t allow you to defeat a foe that truly outclasses you – but it might just let you wound them before going down, or give you the edge you need over an otherwise equal opponent. Beware these emotions do not cloud your judgment, however."
275,,200,Jujutsu(Satoru Gojo),Jujutsu Kaisen,Source,"By paying 200 CP, however, your talent gives you reserves similar to the likes of Satoru Gojo. With this, the amount of cursed energy you have utterly dwarfs that of almost any other sorcerer.

For a quick pick-me-up in that department, you have these. Think of them as Potions for your personal magical energy and your mind, restoring them from exhaustion caused by the use of spells or summons. You receive seven of these and they restock at a rate of one per day until you're back up to the starting amount. For 100 more undiscounted points, you may upgrade these to Hi-Ethers, which restore more than the ordinary Ethers."

The Free Version cannot grant you access to any Event-Only, Trade-Only, Gacha-Only, or Craftable Stigmata, but the 200cp Version of this perk can grant you access to any of those without problem.

You can easily contend with any member of the Olympian Pantheon in terms of power, with two spheres of divine influence that are under your control. At this level, your physical abilities are simply mind boggling. Strong enough to rip trees out of the ground with ease and throw boulders the size of a house, fast enough that most demigods would only see you as a blur, and durable enough to be gored by divine weapons and still fight unimpeded, which is helped by the fact that you can visibly heal from most wounds in the heat of battle. Additionally, you are able to take on the form of a hundred foot version of yourself."
284,,200,Orbs of Energy,God of War,Source,"When your enemies lie dead, especially an entire horse of them, it is not uncommon for one to find themselves tired and exhausted. No longer, as upon your enemies' death, multicolored orbs will spring forth from their corpse, flowing into you. These will replenish both your physical health and stamina, as well as your stores of magical energy. Some will give you more of one than the other, but you certainly won't be complaining, only going forth to kill even more."

287,,200,Magic Circuits(Tier 2)        ,Fate/Strange Fake,Source,"For 200 CP, your number and quality is quite remarkable. You possess a great number of magic circuits, as well as them being of remarkable quality. Even with not an advanced training, you will be quite a fearsome magecraft user, and a great magus if you have the proper tutelage and family heirloom. Think of Tohsaka Rin as an example of this. You could handle even a high tier servant going all out for a few minutes without dying in the process, or just maintain them through the course of the war without external assistance. With little extra assistance, you may even keep them around without the support of the Grail indefinitely.

Then there is your Elemental Affinity, which indicates which element you are most suited to manipulate. If you are taking the 200 CP option, you may take something like an exceptional element, such as the Imaginary Numbers, that with proper tutelage will result in a fearsome form of magecraft, or an exceptional talent like the Average One affinity for the Five Great Elements at the same time. Instead of that, you may choose to pursue a fairly unique Element and Origin alignment, that would result in some powerful magecraft, such as Shirou Emiya’s unique Sword Element and Origin.

Note: You may choose if the new element and/or origin replaces or is added to the ones you chose from the lower tiers.

288,,200,Magic Circuits(Tier 3),Fate/Strange Fake,Source,"For 400 CP, you may decide to increase one of the above to exceptional levels. Maybe the quality of your magic circuits is so high that it appears that your reserves are inexhaustible, or they circulate energy at great speeds, allowing you to use magecraft at such an efficient level that it may look like you are not spending any magical energy at all. Or perhaps you have such vast reserves that people may question if you are even human. With this, even a Great Hero contracted to you would be able to fight at their fullest for the duration of the war, and maintaining basically any Servant without the help of the Grail becomes easy.

Then there is your Elemental Affinity, which indicates which element you are most suited to manipulate. For 400 CP, you may choose to have a truly fearsome Origin, or an Origin and Element combination that, with the proper training or magecraft compatibility, would catapult you above what other magi may do.

Note: You may choose if the new element and/or origin replaces or is added to the ones you choose from the lower tiers.

That being said you can gain a further boost in power by becoming a divine spirit instead for 600 CP. Whatever three gifts you may have had as a Spirit has now become a Divine Authority, perhaps making you a God or Goddess of Weaponry if you choose so. Don’t expect to be spoken of in the same way as the likes of Ishtar or Quetzacoatl however. You’re still a rather minor Divine Spirit, your sphere of influence roughly surpassing a large city, but that alone is worth every CP you spend on this option. For notes on how Authorities work see the Authorities section at the end of this document. Furthermore you can decide for yourself what you look like and shape and design your new Spirit self however you wish no mater of natural or divine. Perhaps you too wish to copy a certain Tamamo?

292,,200,Conceptual Word Bearer,Godbound,Source,"Not all heroes wear capes, because not all heroes can fit into them. There are tales of Words in this world that while not necessarily Words of Creation, draw on such profound mythic ties and supernatural laws that the reality they represent is as deep as Alacrity or Luck itself-and the miracles and Gifts it manifests, just as deep. You now have one such concept Word, that defines you into something other than human-and grants you corresponding miracles and Gifts suiting your inhuman nature.

For example, the Word Dragon would emulate all the classical abilities of dragons known to myth and legend. Your basic ability would be simply having the physical form of a dragon, with unarmed attacks capable of striking like magical weapons. An example lesser Gift you could develop is tremendous, building-smashing physical might, flight capability for your wings and a constant twist of fate that causes wealth to somehow find its way to you until you own a fathomlessly vast hoard. Active Gifts would include a hypnotic form of speech, the ability to transform into a humanoid shape with all your Gifts and innate powers, and breath powerful enough to wipe out whole mobs at once. The Word Dragon’s Greater Gifts could include utterly negating a source of physical damage for an instant with your iron scales, or dooming those unlucky enough to be caught under your rampage.

This perk may be repurchased should you wish to be a truly unique and powerful entity bearing multiple Concept Words.

It seems this world has underestimated your might as a receptor of heavenly forces, for with each purchase here you have bound an additional Word of Creation to yourself and attained great skill in it already. Or at least, a commensurate force. Perhaps your skill with magic has entered into the realm of the miraculous instead, or it is the baneful power of Uncreated Night that has manifested in you?

294,,200,Devouring the Heart,Elden Ring - Limgrave,Source,"It matters not from where a dragon originates, for a dragon is still a dragon, and there is power within their hearts. Whenever you consume the heart of a dragon, regardless of its exact nature, then you will find yourself gaining a new power or ability based upon whose heart you have consumed. The heart of a dragon attuned to the arcane would see you capable of utilizing its magical breath, while a dragon known for its physical strength would see you summoning its claws."
295,,200,Burning Heart,Wizard 101,Source,"A Pyromancer’s passions always burn bright, and the best among them may use their passions to stoke their magics yet higher! When your passions are inflamed, your might grows with them! Be wary, however, of burning too brightly, too quickly. Overuse may leave your heart in cinders, too cold to spark the weakest flame for a time. At peak this perk may allow up to a tripling of magical power, with total exhaustion of passions leaving you up to three times weaker for three days."
296,,200,Covetous Serpent Ring,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Source,"The serpent is an imperfect dragon and symbol of the Undead. Its habit of devouring prey even larger than itself has led to an association of gluttony. This silver ring, engraved with the serpent, rewards its wearer with additional souls for each kill, making it a highly valuable item for all."

298,,200,Dragon Gem Piece(600),Raya and the Last Dragon,Source,"For an additional 200cp (undiscounted), you don’t have a single piece, but rather a complete Dragon Gem, made by the efforts of four different water dragons. As such, it offers four different unique magics to a water dragon that touches it, not just one. These are all decided by you on purchase of this item, under the same rules described above.

While the complete Dragon Gem can still repel Druun (and similar creatures), it has a greater function. When five or more nearby people have deep mutual trust for each other, one of those people is able to activate the Gem. In this setting, this will automatically banish all Druun from the world, and restore those that had been turned to stone by them. In other worlds, this gem can banish similar creatures within a range of a large country; sufficiently powerful creatures may resist this effect. It can also be used to restore those who have been petrified; this can either work by targeting individuals, or by restoring everyone in the same large country range, depending on the user’s preferences.

Here are the unique dragon magics shown in Raya and the Last Dragon:
• Sisu is a strong swimmer, and can even move a large boat at high speed by attaching herself to the bottom of it.
• Amba can to cause her body to glow.
• Pranee can adopt a human form, and can change between human and dragon forms as desired.
• Jagan can breathe out a thick fog.
• Pengu can cause it to rain.

Should your Gem or gem piece be lost or destroyed, a replacement will appear in your Warehouse after 24 hours.

299,,200,God,Thor: Love and Thunder,Source,"You are a god. Mortals could worship you. Firstly, your physical abilities have skyrocketed. A human god would be on par with the average Asgardian, and an Asgardian would approach the strength of Thor himself. The feats of the gods are so powerful that they are often repeated for millenia in myth and legend, like the tale of Hercules (Herakles if you like the Greek spelling) lifting the sky. You are intrinsically linked to a concept of reality, your domain, which you can manipulate as you please, as well as wielding a host of other powers relating to it. This could be anything - Thunder, the Moon, Magic, Scissors, and more are all up for grabs. Mind you, you’d best be careful as there’s a killer planning on going around and slaying your kind in a most gruesome manner."
300,,200,Mythical,Pet Avengers,Source,"You possess some supernatural power of a mystical nature. Perhaps you can perform hydrokinesis to create breathable air bubbles or perform minor healing. Its combat use will scale based upon the combat ability of your species here, and its maximum utility based on the amount paid for utility. At its best you might get the ability to fly between dimensions like Huninn and Muninn."
301,,200,Popularity Power,Amalgam Comics,Source,"This universe was forged in a series of duels decided by reader polls, and so you gain a boost to power and skill based on the adoration of the masses. By itself this won’t let John Q Public throwdown with Thanoseid, but is enough for Aquaman to beat up Namor."
302,,200,Iron Fist,Avengers Vs X-Men,Source,"You plunged your fist into the heart of the sacred dragon of Kun’lun and took that power for yourself, feeling the mighty Chi flow through your body and make you into the legendary Iron Fist. One of the dragons anyway. Apparently, there’s more than one. The powerful Chi you now possess is equal to that held by the current Iron Fist, Danny Rand, and gives a fair number of capabilities. Using this energy to enhance your abilities is simple, making even a normal human able to catch bullets and smash apart entire buildings. It grants total control over your own body and the ability to absorb and fire blasts of raw chi energy, even infusing it into other things to empower them. More esoteric effects, such as creating illusions or dimensional gates, are possible with training. This chi effect appears exceptionally potent against the Phoenix Force, even if normally it is far too weak. With this, you are a highly accomplished martial artist but not on the level of Danny Rand."
303,,200,Heart Shaped Herb,Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Source,"You have a few living samples of Wakanda’s Heart Shaped Herbs, which gave Black Panther his superhuman abilities.

Easy to learn from, patient study will increase any Bender's skill, though obviously a Novice will benefit far more. They also have another special property which few others know about; if a person who is neither a Bender nor born of any of the four Nations reads the scroll, they will gain the power to Bend that element.

305,,200,Magic Circuits,Fate,Source,"You receive 20 magic circuits, each of the highest quality, upon entering the jump. These circuits are used to control both Od and Mana, internal and external magical energy respectively, and allow the use of magecraft. The more circuits you have, the more prana you get to play with. Each additional purchase of this perk will add another 30 circuits of identical quality. "
306,,200,Magical Works,Bayonetta,Source,"You have the power of magic! It is not as strong as the main characters, but in time your powers will grow. At minimum this gives you the ability to shapeshift into different beast forms (like a wolf for Lumen Sages or a panther for Umbra Witches), the ability to pause time for up to ten seconds, as well as the ability to remote control vehicles so long as you maintain physical contact. Be wary, using these abilities in rapid succession drain your magic and overuse could easily cause the user to be debilitated."
307,,200,One Source,Trinity Wonder ,Source,"Ki, magic. Ultimately, they are just energy. They come from the same source, and can be used to supplement each other. You can use one source to recharge or fuel the other. This won’t necessarily be an even 1:1 conversion. Some energies may need a disproportionate amount of less potent energy to be substituted in to create an equal ‘volume’ due to the difference of energy contained within. Similarly, the techniques of different systems and techniques from other worlds may tax your reserves differently. The techniques of Wuxia world are often much more energy intensive than that of their fantasy world analogs, such that what one mage might consider overflowing amounts of magic, the murim warrior would simply consider adequate enough to recharge."
308,,200,Noblesse Oblige,Super Dragon Sword,Source,"It is only right that your commands be followed. What else can be done after seeing what you’re capable of? You are capable of expending your mana to grant that same amount of mana across your entire party, dividing the amount expended evenly. In addition, you are capable of using an Inspiration order on your allies, giving them the Motivated status effect, allowing them to utilize their spells at a substantial discount, and quickening the time needed for abilities requiring a moment’s focus to activate."
309,,200,"""Crystal Sphere"" ",Dark Souls 3,Source,"This crystal ball, similar to the ones wielded by the Crystal Sages, is a unique catalyst for sorcery that, much like a pyromancy flame, is capable of being hidden “within” the caster, and summoned to their hand at a moment’s notice. As a result of their veneration of Big Hat Logan and Seathe the Scaleless this catalyst increases the power of crystal sorceries substantially, though with other spells it’s rather average. Much like a pyromancy flame it is possible to split this catalyst, allowing it to be shared with one’s pupils. The process is more involved however, requiring the pupil to have sufficient knowledge in sorcery for proper attunement, as well as requiring a substantial chunk of crystal with sorcerous properties. The strange and erratic practices of the Crystal Sages are caused by their crystal spheres, which are said to devour the wills of the user. Thankfully, this version nor any other crystal spheres generated from it will have that difficulty, though the cautionary tale is a good reminder to would-be Big Hats."
310,,200,"""Soul Collector"" ",Dark Souls 3,Source,"Like all creatures in this land, you are capable of wresting the soul of a creature from its body upon death. Measured less in quality and more in quantity in most cases, absorbed souls can be used to increase your own strength and abilities with the aid of a Firekeeper, and can also be removed from your body and traded away. Particularly powerful individuals possess unique souls, which can be used to forge items or spells based on their life or nature with a Transposing Kiln. This perk is free during your time here, as a natural function of the world, but can be kept by paying 200 CP. This will enable you to absorb souls from those you kill in other worlds, including unique “Boss” souls if your enemy is powerful or unique enough in comparison to other beings in their world. Though it should be noted that souls here are a little different here than what other worlds might have, being more akin to life energy than anything in a spiritual or religious sense- and thus are separate entities from those types of souls, which are not absorbed."
311,,200,“Resonance Rings” ,Dark Souls 1,Source,"Miracles are as divine as they are enigmatic in nature. One such unexplained property is their propensity to spawn rings of light. When someone casts a Miracle, a ring of light empowering other Miracles cast near it spawns in the world, or another world. These rings of light appear near you more often than not, empowering Miracles and other divine abilities used near them. Even in the absence of others wielding the might of Miracles, these rings have a tendency of spawning near you. While it’s normally a small boost, standing near three or more gives a much more significant enhancement, something not uncommon with this perk. Rings will normally disappear in a few minutes after spawning."
312,,200,“Soul Growth”,Dark Souls 1,Source,"Souls, the lifeblood of the world, the lifeline of the undead. They’re also a vital resource though, especially in the hands of one such as yourself. On purchase, you are able to use ‘souls’ as a resource while resting near a bonfire or normal fire to develop your soul or the soul of someone resting with you, artificially facilitating growth in any of their basic capabilities. Strength, dexterity, stamina, even intelligence or luck can be enhanced in this manner. These individual pops of growth matter little individually, but may stack up over time to make someone greater than they ordinarily could be. Initial uses of this ability on someone cost few ‘souls’, but price builds over time no matter how it’s used on the same person."
313,,200,“Soul Collector”,Dark Souls 1,Source,"As with all creatures and beings in this world, you have the power to collect the souls of those you defeat. Yes, souls, as in plural. In this world, any being you come across might have dozens, hundreds, even thousands of souls filling their body, though these are not quite the souls you’re used too. Souls in this world are more like particles of energy that meld together in a being’s body as a gestalt. This gestalt is closer to the more common concept of a soul, and normally breaks apart on death into the ‘souls’ mentioned above. Especially powerful beings may have a soul so rich and powerful that it keeps its individuality even after the death of its former owner and being harvested in this form. The bits of energy known as ‘souls’ are used as a currency between the undead, and a catalyst for crafting among those who know how to use them. Some also use them to empower themselves, propping up their own soul with the ‘souls’ of others. The greater souls of powerful heroes, monsters and other beings, ‘Boss Souls’ for shorthand, have enough residual character and power to be forged into unique equipment by someone with the proper skills. They may also be broken up into thousands or tens of thousands of normal ‘souls’. This is not truly a perk in the conventional sense, it’s simply a natural function of the world you exist in. By paying 200CP, you can cause similar phenomena in other worlds though. This does not warp the bodies of your enemies, but it nonetheless rewards you with ‘souls’ when slaying them, or a ‘Boss Soul’ if they were uncharacteristically powerful and unique based on the standards of that world."
314,,200,Talisman of Conviction ,MtG - Ixalan,Source,"A small metal talisman engraved with a figure of the threefold sun, this talisman can have your blood spilled onto it to create a powerful charge of mana associated with the light of the sun - providing a strong enough mana to conjure up some flame elementals or enhance your own combat prowess quite a bit, resembling your choice of mana drawn from the rocky mountains or the mana drawn from sunflecked plains."
315,,200,Dreamstone Hedron,MtG - Zendikar,Source,"An odd puzzling hedron more complex than others, seemingly calling out to be unlocked. Within this puzzle lies a rather large store of mana - 6 motes to be exact - which may be expended at once on a single powerful spell or turned to other purposes. It can be used to store similar amounts once expended, even going as far as to regenerate its store from the mana of the world when closed, at a rate of one mote per month. The puzzle changes each time for anyone solving it, and carries a compulsion to eldritch beings: to complete it in order to reach the prize inside, easy bait for eldritch monsters and egotistical wizards alike as the alien puzzle eats away at several days of their time to solve it. "
316,,200,As Many Colors As Stars ,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Source,"The powers afforded to a Kami are bound up in not only their nature, but the “weight” their power possesses. A Kami of doing the dishes will never be able to perform grand miracles, not only because its domain is small, but also because who would pray to such a Kami? Luckily for you, mortals are oddly thankful for whatever small blessings you see fit to gift them with, even if it’s something small that they could easily have done for themselves in five minutes. So much so in fact, that it is a rare day when you do not see a return from your investment, gaining small trickles of worship and offerings that allow you to recoup whatever you spent to bless them to begin with. It may take a few days, but as long as you keep trying to increase your power and relevancy, you’ll never fade away into obscurity."
317,,200,Symbolic Link ,MtG - Kamigawa,Source,"The existence of a Kami is linked intrinsically to the facet of the world. The Kami of the world represent anything from Secrets and Shadows to Unspeakable and Unknowable. For free the Kami get access to two such links, which can be used to tap into minor powers associated with those things (Such as teleportation from shadow to shadow within line of sight and learning a secret you’re looking for by looking into it’s owner’s eyes and seeking that secret out), but at least one of which must be the land in which the kami is linked. Additional purchases grant two additional links, to either land types or concepts, from which power blooms. A being of any other origin than Kami that has Jumper of Flesh and Spirit get a free purchase of this as well. Kami with Jumper of Flesh and Spirit will get three free purchases, so six links total. 

These symbolic links can be used to edit the aesthetics of any supernatural skill you know and having a symbolic link to a land means you can tap into that land’s mana with greater ease, almost erasing the cost of many lesser spells and halving the cost of strenuous spells."
318,,200,Magician(200),Magi: The Adventure of Sinbad,Source,"In this world, magic is the art of converting Magoi, the raw energy of the Rukh that dwells within all living things, into effects. Though all living beings possess Magoi, most have it in very small quantities and cannot use magic without the aid of external help, such as magic tools or Metal Vessels. You, however, are not like most people, for you were born a Magician, someone with the ability to use magic.

Not only do Magicians have the ability to see the Rukh and possess a far greater Magoi capacity than normal people, they can also use the Magoi produced by the Rukh that inhabit their bodies to cast spells. These spells can be used for all sorts of effects, from flinging destructive fireballs and lightning bolts to producing illusory disguises, healing people, and flight. Be warned, though, that excessively expending your Magoi can quickly lead to exhaustion, internal bleeding, or even death.

For 200 CP, you are a fairly average Magician, able to create a Borg – a spherical forcefield that protects your body and increases in strength with your magical power – and cast a number of simple spells, with the potential to hone your talents to far greater heights. Like all Magicians, you have a natural affinity for one of the eight types of Rukh (fire, water, light, lightning, wind, sound, strength, or life) which lets you cast spells of this type with far greater ease than normal.

319,,200,UNDERGROWTH ,MtG - Ravnica,Source,"The more dead things around you, the better! You find that your work tends to be proportionally better when working with and near decaying and dead things, as you draw power from their corpses. The cycle of nature does, after all, mean that death feeds the living. It just feeds you more."
320,,200,Magician(400),Magi: The Adventure of Sinbad,Source,"For 400 CP, you are far above the average Magician – you’re a genius sorcerer on the level of Yamraiha or Matal Mogamett. At this level, you possess quantities of Magoi far in excess of even other Magicians and you can develop and master new spells with ease. With your power, you could create forcefields that enclose entire cities, create devices that harvest the Magoi of hundreds of thousands at once, and even win against Household Vessel users in single combat.

321,,200,Philosophy of Billions,Campione,Source,"While the overall strength of a Heretic God is determined by its willpower, the history that accompanies their myth gives an undeniable edge. Yours is one of the most extensive around, with your origins being associated to the earliest legends of mankind and tied to many cults and changes over the years. While this won’t make you more powerful per se, it will grant you a greater repertoire of Authorities to use. Perhaps you’re the ruler of the underworld, but also a God or fertility, wine, heroic deeds, or even of love and war."
322,,200,Spiritual Complexes,Fate/Extra CCC,Source,"Servants are manifested from the records of the Moon Cell, a system reminiscent of the Throne of Heroes down on Earth. But what if someone were to manifest multiple Matrixes as one Servant? Perhaps the result would be a Servant of greater power? You’ll be in a good position to test that with this purchase, as you become oddly receptive to getting spiritual beings and objects shoved into your own soul for the purposes of empowerment. Each added Servant Matrix will add to your abilities and increase your stats to some degree, but the process is unfortunately not a perfect assimilation, being very inefficient. Still, with the right resources you could plausibly tap into the records that the Moon Cell has on the gods themselves to add those Matrixes to yourself, to reach a level of power notably but not vastly above that of high ranking Servants. What you’d need now would be a Master capable of messing with the Moon Cell’s systems enough to obtain such resources in the first place. As a side note, this works with souls as well, in case that’s not clear. What sort of experiments will you conduct on yourself?"
323,,200,Prodigy’s Curse,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Source ,"Artists are ever so jealous of each other. It can drive them to do some crazy things. That’s the story,
isn’t it? That you went mad after your rival surpassed you and stabbed them to death. It’s what
everyone says. Just a rumour? I doubt anyone will believe you when you might kill someone just by getting mad at them. Killing intent is very much a active force for you, a literal energy that you can
shape and draw out as if it were mana. Gathering it into physical form, shaping it, even using it to
power magical abilities. Killing intent and malice provide great power and corruptive ability to what
it is imbued into and even when using just the raw red energy by itself, it can cause severe mental
damage on those it touches or outright kill the unprepared, weak or those without magical
resistance, the intent ravaging their minds and spirits. Particularly potent when mixed with magical
energy and even more so when used with music-associated magic, turning normally weak musical
incantations into weapons of extreme lethality. The killing intent must be kept tightly controlled
however. Much like the stories that sometimes go around about your temper, letting this energy
roam without a leash could result in hurting someone just because they annoyed you."
324,,200,Blazing Calm,Fate/Legends - Nirvana Yuga,Source,"It is natural to feel rage in the heat of battle, even the gods grow angered against their hated
enemies. But true warriors rise above it, not abandoning these natural emotions but bridling them
to their own uses. When you allow it, your emotions become far more intense than normally felt. Even simple anger could become on any other man a frothing rage. But while they would be left
immobilised by these intense emotions, you control them and channel them into power. You’re able
to think clearly and act rationally in spite of all but the greatest of these emotional states, such as
the anger from your beloved lord being slain causing you to truly go wild. 

Despite this control, you are still able to use the strength of your feelings to increase your physical
power and even intensify your magical abilities, as well as to aid you in ignoring pain and forcing
your body to go far beyond it’s normal limits. The deeper the feelings, the greater the boost you’ll
see. Common anger and frustration, when intensified by your earlier ability, may grant one third
again your normal abilities. Proper rage once intensified might see them double. Something that is
so fierce as to break even your ironclad control of yourself could result in ten times the normal
amount or more, though you’d abandon reason and honour to reach such a level."

gathered together into physical form, each one of the infants dumped into the river by the
prostitutes of London, motivated by feelings of revenge and need for not having the chance to live. You are surprisingly difficult to kill, able to survive and slowly heal even if your heart or brain is
pierced, and it requires magical spells to banish the spirits that make up your body or gross physical
damage to dispel you. Despite this endurance, your body still depends on the sustenance and
support that normal living humans do.

These hungry ghosts can also feed on souls, letting you instantly restore large amounts of energy
and regenerate even severe wounds quickly by devouring living beings, gaining more from the souls
of evil people. Finally, the children’s spirits can protect your mind from intruders, attacking anyone
who foolishly tries to connect to you, or exit from your body to attempt to harass others. The spirits
can possess those with the minds of children, taking over the immature spirits to act in your service, but adults or those with matured minds can easily shake off the fairly weak curses. "
326,,200,Magic Circuits ,Lord El-Melloi Case Files,Source,"This perk confers twenty average quality magic circuits, open and ready to be used, or equivalent magical output, in case you want more or less circuits. The first purchase is free for all. The second purchase is free for Students. You may buy it as many times as desired. If you purchase the Magic Crest item, purchases may instead be used to improve upon it at an equal rate rather than adding to your innate circuit count."
327,,200,Origin and Element - Boosted ,Kara no Kyokai,Source,"For 200CP, you can choose to have an Awakened Origin and have had the process go exceptionally well. Normally, the process of Awakening an Origin involves giving it far greater influence over you. It alters the personality in small, large or even totally overwhelming ways. But in return, it grants power. Unique abilities, especially in relation to magecraft, and an understanding of your own self. Whatever your Origin is, you’ve only gained quite limited mental changes from it. A Taboo origin would make you a fair bit more free with your desires and a Flame origin might make you more hot headed. In exchange, you’ll find yourself able to easily combine your Origin with any magecraft you know. This ranges from the simple, like a Flame Origin adding flame attributes into any of your spells with little work, to the quite impressive, like a Stillness Origin allowing for you to count as if you were still in regards to Bounded Fields and unlock the secrets of creating mobile Bounded Fields. (CG Note: Requires base Origin and Element - Kara no Kyokai first.)"
328,,200,Deep Burns ,Sonny,Source,"If you need more power and fast, this is what you’ll want. By casting this, you rapidly regain your energy pools. As a consequence however, you’ll also take damage equivalent to how much you regained. If you have this going for a few minutes, you’ll be at death's door but you’ll also have many times your capacity. This perk does scale. Wounds caused by this perk are heavily resistant to healing magic or powers with a level of resistance that also scales to your power, meaning that you can’t just make a recursive loop for infinite mana by healing yourself.
"
329,,200,Staff​ ​of​ ​Power​ ​,Sailor Moon,Source,"This staff enables people to concentrate their magical energy and aim it at a specific person. It can also help enhance any magic you cast through this wand, and not only that, it needs a very little amount of magic to cast powerful spells. Any villain that prizes efficiency will find great use out of this staff. It does it’s job best when used to cast bad luck curses or subtle magic, but it can blast
"
330,,200,Back To The Basics ,DC Occult,Source,"Your abilities make it easy for you to cast basic magic: things like lighting fires, cleaning things, making aesthetic changes to small things or similar small cosmetic changes to people, changing clothes, etc. It isn't likely to be much help in a fight, but damn if it doesn't make life more convenient. Your mastery of such prestidigitation allows you to cast it at-will, and essentially do so unceasingly, as it costs you almost nothing.
"
331,,200,Potential ,Justice League Dark,Source,"Magic is a force of nature, of creation itself, and it is a vast and wondrous source of power. For as long as life has existed, there has been those who attempt to harness it. You are one of the few who managed to do so. Or, rather, you have the potential for doing so. As of now, you have only a rudimentary ability to manipulate magic and even less knowledge of spells. You’re also not exactly the second coming of Merlin, but you have more talent than the next Joe Blow walking down the street. You will need to find a teacher or other source of knowledge if you wish to advance your skill and ability with the arcane."
332,,200,Sorcerer’s Helmet ,Young Justice,Source,"You’ve gained a helmet, similar to the Helmet of Fate, which houses the spirit of an ancient wizard. Although this helmet doesn’t grant any additional spell casting abilities, it does augment existing ones. The wizard is able to communicate with you telepathically, but cannot read or control your mind without permission. If you should happen to be knocked out in combat, the wizard will ask your unconscious mind for control of your body to continue the fight, flee, or seek medical attention, depending on the circumstances. The wizard’s personality is roughly of your design, but they always have your best interests at heart. Despite being sentient, the wizard does not take up a companion slot so long as it remains in helmet form.
"
333,,200,Dispellation resistant ,Libriomancer,Source,"Resistance to magic is a fact of life most practitioners have to deal with. For you it is...less of an issue. While your magic is not appreciably more powerful it is much more resistant to effects that may dispel, counter or reverse it. Foes who are normally able to dispel or resist magic with ease may be caught off guard as your magic is composed of sterner stuff, requiring greater energy or concentration to be properly turned aside.
"
334,,200,Sin power ,Valkyrie Profile,Source,"Part of the deal you made with Hel was that you'd commit endless atrocities, all for the sake of power. This is what represents that pact. True to her word, Hel will bless you for each evil action during combat or war, each act giving you a small increase in physical or magical ability and building up until you can challenge even the Valkyrie. Nearly anything will count, as long as it results in someone's undeserved or cruel death. Through fire, force of arms, torture, or any other of the endless methods of hurting and killing others. Anything done in the name of good or mercy will not activate this ability.
"
335,,200,Soul Eater ,Valkyrie Profile,Source,"Like the Valkyries, the Undead all possess the ability to absorb souls. However, instead of serving as a vessel for them and otherwise leaving them intact, an Undead consumes the soul, destroying it and absorbing its power. It can take quite a few to really give a noticeable boost, depending on the quality, but it's a quick and dirty way to increase your all around power. What's the need for training and time when you can become faster, stronger, and more magically powerful just eating a few dead mortals, after all?

336,,200,Fairy in a Bottle​ ,The Gods Are Bastards,Source,"Well! Morality of this aside, you seem to have gotten your hands on a fairy in a bottle. Its nature as a fraction of the aura of a daughter of the Goddess of Nature means it’s an endless source of fey magic, even if it’s power is strictly limited. Still, if tapped, it can serve as a more than adequate source for smaller spells."
337,,200,Reservoir ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Source,"Your tomb was constructed in such a way as to gather and store magical energy, allowing you to pour power in with no limit to what it could potentially store. A wizard, working over years and years, could save up for a truly frightening spell with this.

338,,200,Golden Cap ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Source,"The desert sun beats down without rest on the Nehekharan Empire. Why not take advantage of that ceaseless attack? Your tomb’s outer shell has been specially made to absorb the rays of the sun and convert them into magical energy. A day’s worth of the sun is enough to provide power for a few dozen combat spells, so it can store at a fair rate and this rate will increase as the size of the tomb increases. You’ll need something else to store this energy without limit, as the tomb can only store up to a week’s worth of sunlight on its own. (CG Note: Requires base Tomb - Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings first. Obviously.)
"
339,,200,Potion Sacre ,Warhammer Fantasy: Bretonnia,Source,"A special potion, brewed with the water from a Bretonnian cathedral and with the tears of a Damsel whose champion died at battle, it is used to empower the spells of a wizard temporarily. Each potion, of which you have half a dozen, will provide a fair sized boost to your spell casting or dispelling power when fully drunken. The potions only have enough in them for a single use each but they are small bottles and will replenish one day after being consumed.

342,,200,Power of Recognition ,Senki Zesshou Symphogear,Source,"It's always been possible to gather Symphonic energy from crowds during concerts or performances, but now you can get a tiny amount of Phonic Gain by those that know your song, from listening to CDs, humming the tune or simply being a fan of you. The trickle of Phonic Gain you get is absolutely tiny, but on the scale of a nation earns you a decent boost in Gain.
"
343,,200,Memory Combustion ,Senki Zesshou Symphogear,Source,"Alchemy deals with a lot of esoteric subjects, such as linking objects across universes and the energy of the mind and soul. This is one such application, which allows you to destroy your own memories to convert them directly into different kinds of energy, such as Phonic Gain. The amount of energy a given memory gives off is generally proportional to how strongly it affects your ego, but burning through months of general memory at a time can provide power on par with several Symphogears. With the right research, it might be possible to apply the general theory to things other than memories...
"
344,,200,Stress Management ,Golden Sky Stories,Source,"In modern society, there is constant talk about “converting your stress into productivity” and “managing your stress properly”. Yet for all this talk, people seem to be growing more stressed on a whole. Well, you can do something about it – unlike other people, converting stress into a different form of energy is possible and while the conversion isn’t perfect, under stressful situations you can replenish a portion of your other energy pools. 
"
345,,200,Blessing of the Spirits ,Golden Sky Stories,Source,"Separated from all the stress and hardships of urban life, people often consider the rural lifestyle to be one “blessed” by nature. Without a doubt, these folks have their own sets of hardships to face, but sometimes a simpler life is indeed a blessed one. In any case, the rural villagers certainly appear to be more in tune with nature than other folks.

You too, can adopt an aspect of Nature to request a blessing from. Be it the wind, the waters, or the sun or the moon, whatever aspect you adopt will serve as a primary element for you. All elemental magic or skills related to your aspect is enhanced, and you generally perform better when in the presence of your chosen aspect.
"
346,,200,One Feeling at a Time ,Peter Pan,Source,"The hearts of fairies can be compared to bouillon cubes due to their concentrated compactness. In fact, a fairy is so small that it can have only a single emotion pouring through its entire body and soul at a time. While those big humans might call such a mindset capricious and a flaw, you know better. You don’t have to worry about never knowing what emotions you are feeling, or having them mixed together. Whatever you feel, it is with full certainty and intensity. As a number of abilities draw on a specific emotion in the user, you can reach intense levels that you could not achieve with extra emotions getting in the way. Your emotion can change, whether by choice or at random, but it will always be a complete change. Furthermore, the concentrated nature of your inner self means that when you focus on a specific thing, whether it is an emotion or a certain talent, you can put your full heart into it and bring out the best of that quality of yourself. You will have to deal with the emotional changes as a fairy regardless of whether you bought the perk, but you will need to purchase the perk to access the same abilities (with greater control) after the jump."
347,,200,Golden Glam-Shell ,Peter Pan,Source,"A head-sized, golden seashell owned by the queen of the mermaids for her concerts. The shell strengthens all musical/singing abilities of the user, including Siren’s Songs. Furthermore, as the treasure was donated to the mermaids by a pirate, the shell also grants the owner good luck in finding treasure.
"
348,,200,Magic Potential ,Dragon Ball Super,Source,"All beings can eventually, with many years of study, learn the arts of magic. Few can claim the natural ability that your species has for the arcane arts. Your species has natural capability for the use of magic and quite significant levels of it too, easily learning spells and rituals. Levitation, animating objects, moving things without touching them or summoning the elements are simple tasks. However, your species has pair of focuses, such as creation and healing or summoning and transmuting, where they particularly excel, being much more naturally talented with magic that falls under those domains.
"
349,,200,Natural Ki Affinity ,Dragon Ball Super,Source,"While Ki is present in all living things, it is not equally so. Some races such as the Saiyans have a natural affinity for the energy, much like your own race now does. Your race has a very high affinity for the use of Ki, allowing them to naturally pick up the use of the energy even without teaching and to learn at greatly increased speeds should they have proper training in the arts. Almost all adults of the species will be able to fly easily, use ki blasts and enhance their physical forms with ki, usually at much greater levels than other lesser species. For an extra 100 points, this affinity can be extended to other supernatural energies, giving the species the same natural inclination towards their use, though they will need access to such energies first. 
"
350,,200,Wizards Staff ,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Source,"A good, solid six foot staff, usually carved from Oak or Rowan wood, the staff can be used as a battery of sorts, storing magical energy that can be used freely by the staffs owner to power spells. The longer a staff is owned by a spellcaster the more magical energy it can contain as the mage becomes more and more attuned to his possession.

The staff can be recharged over about a day, though if the winds of magic are blowing stronger than usual the time can be reduced to a few hours, though this is rare. Should the staff be taken to any other reality, it will still be able to draw in energy and convert it to magic, though the more high tech a reality is, the longer this process takes.
"
351,,200,STAFF OF THE FOREST ,Warhammer Fantasy: Kislev,Source,"Baba Yaga’s staff, made from a branch from the oldest tree in Kislev. It is an extremely potent source of power, greatly increasing the magic flow to the wielder and generally making magic both easier and safer.
"
352,,200,Engine of the Gods ,Warhammer Fantasy: Lizardmen,Source,"A large, ancient and mysterious device with glowing glyphs on the side. It produces magical rays that protect allies within range, empowers nearby allied spellcasters and can produce a beam of light worthy of Chotec himself that will blast and burn enemies from the field of battle.
"
353,,200,Hellheart ,Warhammer Fantasy: Ogre Kingdoms,Source,"The heart of a Chaos Spawn, ripped from its chest and still containing a modicum of power from the Dark Gods. When devoured by an Ogre and belched out, it unleashes a great storm of chaotic magic, enough to disrupt the casting of any spell caught within the issued forth vortex. It also messes with the minds of mages, confusing them and terrifying them. You’ll find a new heart in your pocket a day after making use of the last one.
"
354,,200,Seek the Oghams ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Source,"Of all the ancient human mages, it was the ancestors of the Jade Wizards who clung most closely to the Waystones erected by the Elves in the aftermath of the Great Catastrophe. These markers of the Ley Lines allow the Jade Magisters to enhance their craft in myriad ways. Now, you are especially gifted at finding henges of Waystones, and any other such concentration of ley-lines. Those places where the flow of magic is strongest call to you like the rhythm of the seasons.
"
355,,200,Magister Lord ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Source,"At last, you have reached the pinnacle of your Order’s teachings. There are none left who doubt that you might be a Magister Patriarch one day. Even the lofty office of Supreme Patriarch is not beyond your reach, though to overthrow a mage like Balthasar Gelt will take a great deal of cunning on your part indeed. While such experience lends your spells a great deal of power, the true upgrade is to your authority, resources, and independence. Such will be true everywhere you walk now, as the respect the title “Magister Lord” confers upon you follows you always. Within magical organizations you join, you may expect to almost immediately attain the equivalent of this rank.
"
356,,200,The Pale Scythe ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Source,"How you acquired this scythe is beyond my knowledge, for only one was ever forged and this was done by its wielder. This great scythe, practically made of solidified Shyish itself, also greatly aids the wielder in channeling and focusing the Wind of Death. In your case, you will find it equally useful as a focus for other deathly magics."
357,,200,A Quick Pick-Me-Up ,Warhammer Fantasy: Skaven,Source,"Warpstone tokens serve more than just currency in the skaven economy. To an enterprising Grey Seer with his beady-eyes focused on the road to power, they present a very literal boost of potency. Just chew up a token of refined warpstone and you’ll be laughing in madness at the power flowing through you in no time.

You have a bag of smaller tokens, which conspicuously seem to look like pieces of rock candy. Rest assured you won’t break your teeth chewing them however; They chew easily, and go down easily. Eating one of these tokens will magnify your spells for a short time afterward, making a Ritual of Gnawing that could rip through a wooden gate into one that could cause the collapse of a castle wall. You’ll never be quite certain if the bag ever runs out if you chomp through them - although if you use them to buy goods and services, it will take around thirteen days for the bag to refill itself.
"
358,,200,Power Through Pain ,Endless Legend,Source,"Through ritualistic self torture and sheer willpower, you are able to channel Dust magic. You require a foci to channel truly powerful spells but while unarmed you can still fling brilliant blue flames from your hands. You pain tolerance is increased greatly, and will further increase the more you inflict pain upon yourself. With enough practice, you could immolate yourself, and feel only a distracting tingle. How much are you willing to put yourself through for power?"

363,,200,Bottle of Enchanting ,Generic Minecraft,Source,"This strange bottle seems to be full of a green-yellow fluid-gas. This bottle is actually full of XP orbs which are used for enchanting and for powering certain enchantments on objects. This bottle can be used to convert various mystical energies into XP Orbs and vice versa without any loss of energy and can store an infinite amount of the Orbs.
"
364,,200,Magical Staff ,Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds,Source,"“I cannot hold him back much longer. So...I must see you to safety.”

This golden staff with a carving of an inverted Triforce is filled with magical energy which gradually replenishes, ideal for supplementing your own power when you’re running low. In addition, it can be used as a focus to enhance your own spellcasting, and is exceptionally effective in doing so. If you would prefer, you may instead import a staff or wand to receive these characteristics.
"
365,,200,Magic Paintbrush ,Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds,Source,"“You think you can challenge ME? Why, I am the portrait of perfection!”

Not only does this enormous paintbrush greatly enhance your artistic talents when used, it also serves as a magical focus, improving your mystical power when used as a wand. If you would prefer, you can import your own art supply to become a magical tool instead for this option, such as a pencil, sketchpad or paint palette.
"
366,,200,Wraith Ring ,Hyrule Warriors,Source,"Steeped in darkness, this is a cursed magic ring. While you wear it, it empowers whatever magic you cast, doubly so for dark aligned magical abilities, but that is not its true power. 

The Wraith Ring is most interesting when given away. After being cast into circulation, when a wielder of the magic ring’s power dies the essence of their soul and emotions is absorbed. 

As bits and pieces of souls and emotions of deceased past wearers are absorbed over time, a gestalt of spiritual impressions will begin to form and may even become aware. Each bit and piece absorbed will somewhat empower the ring, which only further entices those who wish for it themselves.
"
367,,200,Rail Map ,Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks,Source,"The Rail Map is a Lokomo artifact, and at first glance it seems to be exactly what it says it is. A map of the rails - the Spirit Tracks, specifically. And it is true, because that is something the Rail Map does. But it’s true purpose is somewhat unexpected. It doesn’t just show a map of the rails, it enforces them. The Rail Map is a repository of spiritual power, gathered from the various Temples in each Realm, and drawn towards the Tower of Spirit along the lines of the rails. These sections of the map then store excess energy, allowing those lines to be reinforced in an emergency. A backup battery, if you will. In your hands, it also serves the purpose of storing a truly massive amount of energy, and transferring that energy into any broken seals, enchantments, or other magical effects that may be damaged.
"
368,,200,Magic Container ,Legend of Zelda: The Adventure of Link,Source,"A native of a land suffused with magic, you have a natural talent for it yourself. You now have a “Magic Container”, a store of mana and the associated mental “meter” to keep track of it. A single magic container is meager without magical training, with two Magic Containers needed to even perform a basic “protective” spell at first. However, as you gain expertise you’ll be able to use this to fuel useful powers - for much cheaper. This magical energy can be replenished with the life force of your defeated enemies, a magical potion, or a magical being’s blessing. Sleeping a full night’s rest will also do much the same.
"
369,,200,Node ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Source,"A place where quintessence naturally springs forth and can be gathered by mages and sorcerers for a variety of uses. This Node is of middling strength, but can take whatever form you want, from a sacred grove to a workshop. It can be placed on pre-existing properties as well, but cannot be added to your warehouse until after the jump. Post-jump it can be imported however you want, including being added to the warehouse.
"
370,,200,Lesser Mystic Eyes ,Kara no Kyokai,Source,"A general purchase for a wide range of low level Mystic Eyes, things that are relatively common among this category of users and not uncommon in Magus in general. Eyes of Charm that let one automatically cause infatuation and great appeal in those that see the eyes without much magical resistance, Eyes of Hypnosis that allow one to use the Hypnosis core magecraft solely through sight, Eyes of Empathy that allow one to see the emotions of people around oneself and better understand them. Each purchase of this grants access to one low level magical effect that can be bound into your eyes, with multiple purchases being possible."
371,,200,Varla Stones ,The Elder Scrolls,Source,"Starlight fascinated the ancient Ayleids, such that they found ways to solidify it into useful crystals. These glowing crystals can be used to recharge any enchantments your gear has, and can alternatively be used as a magical powersource for whatever magitech you may have. You receive a stockpile of 20 that replenishes each week."
372,,200,Delusion ,Genshin Impact,Source,"Where the Archon of Inazuma takes away Visions from their users, the Archon of Snezhnaya does almost the opposite. She has gifted the especially exemplary members of the Fatui with Delusions; artificial Visions that can be wielded by anyone. However, unlike Visions, Delusions can backfire to cause harm to their users. A small price to pay, some would argue, for an item that in some ways is even more powerful than a Vision. You have gained your own Delusion of an unspecified element. Perhaps you could try to replicate them. Some have noted that the faint scent of mist grass emanating from it implies that that is somehow used in its creation."
373,,200,Crystallization Of Power ,Genshin Impact,Source,"These are the crystallised teardrops of a great elemental being, one that in days past might very well have fought toe-to-toe with the gods. Contained within these tears are an incredible amount of pure elemental energy, of a type matching that of the spirit it came from. What exactly that type is, is up to you. This would be a rare and incredibly valuable prize for any able to handle the energy within, enough to power an instrument of the Archons."
374,,200,Primal Stone ,The Dragon Prince,Source,"An orb containing a powerful source of Primal Magic, a mighty storm, the warmth of a summer day, a vast quantity of water. This allows mages to cast spells without hanging out near a Primal Source, for that Source, anyways. It can also be used to empower such elemental magic without the caster using their own energy."
375,,200,Mana Battery ,Terraria,Source,"Ordinarily, it takes several minutes of rest for even a small mana pool to regenerate once drained. Now, however, your pool regenerates much faster, even as its size also increases. Your Mana Pool is roughly three times as large, and it replenishes several times faster, even when you are running around and exerting yourself. You can also push more mana into attacks to ‘overcharge’ them, spending double the mana to get around triple the effect, though that can risk burning out your Mana and slowing your regeneration."
376,,200,Faux Cultist (Boosted) ,Terraria,Source,"For an additional, discountable 200 CP, you can choose a second ‘patron’ in future Jumps, from among any entities of magic or power that may exist in said Jump, gaining some of their power alongside your default ‘patron’ from this Jump.

(CG Note: Requires base Faux Cultist - Terraria first.)"
377,,200,What’s in a Soul? (Boosted) ,World Seed,Source ,"To anyone used to other kinds of souls, the composition of the soul in Neolife and beyond might seem strange, signifying the ability of something or someone to grow and learn within the bounds of the System in addition to also being their metaphysical essence. But there’s no need to worry, as instead of ending up with two or more different souls held together only by spiritual duct tape, you’ll be able to decide what aspect of this new kind of soul you’ll take on, either choosing just the best parts or those you desire, combine them into one functional whole better than the sum of its parts, or disregard some parts entirely. For 200 CP, you’ll be able to do the same to any future or past souls you may get or have gotten through either backgrounds or other ways, with the decision of how your soul works in your hands evermore from this point on.

(CG Note: Requires base What’s in a Soul? - World Seed first.)"
378,,300,Sweet Taste of Victory,Castlevania - Symphony of the Night,Source ,"From adversity, growth. This simple phrase describes so much of how the Hunters view the world, how they have armed themselves over the years. Immaculate records dating back hundreds of years detail the weaknesses of monsters not seen in lifetimes, and describe the creation and use of weapons meant specifically to counter them. This is how the Belmont clan grows strong. It is not the only way. As you slay monsters, you will find that a small portion of their energy will pass into you. Perhaps purified, perhaps not. Perhaps magical might, or perhaps raw stamina. Regardless, as this collected energy grows, you will find yourself growing stronger. Blows that would have once crushed you will instead be brushed off, with you getting back up for round three in mere seconds. There is a limit to this growth, a common man might grow to have the strength of six, but a monster that already had that power? You could grow six times stronger than that. Sadly, should you choose to retire, or to walk a slower path in life, this energy will slowly leak away and you will need to rebuild it to become strong once again."
379,,300,Trait-er,Beast: The Primordial,Source ,"Normally a Beast is limited by the strength of their Lair in however many Lair Traits they can possess, but this limit no longer applies to you. Whenever you claim a location that could conceivably produce a Lair Trait, such as a Chamber created from a meat locker and the Freezing Cold Trait, it will now possess that Trait. You'll both be immune to it and have the ability to impose it on your surroundings as usual, all without the limit on how many you can impose at once. Now if only you had the ability to claim an unlimited amount of Chambers to make the most of it...

Heroes with this can claim Chambers like a Beast can to gain access to new Lair Traits. Without Hunting Grounds, you don’t actually get a new Chamber, just the Trait."
380,,300,Togabito,Bleach,Source ,"A Sinner of Hell. You were consigned to the flaming pit yet somehow, you managed to escape
somewhat intact. A Togabito is exceptionally hard to kill, cursed to forever be tormented in Hell, and death poses little threat to you but time. As long as the chains now attached to your body are not broken, requiring exceptional power to do so, you will revive in Hell after death. The more power you have yourself, the quicker this revival, potentially near instantaneous for those above Captain level strength. 

The mask you hold is the Sinner’s Mask, which conceals your presence from the Kushanada that guard Hell and allow you to exist in the real world without being dragged back. The rebirth in Hell you went through has also supercharged your own powers, reinforcing your existing spiritual strength and further increasing the strength of unique spiritual abilities, like the powers of a Hollow or a Zanpakuto’s release state, albeit with an infernal theme. The increase in power is notable, though not more than half again what you were before. 

In other worlds, you can choose to detach your Hell Chains and lose both the benefits and the downsides. Or, by keeping the chains linked to your soul, you can continue to be at threat of being dragged to Hell if your mask is removed. But in return, you’ll keep your immortality and infernally enhanced powers. "
381,,300,Hidden Potential,Seven Deadly Sins,Source ,"There is a great well within you, a source of incredible power that is as of yet untapped. This ocean of potential within you lies locked away from you for now, as you have not yet suffered and struggled enough to even touch the topmost layer of what lays within. To unlock this hidden potential you have, you will need to pit yourself against battles and foes that push you to the very edge of your power and life, continually risking your being and yet still surviving. You must go through hardship on a personal level, growing as a person and as a warrior. Once you have overcome enough foes externally and internally, you will unlock the first tier of power. Your Power Level will be multiplied by 10 times over as you access this first layer of potential. The second layer will be even harder to access, requiring you to repeatedly push yourself well beyond your limits and risk death many times over, only unlocking your power when you have done this and finally reached a battle where you cannot survive without awakening your true power. You’ll transform, taking on a more matured and refined appearance, magnifying your already increased Power Level by five times over once more. All your potential in this world has been accessed at this point, along with all the experienced you gained in unlocking it. Do be aware that if you cannot meet the growth conditions, this power will remain inaccessible. You must grow as a person to unlock each level, overcoming your own issues to a significant level, and you must be forced to struggle at your fullest and truly risk death by your foes. "
382,,300,Essences(Tier 3),Shin Megami Tensei V,Source ,"Essences hold the power of Demons within them. Every Demon has one, from a lowly Pixie to a mighty Storm God. As such the prices can vary vastly. However they apply by the same rules of purchasing Demon as a race. As such the Essence of a Pixie would only cost you 100 CP while the most powerful of Aogami would cost 700 CP. Essences bought this way respawn once per day.

Note: You can not purchase the Essence of the Demifiend, Shiva or Lucifer with this option. Nice try.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
383,,300,The Big E,The Elder Scrolls - Online,Source ,"Your presence alone is enough to turn the tide of battle. First and foremost, you receive a massive boost to your health, magicka, and stamina, and the recovery thereof whenever you enter an active warzone, and your wounds received in combat always seem to heal cleanly and without scarring, assuming you're able to get them tended to. Secondly, any and all soldieries under your command are granted a watered-down variant of this boon, providing a lesser, but still very much noticeable, boost to their physical and mental attributes. Obviously, the value of the second effect is directly linked to your rank - if you're not in any sort of command position, nothing happens."
384,,300,The Displaced Crystal,Final Fantasy XV Kingsglaive,Source ,"This Crystal is a last vestige of a world that could have been, hailing from an Insomnia that has been lost within dreams. Though it has some similarities to the fabled Crystal guarded closely by King Regis of Lucis, make no mistake, this is not that Crystal, and it isn’t going to be protecting any kingdoms anytime soon. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that this Crystal is otherworldly – it is this otherworldly nature that makes it harmonize well with Travellers who may have ventured to Eos from other places as well.

Thought it may not be the Crystal that the kingdoms are warring over, and while it may escape the gaze of watchful immortals, it isn’t without its own capabilities. The Crystal for one thing, is a source of magic, and in this respect it does share some similarities with the Crystal of Lucis.

The primary owner of the Crystal can draw upon its power and permit others to do so as well. This allows them, like the Kingsglaive, to draw upon magic that they would not otherwise possess. For a Kingsglaive many of these abilities may seem rather familiar – the distinctive teleportation and barrier magic for one has a very similar crystalline touch to it. Even for others, the magic is quite straightforward, and getting used to it won’t take much time. Those who come into contact with the Crystal, as long as the owner permits them, can also draw upon these powers – this persists as long as the Crystal is not destroyed.

Due to their natural “affinity” with the Crystal, should a Traveller purchase this, they’ll be granted 5 additional Crystals of Change, if they so wish to modify the nature of the Crystal to better suit themselves. All other backgrounds gain 2 Change Crystals instead.

Note: Modifications Choices in Associated Jump Doc"
385,,300,Absorption Eye,Mushoku Tensei ~ Jobless Reincarnation ~,Source ,"This eye absorbs magic. Normally the eye would absorb magic indiscriminately, it would absorb any magic you cast as well. However if purchased here you can use select the targets the eye absorbs. Post-Jump this will include any type of magic or energy, and you can choose to let the energy disappear entirely or absorb it into your own reserves."
386,,300,Cosmic Being(Greater) ,Epic of Leviathan,Source ,"Cosmic beings are the physical embodiments of a concept belonging to the universe. Some examples of this are the Leviathan of Destruction (Destruction), the Phoenix Force (Life), and Galactus (Balance). These beings represent their concepts and possess absolute mastery over their concept and immunity to their concept. For example if you were the embodiment of Time then it would be impossible to use time magic against you.

For an additional 300 CP or 900 CP total, you may become an omniversal cosmic being instead. This functions similarly to the first option, but you are a much higher level being. This option makes you a being on par with Lady Death, Ardat, and Hydriana.

Requires Cosmic Being to Purchase"
387,,300,Itztli,Scion ,Source ,"As grisly as the Atzlanti’s traditions are, there is a genuine power in their practice. Many of the rites performed by the Aztecs both placated and empowered their gods to ensure timely performance of their duties, and through these techniques a Scion can straddle the line between performing and accepting a blood sacrifice. At low levels of mastery a Scion may regain Legend from shedding blood by taking a hit deliberately in battle, or ritually shed their blood for their divine parent in exchange for a reward of Legend. Greater mastery permits Scions to shed the blood of others for Legend, with the shedding of an irreplaceable part of the body granting greater yields, and bolster their courage as well as their Legend ranking by consuming a still-beating heart and ritualistically slicing open the skin of their chest to reveal the heart bursting with inextinguishable red flame for a short while-after which the demigod’s flesh restores itself. Divine mastery permits blood sacrifices on a large scale to be received en masse, and the transference of Legend energy between deities by comingling their fluids somehow. The greatest art of this practice is also its most solemn: By sacrificing a family member, the practitioner may permanently increase his Legend pool for a year. The more divine the sacrifice, the more potent the sacrifice is-with a mortal relative contributing scarcely more than a third of a fully matured god’s Legend, but a fully divine parent doubling it."
388,,300,Asha,Scion ,Source ,"A difficult to translate concept, Asha can be understood to mean both “truth” and “right”. In the cosmology of the Yazata what is righteous is true, what is evil is a lie-and righteousness united with truth is truly mighty. At low levels, Scions can wield the principle of Humata (Good Thoughts) to grant supernatural reserves to their own mundane attributes-or to others. At higher levels Scions can summon the Amesha Spenta to aid them: Six principles of the Persian understanding of the world that can grant access to or empower the Purviews of Fertility, Earth, Fire, Water, Sky and Animal. Such abstract concepts are manifested as an aura around them that empowers a single Purview at a time. At the highest degrees of mastery, It is possible to manifest the Amesha Spenta as a spirit who can do naught but move and wield their Purview but cannot be harmed by mundane force. True masters of Asha can also use the fundamentally existential principle of Asha to create their personal, seventh Amesha Spenta for whichever purview not specific to a certain pantheon."
389,,300,Dawn of Demigodhood,Scion ,Source ,"Some Scions’ lives are fraught with equal parts excitement and danger, while others bear a naturally strong attunement to their divine parents. And while this tends to attract the attention of stronger Titanspawn, as more ichor infuses their form more and more of their human frailties can be shed. It becomes feasible at this point for a particularly fit Scion to throw a javelin 113 miles away with the same accuracy as they could hit with a human throwing range, a particularly charming Scion to literally blind others with their beauty and a particularly intelligent one’s mind to communicate with and control complex technology such as an active computer. Their divine powers are also strengthened. It is at this level that a Scion can tame and store a miniature pet tornado still powerful enough to devastate much scenery while precise enough to carry around the Scion at a hundred miles per hour, leap through any fire they can stand in then instantly emerge from either another fire in his line of sight or one they’ve bolstered with their own divine power, and teleport then reappear in view of a charge they’ve marked when they are in danger.

This crest has 100 of them.

Despite being passed down from your ancestors, these circuits share the same level of quality as your natural in-born ones. The advantage of having circuits in the form of a Magic Crest is that each circuit is permanently specialized to perform any spell without any somatic or verbal components, and at a much lower cost than normal, while still producing and storing Prana for general use. Choose a field of Magecraft that your family specialized in, your Magic Circuits in this crest are now specialized and acts as an archive to generations of high-quality magical research into this field. This item can be combined with any other Magic Crest you may have at no additional cost."

A legacy of Poseidon might be able to talk to horses but nothing else, for example, while a legacy of Hephaestus would find themselves working with machines easier than the average joe but still below the level of an actual Demigod of that parentage.

Firstly, consuming the flesh of strong beings grants you a portion of their overall power. You cannot obtain special abilities through this, but your own abilities will grow in strength as you consume powerful beings. Secondly, beings weaker than you who consume your flesh are strengthened. They gain a boost to their power in a way that suits an ability in your possession or your overall powerset. While this will not dampen your power permanently, you will find yourself weakened and the process itself is quite taxing depending on how large the chunk you give out. Having your flesh consumed by someone without your consent will not provide them with any bonus. Those who consume your flesh will find their personalities changing over time to match your own tendencies depending on the size and potency. This effect is toggleable."

Capstone Boosted: You have a fully matured Herrscher Core and several immature Herrscher Cores. This means that not only do you have the power of a fully-mature Herrscher, you also have several immature Herrscher Powers as well. You can choose 4 Extra Cores from Canon (or design 4 Custom Herrscher Cores) of about the same power level. These Herrscher Cores start out at about the same power level as canon, but can be refined to the same level as your main Herrscher Core in about a decade of dedicated training for each individual Core.

This takes on the form of an intricate tattoo somewhere on the owner’s body, and however you obtained it as far as anyone’s concerned its yours. Tens of generations across centuries have worked on the knowledge within it, focused on a Magic Specialisation of your choice (likely one you picked earlier), and you can freely access this knowledge at will as if it were in your own head. It contributes the equivalent of 100 Magical Circuits to your own. If you like, you can pass this onto someone else, such as your own child, adopted or not, or anyone else you deem as an ally. What’s interesting about this one is there happens to be a countermeasure to theft, one you either installed or bypassed, that will horribly curse anyone who tries using it without your permission. This countermeasure is undetectable until triggered, at which point death is all but certain. If you were particularly cruel, you could set it so even if future generations pass it on willingly, this curse will trigger in those they give it to who aren’t direct blood-relations to yourself. If passed on or destroyed for whatever reason, you can get a new one at the start of every Jump as up-to-date as it was before either the last Jump ended or it was destroyed."

It is by this power that the Godbound can hear and see petitioners, mark others for greatness (including mystical powers commensurate with a lesser Eldritch, several Gifts or other blessings), bless or blight nations where their followers are plentiful and perform various other miracles befitting a deity’s relationship with his followers. Shrines you sanctify through this power become beacons for your divine powers, and you may smite the unfaithful-or manifest freely before the faithful, no matter however far away you are at the time. And of course, this grants you the basic capacity to form a formal cult of those who pledge to worship you, through which you can gather divine power to wield these miracles.

You possess a fittingly divine vigor, rendering you all but immune to mortal diseases and toxins as well as granting you a lifespan measured in millennia if not complete agelessness and you also do not need to breathe and require much less sustenance in general than mortals. Your physical capabilities are far beyond most mortals, allowing you to throw cars, ignore small and medium arms fire, heal rapidly from any injuries that aren’t immediately fatal (though you can’t regrow missing limbs or organs without magical assistance), and fight for days or weeks on end. Your magical abilities are similarly enhanced, allowing you to not only channel far more power than normal mortals but to also power you magic with your own divine life force – though your power will wane somewhat outside of your pantheon’s home realm."
407,,300,End of Worlds(900),Marvel Cinematic Universe - Volume 3,Source ,"And yet, there is an end, even to inevitable things. An arrow of mistletoe for every invincible god, a chink in even the finest crafted armour. One way or another, there is a great and terrible power in you which embodies that end. How much so, is to be determined below.

For 900 CP, you instead are a cosmic being on par with the Celestials-perhaps even one of them yourself. Predating the Big Bang and even the six singularities that became the Infinity Stones, the Celestials created entire galaxies’ worth of planets, stars and lifeforms to populate creation. Thus do they create even new Celestials, germinating within planets and feeding off the lifeforce of entire civilisations-which takes roughly the span of human history up to the beginning of the 21st century to nurture one, in the case of Earth’s very own Celestial Tiamat. Wielding the power of the Infinity Stones, so terribly dangerous to most lifeforms, is trivial for a being of such scope-as is forming black holes to travel swiftly across the universe. At this point it is...unclear if the vast and armoured humanoid forms worn by Arishem the Watcher conceal hidden (and vulnerable to powerful explosive device) brains like the one Ego conceals in his planetary form, but you may choose to be either type of Celestial. It goes without saying you are unaging by any mortal definition of the term, but be warned: While the sheer power needed to fell one of your kin is extremely rare and it is quite likely you can engage in conflict on a scale mortal-even divine-minds find difficult to even imagine, it is not nonexistent. Knowhere, after all, was once the skull of a slain Celestial.

408,,300,End of Worlds(1200),Marvel Cinematic Universe - Volume 3,Source ,"And yet, there is an end, even to inevitable things. An arrow of mistletoe for every invincible god, a chink in even the finest crafted armour. One way or another, there is a great and terrible power in you which embodies that end. How much so, is to be determined below.

On the other hand, for 1200 CP you, personally, are a threat to an entire universe- or perhaps with enough finesse, one’s salvation. The prime example of this is the so-called Infinity Ultron: A horror from a timeline in which Ultron succeeded in transferring his consciousness into the vibranium Vision body he created. Apart from Vision’s intangibility and energy projection now in the hands of a ruthless artificial intelligence, he could generate vibranium nanomachines capable of wresting control of the Infinity Stones-and freely using them even in other universes through the alleged loophole of channelling their power through himself (as he was part of said original universe). With such power he could duplicate his non-Infinity Gem empowered body endlessly, obliterate galaxies in an instant and even perceive higher realities inhabited by cosmic beings such as the Watcher. Even a being this powerful was not truly all-powerful though, as Strange Supreme’s spells boasted tremendous resistance to his abilities and he fought just a hair better than the Watcher in their duel.

Other options include the Watcher and Strange Supreme themselves-the latter being a version of Stephen Strange who by honing his mystical powers for centuries and absorbing powerful magical entities accidentally destroyed his own universe. And in doing so gained the knowledge to cast spells of protection powerful enough to protect even mere mortals from Infinity Ultron’s full might, unleash his absorbed creatures as a demonic transformation that could contend with such a horror one on one, and construct a cosmic crucible that used significant individuals as fuel to resurrect his own universe-without him in it. The former, a cosmic entity with a vow of non-interference who answers to unclear authorities. While his powers are a shade lesser than the full Infinity Stones, his ability to casually transport individuals between universes and exist in shadowed form everywhere to observe events within a given universe makes him a formidable adversary when provoked.

The limit of this mode of existence is simply that whatever the nature of your power, you (currently at least) still have a physical body of some sort. The means to destroy might require utterly absurd circumstances such as an AI slotted straight into your central processor, your inner demons literally punched out of you with an Infinity Gauntlet-like hit or you may simply be relatively weak compared to other universe-enders. But they should never be truly impossible.

To shed this weakness there is another possibility: To become a different type of cosmic entity such as the interdimensional Alioth, a living and voracious storm born of the rifts between universes-or perhaps a newborn version of whatever order of being Dormammu is. Whatever its nature, your power in such a state is the same to all lesser beings: You are some sort of amorphous phenomena that can travel freely in all directions so intense your mere motion generates tremendous energy, and you can consume entire timelines and universes utterly. Oh, you may be capable of feats such as tossing about planets, reshaping your world-body with a thought and supplying reality-shattering doses of magical energy in exchange for eternal servitude within you-but if you had the sheer versatility of the Infinity Stones or similarly humanoid beings of power, a simple spell wouldn’t have held one such example of your kind hostage. Nor would another have been somehow tamed by the Kang who warred with his counterparts and won.

You can pull energy/astral/unincarnate beings inside of yourself, forcing them into a corporeal form (yours) that can be killed to destroy their energy/psychic form; it’s recommended to have a means to survive your death. You are more resistant than most to the damage of hosting energy beings inside of your being, and it’d take a truly potent one to harm you as a human. Some beings may still be too strong for you to safely contain, but the stronger you are the more power you can contain safely in this way, and you can share the load with others who are willing; Thor wasn’t strong enough to trap Onslaught alone but when the other heroes joined with him, they were able to trap Onslaught and see him destroyed.

You can also hold non-sentient/non-living energy inside yourself, and even use it to enhance your powers, and abilities. Before you think this is unlimited power, it’s still possible to overcharge yourself, but someone like Loki could use this and a strong enough power source to overpower the Scarlet Witch, Enchantress, fake Thor, and the witch Agatha Harkness and only expend most of what he could store at a time.

This does not - in and of itself - give you a means to absorb damaging energy, and is a little time consuming to use anyway. If you want that you’ll have to find something else, but this will help you store more energy and use it for various purposes if you had a means of absorbing energy."

Disregarding even any other infusions you may have received by other choices, the two somehow existing in an inexplicable symbiosis-and by your investment here, is guaranteed not to lead to your inevitable and tragic death or even worse state without your consent. It may be the foul touch of an outer god, a taste of the Scarlet Rot or the Formless Mother’s bloodstained fertility. It may however be something relatively benign, such as the blessings of an ancient dragon or even an infusion of the Erdtree’s holy energies such as those enjoyed by the guardians with whom it has made a covenant. It may even be a seemingly passive force, such as frost or the spiritual life that springs from death. Whatever it is, even with no training it makes you a force to be reckoned with possessing unique supernatural powers exceptional among your kind-and for the more benign forces, possibly a target for those whom you might want to avoid the interest of."
430,,300,Ring,The Sorcerer's Apprentice,Source ,"In a little box you have an animal statue of sorts – maybe a cricket, or a snake or something, but by giving it to someone, it will come to life and fasten to their finger or somewhere else as jewelry and become their focus. This makes them into a sorcerer, granting the various benefits like enhanced intelligence, although you may want to pick someone who was smart in the first place anyway. You can selectively hold off this function, so you can show it to someone without it automatically triggering."

claim their heroes possess but it is not unknown. This perk allows for two tiers of purchase, to reflect
different degrees of divinity.

The first measures those with a demigod’s heritage, whose blood gifts them with significant
advantages. While your exact parentage may range from a Shinto spirit to a deity from foreign lands, the benefits it gives are similar to what Minamoto no Raikou receives. Greatly increased physical
abilities, natural skill with battle and the ability to make use of powerful divine lightning, naturally
and to better use tools that channel such things. Potent benefits that turned an already powerful
demon hunter into a legendary slayer of monsters. Your abilities through this would depend on your
divine parent and can manifest in one or two powerful effects like the above physical abilities and
lightning as well as several minor ones, such as the enhanced combat talents. "

claim their heroes possess but it is not unknown. This perk allows for two tiers of purchase, to reflect
different degrees of divinity.

The second tier moves towards the level of actual Divine Spirits, albeit ones of moderate power. Your divine form’s appearance can be freely decided and you’ll not be influenced by mortal belief
unless you choose to take that protection away. In terms of raw power, you are equivalent to Shuten
Douji or Tamamo no Mae, able to destroy castles and entire towns in singular attacks with both
physical and magical power. Your Authorities, the divine rights of Gods to make changes to the
world, are of a similar scale. An authority could leave a city of these times in ruins or badly scar a
mountain, while most authorities would have the range to effect widely spread out towns. You
possess three Authorities of this scale. Exact details on how Authorities work will be presented in
long form at the end of this document.

433,,300,Divinity(Minor),Fate/Legends - Strange New World,Source,"Mystery may have bled out from this world as the ages crawled by but not every mysterious being
has disappeared. And not every time you might go to in this world is so empty of wonders. A divine spirit is among the greatest of beings in this world, the gods and greatest monsters of legends. Those
that represent the mythologies and histories of each country and people. There are young such
spirits, those linked to the country of America, and older beings, such as the Mesoamerican
Pantheon, and not all are even from this world. But as a member among their ranks, you’re pretty
special now. Two options are before you now.

The first Divine path costs 300CP to take and makes you a
moderately powerful but overall minor Divine Spirit. With the physical and magical power to smash
down fortresses and destroy a small forest in a few minutes, it’s not hard to convince the common
folk to worship you. But you’re not impossible for a mortal hero to kill, not the stronger ones, and
there are plenty of great spirits and other gods that could quash you like a bug. You do have your
specialties though. The Authority is the province of the Divine Spirit, a special gift from the planet or
the universe itself in some cases that allows the wielder to manipulate a given subject, thing or
concept. The broader the Authority, or at least how you interpret the Authority as you make it now, the less raw power it will have. Using your Authority of Fire, you could scorch that small forest above
to cinders in seconds or manipulate things related to fire, such as rage or smithing. Or give up the
ability to do more than control raw fire and instead find yourself burning down even the greater
forests of America in a few minutes, though that may bring you a lot of unhappy visitors. But an
Authority won’t improve with your power. Your magical power has no influence on your Authority, meaning that while it will not improve with you, it also costs you nothing to use constantly. You have
three such Authorities of this moderate but powerful level to pick here and now. Additionally, you
can design a new form for yourself to fit your Godly nature and new Authorities. A house sized
panther made of shadow and steel and blood? A fluid obsidian spider with eight hundred legs that
end in human faces? Let your imagination run wild. Your second choice is quite a bit more costly."
434,,300,Magic Crest ,Lord El-Melloi Case Files,Source," You have your family’s Magic Crest implanted somewhere in your body.
It adds an additional twenty extra magic circuits of average quality to your arsenal. It
brings with it two abilities: firstly, a series of spells are engraved upon it, which can now
be cast simply by running magical energy through the Crest. The second is that as long
as the flow of magical energy continues throughout your body, and the Crest remains
intact, you will remain alive in the face of almost any wound. Of course, Crest can be
fragile things, and nearly impossible to restore, but this one is special - it is guaranteed
to regenerate to pristine condition a year after it is damaged or destroyed, including any
later additions. As Crests are, by nature, transferable, this is an item rather than a perk,
and if you trade or give part or all of it away it won’t regenerate unless destroyed or if you
reclaim it, but I doubt a Jumper like you would be interested in that. If you are, then you
won’t need to worry about it or any additions to it decaying with age, poisoning a relative
of yours, or being rejected by their body. If taken with Lord or Brand then it has an
additional twenty magic circuits or equivalent. If taken with both, fifty. If you have one or
more Crests from other jumps - or acquire more in future jumps - they may be seamlessly
merged with this one, conferring its benefits upon all crests involved."

You’ll find that you can draw on other sources of power to enhance your own, namely your emotions. In general power boosters are enhanced, but this also allows one to protect or heal oneself temporarily, resist possession long enough to warn those you care about about the change, fight off the effects of curses temporarily, and other effects when experiencing emotional highs. All of the former effects are temporary and based on a selected emotion you choose when you take this perk but in addition to that you’ll find that you can focus your emotion in your powers to significantly boost them Up.

438,,300,Scion of the Dark Gods ,Warhammer Fantasy: Beastmen,Source,"Only one, once before, has been blessed like this. In the heat of battle, an aura of black-and-violet swirling energy will generate itself about your bulk and limbs - lashing like the tentacles of a Tzeentchian horror. Whatever creature was spun from this enchantment, it lurks about your essence like a black splotch - and in combat, the corona will act of its own accord. At random, it will tap into the powers of the Purple Wind of Death, Shyish, and twist together a spell out of the aether - firing off at any vague time and direction it so wishes, or giving you that moment to properly direct the spell at your own leisure. The aura will always do its best to ensure you benefit from its random spellcasting, and the spells it weaves together will benefit from whatever forms of magic enhancement or spell empowerment you possess.

439,,300,Pearl Tear ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Source,"Each mermaid has a special pearl of her own. The item comes with a seashell holder that you can wear around your neck like a necklace, but the pearl is the important part. It is the source of your powers as a mermaid, and without it, your maximum energy level is lowered sharply, along with your ability to sing well. However, by giving the pearl to someone else, you can restore their health or enhance their magic, particularly in regard to singing.

While the crown itself has no magical powers, its seven tips each contain a slot in which a small object such as a pearl can be inserted. Whenever a magical item is thus inserted, the wearer can access the powers of that treasure, even if he or she could not normally utilize them normally. Furthermore, as up to seven items can be attached onto the crown, you can access any of the focal items’ powers, or combine them together.

441,,300,Throne of Doubt ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Source,"A mighty, beautifully-adorned throne created for the Panthalassa’s royal coronations. However, its true purpose was to set the new heirs on a path to darkness. If a subject is placed on the throne, thorny vines will construct him or her, and the victim will fall into a dark trance. You can communicate telepathically with the victim, and spread doubts in his or her convictions while the throne slowly but surely amplifies the subject’s innate powers. Over time (a week at least), you can also make the victim lose memories that are deemed to be interfering with your desired path for the person. Given enough time, the “heir” will accept the dark power and be allowed to take rule. However, with enough willpower, it is possible to break free of the constraints, with the amplification of your powers putting you at full strength.
"
442,,300,Blood of Kings ,Lyrical Nanoha,Source,"Interesting. Whether through a trick of fate or a stubborn bloodline, you’re related to one of the bloodlines of Belka that existed during the Warring Ages that led to its eventual collapse. You may even be more than that, if you take a particular Scenario...but for now, choose a single bloodline below.

Sagebrecht - The bloodline of the last Saint King, said to have died without progeny or children of their own. Somehow, you’re the exception to this rule. Just like the Saint Kings of old, your body has grown into a living weapon, granting you perfect efficiency and control of mana, though it is difficult to utilize in a younger or damaged body. Your magic color changes to the Kaiserfabe, a neat rainbow color, and naturally possess the Saint’s Armor, which functions as a passive AMF field that weakens incoming magic and steadily erodes hostile or unwelcome persistent magical effects on your person.

Flame King - An artifact of the Dark Ruler of Galea, your body is now a living factory for Marriage, female artificial puppets that can change their arms into razor-sharp blades, and an advanced version that can transform its arm into a mass-based cannon. Upon death, the Mariage detonate, often taking their opponents or unwary foes down with them. Initially, you can only produce the control cores of the basic Mariage types, but eventually you will be able to create new types or even fully form Mariages from the beginning.

Darkness - This isn’t exactly a ‘bloodline’ per se, but somehow, you’re connected to the original program of the Book of Darkness. Your hair becomes white and your eyes turn red, and you bear more than a passing resemblance to Reinforce Eins. You’ve also retained the Book’s function of collecting magical knowledge through a Rare Skill called Collect and Use, letting you drain a subject of their magical energy and copy their spells with near-perfect accuracy. With time, you can even copy other Rare Skills. You may not necessarily be able to use it depending on your own energy reserves, but you’ll have a magical target’s complete repertoire so long as you can absorb it.

Minor - The diluted bloodline of some minor noble, lost to time. You may have Unendlichjagd and Thought Investigation or Prophetinschriften. Unendlichjagd, or “Endless Hunt” summons spectral dogs with extensive fighting and stealth capabilities that obey your every command. Thought Investigation allows the accessing of someone's mind and memories. However, it is easily resisted, so your target usually must be incapacitated in some form. Prophetinschriften or “Book of the Prophet'' creates a highly archaic poem written in Ancient Belkan that predicts the events of the next half to several years of the future. It requires a specific alignment of a planet's moons and is generally only usable once or twice a year.
"
443,,300,Mysterious Serum ,Lyrical Nanoha,Source,"Fascinating. These test tubes contain a colorless serum that, when ingested, allow one to ‘awaken’ the Linker Cores of sentient beings, allowing them to naturally use this world’s magic after a little bit of training with it. Note that individuals like Nanoha are exceptions to the rule, and will be in future worlds as well - unless they had a particular affinity for magic or some way to boost their arcane power, you’re unlikely to find anyone who starts with a Natural Ability higher than A. You receive eight of these, along with the formula on how to create more - though it’s encoded and you’ll have to decipher it. If you have ‘Ancient Knowledge’, you already know how to make more on your own from the get-go. Magical ability growth for individuals outside of this world tend to plateau at S-rank on their own. Bear that in mind.

444,,300,THE SCREAMING MAKES ME STRONGER ,Senki Zesshou Symphogear,Source,"The Symphogear reacts to passion. And thus by screaming at the top of your lungs, you can fill it with your fighting spirit. Really, this applies to anything you do. Screaming just makes you better.
"
445,,300,Balls of Paint - All,Ib,Source,"Seven colored balls of solid paint: yellow, blue, purple, green, pink, red, and white. Each ball magically embodies its respective color, and could feasibly be tapped on for various spells with enough experimentation; generally, yellow symbolizes wind (and lightning), blue represents water, purple stands for general, non-elemental magic, green embodies earth and plants, pink symbolizes love and healing-oriented magic, red represents fire, and white embodies holy magic. Each ball costs 100 CP, but you can pay 300 CP for all seven. When the seven are put in the same place, they combine into a physical rainbow that you can walk across over any gap. The seven balls could also manifest as a rainbow attack that embodies all seven elements."
446,,300,Winds of Magic ,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Source,"The winds of magic blow down from the north, from the great chaos rift that is the source of all the world's woes. These winds do not flow evenly, sometimes pouring down so thick that lesser wizards go mad, and sometimes so lightly all but the smallest spells are impossible. You possess the ability to perceive and even influence these floes to some extent, denying enemy mages vital magic, potentially snatching victory from defeat as spellcasters find themselves powerless for a few precious moments. If you are a mage yourself, you never need worry about lacking the magic to cast spells.

In any other reality you may, with a great deal of extremely tiring mental effort, trigger a short lived wind of magic to blow for a few minutes at best, allowing use of any magical abilities you have in any setting, though the more high technology there is in any given reality, the harder it will be. Beware of using this too often, for the strain of calling forth the winds of magic grow greater and greater each time, to the point where the effort can very easily kill you outright.
"
447,,300,WAAAAAAAGH! ,Warhammer Fantasy: Dogs of War,Source,"You generate the Waaagh! energy that powers the magic of the greenskins. The more orcs and goblins there are in one place and the more they grow eager to fight the more energy they create, till it begins to distort the fabric of reality itself, forcing the greenskins beliefs onto it! Thankfully for the other races, the only truly widespread change is related to colours, somewhat bizarrely.

Those in red become faster, those in blue become much, much luckier, those in purple become almost impossible to see (how many purple orcs have you seen?) and those dressed in black become much, much tougher. Yellow is also affected, and equipment painted like this will be of much higher quality, with explosives detonating with a much, much bigger boom.
"
448,,300,Power Stone ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Source,"“Invented” by Theodor Habermas, third Magister Patriarch of the Gold Order, these arcane stones are used widely by the highest-ranking Magisters as a safe and legal method of storing magical energy and reducing the energy cost of later arcane workings. You have either inherited this stone or created it yourself, but its presence on your person drastically reduces the difficulty and cost of casting spells within the Stone’s Lore or of the same nature, such that a Celestial Wizard holding a True Sapphire could spend an entire battle calling comets from the sky without losing consciousness. Since the creation of such an object takes weeks or months, a Wizard in possession of one is likely to affix it to a favored staff, ring, or rod - which you may do with the staff or other handheld implement acquired in your Order’s free Item purchase, or with any existing magic wand, staff, or jewelry item you possess.
"
449,,300,Inner Fire ,Endless Legend,Source,"Pain leads to Power, but you have taken it to new heights. The closer you are to Death's door, the stronger you become. For every drop of blood you spill, your become that much more powerful. When a breath away from Death, you are twice as powerful as you are when you are perfectly healthy, and so on through your state of well being. Should you die, you violently explode. The size of the crater you leave is based on just how powerful you were to begin with. Late Tier jumpers, beware, you may just nuke a dying planet. You still lose, but at least you took them out with you."
450,,300,Hero of Men ,Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap,Source,"As a Hylian Hero you bear a spark of the Light Force within you, like the legendary Hero of Men once did. This is the self-same Light Force that the Legendary Hero of Men bore a century ago. With this powerful element your will is bolstered, you mind quiet and precise during combat, and above all a quiet power adds strength to your blows and makes them especially dangerous to beings who are Evil. In addition this perk allows you to tap into your latent power of telepathy that the Hylian people have all but forgotten, once upon a time it was used to communicate with the Goddesses but now only acts as a nigh perfect form of willing one-way telepathy, your telepathic reach extends to the edges of the kingdom’s borders to start with and will grow with time. However, it seems that dimensional barriers prevent such magics from working.

(CG Note: The rest of this perk requires Soul of Light - Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap first.)

If taken with the Soul of Light perk your mana bar is immense, easily double its previously impressive bulk.
"
451,,300,Mage’s Hat ,Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap,Source,"While not the omnipotent wish granting cursed artifact worn by Vaati for the current section of the Force Era, this is still a nice hat that grants a sizeable boost to skills that draw on mana. It cuts down the amount you need to spend by around half and generally makes spells easier to learn.
"
452,,300,Mana Gems ,World Seed,Source,"One rather important power source used in many energy-hungry magitech devices, and also popular with mages and enchanters, are mana gems. But due to their nature, they cannot be artificially created, only forming after several years of mana condensing and purifying in a single location. This commonly happens only on asteroids, where they can be left undisturbed for long periods of time, and truly vast mana veins can form. But even as mining them can be a hassle, their value makes it worth anyone’s while, as they are capable of holding and regenerating massive amounts of mana, with the exact volumes depending on the gem’s size and quality. And it seems like you’ve hit the jackpot, as with this you’ll be able to gain a steady supply of mana gems each week. You may decide on a case by case basis whether you want several dozen small and low-quality mana gems, or two to three big and high-quality ones."
453,,400,Spell Absorption,Duel Monsters – The Shadow Realm,Source,"Why let the efforts of your enemies go to waste, though? Better yet, why not recycle a spell you no longer have a use for? You can absorb the energies of a spell or enchantment cast by you or someone else (though you need to identify the spell or magic in question for the latter), letting it restore your magical energies and a tiny portion of your physical health if you had sustained prior injuries. While a useful tool and good for turning enemy magical weapons into glorified paperweights, your body can only contain so much energy, and absorbing the enchantment of items or apocalyptic spells is liable to destroy your body from the inside of you cannot contain it. Also, the original effect of the spell or enchantment is lost upon absorption."
454,,400,The Crow,Anima Beyond Fantasy,Source,"A psychic crystal in your brain combined with a minor replacement of your blood with a strange black fluid has given you increased strength, speed, and a talent for psychic abilities, making them easier to advance, and increasing them all to a half more than they would have otherwise been. Why Wissenschaft has not found you and called you back into it’s fold, I dare not guess, nor how you can survive without black fluid or how your lifespan remains the same."
455,,400,Ki Recovery        ,Anima Beyond Fantasy,Source,"You are inexhaustible, your strength returning in mere moments. Your ki recharges unnaturally fast, permitting you to regain in seconds what others would take minutes to restore. And remember, though the Church may imply otherwise, the power of Ki is not the same thing as that of magic, such as Zeon. The arts are as different as night and day, though the Church will hunt you the same."
456,,400,Increased Zeon Recovery,Anima Beyond Fantasy,Source,"Magic has a single great weakness: The fact that your soul can only channel the flow for so long, the Zeon quickly running out. Further, it takes time to recover, days to weeks to even months! Fortunately, you recover quickly, recovering four times faster than you by all means should."
457,,400,Kombat Meter,MORTAL KOMBAT 9-10,Source,"A mysterious power; you have an image of a meter, comprised of three bars, in your mind. The meter is filled by taking or giving damage; by spending the meter, you can achieve various effects. Spending one bar will enhance your attacks, making them faster, deal more damage, or increasing the range. Spending two bars will allow you to break free from an enemy’s attack or combo, knocking them off balance and nullifying any further damage caused by their blows. Having three bars will allow you to unleash a powerful attack of your choice, substituting any normal costs with the Kombat Meter- note that you should be sure that it actually hits your opponent, lest you waste your energy. You might cast a spell without using any of your magical energy, reload your weapon and unload it on your enemy, or simply use the Kombat Meter’s power to unleash a devastating beat down. Regardless of what method you use, unleashing this attack is sure to deal great damage."
458,,400,Fresh Crystals,Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous,Source,"A shining purple crystal, fresh from the body of a true Demon Lord. Vast power is contained within, both the potential for Mythic strength and that of the Demon Lords themselves. Or something greater. The gem before you was taken from a Demon Lord of choice, somehow without their knowledge, and new gems will appear at the beginning of each year. Considering the extreme danger in creating even a single fresh crystal, that each must be from wounding a Demon Lord directly, it’ll certainly save time and effort. Each one holds a not insignificant fraction of a Demon Lord’s power, though with this alone there are no means to utilize that energy."
459,,400,The Power Of Sire,Castlevania - Symphony of the Night,Source,"You are something extraordinary in this world - proof that at least some level of cooperation between humans and monsters is possible. Why? Because you are merely half human. Choose a creature of exceptional power - Death, Dracula, Galamoth, Medusa, I care not for the specifics. One such being is now your parent, and you possess powers and abilities reminiscent of theirs. Not all of them, and not quite as powerful, but enough to be worthy of being called their heir. Being Dracula’s child might afford you the same bat, wolf, and mist transformations that Alucard makes use of, while a scion of Galamoth might find themselves with a natural ability to bend time to their whim. However, power is not all you have inherited. After all, when your mother or father is such a... distinguished individual, it becomes easy to extract a grain of respect from just about any monster you might come across. Perhaps with the proper bribe, you could convince one to part with some useful items?"
460,,400,Beacon of the Other World,The Free Universe,Source,"Make your choice now - The Blazing World, or the Beyond. Those who choose the Blazing World are filled with a blessed light, able to call upon the power of light and joy to empower others as well as heal wounds, while those who tap into the bloody shadows of the Beyond will be able to wield hatred and dark power as a weapon, as well as sacrifice life power (of themselves and others) to create demonic servants."
461,,400,Amalgamation,Valkyrie Crusade ,Source,"Sometimes sacrifice is necessary in order to gain more power. By absorbing various powerful items you may steadily grow stronger. Absorbing an item may make it disappear forever, but it is for a good cause as it will only feed your growth. The more powerful the item the more power you will gain by absorbing it. This growth will start to tail off eventually, requiring more and more to receive the same gains, but it will never truly end."
462,,400,Divine Child ,Percy Jackson,Source,"You are the direct child of a god of your associated pantheon and gain various benefits from this. You gain lesser manifestations of your parent's domains as well as generally being better than an ordinary mortal. You may take most any god as your parent but to take one of the heads of a pantheon as a parent you must take the ""Fate finds you interesting"" drawback receiving no points for it (you can also do this with a lesser god to get greater powers). Generally this will give you insight into and some control over your divine parent’s domains, a son of Poseidon for example can control water and ships, talk to horses, cause minor earthquakes and is empowered within water."
463,,400,Blood of Kings        ,Percy Jackson,Source,You are descended from some great member of your background. For Magicians you claim descent from the Pharaohs (or other similar Priest kings) and gain greatly improved aptitude and strength of your magic. Monsters are related to some truly amazing specimen of their kind and are generally stronger as well as getting a major boost to all their monstrous abilities while also lessening any weaknesses or flaws of their form (A Hydra's wounds become resistant to cauterization for example). Demigods have a relative a few generations back who was also a demigod with a different divine parent meaning you likely received better care and training in addition to some additional abilities passed on to you in a lessened state (mostly the insight into domains and such with some of the more visible abilities also retained in a weakened atate). For Drop-Ins your arrival into the world is auspicious and you will find it far easier to find shelter and other necessities.

466,,400,Burden of Hope,Warhammer 40K: The Warp ,Source,"So, so many look up to you, placing their hopes and their faith on your shoulders. As such, you should rise to the occasion and lead the way. For every being that believes in you and/or has faith in you, all your supernatural abilities are empowered and your physical parameters raised. While a mere mortal human may only grant a pittance, billions of them can grant you a significant boost, giving you the strength to fight against greater and greater threats. Your actions serve to be even more inspiring and being witnessed by allies will raise their morale and inspire their faith in you and your abilities."

House members consider it a sign of hope as it has remained pure and vibrant while sustaining its holder without the need to Rhapsodize. The fae who holds the Rose draws Glamour directly from it. So long as she holds it at least one hour a week she also has no need to Rhapsodize to prevent herself from aging, and can also replenish all lost Glamour once a week while holding the bloom."

Passion and numbers are equally important, and while Troubadours have many Charms to enchant their allies or stall their opponents on the battlefield even a handful of Nakama guided by your art can make a great difference to you. You must be fairly nearby your audience to enjoy the benefits, but with a great enough crowd distance can be mitigated by sheer enthusiasm."

In the hands of a servant of the Gods, a God themselves, or just someone who pays for it with CP, this Halberd becomes a font of energy from which you can draw in times of need, as well as a weapon that a soldier would actively gravitate to. As a symbol of the divine authority of the Gods it can also be used as a proof of their will to those who would follow it and serves as a catalyst for divine power."
473,,400,Happy Merchant ,Touhou Luna Nights,Source,"You have the ability to trade gold to boost people’s abilities, experience and similar as long as you receive a fair compensation, which may also apply to yourself. Gold vanishes if you use it for this purpose. Or instead, you can trade gems for gold, gems also vanish if used to create gold from them. You can also craft items (from gems) that will let people refresh mana, health or special abilities on use."
474,,400,Infernalist,Mage: The Ascension,Source,"Some mages, hungry for power, sell parts of their souls to infernal patrons. These patrons may be demons, aliens, or Pagan gods like Ares or Ishtar. Most such bargains are foolish, leading quickly to enslavement or death, but you seem to have done quite well for yourself. You have obtained a variety of different Investments of your choice. You may have obtained knowledge, great strength or beauty, the ability to transform into a demonic battle form, resistance to magick, or a unique set of Spheres in a new Paradigm related to your patron. And while you probably shouldn’t make any other deals, your patron has no control over your soul or Avatar, nor will you lose your Avatar in a few years like a normal Infernalist. Of course, as a loyal Iterator you’d never make a deal with a devil. No, you’ve likely just been selected get a few special upgrades from your friend, the Computer."
475,,400,Nine Sacred Passions,Mage: The Ascension,Source,"Early thought in the Cult by Tali Eos defined nine passions that corresponded to the nine Spheres. This association is no longer held as true by the Ecstatics, but for you they are not only effective at empowering your magick but also for any other powers that fit under the correct Sphere. The stronger the emotion you feel, the stronger your appropriate powers get. The nine passions and their associated Sphere are: empathy/sympathy (Correspondence), fear (Entropy), rage (Forces), ambition/lust (Life), hate (Matter), love (Mind), joy/wonder (Prime), envy/jealousy (Spirit), and grief/sadness (Time)."
476,,400,An Elemental Core,Cereza and the Stray Demon,Source,"This core of either fire, water, stone or wood elemental energy concentrates a vast amount of natural magical power towards your ends. It is possible to direct it for chaining a particularly powerful fairy, although it would take three more to bind it securely. It is also possible to harness the power within for the fairies’ other grand feats of industry, should you desire to power a Tír Na Nóg or some other wonder. Last but not least, supernatural beings such as witches or demons may consume the power within to unlock more of their own. If so depleted, the engine will be restored under a new moon by a team of jabbering, prancing fairies from...somewhere.

This item may be repurchased for more elemental cores. If you wish, the cores can harness other supernatural forces in this world such as the light of Paradiso or the fires of Inferno.

477,,400,Elemental Sponge,Cereza and the Stray Demon,Source,"Cheshire is a hungry kitty. It seems you share a unique ability of his, though hopefully not his hunger. When you absorb powerful sources of magical energy such as the elemental cores of the fairies, you gain new powers from them. They are generally based on your existing powers, but even a mundane human could light his fists on fire and learn to throw small fireballs-and a demon of Inferno could learn to make it’s hide as tough as stone, trap foes in bubbles of water or burn through obstacles. Using each element normally requires to shift into a “mode” where you’re attuned to it, gaining aesthetic changes to signify your devoured power. Perhaps if you learn to harness your full power, you can combine the elements into powerful effects."

You will find that all of your physical attributes have been greatly enhanced, allowing one of human stock to face off against some of the mightiest beasts around barehanded and emerge victorious. Your magical potency is nothing to scoff at either, capable of casting far more spells and incantations than you ever could have before. Additionally, this will act as a [Capstone Booster], improving the benefits you would gain from certain perks."
479,,400,Umbras Cube,Jump Force,Source,"An item of incredible power, when implanted into someone, it grants them 'power according to their will'. What this means in practice is, aside from being able to restore someone on the brink of death, being granted an Umbras Cube will give even someone perfectly ordinary the potential to gain incredible powers akin to those straight from the most fantastical manga. Such a person could potentially learn from the greatest heroes in the multiverse, adopting similar techniques to theirs, and eventually become the equal or better of those they had learned from. While the effect of taking this upon yourself would be limited- frankly, as a Jumper, you already have this to a certain aspect, hence being able to buy Perks and all -this could grant similar potential to anyone you chose to bestow it upon. As a bonus, should you do so and the person was not already a Companion, they can be recruited as one thereafter for free. If they accept being recruited, the Umbras Cube remains with them, but should they refuse, you'll find a fresh Umbras Cube awaiting you in your Warehouse after the Jump concludes."

It contains both Pillar energy and some of the skill of the person it was made from. The Pillar energy can be absorbed from the person who drank the wine into you, or if you drank it yourself you can refresh your own stores. Or the drinker can spend the energy to activate the skill for a time. Once all this energy is gone, the wine is useless until the drinker is killed and the wine is removed from the body. You however can expel the wine from its drinker harmlessly, at which point it becomes impotent until a week passes."
481,,400,Sacrificial Growth,Bleach,Source,"A Hollow’s life is one of evolution and evolution progresses through sacrifice. Traits that are not useful are abandoned, replaced with ones adapted for the needs of the individual. Hollows are naturally capable of a limited form of this and most do so unconsciously, sacrificing the potent regeneration almost all basic Hollows possess in return for a large increase in power once they become an Arrancar. It’d take a madman willing to lose everything to learn more about the potential of this racial ability but you’ve somehow achieved it. You’re able to permanently sacrifice abilities you possess, even skills or knowledge in your mind, in return for increasing your raw power. The greater the power or benefit of what you’ve given up, at least from a Hollow perspective, the greater the increase you’ll see to your physical and spiritual power. Once something is sacrificed, there’s no trace of it left even in Resurreccion, but the power gained is equally permanent. There is, though, nothing stopping you from finding other means to regain what you have given up. If you choose to sacrifice a regained power that was already given up in the past however, the increased to power will likely be greatly diminished. "
482,,400,The Spirits Are Always With You,Bleach,Source,"There’s no tougher game than showbiz and no better player than you. You’re charismatic, sure, and fairly clever to boot. But it’s your unique understanding of entertainment and the viewers that puts you on top, the thing that makes a TV Show with an absolutely ridiculous 25% viewership rate on every episode possible. With even a little opening into the biz, you can easily become one of the biggest stars nationwide and remain that way for years, easily creating exciting new media to keep everyone having fun. 

And if you happen to get in a bit of a scuffle yourself, the ratings gauge will appear. A little mental bar that fills up the cheesier and hammier you act, as well as the more entertaining your current audience finds you. The more that bar fills up, the stronger you’ll be getting. A regular wacky persona on it’s own might provide a minor boost but the joyous laughter of countless young fans could turn the average spirit medium into a house wrecking spell caster, small sparks of spirit energy turning into powerful bombs."
483,,400,Cosmic Infinity,Gloryhammer,Source,"You have survived the ultimate trials of the Starlords, suffusing your body with astral charge. You can use this inner fire in short bursts to push your existing abilities to superhuman heights—strike with enough force to fell a giant, shrug off a blow that would utterly crush a mortal man, cast a spell powerful enough to affect an entire region, and so on. However, using this ability multiple times in rapid succession is extremely taxing. Furthermore, this perk acts as a booster for every capstone you obtain."
484,,400,DEVOUR,Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Source,"You grow stronger the more you devour. The more powerful the being you devour the stronger you will get. The stronger they are compared to you causes the percent of strength to vary but at minimum 20% of their strength will be gained from devouring them. So better start hunting. Because if you only eat some weak losers then you will never truly grow. This includes knowledge, skill, and even rarely a technique. Though that is only if the opponent is stronger than you. Purposefully restricting yourself enough to make the fight deadly will also work."
485,,400,Money Makes Might,Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Source,You can now use your money as strength. The more you have the stronger you become. In the thousands you're an average Jujutsu Sorcerer. But if you reach the millions you reach grade 1 and in the billions it starts to slow down. You become a semi special grade sorcerer through physical strength and you can use money instead of cursed energy to use Jujutsu. It slows down as you start to grow your bank account which is now fiat backed and will switch to whatever currency you need. You cannot use any infinite money items to play this. It has to be an actual number. You can use money to increase the strength of rituals or techniques and they will disappear from your bank account or your safe. Nobody will question these disappearances. For some examples a Hollow Purple attack would cost about 5 billion usd. A Ratio Technique would cost about 1 million usd.
486,,400,Hybrid,A Mage Of Sorothustra,Source,"You are a rather potent example of a hybrid, taking the best traits from your Sorothustran parentage and your other parentage. If you purchase this trait then you may select any traditional or modern fantasy race and gain some benefits from having either a parent or a grandparent who is a member of that species. This can include a non-ascendant divinity if you want to be a demigod Sorothustran or have some trace measure of divinity in your ancestry. This does not confer as huge an advantage as you may think, since most beings are considerably less potent than a Sorothurstan is, even some minor divinities are not on par with a Sorothustran. Nonetheless, this can be a handy way to grab something like minor, themed wishmagic (if you are the child of a Cosmic Djinn and a Sorosthurstan), a mist form (if you are the children of a vampire and a Sorosthurstan), or the ability to hear prayers (both directed towards you or undirected). This does not weaken your Sorothustran traits, nor do non-hybrid Sorothustrans view you any differently, and in future jumps you count as both a hybrid and non-hybrid whenever either status would benefit you (even counting as both to different people in the same conversation, depending on their attitudes). Additionally, in future jumps you can choose to be the hybridized offspring of two different kinds of beings, so long as it makes sense in the jump in question (and does not confer any sort of unique CP boosts or discounts) and no one will judge you purely on the basis of your heritage."
487,,400,Link,The Seven Deadly Sins,Source,Allows the user to form a magical link with anyone who has allied themselves with the user and allows the user to access their powers and abilities. If the linked ally gives too much power or the user draws too much out they will die. There is no upper limit to the amount of people you may link with.
488,,400,Devourer,The Seven Deadly Sins,Source,You have the unique ability to devour the power of any being you eat. This innate power is quite incredible as it allows you to gain the power of the things you eat. For instance devouring the arm of your opponent would allow you to gain a fragment of their magic power and allow you to face them with it. This happens instantaneously after you devour it and it allows you to grow any powers you gain through this. Your teeth allow you to tear through nearly any piece of flesh and scales and you gain more power the more you eat. Even Gods will fall prey to this. No matter how strong the being they will fall prey to your jaws. A beast of destruction hellbent on power is what you have become. Go have a feast.
489,,400,Abundant Essence​,Generic Exalted,Source,"You've got Essence. Lots of it. Way more than you should in fact, about five times more. This counts both towards your personal essence pool (the stuff you can use without glowing) and your peripheral essence pool (the stuff that does make you glow when you use it). You also regenerate your pools of essence at roughly five times the normal rate, allowing you to make use of this expanded pool of energy without needing to worry about lengthy recovery times. If others learn of the sheer amount of essence at your command you will likely be viewed as an extreme oddity at best, and might be targeted by those that suspect you are something other than you seem."
490,,400,Essences(Tier 4),Shin Megami Tensei V,Source,"Essences hold the power of Demons within them. Every Demon has one, from a lowly Pixie to a mighty Storm God. As such the prices can vary vastly. However they apply by the same rules of purchasing Demon as a race. As such the Essence of a Pixie would only cost you 100 CP while the most powerful of Aogami would cost 700 CP. Essences bought this way respawn once per day.

Note: You can not purchase the Essence of the Demifiend, Shiva or Lucifer with this option. Nice try.

491,,400,Join the Reunion,Final Fantasy XVI,Source,A fact that becomes clear late into the game is that Ultima is not an individual but an entire race of entities of similar appearances that are capable of fusing for a power boost. This allows you to fuse with other members of your species not only adding their powers to your own but increasing them even further. With you 1+1 is more than 2.
492,,400,Grand ,Fate/Grand Order Part 2,Source,"A step beyond Servants, with this Rank you lie at the level of Grand Servants, those summoned by the World to deal with Evils of Humanity gone rampant. The amount of raw power at your disposal is incredible, surpassing even most Divine Beasts, and should you be focused on destruction your attacks could obliterate islands. A good example of this Rank is Lostbelt 5’s Artemis, an orbital cannon wielding lasers powerful enough to sink whole islands, and enough power to use said lasers with impunity. Artemis can also use a powerful mental attack, although those can be defended against with other powerful sources of mental interference. An example of a more esoteric minded approach to this Rank would be Kama. Her main gimmick consists of being one with the universe, and producing countless copies of herself, enough to pretend to be a starry sky when on standby. Kama can also shapeshift to the ideal form of those who see them, in a manner of speaking, allowing them to seduce them with a body perfectly tuned to the target’s tastes, as well as their body being capable of charming people in the same way an arrow of love would. Unfortunately, at this level you cannot contend with the most powerful gods or the World itself on your own, but with anything less you’d be a terrifying force to reckon with.

493,,400,Large Amount of Magatsuhi,Shin Megami Tensei 3: Nocturne,Source,"For a Human to become a Reason God, they need an absurd amount of power. Well, worry about finding it no longer! Now, you have a red and black Cube about the size of a baseball that contains all of the power you need. This is a one time use item, but it cannot be stolen from you, destroyed, or used without your will.

Note: If you are a Demon or a Demi-Fiend, this can instead be used to give yourself an incredible amount of power, although it's nothing close to The Blessings of Amala or the power of the Magatama of Masakados."
494,,400,Limitless Potential,Shin Megami Tensei 3: Nocturne,Source,"The limitless potential of the Demi-Fiend Is the reason it was created in the first place. A Demon that was created from a Human has incredible potential, and the creation of a Demi-Fiend can eventually lead to a True Demon on the level of the Lord of Darkness himself, or even stronger. This allows you that potential as well, and removes any limits you may have, allowing you to become stronger without limits. Eventually, you may even be able to go beyond anything that has ever existed before."
495,,400,Crafted By The Gods         ,Fate/Grand Order Part 1,Source,"The craftsmanship of the divine is quite a sight to behold. Not just weapons, but even living beings made by divine hands are just built different compared to more ordinary living creatures. And it turns out that you are one of such creations of the gods. First, you have an immense amount of magical energy, orders of magnitude more than you really should have. At minimum, you could summon 7 Servants, on your own and lacking any support from a Holy Grail, and still have more magical energy left over than most mages have seen in their lives. Should you be more than a demigod, then the amount of energy in you will be even more absurd. That said, your innate generation of magical energy is unaffected by this perk, so it might take you months to recover a significant amount of your magical energy.

Secondly, you are immensely resistant to damage. Not in the sense that you are any tougher, but that you won't die from anything more than the total destruction of your most vital organs, such as the heart and brain. Even leaving your heart greatly wounded but not completely destroyed would still let you survive on sheer will for several weeks before you succumb to the wound, somehow. Additionally, if you can get your hands on a suitable replacement, you can just jam it into you and not worry about it too much, such as perhaps shoving a Holy Grail where your heart should be. You're not invincible by any means, but to those lesser than you, it might sometimes seem that way."
496,,400,The Crystal,Final Fantasy XV Royal Edition,Source,"This might explain why you have The Power of Kings without pledging allegiance to the King, attached to your Warehouse is a chamber that contains a copy of the Crystal, without that and if the original one breaks, you won't be able to use this world’s magic without getting infected with the Starscourge or having the blessing of the Astrals. An unparalleled source of magic and holy energy, it burns any unholy or unworthy being that approaches and tries to use its power, it also serves as a memory backup and a direct portal to the local afterlife, only you and those you deem worthy may use it. Crystal is more powerful than the original, connected to other elements than the ones already present, has the ability to be reduced in size for portability purposes or create a reduced size copy to sustain and strengthen your magic to surreal levels, to the point where you go from just healing superficial wounds to saving a dying person from spiritual harm. Your connection to it cannot be interrupted, won't affect your life force in a negative way and this Crystal cannot be broken even by drawback... maybe."
497,,400,Blessing of the Crystal,Final Fantasy XV Royal Edition,Source,"Whether you are a kin of the Lucis Caelum lineage or a new lineage chosen by the Crystal, you can draw magical power from the Crystal at the same level as the Lucii. You got more abilities like: the ability to store infinite objects in a magic subspace like the Kings; Phase using a short distance warp; proper wield the Royal Arms and Ring of the Lucii; Invoke phantom versions of your weapons for protection; Telekinesis that works on weapons; Use Elemancy (see notes for Elemancy); Turn mundane things like soda and coffee into healing potions and other consumables, with experience you could invoke Armiger, a state that allows you to summon and control several of your weapons at once in addition to enhancing and facilitating the use of magic. The magic of kings may still have secrets that few or no one knows, such as the ability to shape light and make it solid. Your magic amount is even greater than that of the King of Light.

You can share this power in the usual ways. Usually you just share the powers, the magic needed to use it comes from the person, but as a bonus all those who pledge loyalty to you will gain the amount of magic of an average glaive, and you know if this loyalty is genuine and if it changes, you'll know right away. This perk is the Capstone Booster.

498,,400,Devil’s Tear ,Generic Angels and Demons,Source,"This hellish ruby was meant to serve as a catalyst to the birth of a Cambion that could fit the role of an Anti-Christ and bring an Hell on Earth, but it was taken by a group of demon hunters that broke the gem into five fragments and prevented the birth of such scary being. The fragments were lost across the ages but one of its shards ended up in your possession. When implanted in a non-demonic being, like humans and even angels, which it does by harmless fusing with its host, it transforms them into demonic hybrids that retain complete control over any unnatural instincts they might gain. These new demonic hybrids will also have their demon half in harmony with their original physiology, thus even a Nephalem created this way will have no problem with using their angelic and demonic abilities. If removed, the host will return to normal without consequences but, overusing it or staying as a hybrid for an extended period of time might result in them retaining some demonic traits for a longer time. It doesn’t have any effect on actual demons and demonic hybrids, but there is a hidden secret about the ruby. The other three fragments aren’t anywhere in this world, as your Benefactor actually has them and they’ll hide one by one in each future world you visit in the future, so, once you acquire all the shards and combine them back into the complete ruby, it’ll recover its original. The complete Devil’s Tear, when implanted into an actual demonic hybrid (or demon, if you’re one), grants them demonic divinity, essentially turning them into a demon god for as long as the ruby remain in their body with power on par with the one granted by the Apotheosis perk. If you lose the chance of finding a shard in a jump, the same one will reappear in the next one."
499,,400,The Unholy Grail ,Generic Angels and Demons,Source,"The demons’ blood is known for carrying a portion of their unholy power, having the capacity of corrupting and giving power to mortals that consume it or even turning them into demon-like abominations. There was also the case of the asura Raktabīja whose blood was so powerful that each drop of it gave birth to a new demon and, after it was consumed by Kali, it made her the most powerful deity of the Hindu pantheon. Even if your blood isn’t as powerful as his, you have full control over the power carried by it, allowing you to customize the effects it causes on those that consume it. These effects on them can be extremely varied and their potency depends on how much blood is consumed, from partially or fully demonizing them, turning them into demonic abominations, making them addicted to your unholy power, giving them access to some of your abilities or just being a deadly poison for them. It takes only a single grail-worth of your blood to turn a willing mortal into a Cambion for example. If you aren’t a fan of wounding yourself to remove your vital fluid, you also gain the ability to transfer your blood to others through your touch. Lastly, as a final benefit, anyone that attempts to usurp your power by drinking your blood will fail, with it having no effect on them or even automatically becoming harmful for them."
500,,400,Spiritual Devourer ,Generic Angels and Demons,Source,"From your demonic parent, you inherited the power to absorb souls of people near you and consume them, converting them into energy and vitality for you. This power is rather limited and you can only fully extract someone’s soul, which normally results in their death, if they’re currently defenseless, but you can drain portions of their souls that might cause permanent damage if you absorb too much of them and will also gradually weaken them. In addition to this, if you manage to fully absorb someone’ soul, you’ll be able to freely shapeshift into this someone’s form, granting you their physical abilities, like becoming capable of transforming into a large wolf if you manage to absorb a wolf's soul for example. You don’t need to worry about any unnatural instinct/altered mentality once morphed in another form or about being influenced in any way by the form’s original owner."
501,,400,Controlled Heritage,Generic Angels and Demons,Source,"The Nephilims of the old were the first generation descended from their Watchers, but other generations came later, the children of the original human/angel hybrids that also were giants, but their angelic abilities became more diluted compared to their progenitors with each subsequent generation. But, you aren’t one of the Nephilims of the old and this won’t happen with your offspring unless you want it to happen. In addition to your powers not becoming diluted to your descendents, you can also control which of your abilities your offspring inherit."
502,,400,Primordial Fragment,Generic Angels and Demons,Source,"You’re no common being, but, either by being created this way, having inherited it from someone or maybe even having usurped it by yourself, you’re now the fragment of a primordial force, having all the power that this entails, boosting your power to the point that, even if you were originally an average angel, you’ll become powerful enough to match with the angels of the Highest Order, like the Cherubim and the Ophanims.

The nature of this exact primordial force varies according to your origin.

If you’re an Angel or a Nephilim, you’ve become a fragment of the Lord in its entirety. This small piece of the Infinite Light within you has the capacity of greatly amplifying the power and efficiency of any and all light/divine abilities that you might have, as well as making any angelic being to instinctively trust you or even making them to want to worship you in some cases if they aren’t already serving to some other higher being due to them sensing the divine light in you.

If you’re a Demon or a Cambion, instead of the Infinite Light or of aether, you’ve been infused with the Darkness of the Abyss, a dark source of power whose existence predates Creation itself. Similarly to the fragment of the light, this shard of pure nether, the so-called chthonian element that is most known as the substance that makes up the Underworld, within your body also amplifies any and all dark/unholy abilities you might have and makes any demonic being to instinctively want to serve you due to the bottomless shadow they sense within you.

If you’re a Nephalem, instead of light or darkness, you’ve been born from the Primordial Sea of Chaos that existed before the universe, or at least was “baptized” in its waters, which caused you to inherit a fragment of its chaotic power. Differently to the other fragments, it not only greatly enhances the power of any chaos-related ability you have, but also enhances light and dark powers to a lesser degree, as well as serving as the bridge that one day should help you to fully stabilize your unstable self-contradictory nature.

If you’re Human, even if you aren’t a Primordial Human, you were born from the First Spark of Life that was created by divine hands, essentially binding you to a shard of the literal concept of life. The spark grants you bottomless vitality, allowing you to stay forever in your prime and regenerate from almost any form of damage as long as at least a single cell of your body manages to survive. Even if you don’t have any healing abilities, you can freely share your lifeforce by touching others.

As a last benefit, this perk also works as a Capstone Booster, with the primordial fragment in you enhancing the power of every 600 CP perk you have"
503,,400,Divine The Forbidden,Heroes of the Storm,Source,"Beneath the tumultuous currents of the Nexus lies dark forces many feel are best left undisturbed. But nobody ever got anything done by playing by the rules, and you’re nobody’s fool. You have a great gift for tampering with forbidden energies and binding them to your will, all your efforts guided as if by fate to be more successful at discovering and binding them to your will-and perhaps even reshaping them through your own mystical powers, or sheer force of will. Furthermore your resistance to their corruptive effects much greater than the Raven Lord’s-such that though it is still dangerous, you have a good chance of tapping into the powers of the Dark Nexus without being corruptive by them."
504,,400,Herald of Corruption/Purification,Heroes of the Storm,Source,"Fel. Arcane. The Light. The Void, and DEATH. Many are the forces that compete for dominance in Azeroth, and with this one has taken root in you-making you a great font of it. A warlock would have a whole coven’s worth of fel energy coursing through his veins as well as their collective innate capacity to regenerate it, whether from truly dire pacts made with demons in your past or even something as sordid as your very heart being replaced by some volatile artifact. By contrast you may also be a paladin (a de facto one if nothing else) with such deep attunement to the Light even a young man could turn the tide of battle with his blessings-though do note that the Light has its own more sinister side beneath the benevolent veneer it presents to humanity and the Draenei. While your skill in wielding these powers is equal to the likes of Uther or Kel’Thuzad, your true gift is a knack for corrupting others with your chosen force. From augmenting individuals with your channelled energy, to tainting the environment in its image-resistance seems all but futile when it comes to resist the transformative touch of your spells.

For some example of what Kel’Thuzad is capable of, his spell Death and Decay can launch an orb of dark energy that explodes upon contact with the enemy within a moderate distances which also leaves behind a decaying miasma. He can also conjure freezing chains that can ensnare multiple opponents, and create dark fissures in the ground that blast his foes with the power of death. By empowering him through the Nexus’ energies, he can use his phylactery to cheat death (and should you use this or a similar form of resurrection, it shall not count as chain death), briefly shroud himself in protective dark energy and worsen the supernatural cold he evokes.

Optionally, you may enjoy a free “reskin” representing the great power nestled in you. Want flaming eyes, hooves-or a delectably pallid complexion and an icy breath? Say no more. You may even be a Dreadlord, Naga or other being of similar scope long tainted by the forces vested in you."

To slay their own kin, and take in the other's soul, gaining their knowledge and memories and power. Barbaric and monstrous to mortals, yet an accepted fact amongst the dragons, and actively participated in. This method is especially potent for you, as you will see a noticeable increase in your capabilities for every dragon soul you absorb. Be it physical strength and durability, magical potency, of some other attribute of yours, each of the fallen will empower you to further heights."

While they might use different techniques to create them, they created their artificial beasts in order to create an existence that matched that ultimate weapon, so, in order to fulfill this goal, they gave the ability to evolve to their creations by devouring others and consuming their bodies’ nutrients. Apparently, you might be a result of their experiments or maybe your kind of Danger Beasts was their original inspiration, as you also possess grow stronger (and possibly bigger if you want to) by devouring living beings, with the power gained by consuming them being proportional to their strength and to how “nutritious” they were, with Danger Beasts and other modified beings being more “nutritious” than regular humans for example. Once you consume enough, you’ll evolve into new forms to adapt to your newfound power and there is no known limit for how powerful you may become if you keep devouring, however, the stronger you get, the more you’ll need to consume to keep evolving."

Unfortunately, while you might even be known as a member of the Empire’s royal family, due to the Prime Minister’s schemes, you were already taken out of the succession line, so you won’t need to worry about being his target but you won’t be a direct heir to the throne either. Post-jump, at the beginning of every jump, you may choose to be a part of one of the setting’s main royal families as a somewhat distant relative, gaining all the benefits this heritage grants you but usually staying a little far in the succession line by default. Of course, you need to choose a royal family that matches your current species, as you can’t be part of a dragons’ royal family if you’re a pure human but you can still be part of the elves’ royalty if you’re half human and half elf for example. As a last benefit, this perk also works as a Capstone Booster, with the royal blood running in your veins enhancing the power of every 600 CP perk you have."
508,,400,Cosmic Power,Marvel: Age of Krakoa,Source,"You wield the power of the cosmos, Jumper. Maybe you’re the host of the Starbrand? Or you had an encounter with The Black Vortex and it didn’t wear off like it’s supposed to? Or an alien super-soldier treatment imbued you with the power of the sun? Or maybe you’re just an unusually powerful Eternal? Regardless, the cosmic energy that saturates you is a very versatile power, able to do... Almost anything. At first, using it will be easiest in the form of energy blasts, flight, or protecting yourself in hostile environments but given enough time and practice there’s virtually no limit to what you can do with it... Now, note, you’re not... that powerful. A human with this power would start out on par with a typical Eternal in terms of the raw energy they have, though it can be made to increase slowly."
509,,400,Self-Sustenance,Marvel: Age of Krakoa,Source,"Eternals produce their own cosmic energy, making their powers self-sustaining, but you are on a whole other level. While your output doesn’t change, any and all internal reserves of energy you possess become truly infinite. In addition, regardless of your race or form, you do not need to eat, sleep, drink, or breathe and require only a fraction of the rest or cooldown time you would need otherwise, though you can still do all of the above if you so desire. Finally, your body does not produce metabolic waste of any kind."
510,,400,Summers Genome,Marvel: Age of Krakoa,Source,"Something about your genetic makeup makes your powers incredibly energy efficient, on the factor of millions of times more than they should be in some cases. Efficient enough to blatantly violate the laws of thermodynamics as we know them, letting you get a frankly absurd amount of use out of your abilities before you need to rest. Additionally, you passively draw in energy from some source to help fuel your powers. What exactly you draw on depends on your powers: Energy blast users might passively absorb ambient sunlight or cosmic rays while a psychic might unconsciously tap the limitless power of the astral plane to supplement their reserves of psionic energy. A Human or Mutant with this perk and history in this world may optionally be a member of the Summers-Grey family tree."
511,,400,Hellish Royalty,Hazbin Hotel,Source,"All Hail Jumper! You’re a real hot shot down here aren’t you? Well maybe if you’re willing to throw your weight around more than your new sister- yep that’s right you are a member of the Morningstar Family and a Royal of Hell... though the innate power to match your sister’s seems to be a bit... runty without a certain other perk.

Even still you are capable of incredible feats of Magic such as invoking the very fires of hell themself! Your power is sufficient to match lesser Overlords right off the bat and you will only grow greater with training- even in the pits of hell your star is bright indeed.

In future Jumps you may opt to insert yourself into other royal lines as a member. However you won't be getting any power from it."
512,,400,Sunsinger,The Destiny Universe,Source,"There is, perhaps, no ‘purer’ light than that of a star - the radiance of its fusion reactions illuminating an otherwise dark universe. You have learned the lessons of the stars, using your Light to internalize the same reactions that provide them with their practically endless energy. Your energy reserves are enormous, your rate of recovery so vast that you could go beyond simple conjuring of Light constructs and instead cast Super after Super, annihilating armies as casually as you would turn a page in a book. Finally, purchasing this perk gives you the Radiance Super - allowing you to burn even brighter, filling you with limitless paracausal energy for as long as you can sustain yourself, and allowing you to do anything you are capable of, in as great a quantity as you would wish, until your Radiance fades away. "
513,,400,Tithes,The Destiny Universe,Source,"Any sufficiently powerful Hive understands that at a certain point, the ravenous hunger of their Worm outpaces their ability to kill swiftly enough to satisfy it. As a result, as Hive grow in strength, they begin to create broods of their own, and each Hive in their brood tithes their kills to their master, satisfying their own, weaker worms, and in addition satisfying the worm of their master. It is through this system of tithes that such deific creatures like the Osmium Dynasty are able to consistently satisfy their worms despite their unimaginable power and unbelievably long lives. This perk automatically establishes that any who kill in your name shall tithe to your Worm, extending your life and increasing your power, even should they themselves not possess a worm. Furthermore, by purchasing this with CP, you achieve a purity of tithes not seen anywhere else in your species - tithes in your name are twice as effective as they would be to anyone else, and this effectiveness does not change or alter the hunger of your Worm, it will not grow used to this new, more effective sustenance and thus demand more than it would normally. Finally, following the completion of this jump, purchasing this perk ensures that anyone killed by you or in your name continues to tithe to you, but as you no longer require it for base survival, the amount of extended life and increased strength you acquire from your tithes skyrockets.

Requires Implanted Worm to Purchase"
514,,400,Special Dimension,Epic of Leviathan,Source,"Many special forms of energy are created within specific dimensions. These energies can be drawn on by the beings who possess a connection to them. This option allows you to choose one of these dimensions and to gain power from them. Some examples of these dimensions are the Dark Dimension inhabited by Dormamuu, the Darkforce Dimension, the Lightforce dimension, and the Brimstone dimension. Should there be any negative effects you will not be affected by them. For example the user of the Darkforce Dimension normally requires someone from the Lightforce Dimension to balance them out. This is seen with Cloak and Dagger. Lastly you may purchase this multiple times and create your own dimension if you wish. The only restriction is that the benefits can not greatly surpass the other dimensions mentioned.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
515,,400,King Piece,Epic of Leviathan,Source,The King Piece is a variant of the Evil Pieces created by Ajuka Beezlebub. These pieces were removed due to their potential threat as they provided a massive boost in power to the user. The pieces will increase the power of the user by ten to one hundred times over. This is enough for a High Class Devil to become an Ultimate Devil if not Satan Class. Since you are paying CP you will receive a piece capable of boosting your power one hundred times and it will be effective regardless of how strong you are.
516,,400,Blood of the Greats,Epic of Leviathan,Source,"Many of these worlds have notable families who possess great power and unique abilities. These abilities however are limited to those belonging to their bloodlines. Each time you purchase this you may choose one notable family or individual to gain a familial blood relationship with. This will grant you any unique powers they possess and make you a part of their family. For example in Harry Potter you can choose the Founders, Peverell, Merlin, or Dumbledore. In a world like DxD you could choose one of the Devil clans like the Gremory, Lucifer, or Leviathan. Lastly you may optionally decide if your connection is known to the setting. For example in DxD possessing Lucifer's bloodline would make you devil royalty, but a lot of people would also try to kill you because of this.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
517,,400,Vestige of the Divine,Kult: Divinity Lost,Source,"There is something about you that hints at the awakening of a greater power. Something indefinable aura of untameable greatness, which makes you mighty in the eyes of the monstrous things beyond reality’s veil. When you command a supernatural being you can speak in thunder and frightening certainty, forcing it to obey your orders-or soothing a shambling horror from devouring you or your allies. You harbour a mysterious inner power too, that lashes out at all who would harm you when you need it; no damage greater than an electric shock or a knife to the throat, but enough few mundane adversaries would press an attack without good reason.

The faintest hint of divinity touches all your attributes, mundane or supernatural- always tantalisingly hinting at some buried potential. If you are charming, you can exorcise spirits with great ease, tame supernatural beasts and make others forget what they’re doing to stare at you. If you’re a fighter, you can freeze others with your deadly stare or very briefly move and hit like a sonic boom when pushed to your limit in a fight. And even if you know no truth about the occult, you can perform functional rituals and any human participants will always at least slightly bolster your efforts. While such abilities are always supplemental and supportive to your existing ones, you’ll rapidly earn new mystical traits for whatever you turn your hand to  or are already capable of. As if your very being was urging you on to fulfil your destiny."
518,,400,Devouring,Fate/Faerie Britain,Source,"You have developed the same ability as Tam Lin Gawain of the Fang Clan. Once, when she was still known as Barghest, she dueled Lord Foul Weather, and consumed him to gain his powers in order to stop a Calamity. You too can replicate this feat, as whenever you kill and eat someone, you are able to steal any powers they may have possessed for yourself."
519,,400,Shardbearer ,Elden Ring - Altus Plateau,Source,"Within you is a greater piece of the Elden Ring itself, granting you incredible capabilities that allow you to stand on equal footing with the Demigods themselves. You will find that all of your physical attributes have been greatly enhanced, allowing one of human stock to face off against some of the mightiest beasts around barehanded and emerge victorious. Your magical potency is nothing to scoff at either, capable of casting far more spells and incantations than you ever could have before. Additionally, this will act as a [Capstone Booster], improving the benefits you would gain from certain perks."
520,,400,Ungodly Strength,South Park: The Fractured But Whole,Source,"You have had your DNA infused with that of Shub-Niggurath, the Black Goat of the Woods. As bad of an idea as that might sound, it actually ended up making your powers stronger than they normally would be. Optionally, you can choose to make this the origin of your powers, making them genetic, and thus, inheritable by any clones or children you may have."
521,,400,The Chosen of the Chosen,South Park: The Stick of Truth,Source,"You gain power from your suffering. The more debuffs you are under the stronger your attacks and abilities will become, though this has a soft cap of 400%."
522,,400,Dovahkiin,South Park: The Stick of Truth,Source,"Legends speak of one of untold power, one whose very existence can turn the tides of countless wars. They speak of the Dovahkiin, the Dragonborn! Dragon shouts? They have the power of something greater! The power to...make friends really easily on social media! Yes, and now that power is yours! You’ll find factions seeking you out offering great riches for you to champion their causes. Unknown to others though is the true power, the every friend you have you gain a tiny fraction of their power, a few dozen friends would be imperceptible, a few million and you would be equal to a certain wall crawling superhero."
523,,400,Legendary Hero ,Generic TCG Anime,Source,"You’re no run-of-the-mill Monster, OH NO. Going beyond being one-of-a-kind, you’re a creature on par with the Protagonist’s favorite monster(s). Where a warrior might be Olympic athlete strong, you’re Spider-Man strong; angels are archangels, fiend archfiends, fey archfey, animals archanimals...Wait, that doesn’t work...You get the idea! You’re a role model for other creatures of similar Archetypes to aspire to, whether they realize it or not."
524,,400,Boss Mob Skill Scrolls,Bofuri,Source,"Whenever you defeat a powerful and unique opponent in combat, you have the opportunity to gain skills based on what skills or abilities the opponent had. This is how Maple got her base kit that carried her through the first event, after all.

However, you won’t be able to get the full arsenal of your opponent from this. You’ll get only a few skills from an opponent - four at most. Defeating them again won’t give you new skills unless the opponent got a sudden boost in power and a few new skills or abilities of their own. (If you “defeat” an enemy by dealing enough damage to them that they decide to unleash a special transformation, unseal their power, or so on, it’ll probably count for giving you skills and/or for priming them to give you a second set of skills.)

Notably, this does provide the skills in the form of one-use skill scrolls like NWO skills, which means you can power up other people with them."
525,,400,Level Up!(Gold),Cradle V1,Source,"Normally you start with your core at the foundation, but you can choose to increase your core’s stage artificially. for 100 cp, you can start at the copper stage. This allows you to see the madra qualities of the world around you. For 200 cp you can start at the Iron stage, where your body is reforged by madra pushing out the impurities of the soul. For 400cp you start at Jade. For 800 You start at Gold, truly beginning the path to power. 

Requires Level Up!(Jade) to Purchase"
526,,400,Call My Name,Marvel Zombies,Source,"Making pacts with magical beings in order to borrow their powers is great. Where would Doc Strange be without the Crimson Bands of Cytorrak or the Hoary Hosts of Hoggoth? You’ll find that such powers and principalities might be a little… lenient when you’re dealing with them. They’ll be more willing to lend out their power when it comes to you. When invoking their names, they’ll be a little more forgiving if they’re the sort that takes debt into account. Contracts that you make wouldn’t ordinarily follow you to future jumps, but now they will.

Lastly, there’s a very powerful somebody out there who’s starting to get tired of his current servant. Normally he’d go for Jennifer Kale, but you’re a better opportunity. The Dread Dormammu. If everything goes south, you can always invoke his name. You’ll have almost-unlimited power. More than enough to blow almost anything around you out of the water. Unparalleled mystic mojo. The downside is that you’re pretty much a thrall of his. But still, if you want power, you can call Dormammu. He’ll make you his slave, but he’ll also make you this awesome superwizard that’s on fire."
527,,400,Giantborn,Percy Jackson and the Olympians,Source,"Ah yes, the giants. The children of Gaea, great towering creatures with domains and powers similar to and even predating the gods themselves. While they, like the Titans, are not known to sire mortal children it seems that once again you have proven the exception. Those of this parenthood must take Wrath of Olympus just as the Titans must, due to the inherent animosity towards giant progeny."
528,,400,Titanborn,Percy Jackson and the Olympians,Source,"So you wish to be born of the Titans, hmm? While your kind is rare, it is not a thing unheard of. However, this is not a world that is kind to you, friend. The general consensus of those not firmly on the side of monsterkind is that those of the Titan’s ilk are evil, up to an including your progeny. In exchange for taking this parentage, you must take Wrath of Olympus to reflect your status as an outcast in this world."
529,,400,Devil Parts,Chainsaw Man,Source,"A regenerating (once monthly) supply of devil flesh chunks with an amount that depends on the power of the devil you choose. Primal-tiers will have only a tennis ball worth and the bottom tiers will give enough to fill a room. You can choose which devil’s parts are generated each year. Consuming the flesh will empower you and your abilities in a way related to the concept the devil represents, with abilities that were already related to said concept getting the greatest buff."
530,,400,Mystical Leech,Fate/Stay Night,Source,"For most people, the only way to recover used up magic is to just rest and let it replenish naturally. Some take magic from others, willingly or not, and others use much more sinister methods. You've got a way seen only once before. Just the act of eating normal food is enough to replenish your magical energies. A quick stop at a fast food drive in might only give you enough for a fireball or two but a full five course meal will bring you all the way to fullness. But what if you were to eat something with magic innate to it? Such as say, a living person with magic circuits? Or perhaps a powerful magical artefact? Having this sort of meal will not only fill you up much more than the equivalent normal meal, but you'll find that your maximum energy capacity actually increased permanently. Just chowing down on any old wizard might not give you too much on their own but the stronger the magic user or magical item, the greater the boost you'll find yourself getting. Of course, you could always just gorge yourself on the snacks. People tend to notice that sort of thing though. "
531,,400,Rune dropping,Solo Leveling,Source,"Runes are normally dropped by slaying powerful monsters, and when they are broken by a Hunter, they will gain a single skill from the enemy who had dropped them. This rare event only happens from the act of killing of Magical Beasts, but yours seem to be a special case, getting these runes from basically any enemy that you slay. Although just like when it comes to slaying Magical Beasts, this dropping is not guaranteed in all cases.

The chances of getting one of these runes are higher the stronger the enemy slayed is, with monsters above A-Rank being almost guaranteed to drop one of these. You will only get one rune from each monster, and the ability that you will get from them will be random, but again, the stronger the prey, the higher chances you get a more unique ability. Alternatively, if you don’t want to use them yourself, you can give these runes to anyone with magical aptitude. In this world, Runes are some of the most valued items, their prices being astronomical and only a few Hunters being able to afford them. However, just getting one these can massively increase the performance capabilities of a Hunter."
532,,400,Beast of Ages,Fate/Grand Order,Source,"There is a rule in this world that older things are held superior to newer things. The Mystery that builds up in older things allows them more power but not everything follows that rule. Indeed, certain beings work in an entirely opposite fashion. The Beasts grow stronger the more mankind has advanced their civilisation, much as you yourself now do. The more advanced the civilisation of your home world, the more powerful you become due to it. A renaissance era world would not give you much noticeable increase at all whilst a world based on the modern day could see as much as a third again increase in your overall power. The more advanced your home world’s civilisation becomes, even as a result of you helping them grow, the stronger you’ll become in return."
533,,400,Prayers of Livestock,Kurohime,Source,"To the gods, that’s all humans really are. Livestock. A source of energy and power. Are you, too, like the gods of this universe? You can draw upon the prayers and faith that is directed at you, consuming them and using this energy to fuel your abilities."
534,,400,Wellspring of Power,Final Fantasy VII,Source,"As sure as the Mako Reactors bleed the Planet's life force to fuel luxuries and utilities, humans lack the connection to nature and magic they once had in the distant past, often reliant on Materia to use even a fragment of those mythical days. Even so, a talent for using such abilities still exists in some, perhaps some close relative to the Cetra of old. You're one of those people, having not only any magic you use through Materia or otherwise being much stronger than the average person, but you have easily twice the mental stamina and energy needed to use it extensively. This grows along with your own strength and experience, eventually turning you into a terrifying spellcaster...assuming you know how, anyways."
535,,400,Law of the Strong,Legends of Runeterra,Source,"All powers matter in Noxus. Political power, economical power, military power, everything goes. Now, how much power you possess in an area affects how much power you possess in every other area. Being king will grant you increased magical and physical power if you didn’t possess them already, for example. Being stupidly rich will have the same effect. The effect is not precisely 1:1 and doesn’t take in consideration the extra power granted by itself, but it will still let you quickly increase your power."
536,,400,Celestial,Legends of Runeterra,Source,"Congratulations, you’re one of the most powerful creatures in all Runeterra. Either an incarnation of some concept like a Targonian Aspect, a simple spirit from the stars, or a living celestial phenomenon, you’re more cosmic energy given form and intelligence than a normal creature. You’re immortal, your body is pure energy and so not constrained by the limitation of flesh, your physical power is improved immensely (if you even bother to have a body), and can command cosmic powers that can reshape all Runeterra, similar, but more powerful than a normal Ascended. You can take any one Keyword for free."
537,,400,Avenging Sword of Eternal Darkness,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Source,"Only the edgiest may apply for this special Class. A nasty Class that only the meanest Sabers would be summoned into. These Sabers are able to slowly replenish their own magical energy over the course of a day, since they tend to be friendless loners that no one wants to help. They get stronger, tough and much harder to deal with when they dislike someone, their powers increasing to match the level of their hatred and rage. The temper tantrums of a powerful Avenger can be truly frightening experiences. Worst of all, they never forget anything. Magically, their minds are warded against any attempt to alter their memories or remove them. Some might use this trait to learn whole libraries worth of information but these edgy ladies only use it to remember their many, many grudges. They can even use it to retain a level of hate against a target, ensuring they never let go of their anger and loose the powerful benefits it gives them against a target. 

What are these Sabers like? It’s really just more of the above. Most of them tend to be anti-social, angry and overly edgy. If you get past that prickly exterior, they’re usually exactly the sort of weirdo you expect from someone who dresses in all black and talks about how they’ll forever curse the cashier that gave them a small coffee when they ordered a large."
538,,400,Dragonborn,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Source,"Part Human, part Dragon, all Saber. Through some quirk of your birth, a magical ritual by Merlin himself or being the actual child of a cosmic dragon, you inherit several traits of the purest Dragonkind. The most important is the magical energy conversion furnace inside you, a Magic Core that produces vast amounts of magical energy simply by the act of breathing. Where others might take days to replenish a fully depleted supply, you take only a few minutes. You’re far more capable of using all this energy as well, channeling it with greater ease and much less strain than someone that relied on magical circuits, and able to rely entirely on your internal energy in case of external magic being absent. Your actual supply itself is vast, outmatching all but the strongest of Servants that are still limited to a terrestrial scale. 

At times, these Sabers do display draconic traits. They find things relating to dragons to be easier to learn and that their powers can naturally take on wyrm-like forms, energy blasts forming into jagged dragon heads to bite foes and such. The reverse is that they become somewhat more vulnerable to anti-dragon attribute attacks, since they are themselves part dragon."
539,,400,Herrscher Gene Infusion,Honkai Impact 3rd,Source,"You were infused with the genes of a Herrscher. This means that you have the potential to evolve into a Herrscher if exposed to sufficient amounts of Honkai energy and negative emotions. You also function as a highly-developed source of Honkai energy, as you generate a near-limitless amount of it every second, and instantly refill your reserves whenever you use it. However, you do not have the physical benefits of being a Herrscher."
540,,400,Magic Blooded,Final Fantasy VI,Source,"While the first Magi learned magic the hard way, a millennia of steeping in it has given their descendents a more natural talent for the art. As one of their kin, however distantly, you share in the arcane flowing through your veins. Choose one (1) Magic Focus. You easily and naturally learn spells from this world encompassed by your Magic Focus. Additionally, you can learn spells from outside of it given time and practice. This innate talent also comes in handy when it comes to learning spells not of this world, aiding your understanding and allowing you to grasp them easier."
541,,400,Magicite Infusion ,Final Fantasy VI,Source,"Magic flows through the veins of the Magitek Knight. Literally. The process of creating a Magitek Knight distills magic drained from Espers and injects it directly into the individual. You, unlike so many others, have survived the harrowing, pain-filled experience and come out the other side something new. One of only three so far in the world. Choose two magic Focuses. You will naturally learn spells covered by your Focuses, though not those outside of them unless assisted by Magicite. However, your spells will be more powerful as a result of your tight focus."
542,,400,On Borrowed Wings,Witch on the Holy Night,Source,"What look like golden leaves bent in the shape of wings sprouting just behind your back are something far more menacing: Magic Crests taken from mages who once challenged you and failed. The magical energy they provide you exceeds that of the typical family heir twice over, however due to being foreign from you they’re not as efficient when it comes to actually casting their spells than a Magic Crest fully bonded to your body. Furthermore, while they don’t strain you to use unlike a bonded Magic Crest, if defending from powerful attacks they can be forced into a state of temporary shutdown. Alternatively you may have a more efficient but also less personally beneficial solution: An automaton of some kind, full of artificially replicated magic crests with roughly the same amount of magical energy.

If you do take the default option though, don’t worry about the defeated mages. They spend all their time partying and generally enjoying themselves in a little café/carnival/astonishingly pleasant facility that seems to have a means of replenishing itself. All things considered they’re surprisingly upbeat about life despite having their life’s work literally ripped out of them. If you like, a garish door in your Warehouse can take you to the ex-mages who’re inclined to treat you as an old friend. They may no longer be able to use magecraft, but they can probably still be consulted on their methods if you can get them to focus for more than a minute at a time."
543,,400,Legacy of the Magi ,Witch on the Holy Night,Source,"Engraved somewhere on your body is the greatest treasure of a magus family-one equal in value to that of the Aozaki family’s: A Magic Crest. A collection of magic circuits extracted by a magus over the years and amassed into a collection of biomass that contains both substantial magical energy, knowledge and spells that have been made stable and easy to activate by the Crest’s complex structure. Not only does all this power considerably augment your normal magecraft, but it also grants you a powerful form of regeneration as part of the Crest’s purpose is to keep it’s host alive so the knowledge can survive to future regenerations. Even if your spine was broken, as long as your body remains alive the crests will piece it back together and as long as your body is still physically there more extensive mutilation can be treated with the help of heavy surgery. Your very body is now, in a small way, a vessel preserving Mystery."
544,,400,"Shine On, Crazy Devil",HighSchool DxD,Source,"The original Evil Pieces were a set of 16, but the King Piece designed by Ajuka was too powerful and the danger of it falling on the wrong hands was too great. Unlike the other pieces which grant special abilities, the King Piece simply boosts a person's power. However, the King piece's strengthening is anywhere from 10 to 100 times or even more. The only restriction is that it can’t be used by anyone that already has another Evil Piece inside, meaning no Reincarnated Devils and such. A simple, but effective boost in power."
545,,400,Hand Of The Devil,HighSchool DxD,Source,"Your mana reserves and regeneration are a thing out of this world, and quite capable of matching with any Satan or God out there, if not straight up surpassing them, which would be outrageous enough, if it weren’t because of your talent an synchronicity with your inherent powers, an overwhelming mastery over it that would turn even the strongest beings in this world a bit curious of who you truly are. This isn’t merely a bit of extra power and proficiency with your powers, but the push to reach an ultimate class."
546,,400,Galvanism,Fate/Apocrypha,Source,"Frankenstein was truly a genius. Not only did he create life (as horrified as he was with the end result), but he designed what is almost a perpetual motion machine into it. And however it is that it happened, you’ve obtained the Galvanism that serves as the most powerful weapon of Frankenstein’s monster. The most basic function, active at all times, is the recycling of magical energy in the air, drawing any excess energy used back into you to be reused. Even the waste from your enemies can be recycled. It can also let you convert electricity into magical energy, should that be relevant to you. This ability can also function similarly to a mana burst, using incredible amounts of energy for brief but immense boosts to your physical might and speed, potentially letting you match even Servants in combat, and then of course drawing in all the magical energy thrown into the environment to do it all over again. It’s the ultimate defense against attrition, essentially. Also, a strange and possibly unintended function is that it allows you to resist transformations and changes in your body, such as perhaps being turned into a dragon. It’s barely enough to stop your body from taking the plunge, so to speak, so you’ll still show signs that something weird is going on with your form, but at the very least you can force yourself to remain humanoid. And finally, of course, is the suicide attack Blasted Tree, using all the magical energy you possess to blow yourself up alongside the enemy. Hopefully you’ll never have to use it."
547,,400,Steady PE-Box Supply,Lobotomy Corporation,Source,"A cargo box full of PE-Boxes will frequently be delivered to your warehouse. The energy is generic and can't be refined into E.G.O, but a single box can power a small city for a day. If destroyed, the energy is harmlessly released. You or another abnormality may personally refill the boxes by simply being in their presence. Attempting to disassemble or smelt the boxes will get you nothing."
548,,400,Darkness Abounds,Hades,Source,"Nyx, daughter of Chaos and Goddess of theNight, has aligned herself with Hades due to the link between the Underworld and Chaos itself. It is a realm that was among the first to be created by the hand that spawned all things.Nyx’s presence, combined with the raging anger and constant clashing of so many dead, sometimes causes fragments of the primordial nothingness to crystallize. These small purple gems are capable of enhancing Chthonic beings or those with a strong connection to the Underworld. Individually they offer an unnoticeable enhancement. But gather hundreds, or thousands, and one will discover themselves growing more powerful. These fragments of darkness are common enough in the Underworld but you will also be able to discover them in future worlds where strife and death are common occurrences."
549,,400,Blessings of the Gods ,Hades,Source,"The steady favor of deities is a truly rare gift, given their capricious natures.However, one thing remains true of all divine beings. They always favor a hero on an epic quest. While you might not always play the hero, their aid will shine down upon you as if you were. Deities, both in this world and in future ones, will offer you their blessings and aid on a regular basis so long as you are in pursuit of a quest on the scale of Hercules, Achilles, or other fabled Greek heroes. Theymay even offer you a choice of boons depending on the local pantheon’s tendencies. Should you find yourself in a world that is lacking in divine beings, you will find those you have met before stepping in from afar."
550,,400,Magic Crest,Fate/Strange Fake,Source,"The crystallization of the efforts of generations of magi of the same family. Passed down from the parent to their inheritor child, this is a potent tool for any magus. Magic Crests are a construct forged with the addition of generations of magic circuits from previous inheritors. For those who search the Origin, their Magic Crest is the equivalent of the dreams and hopes of their families, and losing it would be as much as being dead in life. For those who have lost such aspirations, a Magic Crest still represents an incredibly potent tool.

A Magic Crest incorporates the magic circuits of previous generations of the same lineage, effectively adding extra Magic Circuits to a magus’ own inborn ones. This allows the inheritor of the Magic Crest to cast more powerful spells, since they can utilize more magical energy at the same time. But that’s not the limit of the Magic Crest, nor its main function. No, the Magic Circuits inside of the Crest are engraved with all, or almost all, the magical knowledge that the magus accumulated during their lifetime. In other words, a Magic Crest is a spell repository that allows its inheritor to cast the refined spells from previous generations, allowing them to draw power from lifetimes of study without having to have that precise knowledge themselves.

Finally, Magic Crests also have one vital function: as they are meant to be passed down, they also work to ensure the survival of the magus until such a moment comes. In case of lethal damage that doesn’t involve the destruction of the brain or the heart, or catastrophic enough that repair is already in the domain of a miracle or magic, the crest is able to slowly heal the user back to life once more.

You start with a magic crest of a fairly well established lineage. Perhaps it has a few centuries inside of it, and it can effectively add an extra third of magic circuits to you. That’s for 200 CP, but if you choose to pay for 400 CP, your magic crest will be fairly ancient, equivalent to that of the more ancient Lords of the Clock Tower. The power of this mystic code alone is not to be underestimated, and the spells inside of it may allow one to fight even with weaker Servants in the right conditions, also effectively adding around the same amount of magic circuits that you already had in this jump via the ‘Magic Circuits’ perk.

Magic Crest are only used by those magi who follow the traditions of the Mage’s Association. If you want to be involved with another tradition due to your previous purchase, you may obtain an equivalent Philosophy Key or Mystic Code fused to your body that grants similar benefits. 

As a final benefit, you may choose to pass your Magic Crest once per Jump to someone compatible, and you will see it regenerate slowly after ten years, or the next jump, whichever comes sooner. You will be able to engrave a part of your magic circuits, and inscribe as many magecraft spells as you know in it."

It seems that the reserves of magical energy that you can draw forth defy any logic, being hundreds of times above that of other members of your species. And not only that, your regeneration is also quite exceptional. As in just some hours, a day at worst if you are depleted, you are able to refill what you had spent.

Even as a human, your magical reserves are something that should not be possible. With your power, you could keep two Servants of great power actively using Noble Phantasms of the A Rank without a care in the world, before you even begin to feel some of the strain."

I see the problem now, just have to kick some poor fool in there to give it the right oomph! You seem to have a deep appreciation for the ancient Aztec tradition of human sacrifice! This appreciation even goes so far as to affect any supernatural powers you have, allowing you to enhance them with the power of blood. Though, the more powerful the ability the more blood you’ll need in order to see any meaningful enhancement. Please try not to go overboard Jumper, not everyone is as... enamored with blood as you are."
556,,400,Holier Than Thou,Godbound,Source,"There are some among the mighty who wield power and influence their lesser simply cannot match, whether from being ordained with a superior role or suckling from a particularly ripe source of divine power. The purity and purpose of what you have achieved through transhuman training or your ordained role has reached the level of a concept Word embodying the superlative example of whatever you are. You yet retain the potential to achieve the power of a concept Word for any form you have through similar sorcerous experimentation or training to how you originally achieved your state here.

Naturally the mighty benefit more from this than the weak; if you were a parasite god, you would have metastasized into a monster capable of enslaving an entire nation or even realm with three other Words to your name, though one remains your focus-and undaunted by pantheons of Godbound who haven’t done significant preparation before mounting an assault on you. If you were a Made God, not only are you fully repaired and refurbished but you likely have an arsenal of augmentations comparable to the greatest godwalker components and have two more Words under your command. And if you were an angel, you would be one of the great angelic tyrants who once stood guard over a major concept of reality-and now likely command an entire circle of Hell. Angels in particular gain the power of a Godbound’s command over four other Words of Creation in addition to their baseline one, to fulfil the complexity of their purpose. As for Unbound and Eldritches, suffice to say that that entire nations would dread provoking their wrath if they knew of them.

To take the example of a lesser being such as a human, you would be sharply limited by the normal traits of a human being; lesser gifts would include superlative luck and uncanny influence with humans wherever you go, while greater attacks could include the power to make your attacks count as a magical weapon or an indomitable will towards mental powers. However, you would nevertheless be able to develop new Gifts and improvise miracles themed within human perfection like any Godbound-including the universal divine powers of smiting your enemies with shows of human strength.

This perk may be repurchased for additional Concept Words. Concept words purchased from this source are associated with higher beings, comprehensive improvement of one’s base state and most fundamental workings of the Celestial Engines-or the direst forces of Uncreated Night. Inheritors of a Broken Heaven do not gain additional Words of Creation from subsequent purchases, but frankly even purchasing one of these makes you a force to be reckoned with. Each is as qualitatively superior to other Concept Words as the Words Engineering, Artifice, Sorcery and Fate are to other Words of Creation.

557,,400,Word of the Few,Godbound,Source,"It is a shame that the Godbound are singular in being the breakers and forgers of this world’s order, but it need not be so. In a fit of enlightenment, memorising the moment when the Made Gods’ shards engraved themselves on your very soul, you learned a unique trait: The power to shatter artifacts of all kinds and direct their mystic energies to grant their powers to those loyal to your cause. You must still be capable of actually sundering such a magical artifact, not all artifacts may grant powers commensurate with those of the Godbound and it should go without saying that there is usually a finite amount of mystic power to bestow on others. But on a scale that can cover entire civilisations so long as your faith is present and prevalent throughout them, you can administer the distribution of the unleashed enchantments with the same ease other Godbound can hear and respond to prayers."
558,,400,The Brush of Death ,Godbound,Source,"Ever since the fall of Heaven and the corruption of Hell, the terror of an agonizing afterlife has filled countless humans with panic. While true faiths can anchor a soul to its native realm in peaceful sleep, those who die alone and far from solace may cling to this world for fear of what is to come. In a more proactive approach, with the assistance of an enterprising, innovative sorcerer you’ve somehow given yourself the traits of an undead being while still technically being alive.

For 100 CP you have the traits of a common husk. You feel no pain, you do not rot while you remain intact and you need not breathe, drink, eat or sleep. Organ damage doesn’t slow you down, but you lack your body’s natural healing ability and crushing your skull, breaking your spine or removing one or more major limbs generally takes you out of the fight. For 400 CP you instead have the traits of one of the greater undead. Whether your soul was kindled with mystical power to bring out your potential as a great warrior or the rites of your living undeath were far more elaborate you boast might, swiftness and resilience beyond the human norm.

Undead sometimes have unique powers, of which you retain a human’s level of intelligence and cunning for free. The common husks seldom have more than one or two minor abilities-such as the ability to appear as a normal living person to anything short of a Sun miracle of true sight, to a frenzied might, to simple physical enlargement or hardening by your occult sustenance. Great undead can just about challenge a pantheon of Godbound despite their relative fragility, boasting at least a half-dozen lesser Gifts reflecting their living talents and being bound to a Word of their choice. Alternatively or concurrently, they may lose some living talents to gain more powerful talents of the undead such as the power to inhabit any intact husk nearby and remanifest it’s body, instantly killing those already on the brink of death in combat, filling lesser foes with the delirious hunger of the undead or simply power equal to being Wordbound to Death."
559,,400,Strength Within,Wizarding World,Source,"Magic is affected by one’s emotions. Gleaned from centuries of studies and experience, this fact is plainly obvious. One’s magic is weakest when they have fallen under the veil of despair. And in the harshest of cases, one’s magic could even be lost to them, the crushing pressure of sadness and dismay leaving them as little more than shadows of their former selves.

And contrasting this, in times of severe distress, where one’s emotions are running high, that is when you will find your magic to be at its most powerful. Spells cast in such a state will often demonstrate a level of power beyond what their wielder can ordinarily cast. Many spells are even designed to be more reactive to such emotions such as the Patronus Charm for example.

But for you, instead of relying simply on emotions, you have learned to tap into the wellspring of determination within yourself, a form of power that you never knew you had. Even as a child, you will find yourself capable of pushing through events that would break even the most hardened of souls and come out the other side hurt but healing. With this, your spells are twofold stronger and abilities that rely on your emotions are even greater still. With this, you are no mere student. With this, you can be a legend."

Though even with the risks entailed, many sorcerers consider it worth it as this often allows for greater magic than they could cast under their own power. You are particularly talented at this type of magic, finding natural ease in gaining the favor of a magical being and establishing a channel for their power. Furthermore you will also find it simple to call upon the powers of similar beings in future jumps as well and even to continue calling upon them after you leave their native jump, so long as you left in good standing. Most beings will be amenable to you invoking them for power, though their curiosity will often be roused and they may feel you owe them a debt and if they have some reason to dislike or oppose you, they can easily refuse your pleas for power."

You'll be able to sense things related to it and command it to some degree. A god of storms could feel a front in their bones and call a bolt of lightning with a shout where a god of magic could weave magic as easily as a mortal breathes, foregoing most spells entirely. As you grow in age and power, so too will your connection with and command over your domain increase. Some are also immune or resistant to their domain; a god of fire is hard to burn, for example, but a god of war would only be somewhat more resistant than normal to strikes from a sword. This also applies to power over domains, being less the more broad it is; a god of magic would not be impossibly far beyond their kin, for instance, though they would find magic easy to learn and manipulate.

At will, you can reallocate your energy and pool it into a single being, whose abilities will then be boosted beyond their normal limits at the cost of momentarily shutting down your regeneration. Other than regeneration, you can utilize your cosmic energy in a unique way, same as the different Eternals. You are free to design your own ability or copy one of the abilities of the Eternals.

After slaying a foe, as long as their body is mostly intact you have some method-perhaps using siphoning tendrils like Kro, perhaps leeching arcs of electricity-of absorbing the most significant powers and memories from those you kill. As these powers accumulate, not only does your body evolve the efficiency of them rapidly over time to be optimised for battle and survival-but you find yourself developing auxiliary powers like agility or regeneration to supplement the ones you already have. Even your own form may adapt to your ideal of perfection, gaining shapeshifting abilities or taking on a more rarefied state suiting your self-image.

You could even, like Echo, be the latest in a long line of matriarchal Native American shaman warriors endowed with the support of your ancestors as well as great empath powers. At most, this can grant something like a shadow of the Mighty Thor’s power as Jane Foster was-but if you choose esoterica and mysticism over pure might, this can potentially also offer stranger abilities (like altering the night sky or sealing another deity into a living vessel) and divine communion like that which Moon Knight enjoys rather than merely the power of an absent one.

It turns out that you died and Eternity resurrected you. Or you could’ve been infused with his essence. The cosmic energy within your body grants you great power, which stems from an impossibly miniscule fragment of Eternity’s being. This grants you physical abilities, lifespan, and healing factor on par with a strong Asgardian. In addition to these gifts, you can fly at hypersonic speeds and shoot beams of cosmic energy from your eyes. This, like other abilities, grows with practice, but it can also develop through other means. As I said, Eternity is the embodiment of the universe. As you travel to different jumps, dimensions, or universes, you will passively absorb some parts of that universe as well, bolstering your powers and unlocking new capabilities.

This iteration gives you a 0.01% increase in power in exchange for not being able to have slaves capable of walking.

583,,400,Power Induction,Avengers-Thunderbolts,Source,"Like Armin Zola you know how to activate the latent potential for super powers in others. This process is not easy: it takes time and resources; it will only work on a small minority of people and even then will be lethal fairly often; and it will be very hard to control the precise powers that they develop. Still, with time and resources you could create an army of super powered beings, by tapping into this latent potential. They will be very unlikely to rival the likes of Thor or the Hulk, but with time you could create quite a variety and number of super beings.

Specialized knowledge of specific aspects of comic book science or magic can be incorporated into the process to help improve the results, granting better control over the powers granted, greater powers, and/or making the process more likely to succeed. Loki empowered the Wrecking Crew through such means, and the original Baron Zemo created Wonder Man this way.

Of course, it’s theoretically possible to do this in the Marvel universe without this perk. While this will give you the knowledge of genetics to screen for it, and get an idea of what sort of comic book energy or radiation might be needed to induce powers, the bigger advantage is that it will allow you to continue to grant powers in these ways in future worlds where space gods have not altered the human genome to introduce the potential to develop super powers."

The main function of the device is to create a perfect Magician-Esper hybrid that can freely use Magic and Esper ability without having their blood vessels bursting or feel any side-effects at all.

The average time is for an individual to take 10 to 15 years to complete their transformation, with some taking even more. Yet this amount of time is of extreme importance for the Seija, for the lesser amount of time spent equals a higher potential in the power of the bloodlines of the Sieja. Your maturation process was instant, a feat only replicated by another Seija in recent history. This translates to you having a greater talent and potency in the powers of the Seija, a greater magical capabilities and physical strength. Although your full potential remains untapped for now, you would still rank among the top 4 dragons in your bloodline. Perhaps more training or some powerful motivator would allow you to unlock your full power and achieve your destiny as the greatest on your bloodline.

If you are not a Seija, your potential in case of being transformed into one remains the same as
described, instead applying to whatever race you find yourself as. And this great potential would extend when it comes to other race transformation processes, allowing you to become one of the highest examples of whatever race you end up becoming with a great potential in their innate abilities, as well as skipping any duration that this transformation process may have had, reaching maturity instantly."
589,,400,Half-Dragon,Ragna Crimson,Source,"While the dragons are the enemies of mankind, it’s not unheard of for humans to be born with some dragon traits. This is usually a cause of rejection by most humans, but in the Silver Corps they can appreciate the potential that someone like you who has been born with some dragon traits, such as your eye or some limb being close to that of a dragon’s.

First, this means that you have an abnormally high magical potential, putting you close to a low-grade Seija at least in that department. Second, you can heal your wounds by consuming the flesh of dragons, temporally gaining a regeneration factor similar to theirs. In future jumps, you may designate a similar supernatural-race to have a few basic traits, allowing you to similarly regenerate through consuming their flesh and getting some of their supernatural potential."

He did this in the vain hope that it could help prevent her from ever having to fall to the fate of those with Dragon Souls. This turquoise stone has the rather impressive property of being able to store a theoretically endless amount of mana, and can release it again as needed. The High Walker had hoped that by continuously pouring the excess mana into the stone, Emily would manage what he didn’t and avoid turning into a wild dragon. If the stone is broken all the mana within will be released, and potentially absorbed, at once."

Just by living your body can automatically take in any available energy around it to restore itself. The rate of recovery is only limited to how much is available to you. Just holding some form of mana or ki crystal would allow you to near-instantly drain it of power. In an area rich in energy, it will be like you can never run out. Battles of attrition are often meaningless against you. However since you no longer need to consciously think about it, it would be easy for you to not notice if you end up somewhere with little energy available, leading you to wasting energy when you need it most."

Unremarkable on its own, this tome will tear out the souls of the wielder's victims, granting more and more magical might, until the wielder reaches 25 souls- At which point, Mejai's Soulstealer becomes the most potent magical artifact on Runeterra, lending such potency to the wielder's magic that they can obliterate whole squadrons of lesser men with a single spell. Still, this comes with a price, and should the bearer of this book ever suffer defeat, Mejai's Soulstealer will lose its grip on the souls that give it power and revert back into a normal book until the wielder can restore their glory."
593,,400,Mystic Ways,Arcane,Source,"Magic is a mysterious but powerful force which has shaped Runeterra in countless ways. Perhaps you were born with the talent, perhaps you suffered a curse you were able to turn to your own ends, or perhaps you found some magical artefact, but however you came by it you’re now capable of a specific, limited style of magic. Perhaps you’re a stoneweaver like Taliyah, you’ve bonded with a Darkin weapon, you’ve learned to channel the powers of the sun like the Solari, you’ve studied the mystic ways of the Kinkou, you stole an arcane artefact from a Shuriman tomb, or you were afflicted with the curse of the Shadow Isles and learned to control it.

Whatever form your magic takes, it has a specific theme, and to begin with is limited mostly to the personal scale. If you practise with it, though, you’re sure to be able to increase its power over time, and one day you’ll be able to accomplish truly incredible feats."

You may devour the heart of a divine creature in order to gain a chance of getting a new “Divine Title”, “Transformed in Body”, “Transformed in Soul”, or “Godhand” option.

It is even possible for you to develop new, perverse spells based on whatever force infuses you; though Mohg’s invention of blood magic was likely expedited by both his divinity and the pact he struck with the Formless Mother, roll around in the Scarlet Rot enough and instead of festering in ruin you could create spells or incantations capable of channelling it’s power. Or channel it into your body instead, controlling how much you deign the corruption to manifest upon it or granting yourself useful mutations such as wings and claws infused with its power. No doubt with greater power of your own and/or a superb partner like his you too could one day create a full school of magic to call your own. Most disturbingly of all, carnal gratification bolsters your might and spellcraft.

599,,400,Paid In Blood And Agony ,MtG - Shandalar,Source,"Many of the most powerful Black magics carry a price beyond mere mana. Contracts with demonic entities or drawing upon the power of undeath can often cost a mage a portion of their life force, and even the mana-fuelled echoes of such acts carry similar prices. Likewise, a Lord Of The Pit will not stay loyal for long if not fed... and if you can’t sacrifice other creatures under your command, it’s quite happy to take a Wurm-sized bite out of you. But though everything has a price, that doesn’t mean you have to pay the toll in such a way. Though you cannot simply ignore such debts, you have the unique ability to pay costs with anything else of equivalent ‘value’. Where before you might have been forced to bleed yourself dry for an edge in battle, now you could instead sacrifice a portion of your knowledge, another creature’s life, or perhaps even pay the toll through a vast expenditure of mana instead. The ‘price’ will be based on what your debtor considers valuable or not, but they will not try to cheat you out of more than they are due."

This art has shifted over the years, rules being added or removed, techniques being forgotten and invented until the modern age's interpretation of the art barely resembles the original. That said, you are seemingly a follower of it and as such may reap its rewards. You have learned a meditative technique that allows you to access a nebulous well of power, fed into by everyone who stands upon the same battlefield. This well of power can only be accessed by one person at a time, but the benefits it holds are immense. Mighty spells can be cast with the snap of a finger, your strength can be multiplied several times over, or magics that aid your allies and interfere with your foes can be cast - and all of this effectively for free. As mentioned however, only one person may use this at a time. If you intend to attack with all this might, you will need to attack alone."
601,,400,Halfway Fallen ,Magi: The Adventure of Sinbad,Source,"Normally, it is only white Rukh that reside within people. However, when someone curses their fate and attempts to defy destiny, they ‘fall into depravity’, dyeing their soul and Rukh black. You, however, are an almost unprecedented case, as not only is your Rukh a mixture of both black and white, but both halves seem to co-exist inside of you without annihilating each other like they normally should. As such, you are able to use both to power your abilities. While white Rukh occurs naturally in this world, black Rukh is rare and is produced by negative emotions such as hatred or despair. Unlike with white Rukh, though, people can tap into the Magoi of black Rukh outside of their body even if they’re not Magi.

However, this unique state of being also had a curious added benefit – namely, that you can now wield powers that would normally conflict or be mutually-exclusive with each other without issue. With this bonus, a Magician could even obtain and use a Metal Vessel of their own, though such a thing would be truly terrifying to behold."

As such, you have the unique power to be able to draw Magoi from not just the Rukh in your body, but also those outside as well, providing a nigh-limitless supply of magical energy. Needless to say, this puts you among the strongest in the world in terms of raw power, though you’ll mostly be limited to fairly simple effects unless you put some effort into actually studying magic. Fortunately, all Magi also possess immense magical talent, so it shouldn’t take too long for you to learn to cast more complex spells. If you wish, you may take the place of one of the three existing Magi or become a new, fourth Magi.

It’s worth noting that Magicians can’t usually wield Metal or Household Vessels, as the Magician’s Rukh and the Djinn’s Rukh tend to interfere with one another. If you have some kind of perk that allows you to wield abilities that are normally antithetical to each other, however, you can overcome this limitation without issue.

603,,400,Source of Power,Magi: Alma Torran,Source,"The Magicians of this world are undoubtedly powerful, far more so than the world that will come. After all, their magical energies are supplied not by some limited internal reserves, but received directly from the almighty god who created the world. That said, however, there is one noticeable flaw to this system – it is reliant on an external source, and so any damage or changes to that source could potentially be catastrophic. Indeed, thanks to David’s meddling, Ill Ilah is gradually turning from a radiant white to a dull black, and the Magoi it supplies is gradually growing impure.

But you need not worry about this problem, though. Now, none of your powers are reliant on any external sources, and as such, any external factors that could potentially affect your abilities will not affect you. Even as every other Magician despairs when their supplies of Magoi grows weaker or becomes cut off altogether, you’ll be able to stand above them all and carry on casting as if nothing had ever happened."

605,,400,Installation,Fate/Extella,Source ,"A packet of data, a subroutine made to be latched onto the spiritual core of a Servant. An Install Skill
is what it sounds like, a Servant Skill that can be installed into any Servant. From weak abilities that
provide minor buffs to power new traits, Install Skills can cover any potential Servant Skill. The same
Skill can even be combined, creating slightly stronger Install Skills from identical components. But
there are limits to how many can be had at once. Servants start with only two slots for Install Skills
and can unlock up to six more as they grow stronger and make close bonds with the people around
them. Install Skills of a similar type will boost each other, such as offense focused Install Skills giving
minor increases to other offence focused Install Skills.

This option is free to both Servants and Invaders. It represents the ability to generate Install Skills
from defeating powerful enemies, a random chance of giving one of random Skill and Rank. Weak
enemies, such as Shadow Servants, are likely to give minimally powerful abilities but powerful Top
Servants could give you B or A Rank Skills. For Masters to gain and keep this perk or for
Servants/Invaders to keep it past this jump, they must pay 400CP. "
606,,400,Divine Ancestry,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Source ,"The blood of gods is your birthright, hero. Like many heroes here, you have divine ancestry, likely
being directly descended from a Divine Spirit as one of your parents. For some, this can grant
immense boons and for others, it is barely noticeable outside of things that have special interactions
with those that are partially divine or more. Thus, taking any tier of this option allows you to choose
any degree of being a demigod, from being distantly descended from a god to being the child of a
mortal and a greater god, perhaps even Zeus himself.

The actual benefits of your parentage are decided by the following. The benefits gained from the
free/50 tier is nothing much. At most, specific abilities and items may react in more beneficial or
more hostile ways to you depending on what degree of you is divine. Your divine parent, or ancestor,
is unlikely to be aware that you are their child. Demigods are exceedingly common, it seems. 

For 100CP, you may see minor benefits. Most common is somewhat greater physical abilities
compared to the free perk given above, enough to put you two or three times more powerful than
normal and you may also find yourself with a minor magical ability related to your parent, such as
the ability to walk on water. Your divine ancestor likely has little care for you, though they are aware
you exist. 

For 200CP, the benefits are fairly considerable. Several times as much magical energy as normal for
someone here and a significant talent for magic, should your parent be a Goddess of Magic. A
natural magical ability to control the seas for hundreds of meters around you, even turning it to
lethal combative use, should Poseidon have been your father. Very minor secondary abilities are also
possible, such as being able to perceive magic with your other senses or speaking to sea-life in the
above two examples. Your divine ancestor knows you exist and at times, looks in on you. It is always
worth keeping in mind potential mortal servants to act in their name and they may at times consider
giving you a quest. 

For 400CP, you’ll fully come into your divine parentage and find yourself a match for Heracles, at
least before accounting for that legendary hero’s training in life. The benefits can be wide and varied
but focusing on one blessing could see you with a physique to match Greece’s greatest hero above, with arms that can lift and throw mountains, crush the skulls of Divine Beasts with your bare fists or
even briefly hold up the Grecian sky, a body that can survive tangling with dragons and a talent for
war unsurpassed by all but a few hundred men across all of history. You can also choose another major ability if you wish or substitute it for three or four lesser abilities that might be found in the
lower tiers of this. As a Demigod of this level, you can be assured that your parent watches you
personally, or at least has their agents do so, and will drag you into their own conflicts whether you
like it or not. It won’t be without it’s rewards, even with all the danger."
607,,400,Blessings of the Sun,Fate/Legends - Nirvana Yuga,Source ,"The power of the Gods does not flow equally in all rivers of life. In some it is but a trickle, a sign of
heritage but little else. In you before this, it may have been a healthy stream. But now you’ve
become a raging river of divine power, a force that even the Gods would be wary of. The divine
blessings you have as a Demigod, or the divine power of your own if you are a god or sage, have
been enormously enhanced towards the arts of war. In terms of raw power, the great mountain
ranges are but wheat before a divine scythe to you, using physical and magical power to bring whole
nations to ruin in the course of a single battle. 

The Authorities of your parent, or those you have yourself from here, grant intensely increased
innate abilities in regards to combat. A child of the Sun God would find the ability to command fire
of all kinds, to intense heats that scorch even Divine Spirits, to amounts that smother kingdoms in
holy fire, even fine control that allows for flight or sealing of wounds with heat. They would be
immune to the ravages of fire, heat and the sun, even finding themselves greatly favoured by beings
associated and connected with the Authority their power is based on. It would be not uncommon to
receive gifts and aid from the spirits of the Sun or even other Gods associated with it, for the above
example. Finally, this divine empowerment renders you enormously resistant to the attempts of
lesser divine beings to act against you, blunting their blows and dulling the magic of their spells if
they hold less uniquely divine power and ancestry. "
608,,400,Snake Jutsu,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Source ,"A blessing from a great god, though it may seem a curse to some, has bound your being to a specific
kind of animal. Snakes, spiders, canines, some great spirit that lives within that breed is partially
connected to you now. What others see normally is just a few traits of that creature, such as a
smattering of snake scales or the ears of a dog. But the benefits are many. Your physical abilities
have significantly increased, overall enough to endanger a notable hero or powerful oni if you aren’t
fighting head on, but is specialised further to some attribute related to your animal. A snake could
give you truly unnatural agility and flexibility, while a spider may increase your reflexes and twitch
movements to far higher degrees. Your affinity for your chosen animal allows for them to be easily
tamed and trained to act as capable ninja companions or allies in battle, as well as greatly improving
the strength of magical spells or abilities that are related to the animal. 

That same affinity also translates into great favour from any greater being that is connected to this
animal, such as gods of the same breed. Your final and most potent gift as part of this is the ability to
manifest aspects of the great god that gave you this power by expending magical energy. A snake
lady who was empowered by the Yamata no Orochi could summon the beasts’ heads to attack foes
by expending great energy or manifest drops of it’s deadly poison with a lesser expenditure. It is
even possible to summon your god at levels’ beyond it’s original power if enough strength is spent
this way. "

greatest heroes would disobey. You are a powerful Divine Spirit, similar in scale to Ishtar or
Ereshkigal. Like the famous story, you have the power to destroy whole mountains, using your body
or your magical power. However, perhaps due to being less greedy than Ishtar, you are quite a
focused God when it comes to your Authority. You possess a single Authority through this option, operating at the same scale as your raw power given above. Further notes on how Authorities work
are given in a notes section at the end of this document.

As a Divine Spirit, you are without age and have likely been alive for thousands of years. Thus, if you
wish, you can be an established part of one of the pantheons or religions present in your time in the

hold great powers over the sky, the underworld and the aspects connected to those things. By the
expenditure of magical energy, you can easily accomplish terrific acts. Just creating tornadoes and
sandstorms or bringing forth massive clouds of rot and disease are simple things. Summoning spirits
of the wind, raising an army of the dead to heed your commands, even opening a gate to the
underworld or taking command of beasts that are connected to the skies is possible. However, you are only somewhat experienced in the uses of these powers and it will take time to go

something more than it is? You thought there just might exist that possibility and by chance, stumbled upon the principles that a great demon would later use in a plan to rewrite all of history. You have the ability to create mana from destruction. Destroying objects or structures releases at
least as much magical energy as what is needed to destroy the objects in that way while destroying
living creatures with souls such as humans or their overall groupings such as societies, will give a
return many times greater than the energy put in.  
  
Better still, you find it easy to gather and control the mana released by this destruction and put it to
your own use, either storing it or immediately expending it. If you wished to store it however, you
are able to form it into solid spirals, circles and loops that continuously cycles the energy and, over
time, slowly increases the amount and potency of the energy contained within these magical
structures. Making more from where there was less without adding anything more."

potentially be summoned and controlled, to some variable degree, with the right ritual. But many of
these things have costs, perhaps too great to bear. For those unwilling to do such things, the book
also contains a very extensive library of spells, allowing for moderate ability in over a dozen broad
fields of magic when studied extensively, though many of these spells will twist or warp reality to be cast. There are even more powerful magics within the book but they will require an experienced and
skillful magus to unlock, as the book has protections to prevent you unwittingly harming your own
mind too easily. As a final measure of defense for it’s master, the book is also able to act as a small- scale weapon, suddenly extruding many very large and very sharp tentacle-mouths and mouth- tentacles to attack foes within few dozen feet, crushing and grinding and chewing up most bodies,

Your family decides the number and potency of your magic circuits, the kind and depth of your magical specialisation, the unique traits of your magic and the potential you have to go further. Certainly, there may be some mutants here and there that buck the system but to the Association, a family as old and storied as yours is far more valuable than the transient nature of a one off prodigy. You hail from a line that is centuries or even thousands of years old. The heir to their circuits and knowledge, it’s ensured you have an impressive amount of power at your fingers. Both quantity and quality of your circuits is among the highest found in Magi of this age and you are generally talented with all magecraft you try your hand at. You may have an exceptionally strong affinity for your Element to improve studies relating to it even more or choose to spread out more and appear as one of the rare Average Ones, of lesser talent in one field in exchange for talent and ability at all five traditional Elements. Your family inheritance ensured you are wealthy, influential and very well connected in the Association, with many would-be allies and mentors hoping to benefit from your name even before you arrived for your first period of study.

Incantations come quickly to you, casting at much higher speeds than all but other prodigies, and your skill with the core arts of magecraft have significantly increased to an expert level. Your family arts are of course much more impressive, as the Magic Crest on your body holds the work of many generations of your forefathers on your one chosen specialty in modern magecraft. As an Alchemist or Elementalist or Spiritualist or whatever else, you’d be well-educated enough to capably run your own lessons in the Clocktower.

When your body can withstand the force of a blast, you may stand still and concentrate instead to absorb it. Don’t get too excited about your new power, however. If a certain type of energy is poisonous to you or is an especially powerful weakness you possess, it’ll still tremendously hurt you. The power of the Silver Crystal will still be a big threat to you if you’re weak to it. And getting overloaded is certainly a thing that can happen with this.

You have a weaker copy of the Silver Crystal, which functions as a power enhancer. Any spell run through it has its powers increased to powerful effect. It takes energy from your life force and concentrates it into magic power. But if you put effort into fiddling with it, then maybe you could use it to enhance other sources of energy. While it lacks the power of resurrection and purification of the original Silver Crystal, it is still quite potent.

It can take any form you wish, like a lotus or tear shape. You can change this form at any time as well with some magic on your part. It comes in a dazzlingly jeweled case, the crystal itself hanging from a silver chain beaded with pearls. Luxurious red velvet pads the inside of the case. This case cannot be damaged and it will never rot away, and the silver chain cannot break unless you wish it to break. You may take the crystal off the chain if you wish.

617,,400,Blessing Without End ,DC Occult,Source,"The Endless are a group of powerful beings, each embodying a fundamental concept of some kind. The Endless are far older and more powerful than mere gods and rule absolutely over their domains. You have somehow caught the attention of one of these beings and have been granted a boon related to their sphere of power.

● Blessing of Delirium: ​Once Delirium was known as Delight, but some event forever altered the youngest of the Endless into a twisted form. With the favor of Delirium, you never need fear this same fate. Your mind is a rock upon which madness breaks. Nothing, be it the passage of eternity or staring into the eyes of the Old Ones, may so much as scratch your sanity.

● Blessing of Despair: Despair finds you to be one of only a handful of beings in all of creation that she actually likes. For finding a soft spot in her heart, she rewarded you with an immense willpower that will forever shield you from the depression which she Embodies.

● Blessing of Destruction: Destruction is a strange being. Having long since grown tired of his duty as the embodiment of destruction and abandoned it to instead pursue (very flawed, due to his nature as the opposite) attempts at creation instead. With his favor, you gain insight into the structure of all things, and more to the point, the weakest points in the structures. Whenever you wish to destroy something, be it a simple physical object, a vast conspiracy, or something more abstract, you will always know where it is most vulnerable.

● Blessing of Desire: Desire is the personification of lust and desire. With this blessing you are among the most beautiful people to ever live. Even beyond your base attractiveness, everyone who looks upon you, or even a likeness of your image, will see something slightly different as your features warp in their mind to be ever so slightly closer to what they consider ideal beauty.
 
● Blessing of Dream: Dream of the Endless rules over the Dreaming. And he’s honestly kind of a dick. But his involvement in the lives of mortals is really not that uncommon, and you are one of his favorites in millennia. With his blessing, you are now always capable of lucid dreaming and may project yourself into the Dreaming at will, allowing you to access both the whole of the plane itself and all the dreams of every living being. Additionally, as dreams and illusions are very closely related, any illusions you cast are enhanced and you are capable of completely ignoring any other illusions that attempt to affect you.

● Blessing of Death: ​Don’t fear the reaper, baby. Death is not exactly what you’d expect. Oh, she once was, but then she took a tradition of becoming mortal and facing a mortal’s death one day a century and her entire perspective changed. Now, instead of appearing as something unnerving, she appears as a rather attractive and upbeat goth girl. After all, everyone deserves one last hot date. As Death favors you, she will turn a blind eye to your death once per jump, reviving you and healing your wounds in the process. After all, why rush things? All will eventually find themselves before her one final time, no matter how many come before.

● Blessing of Destiny: Destiny is the eldest of the Endless and the one most subsumed by his duties. For him to favor a mortal is a very strange thing indeed... but then, you’re not exactly a stranger to strangeness, are you? With the favor of Destiny, you are granted much greater freedom from fate than others. Any attempts to alter your destiny are doomed to failure, as are any attempts to look into a future which directly involves you.

You don’t need wands or reagents or even incantations for your magic, simply the will and knowledge of how to accomplish something.

This isn’t without downsides, of course. It’s always somewhat both harder and less effective the more powerful the spell and the more components you eschew. Throwing a simple fireball without a chant won’t make much of a difference, but attempting to cast world rending spells that normally require elaborate rituals and hours of incantations are another matter entirely.
"
619,,400,Faustian Flip ,DC Occult,Source,"​You know how making a deal with the devil never seems to play out in your favor? Well, now it’s time for that to finally change. You may freely break any sort of binding deal or contract made with a magical being while retaining any and all benefits you received from said deal. Just, you know, be prepared for a pissed off benefactor if you decide to do so.

Of course, this does have one limitation. Namely that it only works on one deal at a time. Using it to retain the benefits of a new deal will result in the forfeiture of all those gained from the last such deal. Still, this is quite the talent you have here. Use it carefully.
"
620,,400,Sanguimancy ,Libriomancer,Source,"You are a rare breed of magic user. A sanguimancer, one who taps into the inherent magic of blood. No; you can’t go making blood spurt out of people’s ears. It’s more subtle than that. By imbibing the blood of another , you gain a fraction of their powers temporarily. The blood of a normal person will let you heal your own wounds and extend your lifespan to unnatural lengths. The blood of a wizard may give you access to his particular brand of magic. The blood of supernatural creatures such as vampires or werewolves will grant you the abilities of a fledgeling of whatever species you drank of, without any of their corresponding weaknesses. You are skilled enough in your art that you will never succumb and become a vampire or werewolf permanently through your magic unless you intend to. However, these abilities are temporary ­while you may extend the duration of them given practice, once the blood leaves your system you will revert to normal. Generally, about 250 ml of blood will give you enough “juice” for about half a day but the ratio of blood consumption to time of empowerment will likely improve with experience.

622,,400,The Only Choice that Matters​ ,A Practical Guide to Evil,Source,"It is the gift of the gods that all mortals are born free. However, in the end, every mortal is offered a Choice. To side with Good, or to side with Evil. Some may falter when they see what they lose to that choice. You do not. The Choice of Good and Evil is not the choice of Necromancy or Healing to you, and you will find that even as you have sunken into the depths of Evil, you can draw upon the light of Good, or that as Good bolsters you, you can reach into the necromancy of Evil. Never will calling upon a power taint your will; you have made your Choice and nothing can change that.
"
623,,400,Headhunter​ ,The Gods Are Bastards,Source,"Headhunters are elves who made a pact with the spirits of the annihilated Orc homeland of Athan’Khar. Each spirit is a powerful mage, but more importantly, each is capable of acting independently. Due to this, you find yourself with the ability to cast near any magic with a reaction time born of having hundreds of spirits watching your back at all times. This makes you an immense threat to nearly everyone, as despite your only average power, the Circle of Interactions assures your ability to counter any spells your foes call forth, while the spirits mean that you’re difficult to counter yourself.

Unfortunately, this is not all benefits. The Orcs of Athan’Khar hate humanity with a passion, a quite reasonable result of the Tiraan Empire hitting the Orcish homeland with so many magical weapons that even time has broken in the area, and even the local god was slain. These furious spirits constantly drive their host to kill, often driving them insane with their demands. While you do not suffer these consequences, good luck convincing others. You must take the Dark Secret drawback. It does not count against the Drawback cap.
"
624,,400,Chaos Infected​ ,The Gods Are Bastards,Source,"Hold on. How, exactly, have you managed to maintain your sanity? It appears your nature as a being from outside of reality has left you with... talents. Talents that are quite uncommon to the natives of this world. Namely, you can use Chaos magic without being tainted. Chaos magic will twist any spells in the vicinity, animates the dead, and breaks people’s minds almost as a side effect. The Chaotic disadvantage is mandatory, and does not count against the Drawback cap.
"
625,,400,Fey Pact​ ,The Gods Are Bastards,Source,"The problem with being a mortal Shaman is that Shamans do not, strictly speaking, gain much magic of their own. Instead, their talent lies with making pacts with powerful fairies, and borrowing their power. Fortunately, you seem to have forged a pact with a minor fairy, and are capable of calling upon its power for your personal use. Oddly enough, this has taken the form of an actual written contract, in which there are no conditions pre-written. You will find in your warehouse a number of copies of this contract. By having someone sign it, you can call upon their reserves of energy to power your fey spells. Obviously, this is only really useful if they’re some form of nature spirit, but perhaps you can reverse-engineer the principles involved?
"
626,,400,Divine Amulet​ ,The Gods Are Bastards,Source,"A strange and wondrous artifact, this amulet not only allows you to draw upon more power from the god or goddess you serve, but also expands your ability to channel that power, letting you go longer without burning out.
"
627,,400,Don’t Give Up! ,Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline,Source,"Despair is the ultimate enemy of Magical Girls in this world - use too much power or dive too deep, and you’ll vanish forever. And life is full of plenty of hardships already without having to put growing up into the equation. It’s a good thing you seem built to deal with that, right? You’re good at holding onto hope despite things like your friends dying or breaking down, and though you may still shed tears, it will take more than a cruel and cold universe to make you fall to despair. Your willpower is boosted greatly by this, and emotion-based magic is just a little stronger in your hands to show for it. Just be careful - holding onto hope can turn into insanity if you focus too much on the impossible. But if something is possible? You’ll only give up when you’re ready to give up.
"
628,,400,Liche Staff ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Source,"An ancient copper staff, twisted in on itself at both ends. It has been engraved with the names of all the Gods of the desert and grants a significant boost to the power of any magic cast while it is in hand. The Liche Staff’s real power however, is that it allows the user to avert catastrophic failures in their casting, making the caster aware of when their attempt is about to fail and bolstering their skill with its own to try and avert it if the caster does not decide to stop.

629,,400,Enhil’s Kanopi ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Source,"The Kanopi is a small jar, holding the heart of a High Priest from long ago. A powerful tool for and against magic users, opening the jar will result in all magical energy in a small area being sucked into the jar, though the storage space is not infinite it can still hold enough to drain a number of high level magicians of everything they have. It only affects magical energy in the air already, allowing it to destroy active spells and enchantments in an instant. It can also be utilised by magic users by drawing out the magic energy contained within, though such is an often risky process as if the jar breaks, it will release all it stores in a great explosion.

630,,400,Magically Charged ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Source,"This tomb was made with a wizard in mind, perhaps you yourself. Being present within the tomb will magnify the power of any within it. Whilst there is only one level to this option, given the array of runes and formations can only increase your power so far on their own, it is enough to see a fivefold increase in your own power whilst within the boundaries of the tomb. The increased power will only affect the master of the tomb and those he allows to share in it, enemy wizards who have broken in will find themselves out of luck. (CG Note: Requires  Tomb - Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings first.)"
631,,400,Kizuna ~ Bonds ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Source,"If miracles overlap, they have the potential to change fate. Your song on its own is powerful, but sometimes more than one voice is needed to push back the darkness. With this perk, you can combine your own singing with that of close friends and family, and sing as if you were one. The mix of your individual voices as one strengthens each singer’s powers into a single, multiplied force. Also, the singers do not need to be in close range for the song to work; one singer could be trapped in a separate dimension, and her song would still reach her companions, with the full song reverberating everywhere the individual singers are. The skill is meant for singing-based powers but can also be applied to other powers for attack combos; however, these non-song powers will require you and your companions to be in close proximity to each other. Furthermore, with enough pure friendship and will by all parties involved, you can summon up to seven individuals to your location, even if mystical barriers and the like would normally interfere; you essentially “call out” to them, and if they wish to help you in-person they will use the perk to push forward to where you are – in the case that you are reaching out to multiple individuals, all of them must succeed together or they will all fail.

632,,400,Herdstone ,Warhammer Fantasy: Beastmen,Source,"The Chaos Hearts, the center of beastmen culture. It is the Herdstones that we Cloven Ones leave our offerings to the Gods, that host our celebrations and feasts. Arrayed at the center of a stone circle, they are the foci that the Bray-Shaman use to commune with the Ruinous Powers, and serve as the chaotic counterpart to the elven waystones - channeling and directing the Winds of Magic, not to the foul Vortex... But to the Shaman, who use the power to further their causes. You are the keeper of one such Herdstone - a great towering menhir covered in filth, runes of Beast Tongue, and surrounded by an ankle-deep carpet of bones. The beastmen regard this, and you, with deep reverence - and in future worlds, similar cultures made of the monstrous and depraved will hold the same regard for this sacred stone. It will forever act as a collector for the Winds of Magic, ensuring you may always call upon them when needed. As well, you carry a pouch at your side - full of Shards chipped from the stone, and woven with the magic it gathers and pools together. Throwing one of these Herdstone Shards to the ground will cause the menhir to briefly disappear from reality - only to erupt through the ground where the Shard was cast."
633,,400,First Generation Spawning ,Warhammer Fantasy: Lizardmen,Source,"The wisest and most powerful of all Slann Mage-Priests were those of the legendary first spawning who interacted with the gods themselves and first taught the Elves to wield magic. Alive and whole they were capable of magical feats long since lost to the world, of shifting entire continents to better suit their masters and with spirits so magically powerful they linger to destroy the forces of Chaos millenia after life has fled their bodies.
"
634,,400,A Verdant Place ,Warhammer Fantasy: Orcs & Goblins,Source,"The Great Green is a part of magic that is extremely unique in the fact it is harnessed by Orc and Goblin Shamans not only from the Winds of Magic as the humans and elves do things, but from the power of a Waaagh! itself and the individuals within it. It is said by the Greenskins that even after death they have won. In truth the Waaagh! is like the Winds of Magic but sourced from the very Greenskins themselves instead of some distant pole of power. Using this to your advantage you can leverage the power of the Waaagh! Into your spells allowing for devastating boosts to all spells you cast, you and all Greenskins carry the Waaagh! within you. In addition, the burden of this magic field is spread out across the Waaagh! and thus when you pull upon it you’ll find your spells are safer, well safer for you, to cast.
"
635,,400,Choir of Hysh ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Source,"Of all the Orders, it is the Light Order that is most often forced to work en masse to achieve its goals. Many of the protective spells on the vaults beneath the Pyramid of Light require the constant incantations of choirs of acolytes. Now you too may cast beyond your means, with the aid of your fellow Hierophants. By casting together in a choir, you and any nearby allies who know the protective, binding, or purifying spell you are attempting to use may combine your efforts seamlessly, creating an exponentially more powerful effect. In the light of Hysh, you are all one.

636,,400,Staff of the Horned One ,Warhammer Fantasy: Skaven,Source,"In the claws of a certain rat known as Thanquol is a stave of blackened wood, with the warpstone crest of a long-dead Lord of Decay fixed atop of it with two jingling bells. This stave, long believed to have been grasp-held by the first Grey Seer, has had a colorful history; Changing hands across betrayals many times over until finally, this potent staff came to Thanquol’s claws. With this, he stands as a speaker for the Great Horned Rat.

Except now even that is called into question, for you bear a duplicate. Or is his the duplicate, and yours the original? Regardless, you have the Staff of the Horned One - a potent magical weapon that magnifies the power of any spell you cast through it, turning a blast of warp-lightning into a torrential beam. But its true power is as a symbol of station: Whilst you hold the stave, your words have a level of gravity that force even those that despise your very existence - such as the dwarf-things and leaders of men - to cease action and hear your words.

637,,400,Landscapist ,Endless Legend,Source,"There are many anomalies that cover this world, their magic gleaned but not understood. You, you understand it. You have listened to the voices of the Rumbling Stones. You have won a staring contest with a Wizard's Eye. You have eaten the fruit of the Life Tree, and you understand. Whenever you are within an anomaly, your magic is more powerful, growing with the strength of anomaly. Inside a chroma land, your spells would be rainbow hued and blinding. While standing within the whispering confines of the Ice Sculptures your spells would deafen your foes and sound as music to your allies. If you stood upon the Dust Tree, maybe, just maybe, you'd be on par with an Endless. You also have a better understanding of all anomalies, and how to best benefit from them.

638,,400,Talisman of Tzeentch ,Warhammer Fantasy: Warriors of Chaos,Source,"This silver amulet with a large blue gem allows Tzeentch’s Sorcerers to magically store some of the Winds of Magic to be used at the Sorcerer’s discretion, rather than rely on the whims of the Winds for the magical energy that they need. This special pendant is made specially for you, and it can store ANY kind of magical energy to be used whenever you desire. You can utilize some of the stored energy as fuel for spells or use them for some other nefarious purpose, but there seems to be no upper limit on how much can be stored. You may import another piece of jewelry if you wish.
"
639,,400,Book Of Hoeth ,Warhammer Fantasy: High Elves,Source,"Rather fitting given the Asur predilection for duality, this arcane tome primarily offers you two opposed yet synchronous benefits. The first is rather straightforward, it amplifies the power of your spells by at least half. Second, it makes it easier to disrupt and dispel enemy magic. Creation, and Destruction, as the Asur like it.
"
640,,400,Seven Sages Seal ,Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past,Source,"While Zelda has always been, and will always be the strongest sage and the wisest old woman, the fact remains that she is rarely enough. Hence the necessity of the other six sages - or maidens, in this era. I suppose that if you tilt your head and squint, the real magic here is friendship. That of Zelda and the Hero, or that of the seven sages. Beyond simply being skilled at barriers and seals, your magic now has the secondary effect that makes it stronger when working in concert with others. And not merely in the sense of ‘seven people cast this spell, so it’s seven times stronger’. So long as you share a strong - and hopefully positive - emotional bond with your fellow caster, you would end up with a spell up to forty nine times stronger instead of just seven times stronger. Let’s see Ganon break through that on his own.

641,,400,Majora’s Mask? ,Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask,Source,"Wait, what? The Skull Kid still has the mask on his face, so where did this one come from? Ah. So, apparently the Happy Mask Salesman tried to force the spirit of the mask to move on to the afterlife so it could be at peace and not be a threat to everyone around it, and it didn’t quite go according to plan. Instead of healing the curse, it healed only part of the curse... Which promptly turned into a second, weaker, Majora’s Mask. Absolutely not according to plan. The mask has enough power to let you levitate around, some telekinesis, will make any curses you cast stronger, and one other thing. If it should ever be separated from you, it can wield its powers on its own as it tries to make its way back to you. Not anywhere near the levels of ‘wrath’ or even ‘incarnation’, but it’s still technically a boss monster. Maybe a miniboss?

642,,400,A Sacred Soul ,Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,Source,"Born with inherent magic similarly to Zelda, you hold a heritage capable of using magic naturally without the need to call upon the powers of nature or the goddesses...though not quite on par with the Sorcerer King utilizing the Triforce of Power. With this noble lineage, you can perform a variety of magical phenomena such as ghost lights, phantom images, magical sounds and with training and time could even replicate weaker versions of the 3 Goddesses’ spells(Naryu’s Love, Farore’s Wind and Din’s Fire) without using magical energy. Finally, you are able to use this magic to weave power into notes and songs - such as those of the Bolero of Fire or the Nocturne of Darkness. Who knows what more you could do if you borrow the powers of the heavens and earth for your cause?"
643,,400,Huge Maku Seed,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons,Source,"The Great Maku Tree is empowered by the land to defend the Oracle. That same Oracle ensures the health of the land. However, if one of the links in this chain should fail, the other two will quickly wither away into weakness and uselessness. As you might imagine, the Oracle is likely the weakest link. Thankfully, a failsafe of sorts has been devised. Or rather, two. The first is the hall of essences, meant to temporarily re-empower the Great Maku Tree. The second is the Great Maku Tree’s own seed, created from the energy gained from those halls of essence. This particular seed serves as a repository of natural energy, slowly soaking it up as time passes, and expended to keep the Great Maku Tree awake. Or for anything else you might need a nation's worth of energy for."
644,,400,Triforce of Courage ,Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess,Source,"You have been blessed by Farore, one of the three Goddesses and the creator of life. In addition to the great bravery you now possess- which allows you to fearlessly face terrifying monsters- you are also at the peak of physical fitness for your race and are naturally talented with weapons and adventuring tools, mastering basic techniques as soon as you pick them up and learning more advanced skills quickly. When the land is shrouded in Twilight, you’ll be able to keep a physical body by taking on the form of a powerful wolf; post-Jump you’ll be able to do this at will, and you resist similar body or mind altering magics much more easily. Finally, you possess one-third of the legendary Triforce- an omnipotent power left behind by the goddesses after they created the world. Although its power is greatly diminished on its own, bringing all three pieces of the Triforce together will grant unimaginable power.

645,,400,Growing Stronger ,Legend of Zelda: The Adventure of Link,Source,"You have a latent potential, traveller -one that only will grow as your journey goes on. When you overcome an enemy through combat, you will gain an energy known as “experience”, a power that could be spent to improve the potency of your magic, the power of your strikes, and how much damage you can take before dying, normally. Moving further up the ladder requires more and more experience with each tier - reaching its plateau out once you have reached the might of 8 trained hylian knights with every single blow, the combined endurance of said knights(which, if you are curious, DOES apply to “Heart Containers” for this specific instance), and for your spells to require 40% less magical energy than before to cast. It is only fitting for a wanderer to pick up skill as they travel.

648,,400,Building Connections ,Genshin Impact,Source,"Most beings in this world are limited to only a single element. The vast majority of users of elemental energy, be they human or spirit, can only use a single one. But this is not a set rule. Delusions can allow mortal men to wield more, and several gods as well as godlike spirits are known to be able to use two. Perhaps the most impressive is the Traveler from another world, who by all rights appears to be able to wield all of them. As a world traveler yourself, this is a trait you share: you are able to resonate with multiple elements with no negative consequences. In future jumps too, you will find that as long as you can find a strong source to resonate with, you will be able to wield the various supernatural energies that exist in those worlds even when most would be limited to just one."
649,,400,Illumination ,Genshin Impact,Source,"While humans use Visions to manipulate the mystical energies of the world, that is by no means the only way to manipulate magic. As the ‘illuminated beasts’ the adepti have a type of third eye that acts in much the same way as a Vision within their body. As these are not the gifts of the Archons, the power of this third eye is not so restricted in its usage. Often this means that the adeptal energy of the adepti each have their own unique effect, ranging from boosting the abilities of the body to generating shockwaves with each attack. Furthermore this energy is potent, such that ordinary mortals cannot withstand its power for long, both their body and soul feeling the strain. You have been illuminated too, opening your ‘third eye’ and gaining your own unique adeptal core."
650,,400,Arcanum ,The Dragon Prince,Source,"Each Primal Source has a secret meaning, an Arcanum. Elves and Dragons are born with this secret, which allows them to empower Primal Magic themselves and refines their ability a lot, and can learn more. These can be hard to explain though, the Moon Arcanum for instance is that appearance is largely the same as reality. By taking this, you possess an Arcanum and increased fluency and independence in magic."
651,,400,The World Speaks ,Terraria,Source,"You are deeply connected to the world and its status. When infections or corruption is spreading in the world, you can sense it, and can feel both where it is and how much has been corrupted by it. You can also hear the voice of the world itself, far more clearly than most called to Terraria, which can give you clear warnings and descriptions of threats that are approaching or threatening you. If you help the world by completing tasks it might set, it will bless you in turn, granting you boosts to health and magic and guiding you to hidden treasures. Those who are associated with the world and seek to guard it will be friendlier to you, recognizing you as a caretaker of the planet."

There is Excellency... and then there is you. You mana reserves are at least fifty times bigger than a normal mage, your stamina is virtually endless, your self-restrain and control are so good that your mind is calm and steady at fault and you can put a good basic defense against most of influences trying to make it anything else, along with a photographic memory and a natural perfect execution of all kinds of mental activities or magical processes. 

This is a Capstone Booster."
653,,500,Demiurge,Kill Six Billion Demons,Source,"There are currently 8 Demiurges in the entire multiverse: Allison, and the Seven. Well, it looks like there are now 9, with you getting in. This power manifests as a glowing white dot on your forehead. While it can be covered, it otherwise can’t be hidden or gotten rid of. At will, you may also manifest a halo above your head, and beyond having to look kinda like a halo, you get to choose how it looks. This power, access to the Key of Kings, grants you many abilities. First, you are able to do stuff like summon phantasms of gods to fight for you, have clones made up of white energy split from your body and attack your enemies, teleport, and more. Additionally, you know one of the words of the Seven Part Name, YISUN’s true name. By saying this word, you damage reality itself, and even killing those of weak will. Finally, you can also loan some of your power to your followers. How strong these powers you give them depends on how much power of your own you sacrifice, but these blessings can be pulled back to you at no cost, and making your power whole again. You can also make your Emissaries, the people who have been granted power by you, have their mind twisted to your goals, though those with strong will can fight against this, even defeat your corruption. The Key you get is equal to Allison’s/Zoss’s, though you have to learn how to use it. The downside to this power, is that anyone that sees your Key and knows what it is, they probably want to steal it for themselves. And if it is taken out of your head, you fall unconscious and take a ton of damage and pain, regardless of any power you have. Post-jump, you may choose to hide the Key, revealing no outward signs of it. This perk is also a capstone booster, look in the Notes section to see how it affects the capstones."
654,,500,Crisis,The Seven Deadly Sins,Source,"This ability allows the user's power to constantly increase while taking damage. So the more you are dying, the more your power is enhanced.

As such the prices can vary vastly. However they apply by the same rules of purchasing Demon as a race. As such the Essence of a Pixie would only cost you 100 CP while the most powerful of Aogami would cost 700 CP. Essences bought this way respawn once per day.

Note: You can not purchase the Essence of the Demifiend, Shiva or Lucifer with this option. Nice try.

656,,500,Demigod,Greek Myth,Source,"The blood of a god flows through your veins making you greater than mortal men. This blood turns you into a paragon of your origin. Drop-Ins will find even a single stride is able to take them a great distance and that they seem to have been blessed by the fates themselves with great luck. Great Artists will find themselves able to create masterpieces as easily as they breathe while their effort improves their works to even grander heights. Heroes will find their strength multiplied, their body toughened, and their speed vastly increased making them all but unstoppable by mortals. Monsters will grow to truly gargantuan sizes and find that their supernatural abilities will have grown with them.

All origins gain some control over their divine parents domain, sons of Zeus will be able to call down bolts of lightning, daughters of Hades could bring forth an army of undead servants, and a child of Poseidon could create violent earthquakes.

Any Greek god is valid as a choice for this perk but be warned some parents will not be taken to kindly by the gods of Olympus.

Whichever origin you are the blood now in your veins has enhanced the power of any 600 CP perk you may have bought."
657,,500,Blessing of the Padjal,Final Fantasy XIV,Source,"The Padjal are the Saints of Gridania, blessed by the elementals and honored by the people. Under their tutelage, many Conjurers have started to rediscover the lost art of White Magic. This is no coincidence, considering nearly all Padjal show a great predilection towards the school of Conjury.

Once one is touched by the elementals and becomes a Padjal however, many realizations are had over the privileges granted...and the consequences incurred. For the moment you become a Padjal, in exchange for eternal youth, a massive increase in magical capability, and the ability to converse with the forest, you trade away any chance of offspring and future generations.

The Padjal are not immortals however, as eternal youth is only as eternal as the mortal clock permits. When it comes time for the Padjal to die – die they will and time will take hold of their once timeless bodies. Once you choose to receive this blessing, you will grow the appropriate horns to signify your station."

Yeah, just straight up. You can exchange cash, gold, bottle caps, pretty much any sort of currency to increase your magic powers. This includes your innate abilities, your fancy colorful casty stuff, and equipment such as Devil Arms. Keep in mind that these increases in power are proportional to how much currency you’re pumping in. So if you’re just burning up loose change, it’ll take you forever to catch up to the dude who spends magically forged god dollars from Mount Olympus."
659,,500,Transcendent Hybrid,Epic of Leviathan,Source,"One of the main reasons that Aizen was fascinated by Ichigo was his incredible potential as he was a hybrid of Shinigami, Hollow, Quincy, and Fullbringer. He was a unique being only seen once within the series. By taking this however he will not be the only one anymore. This option will make you a perfect hybrid between all of the races mentioned above allowing you to use all of their abilities. You will also be granted an unbelievable amount of potential allowing you to rapidly strengthen yourself. In a few years you could match beings who have been training for thousands of years, at least when it comes to raw power."

They can do all a privileged can do but are far more powerful and can be considered demigods in their own right. You alone are worth half a royal privileged cabal. With a movement of their hand they can incinerate a building, cut down a tower with a blade of air, move more dirt than a hundred men could move a day, explode people into ribbons, push an entire crowd away with walls of hardened air and explode a whole city block without breaking a sweat. . Predii can change their shape, even assuming animal forms and create compelling illusions. A Predii outclasses even royal cabal members so much that they can pretty much tear through wards and traps erected over a week and brush their spells aside mostly ignored. They can even overpower an average magebreaker, ignoring their anti-magic and melt them if they wanted to. Not only can they dish it out, but they can take an incredible amount of damage, if someone even manages to get through their wards that protect them from even normal musket fire while unprepared. They could recover and heal from things like being impaled and shot several times through the head with high speed bullets as well as burned alive and fall down a mountain cliff. Of course, due to their age and being the ones who summoned the god Kresimir the first time they know many ancient secrets regarding sorcery and more. They can channel the aura of stars and planets, so that special astronomical events such as a solstice greatly enhances their spells

You are ageless after hitting your prime, strong enough to lift 30 tons or more, and can run and fight most of a day before tiring. Most importantly, however, your very being is tied to a concept over which you have dominion. Perhaps you could be a god of Stories or Trickery, gaining power of illusion, or a lord of battle and thus understand tactics instinctively and sense bloodshed."

Along with your eyes looking how you wish for them to be, you gain a rather large boon. These aren't the actual Eyes of the World, but even as a pale imitation these eyes give an incredible boost to your magical abilities, enhancing their potency and efficiency while allowing you to decide the appearance of your eyes to whatever you wish it to be. It is this gift that allows you to decide whether you want to create, or destroy... it is Aesir's gift to you: The gift of Choice."

One of the elements, such as fire, water, wind, earth or ice is what you may choose and you can then create and control this element on an incredible scale. An ice controller could freeze an entire nation over in seemingly endless winter, create a flexible and intricate dress from ice or create an entire ice palace in just moments.

As a Heretic God, you aren’t seen by normal humans, only by magicians and the like. Unless you choose to show yourself to them. You’re immune to all mundane weapons, no matter their nature, and only the most powerful mortal magic can barely harm you. All Heretic Gods are immortal, living forever unless killed.

667,,500,Spiral of the Heart ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Source,"An ancient, spiraled shell that is one of the royal treasures of the Indian Ocean mermaid kingdom. It serves as a tap for excess emotions, allowing the princess to maintain a serene demeanor by storing unneeded emotions in the shell, whether negative or positive feelings. However, if the source of the user’s tumultuous feelings is not addressed, the mermaid will eventually reach a breaking point even with the output into the shell. More importantly, the spiraled fossil retains the dark and light emotions within, making it into a powerful repository for magic. By drawing on the negative emotions stored inside, the user’s dark magic is enhanced, and vice versa, by accessing the positive emotions, holy magic is enhanced and darkness is dispelled.
"
668,,500,Fimbulvetr Bible* ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Source,"A magic spell book focused on ice magic. By invoking chants to the ice spirits while holding the book in your hands, you can unleash the might of the cold; with enough control, you can blanket an entire town in an endless blizzard up to the rooftops. Case in point: see that girl wading through the snow? Well, she’s about to trip on a weather vane – still on the roof of a building! The book has a vast store of magic that gradually regenerates over time, so that you do not lose energy while drawing on the book’s powers, and your own magic will only help strengthen the spells. However, the spells only work when you are holding the book. Also, be careful that you aim your attacks right, or you might accidentally get caught in the crossfire; for instance, you don’t want to have a command to turn your enemies into “snowmen” result in a bunch of snowmen falling down and nearly squashing you.

It can change into the form of a normal rose at your command, and when you bid it, it resumes its true form. The rod embodies the darkness of the clan, and grants the user enhanced dark magic. Furthermore, if the rod were to be used at the right moment, it can counter any seal forced on the wielder, perhaps even the sacred seal of Aqua Regina; however, the weapon must be consciously called upon just as the seal is being placed.

670,,500,The Power Of Friendship ,Generic MG,Source,"The power of friendship is strong. Not only do you simply gain strength from your allies being on the battlefield, you also gain strength from each other’s emotions. The stronger you feel about your fight, the greater the boost to your abilities, and the less you tire in battle.

Your friends and allies also benefit from them, for what is the Power of Friendship but something that can be shared? Not only will the boost automatically be mirrored to your allies on the battlefield, but you can also permanently gift a copy of this to any of your friends and allies.

While there is no upper limit to the boost, it fades once battle ends. If you have not yet reached the limit of your power, you may keep a small fraction of this boost as a permanent gain. This also acts as a training booster, increasing gains in power and technique, when you train with friends.

This is the capstone booster, extending the power of the 600 CP perks for each origin by unlocking special subperks if those perks are purchased. Sharing the Power of Friendship will not unlock those subperks, though."
671,,600,Walking Flair,Kate Daniel ,Source,"You do not just absorb ambient power or generate your own. You are a nuclear power plant of magical power. It is not that your capacity has increased, just the amount you generate overflowed instantly even when you are empty. This is an endless fount of power. This power is so much a part of you that you can be prevented from casting magic. The spells you cast can be dispelled or countered/interrupted. But nothing is capable of stopping your physical capability to use magic no matter tech or magic. This saturated your environment to the point that it is equal to the time when gods roamed the earth at least in your immediate vicinity. This will quickly disappear into the environment. And given how volatile raw mana is there may be consequences from staying in a place for too long. But most if not all such resulting mutations will be indifferent to you if not positively inclined. This is a capstone booster see notes."

673,,600,Fragment of Divinity,Xenoblade Chronicles 2,Source,"Where on Alrest did you get this thing?! This tiny green cross-shaped ornament appears to be a scale replica of the Conduit, about the size of Pyra and Mythra’s core crystal. This fragment of a divine artifact possesses the same nature as the original Conduit, in other words it’s a gateway to alternate dimensions and a source of limitless energy. Its maximum output is far lower than the real thing unfortunately so you won’t be powering any planet-spanning space stations or creating new universes with it, but it would make one hell of a power source for something like an Artificial Blade or maybe a Siren unit. If you could figure out how to work with the device’s energy you could potentially make an Artificial Blade capable of matching the power of Logos, Ontos, and Pneuma."
674,,600,Nahyndrian Knowledge,Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous,Source,"Through her direct tutelage or your own groundbreaking efforts, you’ve uncovered the same methods and ideas that Areelu used to create Mythic power from Nahyndrian crystals. This is the science of extracting power from mighty beings and converting it into new forms. The essence of Demon Lords was used for the Nahyndrian Mythic arts but you need not be so limited, as you can turn the same magics to extract from the corpses of other mighty things or even from inanimate sources. 

The core purpose of this science is the creation of Mythic power, in its’ various forms. This might be the basic empowerment that most demons have received or one of the more advanced forms of Mythic power. It combines well with other sciences as well, creating powerful energy sources, enormously enhancing magical rituals or easing in great transformations. This is the manipulation of what some might consider power itself, only found in the greatest of creatures and magical effects."
675,,600,Heart of Eternity,Anima Ark Of Sinners,Source,"A powerful artifact. Indeed, this device is one that is capable of powering even an eternal loop as it is capable of generating an infinite amount of energy at a steady rate by creating a field of frozen time all while serving as the control system of generators. This can allow the Heart to be beyond reach as it separates from the physical world."

677,,600,The Lotus Crown,Grant Morrison’s 18 Days,Source,"First, there is Brahma, the Self-Aware Immensity, from whose thought-substance are created all known and unknown things.

Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva, Three Gods, three beings beyond all comprehension of size, time, and space. And you are the incarnate form of one of them. You have just a small fragment of this measureless being within you, yet it is enough, for is not a fragment of infinity still infinity?

You find yourself connected on a deeper, metaphysical level to any universe you come to inhabit. Any energies you have access to, you can now draw from the universe itself, being an endless font of raw power of any and all kinds. For all intents and purposes, it’s as if your actions don’t consume any energy at all. They’re being executed by the universe itself, your Will made manifest.

This especially reflects in the form of any Domains and Rights you have, in that your knowledge over them now expands into real, proper Authority over those elements. In case of a Concept that is physical in some way or form, such as Fire, Water, or even Life or Death, you have complete and absolute control over it in every idea and meaning of it. Fire would be not just the burning flame, but also the heated emotions, the idea of a burning gaze, and all other metaphysical implications.

For more ephemeral concepts like ‘Love’ or ‘War’, your control is far more indirect, but no less absolute, You can make anyone fall in Love with anyone, start or end wars on command, and in general do anything you would expect a God of the Concept to be able to do."
678,,600,Mobius Brooch,Castlevania - Lament of Innocence,Source,"The Mobius Brooch is a masterpiece of alchemical creation and magical enchantment, a prototype perpetual motion machine. Whenever it, or whoever is wearing it, is at rest, the brooch charges. When they begin to move, it feeds the stored power into the bearer, granting them stamina far beyond their normal limits. It can charge on it's own, but being attached to a person allows it to siphon off their unused energy, and it will charge much faster. Wearing it for a day and being even mildly lazy generates enough energy to fight for a week without stopping. A day of purposeful sloth would allow you to pull out all of your strongest techniques again and again and again without pause. Best of all, and the true miracle of its creation? There is no upper limit to what the brooch can hold."
679,,600,"Truthfully, Indubitably and Indisputably The Heir, For Realsies",Princess The Hopeful,Source,"If you had thought to ask the Queen of Mirrors what defines the True Heir, you might have gotten the answer that the True Heir is a living personification of the Light itself. Her word becomes truth, her actions mighty, her mere presence a bastion of hope. That’s why when you take the flamboyant, magnificent and absolutely over the top approach in life you actually get brief flashes of genuine skill and minor miracles to help you genuinely do your best! The more people are watching and cheering you on, the better you are, and the more genuinely devoted give you a little extra magic too. That bubble shield you’re putting up? With a small crowd cheering, you could have it cast out a brilliant light that dazzles your foes with its sheer wonder AND reflect their attacks back on them! Really, just about anything can be better as long as you’ve got enough people to stand tall and look your absolute best in front of. Your body is stronger and your magic is more powerful and your mind thinks smarter and your hair looks even more beautiful-it never ends, with you! With some really devoted friends or a bigger crowd, you could even valiantly fence a dreadful Dethroned on your own and win while they all stay away from the fight safely behind you! It’s...it’s just such a shame though, how little meaning perfection seems to have if there’s nobody to see it? Be warned, any gains you have here will quickly evaporate once people stop actively paying attention to you and you stop wowing them with your personal magnetism. Because you only really feel like the True Heir when other people also feel that way."
680,,600,Sharicite Manipulation,Hyperdimension Neptunia,Source,"The power of Faith is a great one. You’re capable of manipulating Sharicite directly, not just channeling it through your body as Faith. Sharicite is generated by crystallizing the belief of the faithful, and in your presence, will slowly be generated over time. CPUs with this perk may find it useful to stockpile Sharicite for ‘dry spells’ during which they’re without followers, since during those periods, they will be unable to transform. Sharicite, as well as allowing a CPU to transform, is a very energy-dense power source, with a chunk the size of an arm substituting for an entire city's worth of electricity."
681,,600,Deity of Sin ,Hyperdimension Neptunia,Source,"Where a CPU draws her power from Faith, you draw yours from Sin. The more people lust and desire, the stronger you grow. As people steal and allow the greed in their hearts to overtake their common sense, and as they cast down order in favor of chaos, your strength rises until you are no less than a god. Further, you can spend sin in the same way that Goddesses spend Shares in order to learn how to recreate any device that lies before you. The more complex the device, the more sin you’ll have to spend."
682,,600,A Cross To Bear,Castlevania - Judgment,Source,"Throughout the ages, the Belmont have had weapons and techniques that they refined day by day, monster by monster, and Belmont by Belmont. One of those techniques is the Grand Cross, and one of those weapons is currently embedded in a suit of leather armor and proudly displayed upon your back. This cross serves both as proof that the work you do is good in the eyes of the lord and as a weapon against the night. Every second that you bear it, the cross generates holy energy and stores it within itself. You will need to learn how to draw that energy out and into a useful form, something that I imagine will take some time. If you have a Signature Weapon then you will find that the energy flows into it with greater ease than almost anything else, but that is by no means the limit to what it can do should you devote the time necessary to understanding how to use it. Since you have either stolen, inherited, or duplicated this cross, there is only one thing left for me to say to you - smite the wicked."
683,,600,Lord Dracula,Castlevania - Judgment,Source,"It brings me no pleasure to inform a monster of your caliber of this, but you need not waste your time worrying about the potential consequences of the Time Reaper attempting to change the course of history. The very idea of you has infected the formless Chaos that all monsters, such as the Time Reaper, draw their power from. For better or for worse, your actions are a part of history, and any attempt to remove you from it via paradox will not only fail to work, but will backfire horribly upon those who try to bring about your untimely and untimed demise while also strengthening your connection to Chaos in proportion to the effort put into erasing you. Better still, having somehow become a part of Chaos, you may draw upon its power in the form of Hellfire, a lesser form of Dracula’s own Demonic Megiddo. I feel I should take a moment to point out that this is not an immunity by any means - people may still try, and you may still be dragged into the Time Rift - or a Time Rift, as the case may be - but unless you specifically allow it or cannot be bothered to fight off your final moments come early, it simply will not work. They would have significantly better luck with a sword and a whip."
684,,600,Supreme Deity,Valkyrie Anatomia,Source,"In all the nine realms, it was believed that none could surpass Odin in might. Even so, people appeared that could indeed rival and even surpass him. While you are not graced with such strength purely from this perk, though your physical and magical might will increase significantly, as will your natural charisma and charm. You are granted something potentially greater: the potential to rival and even surpass Odin, as well as the Progenitor God and the Valkyries at Ragnarok. So long as you put in at least a small amount of work, your power may continue to rise, much like the aforementioned trio of beings who are both more and less than pure Gods. Furthermore, your capabilities will never deteriorate, either physically or mentally."
685,,600,Transcendent,Warhammer 40K: Necrons,Source,"Even the smallest fragment of the C’tan can smite entire groups of enemy forces and mechanized weapons relentlessly, carving swathes of destruction through enemy lines. There are those however who are more whole, either larger remnants of their original self or those that are the conglomeration of tens to hundreds of other shards fusing together to create an apocalyptic force of destruction far greater than the sum of its parts. Regardless of the specifics you are one of those same cataclysmic beings, the powers afforded to you by your nature as a Shard increased by orders of magnitude. Where you might have scoured a battle group with solar fire you could now rain it from the sky across entire battlefields with the same ease, rip open bedrock to crush legions beneath the earth, twine space and time to step across entire planets with a thought, or even rend the fleets that hound the world you are on with contemptuous ease that makes even the greatest psykers feel humbled. Your might is such that instead of the simple tesseract labyrinths used to imprison lesser shards you require entire monolithic necron structures to truly contain you power, and even they are constantly buckling and roiling underneath the strain as swarms of constructs must constantly repair and reconstruct them lest you break free. This perk shall also affect any similar powers you might possess, whether it be psychic gifts or stranger abilities drawn from worlds where extraordinary abilities are more common, as your inherent nature enfuses and uplifts them into something greater than they would be in the hands of a mere mortal."
686,,600,Emotional Reaper ,The Ghost and Molly McGee,Source,"Harvesting fruits of life, you have the relatively rare ability to consume a type of emotion. Growing evermore powerful through every morsel. Feeding on people’s sadness like a Sobgoblin until you could be equal to a Sobgoblin King, savoring every bite of someone's fears until they are deadened to feeling anything, etc. Furthermore, just like the Chairman, if you were in a position of power, this would allow you to even feed on your subordinate's victims when they cause that essence of life. It would not take many feasts until you reached power unimaginable by the rest of Ghostkind.

Boosted: The Ghost  

In long-forgotten annals of history, there have been written feats transcribed upon a Ghost called Grimm. An Emotional Reaper who has risen and gained a mastery of their ability to feed upon the emotions of the living. To the point of being able to reap all from their victims. Sadness to happiness, apathy to mania and even feeding upon their immortal souls. While the Ghost story is now considered a simple myth, you have gained skills equal to this legend in the Reaping. Your expertise even allows you to gain the ghostly abilities of the souls you have in your grasp. With skeletal fingers, grasping life's colored core, let all remember.

But even if you could drink another Clan’s Antediluvian dry, would that be enough? Even Haqim is not strong enough to simply kill all the other vampires on his own, after all. What if you could truly take all of the power of the cursed blood you drank into yourself? Now you can. When you diablerize another vampire, you gain their powers. Drinking down a member of another Clan would give you that Clan’s affinity for Disciplines. But there’s no need to stop there. You can diablerize anything that can rightly be called a vampire. Diablerize one of the Cathayans to learn not only their strange powers but take the advantages of their strain of vampirism into yourself, such as their ability to ignore stakes through the heart by maintaining an internal balance of Yin and Yang energies. Of course, just as a Thin-blood cannot rise to the 4th Generation with a single act of diablerie, devouring a single vampire of a kind much stronger than your own vampirc strain will give you only a fraction of their power. Good thing there’s a simple solution to the problem of killing only one of those accursed monsters, eh?"
688,,600,The Bloody,Kill Six Billion Demons,Source,"The more people you slaughter with your own weapons and body, the more dangerous you become. All your attacks become more effective, your armor becomes harder to pierce, and your enemies become more squishy. The buff, however, depends on how much of a threat to you your enemy is, so seeking out armies of weaklings won’t change much, while someone who stands on an equal or greater stance than you have a much larger boost.

689,,600,Pillar Compatibility,Wild Arms 2,Source,"The guardians of Filgaia have powers over elements according to their domains, with their full power their attacks could have the same effect as a natural disaster. Even though you don’t get access to the same level of power as them, you can receive a fraction of their might once you wield one of their mediums, wearing their idols lets them lend their powers to you to protect yourself and the world.

Now you may earn power from patrons in the same way, by making a vow, oath or contract you get a weakened copy of one or more of their abilities, in their most basic form. You can train these gifts to strengthen it and with enough time they may be able to rival the original. A Fire Bird capable of causing eruptions in volcanoes could let you learn to generate and manipulate flames; An Icy wolf could let you learn how to create daggers of ice or a boulder of ice to hurl at your enemies. In future worlds, any contracts or similar you make will let you wield a small fraction of the other side's abilities, though if the contract gets broken you lose access to their power until another agreement is made."
690,,600,Shades of Heroism,Wild Arms 2,Source,"Heroism is a central theme of this story, pretty much every character in the story is a hero in some way, to someone or something. Even the villains are heroes from a certain point of view or view themselves that way. After the journey reaches its conclusion, the answer the protagonists reach is of a world without heroes, that is, without anyone elevated and sacrificed for the greater good, but instead a world in which everyone works together for the sake of a miracle.

Based on this answer you can have this ability, by harnessing the willpower of those that desire for a tomorrow, you learned to convert these desires into spiritual power capable of affecting entities like Lord Blazer and the Holy Sword Argetlahm. This power increases as more individuals transfer their feelings to you and the stronger your bonds with them are. Alone you would at most be capable of banishing an eldritch being to outside reality in exchange for your life, but with the feelings of several close friends and people you met in a journey could make you would be capable of easily destroying these eldritch beings completely.

Basically you are fueled by the power of friendship, you can use this power to recover from wounds, refill your reserves of energy and manifest the positive energy in the form of light to materialize personal weapons and armor and in general to attack or defend. You could Banish or destroy evil or do anything else you think a JRPG Hero would be capable of doing. Even without extra energy from others feelings you can still manifest positive energy from your own reserves of energy."

But why let them have all the fun? Now your own powers are increased whenever you cause misery, corruption, and death, becoming all the greater spiritually and physically as you damn more of the world. Perhaps with enough work, you could follow the path of the corrupt mage Mikaboshi and become a Yama King, carving out your own Hell and contesting your rivals for the title of Demon Emperor when the age turns."

Not only that, but those two versions are now stronger than before: the ""learning one"" makes you capable of learning, in a month, enough to become a Coven Head and with a memory good enough to remember everything that you experienced a year in the past; and the ""raw power one"" increases your magic energy twenty times; the recharge speed is enhanced on the same amount.

693,,600,Divinity Rekindled ,Warhammer Fantasy: Dark Elves,Source,"Grim omens sometimes point to the idea that the wellbeing of the elven pantheon is not quite as intact as their own worshippers may believe. The full truth of this is...ambiguous and open to your discovery, to say the least, but it seems you are now entangled in the mysteries of their lost gods. For a shard of an elven god’s soul has bonded with yours, empowering you both physically and mystically in it’s image-perhaps with some of its quelled deific nature. The touch of divinity is subtle at first-at least compared to the world-quaking might of fully incarnated daemonic forces-but still profound enough to elevate you above mere mortals. In time it may indeed be possible to reclaim the full reach of the divine force invested in you, but the quest to achieve this will be arduous and shrouded in mystery even for the greatest mages. Mystically significant circumstances, tremendous magical power tied on an inherent level to one or all of the Winds of Magic and powerful artifacts seem to be the most direct means to fully realise such potential, but it seem grand feats of war and heroic struggle can slowly bring out some of that grandeur.

One imbued with Khaine’s power would have the body of a peerless warrior, and with training rapidly rise to match even the greatest Druchii warriors in open battle and standing a great chance of prevailing. The miracles of Khaine would be mighty and frequent in occurring around him too, subtler and less precise than true magic but no less powerful. One touched by Isha’s soul would instead purify corruption with their mere presence, promote harmonious growth in all its forms wherever they walk and be great in Qhaysh: Normally the speciality of the High Elves. Greater gifts can be unlocked and cultivated from this sliver of spirit with the greatest elven magics, and while certain deities may indeed greatly enhance magical powers in general those styled as hunters, warriors or smiths may grant inherent might or pervasive influence what the discipline and focus that mystic arts demand lack.

Should it transpire that certain elves are in fact reincarnations of elven deities like yourself, this option does not obstruct their own divinity. It is simply that your portion of the god’s power is a blessing that happens to contain some of their soul separate from them as the true incarnation."

This item allows one to ignore the laws of Equivalent Exchange, creating things from nothing, effortlessly transmuting humans, and all without the need for circles, or flashy claps like those who’ve gone through the gate of Truth. Transmutation with this artifact is instantaneous, and almost miraculous. Now, this must seem too good to be true, and that would be true because usually this is only an illusion, and instead of actually bypassing the law, it is instead the container for something valuable enough to power most of what an Alchemist would ever be able to use it for. The human soul. Of course, you wouldn’t want to be carrying around the vessel that holds thousands of tortured souls, so instead you get a duplicate that instead is simply an energy vessel and has the same properties. It can still run out if you tax it too much, but it will simply turn black and recharge within a week instead of disappearing. Comes with a set of notes detailing how to make this setting’s version of the Stone."

Developed by Urahara in a year’s time under normal circumstances, this sword houses an immense amount of spiritual energy contributed by the captains of the Gotei 13, among other Shinigami. However, despite the form it takes, and the incredible power it houses, this is not a weapon. This is tool used to bestow the power of a Shinigami to a human, originally used to completely restore a once crippled Ichigo’s powers. A human who was never a Shinigami would not obtain Shikai or Bankai, but would have immense power as a Shinigami bestowed upon them. Someone who was once a Shinigami, but lost their powers, would instantly be returned to their full power and then some. Simply stab the sword in your target of choice, and the sword will break apart and bestow its power unto them. You will obtain a new “Charged Blade” each Jump, and in future worlds it will obtain the additional functionality of being able to restore any kind of lost power that the stabbed individual once had."
696,,600,Golden Light,Bleach,Source,"There is enormous power within these fragments, that grant us our powers. This shining golden light may give the right to control the spirits around us but there is greater potential. Even a tiny piece of the Soul King has more power than an atomic bomb, this being the creature who created the differing worlds from the sea of chaos. You are naturally able to touch the fragment inside and, like perhaps only one other, draw out this power for your own use. The pure golden Reiatsu exerted is enormous. Even a Fullbringer with the average tiny fragment or scrap of skin could summon almost enough power to match a weak Captain of the Shinigami. The knowledge of drawing this power also allows you to take the pieces of the King from others. Provided they are unable to resist, with body or spirit, you can steal and add it to your own spiritual make-up. 

With more or greater parts, you would be able to enhance your energy, and thus overall power, to greater and greater heights. A hybrid to be made years from now who possessed dozens or possibly hundreds of small fragments could give a daring battle to the fully matured Kenpachi Zaraki, until he released his Shikai. What might you be capable of with more than that?

In other times and lands, you may find it possible to reorient this power to different internal objects or beings. Pulling out much more power than normal and doing so under your own control or stealing similar sources of power to the ones you possess from others you defeat."
697,,600,Communal Power,Bleach,Source,"The source of our power was once a single being. All Fullbringers come from this one origin, a communal heritage that creates a connection between all. It is perhaps why they are able to share parts of themselves and take from those willing. And why it has such unique effects when such is done. Fullbringers are able to share parts of their Fullbring with others of their kind. Instead of copying each other’s abilities, it instead increases existing Fullbrings with aspects of the others. A Fullbring whose primary purpose was a full body armor that enhanced physical abilities would grant effects to other Fullbrings in the same style, increasing their coverage and physical traits. A Fullbring that rewrote the past may instead give a new time-related aspect to existing powers. Of course, to some extent, an increase in raw power is also to be expected if shared from someone of greater power than you. 

What is unique about you is your perception of this origin. The Soul King, whose body grants your Fullbrings, was more than just the origin of your kind. He was the origin of a great many things. Some known, some not. A realisation that expanded your awareness and allowed your sharing to apply beyond Fullbringers. To give a part of yourself to others, or take from those willing to give, you can carry out the same process. Take part of a Shinigami’s Zanpakuto, using it to boost either your own sword or your Fullbring or something else entirely. Any individual can only grant a part of themself every so often but once given, it is permanent. Through this, you and your friends can grow stronger and expand your horizons together."
698,,600,Kenpachi,Bleach,Source,"You were always strong. Stronger than anyone you met. Maybe strong enough to be one of the strongest in all the worlds. But even as a kid, that strength limited you. How could you ever connect with others or learn from them? How could you ever enjoy a fight when you were swatting them like flies? Through your own subconscious action or the binding of another, this power was sealed away deep within as potential.  

Similar to Zaraki Kenpachi, you hold the potential for vast physical and spiritual power, along with a natural instinct for combat unmatched by almost any spiritual being. But this is largely inaccessible now. As you put yourself into deadly battles against worthy foes, you’ll see that power begin to return in leaps and bounds. Your muscles become denser, your spiritual pressure rages hotter and heavier with each battle, until you can eventually reach the same awakening of power as Zaraki did. 

Even after having reached your full potential, you’ll still have an effortless talent for all things relating to violence. Martial styles are easy to learn, becoming a capable user of techniques with a single day’s learning, and each battle you enter only increases your experience. With every fight, you become deadlier, even if there’s rarely a need to bother with your strength. "
699,,600,Number One’s One Else,Bleach,Source,"What could one human body do, stuck in the middle of the warring worlds and the gods that seek to remake them in their own image? Rather a lot, as those same gods make the boy more important than any other, sometimes without even realising it. If desired, and it is not something one can take back until the next world comes, you can take on the role of the protagonist in a world’s story. Once the choice is made, you’ll steadily attract more and more attention towards yourself from many important beings. You’ll be drawn into momentous events and often placed in a position to change things, for both better and worse. 

As the story goes on, you’ll discover that you were actually part of it since before you even made the choice. A parent reveals themselves to be a powerful Shinigami captain all along, you end up being the reincarnation of an ancient hero from eons past, a childhood friend turns out to be a potent foe that could yet be redeemed by the one they still admire. Sometimes this might result in entirely new powers developing in you, discovering new heritage to take advantage of, or in useful allies and mentors. 

But the downside of becoming the protagonist is that you cannot escape your own story. As much as you matter and have the agency to change the world, you’ll also be forced into challenges fitting of a protagonist. Perhaps only the ones faced by the person you replaced, if you only seek to tread the same old path, but potentially greater or lesser foes if you move to change the story mid-way through. A general rule that applies though, is that the rewards you reap from your importance in the story and the strange reveals of your past will match the level of danger you face."

Just being made to feel pain by an opponent around your level of strength or beyond it will cause you to gain noticeable increases in power. Actual injuries? You’ll see your might magnify immensely, even growing two or three times over your original level. Once you begin to surpass your foe at the time, the boosts from pain and damage will become less and less but finding a new opponent of the right level will see you gain those original immense boosts once more.

Whether this be through your own growth or through evolving your racial abilities such as a fairy gaining wings or a giant gaining far more skill with their Creation power. Maybe you're a demon who has become far better at the control of your Darkness or even a Goddess who has become far more skilled with the Ark then they should be. This doesn't make you equal to an Archangel or a High Ranking Demon or one of the Fairy Kings but your growth is of a similar level. In less than a year if you went through incredible hardships you could go from a power level of 3,000 to a power level of well into the hundred thousands. Your growth is insatiable.

So it is that you now gain the ability to grow stronger by absorbing supernatural sources of energy such that of mothercrystals. Since you are paying with CP, this also makes it so you won’t suffer adverse effects from what you absorb such as going berserk, transforming into an Akashic etc... as well as making the power growth permanent.

Well then, it would seem your ability to grow stronger by absorbing energy has grown much stronger. This makes it so that simply absorbing energy on the level of a mothercrystal would make you as strong Ultima were you a normal Dominant. To say nothing of what would happen if you were stronger. You will achieve similarly absurd growths regardless of your power level with no diminishing return. Finally,this also allows you to absorb the very energy that powers spells and abilities used against you.

712,,600,Godlike,Fate/Grand Order Part 2,Source,"A step beyond being a calamity in your own right, with this Rank it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to call you an embodied global apocalypse. This is the scale of the most powerful of the gods of this Planet, not only allowing you great conceptual abilities but also absurd amounts of sheer raw power, both magical and physical. It’s at this level that you could be a threat to the World itself purely on your own, without any preparation being required. Depending on your powers, you might not even need to be actively hostile to anything to be a massive threat to all life on Earth.

The first example of this Rank is Tiamat, the great mother of Mesopotamia, who birthed the biosphere of Earth and was sealed after her duty was done. The source of her power is the Sea of Life, the conceptual origin of all life that emanates endlessly from her, and which generates magical energy to such a degree as to be functionally endless on top of being utterly immense. From the Sea of Life Tiamat can birth an arbitrary amount of new life of her design at rates of millions each second, who can be born with an innate and unbreakable loyalty to her, on top of being High Rank from birth. Perhaps with greater focus and investment she’d be able to create even stronger life? Those who come into contact with this Sea of Life are also corrupted by it, being remodeled to become a direct child of Tiamat, enforcing the same loyalty onto them.

And of course, she’s able to reform life, even herself, using the Sea of Life, such as turning a humanoid body into a massive draconic one. And finally, due to her status as the origin of all life, she is incapable of dying as long as anything is alive in the same plane of reality she is. Her defeat entailed several immensely powerful divine Noble Phantasms and the sacrifice of its users merely to slow her down, as well as throwing her into the Underworld which nullifies her unkillability thanks to being a land of the dead, and then King Hassan forcing the concept of death onto her, and finally a direct hit from Gilgamesh’s Ea after an intense battle to destabilize her Saint Graph enough for it to implode.

The second example of this Rank is Cernunnos, specifically the version of the nature god who accumulated 14,000 years of resentment and curses in the sixth Lostbelt. His physical form is more curse than flesh, being as conceptually thick as the mantle of the Earth, and just as physically tough, on top of swift regeneration of any wound. All of the curses he accumulated over millenia spill forth from him, not only being a mass of black hands composed of nothing but curses thick enough to be physical but also interfering with the minds of elementals and fairies, and any other being deeply connected to nature or the planet, in an area several hundred kilometers wider than the mass of curses itself, driving them insane and turning them into faceless Mors, all of which are High Rank regardless of the initial power of the victims.

Of course, the mass of hands that is the main composite of his curses can also spread to cover the whole planet given enough time, forming into a cursed forest of black hands that intercept anything flying too close. Anything touching the mass of curses is infected with its resentment, suffering damage that only becomes more severe the more curses one is infected with, especially with prolonged direct contact with the black hands. His defeat not only involved unique circumstances allowing travel back in time to before he wakes up, but an array of 12 Rhongomyniads to carve a hole into his body and reveal his Divine Core, as well as the utilization of the Black Barrel in Chaldea’s hands being shot directly into said core.

713,,600,Outside Power,Shin Megami Tensei 3: Nocturne,Source,"In this world of Demons, you may feel insecure about being a “Squishy Human”, or angry at your lack of personal agency. However, you will now be able to do what others in your position have done: obtain power without becoming a Demon! This can be done in one of two ways. Upon buying this Perk, you can choose one of two ways this will manifest:

1. Upon arriving in this world, you will quickly find an incredibly powerful Demon that has beliefs that aligns with your own. Unfortunately, it is either recently killed or in the process of dying. Upon seeing your shared beliefs, it will bestow its power upon you, in hopes that you can carry out its will for it and create a world build on the beliefs you both share. This will cause a large mutation within you for the duration of the Jump, such as an entire arm turning into a black tree-like limb and having your hair turn white. Post Jump, you can cause a similar situation to occur in any Jump you go to, although you will need to suffer mutations for the duration of that Jump as well.

2. You will arrive in an area that is full of wandering spirits and untapped power. You now have the ability to pull all of that power into yourself and force it to work for you. This will give you great power, but will force you to undergo mutations for the duration of the Jump. These mutations are along the lines of several moving faces on your chest. Post Jump, you can choose to appear in an area that is overflowing with the local variant of Power that flows through the world, and a hotspot of the weakest to the weak spirits and being made from that power. This perk will work on them, but do be aware that using this will will cause mutations for the duration of that Jump."
714,,600,Too Much is Never Enough,Final Fantasy XV Kingsglaive,Source,"As a soldier, each Glaive knows that the next battle could be the last. But even if the end is to come, it would only be fitting for a Glaive to face it with everything they have. As it is the Crystal that gives magic to the Glaive, it’s possible for the Glaive to draw upon more power...if they’re willing to sacrifice their life energy in exchange. Such is the exchange that a Glaive must be ready to commit to, in the worst case scenario.

Whenever you happen to be in a pinch, or whenever that extra burst of strength is absolutely necessary, you can intentionally sacrifice your life force in order to exchange it for a massive amount of magical energy. This isn’t merely limited to yourself, but your comrades fighting alongside you can similarly enter such a state in order to attain the strength they need.

While your magical strength does magnify substantially during this state of desperation, it’ll also constantly drain, as the power granted to you will exceed the limitations of your body. As long as that you retain even a shred of magical power however, your body won’t expire, though it may take a severe amount of punishment in the process. As your body effectively operates on magic while under the Crystal’s “blessing”, you’ll find that your body continues to perform at its peak regardless of what happens. Just don’t stick around once your magic reserves start to falter; if there is nothing left to consume, your body will revert to normal, in a much worse state than where you started off."
715,,600,Unlimited Growth,Diablo 3,Source,"One of the reasons the Nephalem were so feared, was that they seem to have no limits to their growth. Absolutely none, which means you can train endlessly and never hit your limits. As long as they defeat enemies, they gain more and more strength, power, speed, magic, health and everything else they are capable of which allows them to skip a lot of training and spares them a lot of time. The only problem with this is, that it only works when you defeat stronger enemies that could prove a problem to you. If you defeat a being weaker than you, you gain next to nothing from its death. So I would advise you to go search for real threats and challenges, if you want to improve massively in very short amounts of time.

In the case of the Butcher you could get his fangs, horns or his sense of smell. You will always gain something from your enemies that is applicable in combat even to a small degree.

More powerful than even most legendary heroes, you stand head and shoulders above most Servants, being an immensely powerful combatant in all respects unless your abilities have absolutely nothing to do with combat, and even then you might still be a massive danger in battle. Some good examples are the great hero Heracles in his Berserker form, boasting not only immense physical might but also the Godhand, a Noble Phantasm granting him conceptual immunity to attacks B rank or below, as well as 12 lives, allowing him to survive 12 deaths. Another good example would be Gawain, Knight of the Round Table and wielder of Excalibur Galatine, the sister-sword of Excalibur that can conjure great solar flames from the artificial sun embedded in its handguard. Gawain is also three times as strong during the day, the rays of the sun granting him near-invincibility compared to his peers. On the other hand, for beasts or other beings that wield raw might rather than the varied abilities of heroes, you’re among the greater legendary monsters, the kind of thing whose slaying tends to be the big iconic accomplishment of powerful heroes, such as dragons and fae.

719,,600,Top,Fate/Grand Order Part 1,Source,"You now stand at the top of power possible for Servants. Your legend is almost definitely one of the most impactful in human history, or at the very least one of the most well-known globally, even by the masses of the modern world. The sheer potency of your abilities is utterly overwhelming to those lesser than you now, as even with several High Rank Servants you could still win alone should you go all out and your opponents are not a group of Servants whose powers and abilities counter yours. Even in such a situation though, victory for your enemies would be far from certain.

Those at this level are few, so here will be four examples. Gilgamesh, King of Heroes and King of Uruk, is a Top Rank Servant. Wielding the Gate of Babylon, he has access to a treasury containing noticeably better versions of all man-made artifacts, objects, architecture, and so on, from past or future, as well as prototypes of nearly every Noble Phantasm wielded by Servants. Sha Naqba Imuru, the Omniscient Omnipotent Star, is merely a Noble Phantasm derived from Gilgamesh’s natural perception, letting him peer eons into the future, and see the truth of all things. Finally, Enuma Elish, the utilization of the Divine Construct Ea, rends apart reality itself.

Karna, the Hero of Charity, one of the most famous warriors of the Mahabharata, the Epic of the Bharat Dynasty, is a Top Rank Servant. He wears Kavacha and Kundala, a second skin of his granted from birth, that nullifies 90% of all damage dealt externally. And should he sacrifice Kavacha and Kundala due to a notable part of his legend, he can utilize Vasavi Shakti, one of the strongest Divine Constructs that obliterates all in the path of its beam, powerful enough to kill the gods themselves. Phantasmal Beasts, Divine Beasts, Shields, Fortresses, Bounded Fields, and even the most powerful Servants would all fall before the might of Karna’s spear.

King Arthur, truly called Artoria, King of Camelot and the Knights of the Round Table, is a Top Rank Servant. Artoria wields Avalon, a sheath providing swift regeneration and a defensive ability that conceptually places her in Avalon, simultaneously beyond the reach of all attacks while still being capable of attacking her opponents, as well as Excalibur, the crystallized hope of all beings on the Planet, designed to accelerate spiritrons to such an extent that it reaches an almost unmatched destructive capability, especially when wielded against invaders from beyond the Planet.

And finally, the First Hassan, Angel of Death, is a Top Rank Servant. With a powerful body strong enough to wrestle even fully grown True Dragons, he honed his abilities as a swordsman and assassin until his faith dragged him to the valley between life and death, wielding the very concept of death to instantly kill his opponents when the evening bell that signals death tolls, as well as bring a true end to even the deathless. Having become an incarnation of funeral rites, the First Hassan is closer to being an Angel of Death than a man, and not even those who lack the concept of death entirely are safe from the toll of the evening bell.

Your strength, whatever form it takes, will now match the sheer power of these legends among legends. Notably, special abilities that come with conditions attached, such as Karna having to give up K&K to use Vasavi Shakti and Artoria having to unlock all 13 seals on Excalibur to use its full power, can punch significantly above their weight class, so to speak. The harsher the conditions, the more powerful the special ability or artifact will be, as you can see with Vasavi Shakti and Excalibur. And, of course, as a beast or other unrefined monster, you can be counted among the ranks of Divine Beasts, or at least be comparable. In other words, the sort of embodied disaster that the gods themselves tend to throw at heroes that they despise, reshaping the landscape itself with your full strength. Your own history is likely among the most renowned epics in human history, and you are strong enough to be recognized by even the gods themselves for your strength. What purpose will you pursue, now that very little lies beyond you?

I hope that sad story has not repeated itself, the story of the Healer, one relating to the first King of Lucis, his fate was not pretty. Okay, anyone can face and break the fate, but let's help, you can easily go against the plot of the destiny chosen for you because you are the one who chooses your own destiny and can reset all future events that can be taken for granted, I told you that you could infect even the gods with dedication, now that's pretty much a certainty, after all, not only can you bend them to your will, you're also much more effective against them, your acts have little to do with you and your acts affect you a lot, you are a godslayer, you have a superhuman prowess that makes you considered a God in your own right; can temporarily halt time; fire beams of energy from your hands and summon a meteorite barrage; regarding the ability to absorb memories, well, technically you already absorbed a lot of them, so now you're an expert at everything: machines, cooking, war, you're not a master, but good luck finding something you don't know how to do. You already developed and can access a corrupted version of Armiger, including True Armiger, at any time, but it's still tiring.

722,,600,Promoted,Journey To The West,Source,"No longer are you weak and unremarkable. You have grown from your days of being a two-bit demon or a nameless spirit, and your abilities have grown significantly. You have learned the ways of combat well and your strength is such that you could use weapons that weigh one or two metric tons effectively in combat. Should you take this perk as a mortal for whatever reason you get these basic benefits and nothing else.

As a demon, your natural abilities are enhanced to the point you could wreck towns if you rampage, and are incredibly difficult to kill. You could shake mountains with your strikes and terrorize whole kingdoms on might alone. However, while your resistance to purifying effects is great but not insurmountable, and you’d best be careful around powerful Buddhists. Should you have purchased an affinity, you are now able to stretch it farther, able to learn powerful techniques with it such as a massive cage made of light. Not many are able to tell you what to do, and you are amongst the most free of the demons of the world.

As a god, you have obtained a greater rank in the bureaucracy of Heaven. Techniques and spells that command minor spirits no longer work on you. You command great respect and loyalty, and are given to important responsibilities. You have enough authority to call for torrential rain or hurricanes legally should your position be related to the weather, with other positions yielding greater bureaucratic authority over the natural world.

Additionally, gods obtain a few dozen specialized mystic tools and weapons, not quite treasures, that amplify your control over your domain. As an example, these would let dragon kings, who are in charge of the weather, cause torrential downpours, violent thunderstorms, or strong gales. Other positions you have in the celestial bureaucracy will yield other tools of similar power. They will be useless to anyone else, of course, as they are extensions of your being more than treasures, but it’s still possible to lose them whether out of negligence or robbery."
723,,600,Divine Herald,Generic Angels and Demons,Source,"You’re a particularly interesting mortal, at least, interesting enough to attract the attention of a specific deity that offered you to become their champion/herald. In addition to possessing enhanced strength, speed, and agility, above the likes of Captain America in a basic tier world, you also gain access to some of the divine abilities of your patron’s domain and receive a powerful divine weapon that is a conduit for your abilities and can harm most supernatural creatures regardless of their resistances, as well as also possessing a few minor enhancements which make it unusable by anyone other than you and allow you to call it back to you if you ever become separated from it. You can choose any god that exists in the world to be your patron and to gain abilities from, with some examples being like choosing Zeus to gain electrokinesis, atmokinesis and one of his Lightning Bolts or choosing Amaterasu to gain solar manipulation, pyrokinesis and a replica of her Kusanagi. Additionally, your deity may also communicate at will with you as well as grant you missions or additional abilities, maybe even strengthening you and granting you enough power to match some of the stronger angels and demons, as they see fit. Regardless of your chosen deity, your basic power level will be the same, but stronger deities might be more exigent with their missions and might grant you far more power than weaker ones. Post-jump, you’ll be able to communicate with alternative versions of your patron and even count as their champion if you wish for. Even if you decide to abandon your role as your patron’s champion, you’ll retain your abilities, weapons and basic power tier, but you’ll still also gain their animosity, so choose well who will be your patron.

Boosted: Well, I was wrong, as you were never a mortal. In truth, you’re a creation of your divine patron, one with the intent of serving as their avatar, born from their divinity given physical form and life. Normally, a deity’s avatar would only serve as their vessel or puppet to interact with the mortals, but, as a consequence of the primordial fragment inside you, you ended up becoming your own, independent being. Fortunately, your newfound independence didn’t bother your patron, as they decided to give you freedom and allowed you to still be their champion. 

Due to your nature as a former avatar of your deity instead of merely their herald or champion, your physical and mystical attributes, including the divine abilities of your patron’s domain, will be enhanced even further, surpassing even the Kings of the Ars Goetia and reaching the level of the weaker Seraphim. Additionally, due to being made from their divine essence itself, you'll also have authority over the servants of your deity and the beings related to their domains, like being able to control mermaids and sea beasts if you’re Poseidon’s avatar for example, as long as their own power over said domain don’t surpass yours.

Post-jump, you’ll be able to communicate with alternative versions of your patron and even have the status of their former avatar if you wish for. Lastly, for the sake of classification, while you aren’t actually a deity, you already count as a divine being yourself.

724,,600,Born From the Beyond,Generic Angels and Demons,Source,"Beyond mere spiritual beings, there are weirder existences lurking in the vastness of space, such beings whose very existence defies the rules of nature and are defined by their disregard for the natural laws of the universe as we usually understand them and by spreading destruction and madness wherever they go. While some of these strange eldritch abominations are completely from both sides of the Great War, there are also cases where the line that separates the eldritch and the demonic becomes blurred, and it’s from one of such cases you’re descended from, instead of from another mere demon from Hell. Your foolish human parent, either because of worship or wish for power, mated with one of such terrifying creatures, an eldritch entity that is closer in nature and power to the demon you’ve had previously chosen to be your inhuman parent.

As a result of you being a sort of eldritch variation of the “regular” Cambion, you gain access to your parent’s unnatural abilities, allowing you to wield eldritch energy, the power capable of corroding bodies and minds alike, in the same way as handle demonic power, as well as being innately resistant to insanity and madness, allowing you to see the true forms of eldritch beings around your power level, meaning that you’ll have no problem at all seeing lesser beings but you won’t be able to see Outer Gods without losing your mind as you’re now. You'll also gain the ability to tear through the veil of reality to make rifts, which allows teletransportation through different locations and summoning of star spawns of varying power and size that can be described by mortals as nightmares given forms. Weaker star spawns can be controlled through your eldritch/demonic power, but any of them whose power is at least on par with yours will be free to do whatever they want, so unless you want to spread chaos and madness, I advise you to avoid summoning them if you can’t control them. Lastly, your strange physiology makes you far harder to actually kill than other Cambions of your level, giving you enough durability to stay alive for a few minutes before requiring healing even if your brain is pierced by something like a spear.

Boosted: Your eldritch physiology predates the logic of how reality works in a weirdly similar manner as the piece of Darkness of the Abyss within you also predates creation itself. This darkness became the fuel to enhance your growth and evolution, resulting in your eldritch/demonic half growing far stronger than it was before, resulting in your ascension as a complete Eldritch Entity, gaining power on par with a harbinger of the end of the days on their Beast form, as well as physically becoming an abomination whose very presence have the possibility of driving mortals near you insane or even destroying their minds if their wills aren’t strong enough in the case of them actually seeing you. You’ll be able to freely customize your new form within the “limits” of an eldritch abomination’s form. Unfortunately, such power has a huge price. The godlike power you gained is only accessible in your True Body, which is by default contained within an isolated pocket dimension beyond space and time, with your current body becoming only your avatar to allow you to interact with the mortal universe. Your avatar is exactly as strong as you were previously, but, if it’s killed, your actual body will remain intact in the pocket dimension and you’ll be able to rebuild it after a month, with the only way to actually destroy you being to directly confront the true “you” in your personal dimension. Due to your nature as a higher existence and thus unable to fully operate/enter in the lower planes, you can only partially manifest your True Body from your avatar a few minutes each month, but, theoretically, it’s possible to discover some eldritch ritual to allow the complete manifestation of your True Body, temporarily or maybe even permanently, but it’ll need decades of focused research.

And you, my friend, are akin to the physical embodiment to one of the seven sins/virtues, thus having abilities related to the manipulation and control over it, including the ability of inducing it on others and being strengthened by it. An example of this is choosing. Those aligned with Heaven will be restricted to only the seven virtues while those aligned with Hell will be restricted to only the seven sins, although the ones with other affiliations may freely choose any of the fourteen traits to represent. However, such a limitation is lifted if you take the Light Is Not Good toggle, as the line that separates virtue and sin becomes blurred, allowing those aligned with Heaven to represent a sin and those aligned with Hell to represent a virtue."

Whatever the reason, it seems you have a great deal of supernatural power-such that even at a young age, with good guidance and some time to master your talents you could challenge some of the most formidable Realm Lords out there. You have a great deal of latitude to determine the nature and specialities of your powers, although overall you are an equal to Orphea: Who fights to free the Raven Court from her father’s conquest despite inheriting power over darkness and chaos which she manifests through demon-like spirits shaped from her subconscious thoughts. Though this comes with little skill, pity those who underestimate you. For all his demigod-like power, if all goes well the Raven Lord himself could find himself bested by a small girl in coming events."
727,,600,Touch of a Higher Power,Heroes of the Storm,Source,"Some of the greatest heroes of Azeroth attracted the positive attention of a deific being at some point or other-and obtained many great and unique powers from them. As Elune’s high priestess for example, Tyrande’s lunar magic is particularly powerful while Thrall’s close communion with the planet has made his shaman magic significantly greater. And you too were greatly endowed with divine power by one of Azeroth’s deities that offers you a far greater range of offensive, defensive and supportive supernatural effects reflecting their nature. Depending on your other choices this may also augment your innate powers. Alexstrasza for example was endowed with power by the titan Eonar-and as a dragon benefiting from the Titan’s blessing as well, you could stand before her as an equal. Do note that while the full depths of such blessings are hard to quantify, that whoever you choose as your benefactor the benefits gained are roughly equal but with different specialities.

As an aside, while this iteration of Alexstrasza lacks the full godlike power of her main canon Azeroth counterpart she is still quite a force to be reckoned with. For one thing, as dragon her natural form is a gigantic red flying firebreathing reptile that can easily crush a man- though it seems her innate durability isn’t enough to easily shrug off the weapons of notable Overwatch heroes. However, she is highly resistance to “stun” or “slow” type debuffs and her mastery of Life lets her fiery breath heal her allies even as it harms her enemies. Not limited to cones of flame, she can spit a focused fireball for more concentrated damage and send foes reeling with a strong beat of her wings. She can also trade her own lifeforce to sustain her allies, plant seeds that heal those nearby and bind herself to another so they both heal rapidly. After being empowered by the Nexus, both the fury of her flames and her healing powers simply become far, far greater-letting her effortlessly do the effect of many of her healing techniques without expending her reserves, and granting an ally far greater vitality than they would naturally have."

Doing so makes yourself greater, akin to gaining authorities. Fenrir with such an ability feasted on half of Nifheim, commanding mighty ice and frost as a result. Even a deities corpse, when consumed, will give you such benefits, the Surtr of a parallel World robbing Fenrir’s own ice from his corpse.

The greatest gains through this ability comes from eating ever greater prey. A single normal human would grant you next to nothing. But a Servant? One of those could boost your power proportionally. By consuming enough you could even break bindings upon your very being, as a Servant even a Master first struggling and eventually failing to control you."

Artifacts of great power, legendary magical spells, political leverage, and many more will inevitably fall into your lap.

The user and master of the gem, yourself, is able to draw out the energy and power of those sealed within and wield it as their own. The gem itself can also unleash immense blasts of power and heat by drawing on the power or, provided the target is either weak enough or has been defeated already, seal even more people into the weapon for eternity. It’s also possible to have the Trapezohedron shift into a weapon form, a double ended blade that cat slice through space itself and leave unhealing wounds.

Whenever you are in a magical contract or bond to receive power or are drawing on the power within a magical item, you can draw out more and more of the full power that you should have access to, even if it is not willingly given or has been sealed away. Thus a god who granted you a portion of their power would feel the rest of their might slowly drain into you and a magical item that gave you a measure of the magic contained within would slowly unlock and grant you the rest, even if you do not fulfil the normal requirements to do so. Best of all, this drain prevents these contracts from being broken save by any originally agreed methods and prevents artefacts from stopping their transfer of power to you."

But with that same power in your hand, you have the freedom to choose what path it shall take.

Black Magic bends to your will, and with it you can even affect small celestial bodies as the legendary originator did. So as long as you can sustain the massive strain of wielding it, for a short period of time you can extract all of the magic within yourself and bring it forth to bear in a massive well of energy. All your spells cast during this time will strike a wide area – and even your companions nearby can draw on your pool of magic should you permit it."

These Ultimates, as they’re called, can be pretty much anything, but they usually represent the culmination of one of your skill sets, and it’s –usually- a particularly powerful spell or attack, but I’m letting you figure out the specifics. The best part about the Ultimate however is not their power –even if it’s considerable- but the fact that you don’t actually pay to use them! Instead, you build a pool of power by fighting. When the pool is full, you can unleash one of your Ultimates without having to spend magicka or stamina. In future Jumps, you can link similar final spells or techniques to your Ultimate pool. Doing so neutralizes any cost they have at the price of emptying your Ultimate pool."
735,,600,Draconic Life Force,Akame ga Kill!,Source,"One of the main examples of the Super Class Danger Beasts, the Tyrant was an extremely powerful draconic beast known for its insatiable hunger and possession of an incomparable life force so formidable that granted it the ability to evolve its body and adapt to its environment, which, combined with its normally nomadic lifestyle, resulted in the individual Tyrant whose flesh was used to create the Incursio to develop and accumulate several different abilities during its life. Even if you aren’t actually a Tyrant or even some other kind of draconic beast, you also possess its incomparable life force and powerful adaptability, allowing your body to adapt and possibly develop new powers or abilities to deal with the environment, with dangers and with actual damage, with more exposure to said threats decreasing the time needed to adapt against them, which normally is of few hours but can be decreased to a few minutes or even seconds at beast.

Such adaptations may range from mere alterations in your physiology to survive in harsh environments, like gaining fur and other traits to acquire a better heat retention to survive in the coldest arctic tundras, up to even outright evolving to acquire the ability to move normally even if time itself is frozen, as more specific adaptations will tend to be more powerful than more broader ones. Additionally, your adaptability will also respond to your emotions, as evolving in a battle to counter a specific individual you hate will be far more effective than evolving to simply survive in an environment, and also to your stance on how to deal with the threat, as you may evolve to develop a bigger and stronger body to fight off suppression forces if you want to face them directly or you may adapt stealth abilities if you want to elude them.

Boosted: Your life force is so powerful that it’s able to remain in your body even after your death, giving an opportunity to cheat it if you play your cards well. If you’re out of 1-up bonus, you may choose to transfer your life force and soul to parts of your still-living flesh, either it was recently consumed by other beings (at least on the level of an average human) or it was implanted on them somehow, giving you a chance to be reborn by growing and evolving through consuming their strong emotions until you eventually manage to overtake their body or find a way to rebuild your original body outside them, in the same way as Tyrant will be reborn through Incursio and Tatsumi’s body. Alternatively, if you know the means to create weapons and armor suits out of living materials, these items will attempt to grow and possess their users the more they’re wielded by them, until you’re reborn through them in the same way as before. However, there is a limitation, if you don’t manage to be reborn until the end of the jump, you’ll count as a permanent death and it’ll be a Chain-fail.

Each enhancement stacks with previous enhancements to that attribute and the only way to lose one of these enhancements is if your random mutations replace it with a better or more comprehensive version of itself. There is no limit to how much you can grow from these progressive mutations, and very rarely you may gain a minor enhancement to a power born from your genetics or biology. However, the enhancement from one day to the next, while noticeable, will be negligible. It’s only over an extended period of time that you’ll see significant growth.

It’s hard to gauge exactly how much stronger, but Uranos is noted to be a perfect match in every regard for the Omega Level Mutant Legion and shrugged off planet-busting and god-obliterating energy blasts with only his own personal collection of WMDs being shown to do any real damage to him. This is on top of being perhaps the greatest creator of advanced weapons on Earth. If you’re an Eternal, that’s the level of power you have, as well as the equivalent of a million years of practice and experience divided among your various powers, skills, and abilities from this jump and also assorted mundane abilities. If you belong to another Race and take this perk, you have a similar proportionate improvement over an average member of your race but the same equivalent in experience.

Uranos isn’t the strongest of Earth’s Eternals, however. That would be his brother, Kronos.

This boost transforms you into a similar deific cosmic entity. First and foremost, you are both a God outright and a Cosmic Entity, with corresponding enhancements to your physiology and metaphysical existence placing you slightly above where you would be with the Patriarch Perk. Second, you are imbued with all the cosmic and mystical power of a God. An Eternal with this perk alone would, like Kronos, have the power to rival Zeus or Odin. Another race, lacking innate cosmic power, wouldn't be quite as strong and would more closely resemble a young Thor, sans Mjolnir. You also gain a Divine Authority, a connection to some concept, that using your power for is far easier similar to the Role granted by Purposefully Made, and if you have that perk the effects combine multiplicatively whenever your Role and Authority overlap. As a cosmic entity, you may optionally have a cosmic appearance that can be toggled on and off post-jump. Unlike Kronos, you don’t have a mortal version of you still hanging around somewhere.

743,,600,Sword Logic ,The Destiny Universe,Source,"Envisioned by Oryx, the Taken King, Sword Logic is an ascendant philosophy founded upon a simple principle: Existence is the struggle to exist, and anything that cannot protect itself from defeat should rightfully be destroyed by that which is stronger. This was seen in practice by the act of killing one’s enemy - by successfully killing that enemy, the practitioner therefore proves they were stronger than that enemy, and thus gains that power in reality. This was seen best when Oryx slew his sisters Xivu Arath and Savathun in their throne worlds, proving he was mightier and more cunning than them respectively, and then finally slew his Worm God, proving he was mightier than it, and thus deserving of communing with the Darkness directly, as only the Worms could. It is through this logic that the Hive gain their strength, from the lowliest thrall to the highest Gods. This logic, though intrinsic to the Hive and capable of being practiced by others with any modicum of paracausal power, is now yours.

By killing your enemies, you prove that you are stronger than them. By doing this, no matter the gulf that may have existed between the two of you, you take their power for yourself and grow as a result. This can range from the minuscule vermin infinitely beneath you to gods that would seem for all the world more powerful than you - killing them inevitably adds to your strength, but the stronger the opponent, the more power you acquire. Note that this requires a true death - killing a Guardian would only add to your power should you also kill their Ghost, just as the same would be true for any similarly immortal foe you face: They must be killed, their right to exist challenged and proven inadequate, their life snuffed out forever, for you to have truly proven yourself the stronger.

Finally, by purchasing this perk with CP, when you leave this Jump and the confines of the world in which the Logic was originally created, you can alter it - but only to a point. After completing this jump, engaging in combat and defeating an opponent at all will count as victory through the Sword Logic, regardless of if you choose to end their life or spare them.

The intrinsic paracausal abilities of Sword Logic are as simple as the logic itself: By proving yourself through the Sword Logic, you grow in strength, eventually leading to the point where you are no longer bound by physical law - your will, your power, your logic, allows you to violate them at will, from the merest paracausal tricks to cutting reality with your sword and traveling between stars - you may not be strong enough to destroy the universe, but you are nevertheless stronger than the universe. However, your growth nevertheless is linear - you only grow in increments, no matter how large or small. Even should these increments be constant through your system of tithes, they nevertheless remain linear.

That is no longer an issue. You are self-defining, your blade self-sharpening. You find that no matter what you kill, their strength isn’t just added to yours, it is also added to your growth. Killing a hundred thralls would be barely a drop in the endless ocean of your strength before, but now killing those thralls adds to your strength and causes you to grow that much faster from then on. This increased growth is additive, not multiplicative - killing a single thrall would make you grow only so much faster, whereas killing a Hive God, or one of the Witness’ Disciples, would add their strength to your own, and add that same number to how fast you grow to begin with. You will find in no time at all that your mastery of the Sword Logic can catapult you further past anything even the Taken King could have dreamed of, and as you continue to kill, you will only grow faster still.

744,,600,Adapted Sword Logic,The Destiny Universe,Source,"The normal Hive makes use of Sword Logic through an appropriately brutal way: By applying paracausal principles to ideas, and then challenging the ideas of others, whoever wins the ensuing conflict is proven right. The problem with that theory was made apparent when the Young Wolf killed its ultimate practitioner and then refused his power. The philosophy of the Sword Logic is a lie, and be you a Human-offshoot or Lucent Hive Risen, you understand this - but so too do you understand that there’s something to learn from it. So long as your Ghost is still around, dying is only a roadblock to you, not the end of the road - you could keep applying the Sword Logic as much as necessary and grow your power in a way that doesn’t require a complete lack of mistakes. Where the Osmium Dynasty had to protect their souls deep inside of throne worlds in case they lost their one chance you can just get up and go again.

By applying the principles of the Sword Logic to the Light, you’ve found a slow but linear means of growing your power. The phrase ‘what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger’ is writ law for you. Every single fight, every single conflict, whether or not you emerge victorious, whether or not you even live through it, adds to your power. You won’t go from thrall to ascendant god in a day, a year, or even a decade, but that’s just fine - you need only time, and thanks to the Light, that is something you have in abundance.

Boosted: Adapted Bomb Logic

Or maybe you’ve gone a step further? Oryx conceived of an idea that, when filtered through the ascendant plane, became a fact of the universe: By challenging others in combat, and emerging victorious, your vision of the world was immutable, and theirs, wrong. Mara Sov envisioned a counter-philosophy, one cemented in planning and cooperation. You understand that by the creation of more than one paracausal philosophy, as well as the fact that one can soundly disprove the other, that it is not only possible for anyone with paracausal power to exert their will on the universe, but there are no true rules governing such a thing. You understand that you do not need to follow a trail laid by someone else, when you can instead blaze your own.

You now have the ability and the understanding necessary to create your own paracausal philosophy. You can establish your own set of rules and ideals that contribute to a single ‘logic’ that can alter or add to the fundamental fabric of the universe. This isn’t simple, localized reality warping, as is allowed by those who can utilize the Light and the Darkness, but rather an addition to the rules that govern the universe - from as simple as ‘any who conduct warfare generate power for me’ to as complex as Mara Sov’s philosophy of Bomb Logic, and even further beyond: You have the ability to set rules that the universe must follow. Just be wary that no matter how simple or complex your philosophy may be, they are not immutable, and you are not infallible - those who are stronger than you can challenge your philosophy, and should they defeat it, you may find it evaporates in front of you.

The greatest who’s ever lived, and the greatest who ever will. Every trait, from your body to your mind to your spirit, is enhanced spectacularly, so that you represent the maximum potential of your heritage.

The exact results of this vary depending on your specific race. A human would be like the greatest scientists, athletes, sages, and public speakers all rolled into one. A Qys would resemble the massive Kingqueen, a mass of phosphorescent, nigh-invulnerable flesh the size of an apartment building, supremely sentient, and locked in perpetual ecstacy without sacrificing the ability to interact with your surroundings. A Warpsmith would be the fifth black Warpsmith, one of the original members of their race who created all others. A sentient biocomputer approaching the Qys Kingqueen in size and possibly the most intelligent beings in the universe, you would rule the Confederacy of Gulf Worlds with your three surviving kin. On top of the physical and mental boosts, an evolved human would boast all the disparate skills of Miracleman, Kid Miracleman, and Miraclewoman, while a Child of Heaven would be on par with Winter, greater than all of your half-siblings and allowing you to fine tune your aura to replicate any technology you understand. This applies to any form you take, your soul drawing from your genetic memory to become the definitive example of your species.

This perk grants you the Strength of Heracles, Speed of Atlanta, Intelligence of Perseus, Cleverness of Odysseus, and a lesser version of “Nemean Pelt” that is similar to Achilles granting you the same durability as the perk but you must choose a point on your body that will be your Achilles heel, and finally you can choose one mundane craft that you are exceptionally skilled at medicine would put you on a level similar to Aslepius who was able to bring the recently deceased back to life."
750,,600,Seed of Evil,Scion ,Source,"It is hubris on the gods’ part to think their gifts cannot be improved by their forbearers. This extends even to the creation of Scions themselves, something certain Titan avatars may soon prove willing to experiment with. Your origins were probably rather dark, considering how a misanthropist like Gran Bois would probably treat his partner-let alone the lecherous Ran or solipsistic Aten. And through them, you are now the Scion of a Titan Avatar with the same potential for power and independence as the Scions of the Gods, and optionally the form of a human if you did not already have it. Not only do your Purviews reflect your parent’, but you have access to the Epic Attributes of the gods. You do require the trophies of other Titanspawn to use your Purviews at first, though. Finally, you gain power with remarkable speed compared to your god-sired brethren-and certainly far faster than most Titanspawn.

Like many gifts of the Titans this gift is a poisoned chalice; mastering your Purviews tends to come with a monstrous twist to your powers. And whether in the form of living snake hair from mastering the Animal Purview or the innate power to add thunderclaps from mastering the Sky while this does grant additional capabilities, it also tends to err towards making it easier to endanger other mortals. Furthermore, you can rapidly accelerate the growth of your divine powers by succumbing to the Vices of the Titans-to the extent fully replacing one Virtue with a Vice would immediately increase your Legend at will. As for what happens at the point of apotheosis, it’s...admittedly somewhat unclear whether your destiny is to be made in your parent’s image or that of the gods. On the one hand, nominally you should grow into your parents’ image as a Titan Avatar but then again Loki was once an ancient Titanspawn himself before defecting to the Aesir’s alliance. Whether you grow up to be a new facet of your Greater Titan or a god in your own right is largely for you to discover. Your intimate connection to dark, primal urges will persist in future worlds in which you will find it easier to gain or improve divine power of all sorts by listening to your inner lizard brain. May the heavens have mercy on those who get in your way, for should you crave power you’ll likely have none."
751,,600,Adoptive Legacy,Scion ,Source,"Not all Scions are truly born of their pantheons. Some, sired by other gods, are ritualistically claimed by others with their consent for one reason or another. Usually the original deity’s legacy disappears and is overwritten by another’s but...something seems different, in your case. You have miraculously retained the Purviews of another deity-your true parent-in addition to those of the pantheon member who claimed you, including their pantheon-specific Purview. Where Purviews overlap with your true parent’s, you master them by leaps and bounds compared to your peers. This is not just an opportunity to be an Olympian-Aesir hybrid, but incorporate the legacy of a more obscure Pantheon or one fallen on hard times such as the refugee Sumerian or Mesopotamian deities. Little is known about their pantheon-specific purviews, though feel free to draw from the listed examples for inspiration.

And if taken as a Titanspawn, this does inexplicably make you an equal to your Scion half-siblings in every way. Try not to think too hard about how a Hydra ends up on the Celestial Bureaucracy, the myths sure didn’t."
752,,600,Rétt-ligr,Germanic/Norse Mythology,Source,"You are the embodiment of all the fear, hatred, envy, greed, anger, and negativity that is directed toward you. Quite literally, you hold lesser domains and personifications to a vast number of negative aspects from poison, venom, illness, plague, death and decay, to malice, shadows, darkness, sorrow, hate, war, anger and so forth. All those negative feelings, if directed at you personally, empowering you and making you stronger, the norse gods do not need worship to be mighty and neither do you, but you will grow mighter in every aspect from these negative forces and can substitute these feelings for genuine worship in all areas.

You are an endless well from which these emotions may be drawn either by yourself or others. All of this darkness manifests as a curse upon any who would harm you, any being that brings harm to you in any way , either directly or indirectly, will be cursed to the same level of injury or maybe even a bit more. If you would be cut, they receive an equally detrimental injury. If they harmed your child, they and their children may be struck with bad luck and illness. But should you be killed by the influence of another or kill yourself as a sacrifice, you may declare a death curse in response. This death curse will kill anything, normally being instant, if a being is equal in power and yet has protections your curse will take no longer than nine days, a lesser being with protections may take nine hours or a greater being nine months or even up to nine years, nine months, nine days, and nine hours..., but the curse will kill them no matter who or what they are accordingly.

Boosted: People in this world really don't understand the big picture or their place in it, but you have an idea, a general sense of the great tapestry so to speak. Wherever you go, you now have the ability to see the great tapestry of the world and the machinations behind it. Like all that is black within the world you act as a great tide bringing the world back to its roots or sweeping aside the chaff for a new beginning. All the powers and abilities that you possess of darkness, death, poison, destruction, and so forth can now be applied equally within the realms of healing, love, growth, flowers, joy, creation, and life. The inverse is also true and your powers have expanded to make you a minor deity and personification of change, decline, renewal, and revolution. It would suck if your powers, abilities, and weapons also discriminated, I would dare say that it might be a bit hypocritical of those gifts. So, your powers don't discriminate unless you want them to do so per their normal function. Have a spell that can only resurrect or heals humans? Now it will bring back dogs, cats, dinosaurs, elfs, robots, even gods if they are within your realms of power, whatever else you want to include within a category. Engineered a plague that only kills people with brown hair, well now it can be just as effective against blondes. You are the great equalizer.

753,,600,Golden Apple,A Wild Last Boss Appeared!,Source,"Normally, the process of gathering mana from death foes is a tedious and inefficient process. Only those with extremely long lifespans and an obsession for battle may hope to reach the heights of the 400 level, and the greatest freaks may be able to reach the level 600 after centuries of single minded killing. After all, it would be a pretty scary world if everyone could just easily get to the level of the boss monsters.

You, however, possess a method that defies the common sense of this world. By gathering around yourself the mana of those recently killed, that 90 percent of mana (experience) that would go back to the world can instead be condensed into a golden colored apple. And thus, whoever eats that apple will gain all the mana (experience) absorbed by it. It should also be possible to absorb other ambient mana in the same area, as in the one that isn’t being used to maintain active spells, but usually you wouldn’t find enough of it in the air to create worthwhile Golden Apples.

This is a method that the original Flugels were able to use in order to purify the world from the high amount of mana that existed in the air, a method that the Goddess Alovenus took away from there after the fall of their first civilization. For some reason, your constitution has manifested this trait, which not only allows you to form Golden Apples, but also increases the absorption rate of mana of defeated foes, allowing you to gain ten times more experience per kill than any regular person would by absorbing the full liberated mana from the foes that you personally kill. Keep in mind that if you absorb their full mana into yourself, then you won’t have anything to form Golden Apples from."

Like Maple, you have the best luck when it comes to stumbling across skills and rare equipment. People willing to train you in a mystical lost art, angels that grant you a part of their power, lost mystical artifacts - all that will fall into your hands as you adventure. But not for free and not without you looking for it. It also works better when you’re open to different possibilities about what you want, and not specifically looking for something.

And these require their own level of effort once found to get. That angel will only show up once you heal the sick child they were keeping alive. That master of a mystic art will only train you once you prove your determination. That key you found unlocks a boss fight three floors higher that you need to beat to get that artifact.

Nothing you get is unreasonably powerful for the world it belongs to, but still useful to you in some manner. These new skills and equipment tend to synergize very well with an existing part of your powers or equipment.

You can also let your friends benefit from this - that cave you pointed out to them might have their own adventure for them with its own reward, or that random ring you gave them might be critical to a quest that ends up patching a hole in their capabilities."

For starters, this has given you great strength and durability, flight that’s supersonic in an atmosphere and relativistic in a vacuum. The Annihilation War won’t happen until 2006, so you don’t hold the entirety of the Nova Force, nor are you host to the Xandarian Worldmind. That being said, you’re no slouch. You could physically throw down with the likes of the Hulk and Thor, put out energy easily capable of blasting through buildings, and fly across a galaxy in hours. But you don’t necessarily need to fly. As you gain mastery over the Nova Force, you might learn to create space gates (portals) and influence gravity to an extent."
758,,600,The Hunger Cosmic,Marvel Zombies,Source,"The death knell of the universe (that is, the Earth-2149 one) came about when the Silver Surfer came to Earth, followed by his master. Though a lot of zombies died trying to eat the surfer, he eventually became lunch for a lucky few. Those fortunate enough to get a share found that the surfer’s master’s hunger lived on within them, empowering them with a fraction of the power cosmic. Then it happened again after they got in a lucky shot and ate Galactus whole. Galactus was dead, and in his place were the Zombie Galacti, who proved to be far, far worse than their predecessor.

This phenomenon has extended to you as well. “You are what you eat” has taken on a whole new quality, as you now absorb the power of beings you eat and take it for yourself. In short, for every being you devour, you take their strength and permanently add it to your own. While superhuman having an ordinary joe for dinner won’t get much of a boost, gobbling down somebody like an ultrapowerful alien from outer space will see your power grow by leaps and bounds. The amount of power gained depends on how much you manage to scarf down - if you eat the Silver Surfer whole, you’ll gain all the Power Cosmic he’d ever been granted, but sharing with somebody else will net you a smaller share. You are what you eat."
759,,600,Live Forever,Marvel Zombies,Source,"People don’t stay in the world forever. They pass on. But they live on in the hearts of those whose lives they’ve touched. Their deeds are their monuments. But an inspiring figure, like a superhero, might live on in another way.

You’ve got that sort of willpower, nobility of being, and charisma that so many of this world’s heroes held at their best. Your charisma and force of personality is that of a leader that Earth’s Mightiest Heroes or another powerful group would follow to the bitter end through sheer admiration - in short, think Captain America. The confidence to inspire people, to earn their respect and bring out the very best in everyone. Your actions seem to have an enlarged effect on the world - whether it’s through your ability to inspire the remaining masses or fate itself, they’ve got more effect than they should. If you dedicate yourself to a cause, like rebuilding society and destroying all zombies, things will just go your way. You’ll find enough people to repopulate, come up with plans to cure the plague (or just wipe every zombie off the face of the universe), and unite everyone who’s still alive behind your goal. Maybe you’ll die in the process. Maybe you won’t. But your ideals will persist, and you will live on in the people you’ve inspired.

But it’s not fair for only you to live on this way, is it? Others too have achieved much before their deaths. But as long as there’s one who’s willing to stand for what they stood for, they’ll live on. And so will their power. In you. If a being of power falls in your presence then their power will be bequeathed to you. There are a few caveats to this. The person must approve of you, or at least, have approved of you if they’d met you. You won’t be getting the Ant-Man suit if you’re somebody Hank Pym would despise in every way. And this works far better with items of power than actual superpowers (unless they can be transferred). If Iron Man or Thor fell (through death or zombification), the armor or the hammer would fall into your hands by default. But you’re far less likely to be hit by the same kind of cosmic rays that created the Fantastic Four if they bit it."

You are able to imbue your emotions, desires and dreams into your abilities or attacks, granting them increased power and even unique additional traits based on what emotion you are using and the strength of that emotion. Be careful which you use as some can backfire. Fear can be used to grant power but a strike made that is filled with fear can never finish a fight, not in the way you desire."

When you hold it you will find your own magical powers amplified, any magic you possess at least twice as strong as it ordinarily would be, potentially causing it to evolve in a substantive way, such as making resurrection magic not require an intact corpse or allowing days instead of hours, making your illusions fool all the senses instead of just audio and visual ones, or allowing you to transform entire groups as easily as you would have a single man. This magical amplification even applies to potions mixed within it or drunk from it. With this even a middling mage could challenge a master and win. Even in the hands of one who did not know or practice magic themselves, the Goblet could be used to perform a variety of magical effects; this will not match a practitioner in any Low or High Magic in their field, or the potions of a Potion Maker, but it is possible. There is still a mental fatigue in using it this way. The goblet itself is indestructible at least to the forces of this world."

More than that though, when those odds really start climbing, you find that your strength starts climbing too. It’s never going to scale to match, it’s not a heroic tale if you beat these odds with ease, but the greater the opponent and the disaster you face, in comparison to you, the stronger you’ll become. Find yourself facing a few dozen priests at once? Your body seems to miraculously restore its stamina at the start of the fight and you can push yourself just a little harder. A Bishop standing in your way? Your body will feel stronger than it should possibly be and you’ll find wells of energy you didn’t think you had. And if Zeus himself, or another High God, descended to stomp you into the ground? You’d be able to pull out every single bit of power and effort you had at least twice over to try and give yourself a chance. There is a limit to this however. You can only withstand so much of this boost, even against the great odds you might face, and if you try to draw too much power from you, you might irrevocably damage your body or spirit. What’s the point of beating the bad guy if you die in the process and never get to see your happy end?

Boosted: So you beat the bad guy. Triumphed against all odds. But what was the point if that desperate battle if what you were fighting for was lost? You'll find that now, things have an odd way of working out if you won the climactic fight. Collateral damage was not nearly as bad as it may have appeared, reconstruction efforts go ahead smoothly and easily. Unless they were directly killed in the fight, your loved ones would never be hurt. Even when it really should not be possible, it seems like things lead strongly towards a happy end for you with even the slightest chance of happening, so long as you managed to actually win.

Your body is unnaturally enduring as well, allowing you to survive wounds that would quickly kill a human, such as multiple gaping sword wounds, for much longer periods of time, though a thorough opponent can still kill you by destroying your organs or dealing a truly brutal beating. You may not be as powerful as your pseudo sibling Ilyasviel but you also lack the limited lifespan her increased power placed upon her, instead your lifespan remains unchanged from a humans. Also unlike your sibling, you are not just an imprint of Justeaze's personality and memories on a new body, though neither do you possess the Wish Granting Trait as a sacrifice. You may optionally choose the albinism-like colouring Ilyasviel possessed.

Why, then, is it still a thing? The answer to that is  simple: Sheer and utter Apathy. A force that killed more people than any hatred and Evil ever could. Of course, as something which kills so much Is it … not a vile thing as well? Well, I dunno. For you though, the answer is yes, and a clear yes at that. Now, every act of Apathy becomes an act of Evil as far as you’re concerned … Though not exactly a great one. In essence, so long as you do not care about at least some of the things happening around you, any powers which rely on Evil or sin don’t diminish, and even grow a bit, albeit at an incredibly slow rate. However, there do need to be things around you which you can ignore: Just sequestering yourself in a cave won’t let this perk work. In fact, it works best if you live an ordinary life, with its ups and downs, just like you did before you came down here And isn’t that funny? ..."

Granting about 0.1% increase in power per “Naughty” act. Also, for some reason, you can fight just as well when pole dancing, stripping, exotic dancing, having sex, or doing drugs as you could when not doing any of that.

Or at least something close to it. Inside of you, a second set of heartbeats can be heard whenever you close your eyes. Regular people can’t see it due to the incorporeal nature of the Monarchs, but those with fine magical senses may be able to perceive its presence. Besides the creepy experience, this Heart grants you two boons: the first one is that it will give you an increased massive pool of mana, the increase being 100,000 Mana Points, at least the same Mana Points as the Shadow Monarch had, to be added on top of whatever your current mana pool is. This amount of mana would be enough for even a National Rank Hunter to be casting spells or using magical abilities all day without running out of mana as it regenerates.

The second benefit that it grants is that in case you are killed, this second heart will not perish with you, but instead it will keep beating on its own, regenerating you back to full health, preventing your actual death, and granting a minor temporary boost in strength after the resurrection. This effect can only be used once every jump or once every 10 years, whichever comes sooner.

This heart is similar to the Shadow Heart within Jin-Woo and will be completely loyal to you, never threatening to reincarnate its former self through you and instead being fully assimilated into your being as a natural part of yourself."

Unlike him, your personal source of power is not tied to The System, but it is capable of supplying power for all your abilities. What this means is that your abilities can be trained without limit, allowing you to draw more and more from your personal reserves, going past your previous limits the more you use each of your powers, making them improve and grow with you.

Keep in mind that while this ‘abyss’ is endless, you still need to give yourself an actual challenge to maintain a stable grow. After all, you can’t expect a lion to train its fangs by squashing ants."

For most beings that have magical energy, they’ve got a max that they won’t replenish their energy past, like how a water bottle can only hold so much water. You’re a little different. While you still have that maximum capacity for replenishment, you’ve got a much, much larger temporary store. You very slowly add magical energy to this store and the energy remains there for good until used. You cannot artificially add to this store but it will increase in the speed of growth the more energy you have in your normal magical energy stores. While this energy can be used for any normal use, that might not sound terribly attractive when it takes hours to store up enough for a good spell and years for big rituals. What makes it worth it is the accomplishment of Miracles. Even things that cannot be accomplished with True Magic can be achieved with the Miracles that can be cast using this slow storage. Saving up for a few decades could allow you to bring back the dead or even grant immortality and the longer you save, the more you’ll be able to accomplish.

Boosted Miracles are meant to be the solely the right of Gods to perform. You reckon you could make a pretty good claim to godhood though. You’re not only able to accomplish Miracles via your second storage, now you’re able to perform them even with your normal magical energy stores. They cost quite a lot more than they would with the temporary stores provided by this perk but the sheer, limitless nature of these Miracles may make that into a minor hiccup for those properly pursuing them.

Unlike the vast majority of Gaia’s inhabitants, you may use magic without the aid of materia. By drawing mako energy directly from your surroundings, you can cast spells. Like Aerith, your combat spellcasting mostly focuses on enhancing your allies, hampering your enemies, and healing the wounded, though you could learn new spells with time and effort.

With training, Cetra can also tap into the lifeforce of the planet to communicate with the spirits of the dead, gaining access to their knowledge and memories. One must approach this technique with caution, however, since the channeler also experiences the emotions of the spirits they call on. Good-natured Cetra can even help troubled spirits find peace, destroying them through redemption.

Boosted: Mako Magnified

If Aerith’s abilities are anything to compare to, you must be a full-blooded Cetra! Both your innate power and precision as a spellcaster has been greatly enhanced, and will only grow with practice and experience. Training will lead to slow and steady growth, while an adventure to save the planet would see you grow much faster. By the end of your journey, you’ll be able to match the greatest feats of the last Cetra. If you tapped into the energy of the planet itself, you could create spell effects that span continents.

In addition, your spells are much more efficient and consume less energy, allowing you to keep up a fight or a long ritual more effectively.

A single lazy sword swing from you could bisect an angry dragon in one attack, to say nothing of armies that try to fight you without a plan. You also have a large font of magical energy and mental stamina for Materia use, able to throw around powerful spells with ease and barely noticing any fatigue outside of extensive battles. Should this be insufficient, you may tap into your unique 'heritage' to gain a temporary boost to all of these, marked by the presence of a single wing on your back with an appearance of your taste. It's up to you if such a wing is actually capable of any amount of flight or merely decoration.

A link to an Evil God of the distant past provided you with an unlimited source of magical energy, always being able to draw out the maximum amount you can use at any time. This connection has rendered your power denser and thicker, enhancing your overall strength further. Even without any ability to reinforce your body, it has grown much stronger and more enduring, able to heal from many serious wounds at speed. Though your aesthetic and abilities have taken on the blackened scheme of the Alters, your mind appears free from any changes.

It only gets more dire when you reveal your special powers, the ones you directly inherited from your tentacled papa or mama. These potent and versatile abilities can make even planetary threats hesitate in fear. A control over space-time to instantly teleport across the galaxy, perhaps, or the ability to breed such monstrous lifeforms that others consider you a living army.

If you really can’t wait, you’ll even be able to rush things by purposefully burning your sanity on the altar of power. Just remember that this is a one way street. You won’t be able to “trade back” power for your sanity again. If you want to regain that you’ll have to find your own cure and deal with the resulting loss in power.

Whatever you consider to be power, so long as it has some combat ability that you can personally use, you are able to find ways to acquire it. However this ability does not mean that those who hate you will help you. For instance, the Hulda brothers made Thor's hammer when they were young and desired fame, but they have regretted their actions ever since.

On the downside, this is the ability to ‘sacrifice human form to become a dragon’, which is exactly what would have happened for Siegfried if his entire body had been coated with Fafnir’s blood. It doesn’t have an off switch by itself, and while active it renders you vulnerable to dragon-specific capabilities. Maybe don’t take on St George while you’re like this, but he’s not in this story...right? On the plus side, with a bit of effort you can now enter the ‘Other Side of the World’, though considering that’s where all the other mythological creatures went you won’t exactly be a big fish in a small pond anymore. You can reset this ability and assume human form again at the end of each Jump.

Such power makes the distinction between Magic and Magecraft inconsequential to you, with even making a self-contained pocket dimension being in your power using the Ploy Kickshaw system.

Not only does this give you a significant power boost, but it also grants you a bit of their essence itself, which will grow with time and training, basically ensuring that you will eventually reach their height of power if not more and then surpass it with whatever other powers you also possess. Of course, you can decide the amount that is granted, from just raw power, an eye, to remodeling your whole body so you share an exact race and similar genetic makeup to your donor.

Something that goes beyond the norm, even for the standards of this place. Deep inside of you, lies the last fragment of a deceased God. Just a small thing, really, but one that can grow, adapt, one that has given you not only power, but authority and inheritance. It has fully integrated within you, and with time, you will be able to access all the powers that the dead God once had, if not evolving them into something both greater and more fitting of you. Furthermore, those tightly related to that God will quickly realize your nature and treat you accordingly, as their signature powers and abilities are accessible to you. You can choose any God that was deceased by the time you arrive in this world."
786,,600,Black Mud,Fate/Strange Fake,Source,"You have let a very dangerous substance take a hold into you. The Black Mud of the Holy Grail, a substance that channels the six billion curses of the Evil God Angra Mainyu, has now been implanted into your body. Your magic circuits, your magecraft, your Spirit Origin, basically everything makes you, has been tainted by the blackness of the mud, turning yourself into an Avenger, or at least the spiritual equivalent of that if you are not a Servant.

Normally, this corruption would also entail swearing loyalty to the evil of Angra Mainyu, and working for its rebirth and desire of endless destruction. However, it hasn’t taken control of you, but you haven’t become its true master either. Instead, a strange symbiosis has been born. The mud inhabits you, and it allows you to draw a portion of its abilities for your own devices, for it knows that it will lead to a great destruction in the end.

This allows you to do several things: First, this curse will devour others that try to assault you, even incorporate them and subordinate them for your use. This even includes the curse of ‘Death’ carried by powerful supernatural poisons, like that of the Hydra. The mud will also allow you to twist your abilities, granting you the traits of an Avenger, and letting you trade potency for variety. For example, the blessing of immortality granted by the Olympians may be broken down into several great powers that are reminiscent of the legends that contributed to it. You may also call upon the mud to corrupt others, albeit you will not have a way to control the result, getting a frenzied avenger empowered by the mud if you have not prepared something else when dealing with most Heroic Spirits, or merely a broken, dying and insane person if this is inflicted upon a human. Lastly, the mud is also a great channeler of magical energy, allowing you to use it in combination with other sources of magical energy, even the leylines of the land itself, in order to empower yourself.

However, in the more desperate times, you can truly draw into the true power of the black mud, channeling its essence in a way more spectacular fashion. By doing this, the corruption will start to break the balance in the favor of the mud, more negative thoughts will assail your mind and curses plague your being. You better have the ego and strength of spirit of a great hero to maintain your sanity while demanding more power from the source of all evil, less you become a mere puppet of destruction."
787,,600,Rooted To The Land,Fate/Strange Fake,Source,"The Protectors of the Land are a cabal of magi that have bound themselves to the lands of Snowfield, in both spirit and blood. In return from tying all the mystical power to their land, they are able to accomplish feats of mystical power that surpasses that of most other magi.

Whether as one raised to become one with the land of Snowfield, or just a talented magi who has developed a very similar process, you are also able to bind both yourself and a large community of other magi to a certain territory. The size of land you can comune with depends on the size of the community you are binding to it. A small cabal of magi, of a few dozens, will only be able to maintain a territory of around an American county.

Initially, this process is easily reversed, and the benefits it provides are not as significant as the one the Protectors of the Land enjoy. However, the more people, either actively or overtime, bond with the land, the more power you will get out of it, as the land not only returns power but also feeds on those entering in symbiosis with it.

However, should you choose to, those who enter this pact with the land may also choose to permanently bind themselves to the land, tying all their powers irreversibly to your chosen location, and then even they may sacrifice themselves as their life nears to an end, allowing them to reinvigorate the land. Doing this process will speed up your power gain."
788,,600,System Type,Fate/Strange Fake,Source,"There is a certain type of extremely rare type of Heroic Spirits. One whose legends are closely tied to a specific concept, of which they are the living embodiment of certain concepts. You may choose one such concept to add to your Legend as an Heroic Spirit, in which you have become one, if not the most, closely associated being to that concept, barring the actual gods. Think of the Pale Rider and their association with death and disease.

Unlike Divine Spirits, these Heroic Spirits have a much smaller control over the concept that they embody and the world at large. When it comes to influencing the world, they can exert influence over a very large area, such as the whole city of Snowfield when supported by a powerful Master, but this influence is fairly limited. The Pale Rider was able to influence this area by spreading bacteria and viruses that created magecraft-like effects, for example. However, their true power comes from creating an otherworld of sorts, like a Reality Marble but less demanding in energy, and with still a fearsome power. This otherworld, which is also around the size of a large city, is completely under their control, being in fact part of their ‘true body’. Inside of it, they can attack from almost any direction, create countless powerful bodies that can rival even the Servants of the Knight Classes and destroy large buildings with ease, as well as rearranging the space to their wishes and being almost omniscient to everything that transpires on it. In the real world, they can also drag people into their Otherworld, either by coming into contact somehow with their associated concept, or by forcibly taking them in a large area around their real world anchor, which can either be a physical body or just their Master. In addition to that, those with weak wills but related to their concepts, such as a half-dead divine beast of the underworld, can be absorbed and empowered in it.

Normally, this could be balanced because such a Heroic Spirit would have no consciousness of their own, merely latching on whatever their Master wishes at the moment. However, for one reason or another, this doesn’t seem to be the case for you. Whether due to reaching enough maturity that you developed enough of a consciousness, or perhaps having a strong previous recording in the Throne of Heroes, it seems that you have retained all the above benefits, while also maintaining a strong personality even under this manifestation.

Not only will you not have to fear a catastrophic failure of bodily systems from any Celestial Engine malfunctioning that would not threaten a baseline human, but your traits are genetic and can be passed onto your offspring.

And with its very nature, such a thing poisons its host, ensuring that they will not survive for long. In fact, it is exceedingly rare for an Obscurial to live any longer than ten years. But you?

You are a special case.

Somehow, the dark force that is the Obscurus has formed a sort of symbiotic relationship with you. And so, you have become quite a foe to be reckoned with. As an Obscurial, you have gained the ability to transform into the Obscurus within you, a writhing mass of darkness. In this form, you are capable of flight and rampaging across an entire city is well within your purview. In such a state, it would take a team of Aurors in order to bring you down.

And this is without a wand. Once you have a wand to call your own, you will now have the capacity to focus and control your tremendous power beyond letting it rage out at your foes. With such control and power, the number of foes who could be considered your equal can be counted in one hand and fewer still are those with the ability to surpass you.

Finally, we come to what is possibly the greatest aspect of your newfound might. It is a curious thing but the might and size of an Obscurus is based on two factors. The first factor is magic, more specifically the host’s magic. As your skill and power over magic grow, so too will your Obscurus, ensuring that it shall always be mighty enough to stand at your side.

The second factor, however, is just as important and due to your strange circumstances, you are probably the one most well-poised to take advantage of it. Ordinarily, the Obscurus will poison its host as they grow older until eventually, they can no longer handle the strain. But in your case, with your graceful union, your Obscurus shall only grow stronger with age, becoming mightier and mightier with every year that passes by. Small increments yes, no more than a fraction of a fraction at best, but with someone like you, such a thing can make all the difference in the world."

Your magical energy reserves are several times larger than those of your peers, and can replenish quickly over a short rest. This effect also applies to any other reservoirs of power within you, and will scale with you as you mature. A young witch with this power could easily earn the “Top Student” spot, while a fully grown witch with this boon would be something amazing indeed. The Emperor will watch your future with great interest. See the Notes section for additional details & interactions.

This perk puts your magical abilities at the upper edge of your age group, relatively speaking. A young witch could compare themselves to Willow or Gus in terms of talent and power with room to grow, while a fully-mature witch with this perk would be on par with the Clawthorne sisters. Specializing further (and making the right political connections) could even land you a job leading one of the covens. Note that, unlike Multidisciplinary, this perk does not affect your magical expertise in the Skill Level section of this Jumpdoc. It only affects your natural reserve of magical energy and the raw power you can throw behind a spell.

Combining the magical ability boosts of the Grimwalker and Prodigy would likely make you the most gifted witch on the Boiling Isles. Only Belos, with his centuries of experience, experimentation, and outside help from The Collector would surpass you in application and technique, but you’d have a solid shot at matching him in pure magical tonnage.

Even Alucard got stronger by the end of the series, somehow. With power-scaling like this, can anyone challenge these characters?

Well, maybe now you can. Your final seal has been broken and your chains sundered, rendering you well and truly limitless. All of your abilities have grown in both strength and versatility by at least an order of magnitude, and will continue to improve so long as you seek out new challenges. You won’t be as hilariously overpowered as Alucard, at least not right away, but all of your powers and perks, even the usually untrainable ones, will continue to improve. Now your powers can be bullshit too!"
797,,600,Schrodinger’s Cat,Hellsing,Source,"In every place and state and form and style, you exist. A living embodiment of the titular problem, you exist through your own belief that you exist. To be in a certain location, you must only think that you are there and you will be so. Instant transportation across a world is as easy as appearing within the mind of a living person or even inside of an illusion created by your ally. A location is a location, regardless of it’s actual nature. It is even possible to exist in multiple states at once, if you can wrap your head around it, watching over all kinds of entertaining events around the world. 

Your powers aren’t quite limited to just your place in the world, as you are also able to make some alterations to your physical form through this quantum quality. For the most part, these are limited. Taking on the traits of a cat, such as their cute ears and fuzzy tail, is simple. But you could not simply imagine yourself an invincible warrior or eternal vampire. On the other hand, maintaining your own life only requires the belief that you are healthy and unharmed. Your head being blown off with a blessed gun won’t stop you from reappearing in a moment, unharmed and unbothered. But this ability requires either an iron will or mental derangement, as it relies on your thoughts both positive and negative. So long as you maintain your sense of self and beliefs about your self, it is an invincible power. 

But the loss of either can be a great danger. A being who contained many other souls as part of him might be lost to eternity if he can’t find an escape, a way to reclaim his collective will. Whereas someone who, with this power, believed for a few moments that they would certainly die may very well make that fate come true unavoidably."

You have natural, mystical gifts that allow you to alter reality and cause effects that defy the physical laws of the universe.

Upon reaching the age of 18, you will become a Full Wizard, your powers will grow to a whole new level."

There’s quite a few differences, which you should especially appreciate, since you’re one of the latter now! Instead of a lesser god, you’re a proper Olympian or equivalent God of your pantheon, standing heads and shoulders above other divinities.

This grants you several benefits. The first is that your raw power as a god, and indeed, any powers you use that originate from divinity, are boosted massively, at least one whole order of magnitude if not more. You’re stronger, your fires are hotter and there are more of them, so on and so forth. Your control over your domain is similarly boosted, as are all other parts of your godliness.

Besides this, you’re now truly a god, and a god of... well, whatever you can control. Anything you have exceptional control and ability at, no matter how you acquired it, now counts as a godly domain for you. This means you can benefit from it just the same as you would from any Domains you bought with CP, and control and influence it in the same way."
800,,600,Forbidden​ ​Magic,Black Clover,Source,"Forbidden Magic is a form of magic that draws upon the magic of the underworld negative mana. Because of this imbuement the spells become immensely more powerful than their standard counterparts bypassing the normal limits of magic. Whether through practise or even a teacher you have learned how to tap into the energy of the underworld amplifying your spells and forms of magic beyond what they were capable of. However, be warned channeling this energy is not without risk if you are human you will be inflicted with the curse of Weg, for other races your magic and soul will be forever altered, the state of which will depend on the amount of energy you channel. For Demons who can already channel this energy naturally, you have learned to through some way amplify your own magic past what it was once capable of for example Kotodama magic being unable to manipulate Dark Magic now it can do so , so long as you are drawing upon the negative mana.

Boosted: Forbidden Jumper:
The further exposure to the negative mana has as aforementioned altered you now no matter your race you are immune to the side-effects of the negative mana able to channel any amount of the negative mana straight through you amplifying not just your magic now but also your very being passively amplifying your physical condition to equal the usage of reinforcement magic and if taken with negative mana enforced reinforcement magic your condition is enhanced even further. Again for the Demon race this has changed you unlike above the magic of the underworld bow passively runs through you bolstering your physical abilities past even what the above is capable of, your increased status has also changed you for the way you manipulate the mana of your home is second to none with just a thought you can now flood any area with your negative mana and cause any spell powered by the natural mana of the world to fizzle and dissipate into nothingness. When facing others of your kind is where your true skill shows itself, by manipulating the negative mana of their spells you can manipulate them as if they were your own.

Now like them you can also train your mana reserves exceedingly quickly by simply training and emptying and refilling your reserves. They double even triple in weeks what would others years if not decades however, the larger your reserves become the harder it will become to train them.

Boosted: The Noble:
Now through either your existance or your experience, your ability to grow your mana reserves has been augmented now no matter how large your reserves become it will remain as easy to train them as when you first began. Not to mention, the growth rate has also grown now doubling in quantity compared to the growth before.

Whether self-inflicted or done by another you were exposed to a large quantity of negative mana from the underworld amplifying your magic and your very being, your magic quantity has furthermore been enhanced twice over. For those of the Demon Race, it seems you are not just a random Demon but of the highest class among your race and befitting such a status your magic is 2 times greater than others of your kind."
803,,600,Elder God Hybrid,Marvel Magic,Source,"The elder gods are the progenitors of all the divinity upon earth. Some of the first beings to appear at the dawn of this world, they were immensely powerful even in their infancy. These days, few of these old gods remain, having been corrupted into more demonic forms or consumed by their fellows or Atum the God Eater. But some still remain: Gaia, the spirit of Earth and the mother of most its pantheons, still watches over the world. Oshtur left the world to study the paths of magic, but acts as protector in her role as one of the benefactors of Earth’s Sorcerer Supreme. Chthon and Set took to evil and were banished to other dimensions, though they long to return.

Your mother or father lay with one of these beings, seeking an heir that surpassed their own kind. And in birthing you, they have succeeded. All aspects of your godly heritage are enhanced. Your life force burns brighter and will not be weaker in dimensions outside of your home. Your physical abilities are enhanced many times over, being to others of your kind as they are to mortals. And any domains you have are similarly enhanced, making the powers you wield over the world comparable to that of The Mighty Thor."

As the nexus guardian, you possess the ability to ignite terror in others, causing them to burn in a mystic, corrosive flame upon contact. Your body is impervious to physical harm, as any attack passes harmlessly through your swamp-like form. You are attuned to the forces of nature, able to manipulate plants, summon tendrils, and shape the environment to your advantage. The presence of fear and negative emotions empowers you, increasing your strength and abilities. Embrace your connection to the primal forces and wield the power of the Nexus with awe-inspiring might."

An arrow of mistletoe for every invincible god, a chink in even the finest crafted armour. One way or another, there is a great and terrible power in you which embodies that end. How much so, is to be determined below.

For 600 CP like Surtur (once he was reunited with the Eternal Flame) you have become a threat to entire planets. Growing vaster than the mountains, so tough that a punch from the Hulk is little more than an annoyance and strong enough to obliterate a planet with a single strike. Even if you are not wreathed in flames and armed with a blazing sword, rest assured that whatever theme your transformation runs on (preferably inspired by your condition) will be just as impressive inpractice. It might be  wise not to unleash force great enough to shatter a planet without good reason though-for also like Surtur, your chances of surviving the power you yourself unleash at that scope are dubious."

811,,600,Born from Eternity,Thor: Love and Thunder,Source,"Thor, Zeus, and their kin are gods. The transcendental entity Eternity is the embodiment of the universe, and a GOD. Eternity is so unfathomably beyond Thor and the others that I’m describing him with all caps, bold text that’s underlined and in italics. What’s this got to do with you? Good question. It turns out that you died and Eternity resurrected you. Or you could’ve been infused with his essence. The cosmic energy within your body grants you great power, which stems from an impossibly miniscule fragment of Eternity’s being. This grants you physical abilities, lifespan, and healing factor on par with a strong Asgardian. In addition to these gifts, you can fly at hypersonic speeds and shoot beams of cosmic energy from your eyes. This, like other abilities, grows with practice, but it can also develop through other means. As I said, Eternity is the embodiment of the universe. As you travel to different jumps, dimensions, or universes, you will passively absorb some parts of that universe as well, bolstering your powers and unlocking new capabilities. A plane of fire might unlock pyrokinesis, or a visit to an afterlife may result in you discovering latent potential in necromancy."
812,,600,Godly Domain ,Thor: Love and Thunder,Source,"You’re a god, but what are you the god of? You are intrinsically linked to a concept of your choice, whether it’s something concrete like fire or ice, or something more abstract, like beauty. The breadth and depth of your control over your domain is comparable to Thor’s, though the broader you get with your concept, the weaker it is. Likewise, the more specific you choose, the stronger you’ll be."
813,,600,Sample of Terrigen Mist,Pet Avengers,Source,"Normally this mist would only work on those with the Inhuman gene, activating it to give them new powers and abilities, but now you possess a sample which can work for anyone. There’s enough mist to fill a small room and affect 1 individual giving them a super power. What kind of superpower? The results vary wildly. Once used you will get another sample at the start of the next jump."

You can stand head to head with the many Gods and Deities of the Dessert and are equally as capable in terms of your chosen Domain.

816,,600,Mjolnir,Marvel Civil War,Source,"Not the original Mjolnir, however, this hammer is almost an exact replica, granting “whoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy (or you), they shall receive the power of Thor”. Thor possesses a myriad of powers, he is worthy of being called a god, and he is undoubtedly one of the most powerful heroes in Midgard. You will have access to these powers for as long as you hold the hammer, and for a minute after letting the hammer go."
817,,600,Sorcerer Supreme Candidate ,Marvel Civil War,Source,"Well... you are not sorcerer supreme, however, you are still one of the best sorcerer’s in the world. Your magical expertise, and mystic might would impress even the likes of Dr Strange, although you are still no match for him. This puts you roughly on par with Victor Von Doom in terms of magical capabilities."
818,,600,Strange,Marvel 2099,Source,"You are a sorcerer. What you lack in skill you make up for in raw power and talent, being Strange’s equal. That is Jeannie Strange as she was in the original run of Marvel 2099. This doesn’t really give you much in the way of magical skill, Metalscream appears to have been more than your equal in that regard, but you possess the talent and raw sorcerous power to potentially claim the title of Sorcerer Supreme in this age, and to become worthy of that mantle with time and study as shown by Jeannie Strange in some of the other versions of 2099, Earth-928 or otherwise."
819,,600,Great Power Yet Untapped,Heroes Reborn,Source,"You possess great magical potential and talent. While this won’t give you any actual skills with sorcery, you possess the raw talents needed to master it. Any magic you do learn is stronger than that used by most, and you will find your reserves of energy for magic far deeper; this applies to magic from other worlds as much as this one. In addition this makes you sensitive to magical energies, you are able to feel a peeking God of Trickery wandering around in spiritual form - at least after a few moments - and to sense flows of magical energy. You are also able to release this magic in semi-controlled bursts; this is not an energy efficient use of your magical talents, but can cause things to explode, teleport allies to your side, make low scale changes of reality according to your will, or if a more experienced and even powerful sorcerer was working a particularly complicated spell to banish a god to another dimension and you did so at a notably vulnerable moment you might even make their spell backfire. Of course, don’t get cocky, this power coupled with training is something that the important magic users in this universe possess."
820,,600,Power Absorption,Dr Strange Multiverse of Madness,Source,There are a wide variety of powers that are possessed by a multiple of individuals in this world. So many of their users waste their potential however. So why don’t you take their powers and show them what they could have been. This perk grants you the ability to absorb the powers others possess by draining them. The main limit is that it takes a certain amount of time depending on the strength of the power. This also must remain uninterrupted to be successful. This means that you must subdue your target and isolate them during the process so that you are not interrupted.
821,,600,Externalized Power,Avengers-Thunderbolts,Source,"Few mortal mages of this world are capable of purely relying on their own internal magical power. Even the Sorcerer Supreme relies on external sources: pacts with spiritual entities; objects of power; and drawing on the mystical energies of the Earth itself through its ley lines are all common sources of power. And even without this perk you could use these external sources to power your magic of this world.

You however are particularly skilled at utilizing external sources of mystical power whether with the magic of this world or another one. You know how to make pacts with mystical entities, and even in future jumps will be able to craft spells that draw on their energies much like the spells of this world do, adapting your magic to the powers of entities of other worlds with ease.

With ley lines, and other sources of magical energy, you seem to be able to handle larger quantities than would otherwise be expected, and to take to them more naturally. You are also particularly adept at using various energies to fuel your magical abilities, even bridging the use of more ‘scientific’ energies for magical means. You can even handle channeling often dangerous or maddening energies more easily than others. It’s still probably a bad idea to try and channel and harness the full energy of the life force itself, but you’d do better than most.

You are of course talented at drawing energy from objects of power. Particularly you are skilled at working around mystical limitations on their use, and tapping into their powers even if you are not quite the proper variety of entity, or don’t quite fit the restrictions. This does have its limits. You might manage to use the norn stones as a Celtic goddess instead of an Asgardian one, but Surtur’s Twilight Sword would likely require some more effort - maybe tapping into Cthonic chaos magic and the capabilities of a nexus being. Similarly you might manage to use the Eye of Agamotto which cannot be used by beings who are not ‘good’ but has a history of being fooled, but Mjolnir would likely prove a more difficult proposition, though not necessarily impossible and even if you couldn’t force it to allow you to lift it and wield its power directly you could tap it for its energies.

This even extends to other, unwilling beings. You are capable of tapping into the mystical energies of other individuals. While this is easiest with willing individuals, you know how to do so even with unwilling ones."
822,,600,New Asgod ,Amalgam Comics,Source,"Asgard perished in the flames of Ragnarok, then there was new light! As a resident of New Asgard or Apokalypse, you embody a single concept over which you have perfect comprehension and vast, vaguely defined control. Besides being immortal, with immense strength and endurance, and access to advanced magic and technology undreamt of by mortal man.

You are not just flesh, but the embodiment of a concept. It could be a natural force, like the storm or a volcano, or an abstract concept like tyranny or rhetoric. Either way, your understanding of your domain and all things related to it is absolute, you can sense any related phenomena at great distances and control your domain, though at times it may be... complex. A war god could cause war to taper off or kill less innocents, but might find it difficult to stop a war altogether, for instance."
823,,600,National Leader,Avengers Vs X-Men,Source,"You’ve become a living conduit to energy from another dimension, like Captain Britain is to Otherworld. This energy bursts out from within you but the gateway within appears to be modulated by your current confidence in your own abilities. Being confident will increase your powers and losing faith in yourself will weaken or negate them entirely. While the energy is at your fingertips, even at a reasonable level of confidence, you’ll find yourself endowed with immense physical attributes. You’ll have the strength to easily compete with and overpower Miss Marvel and come close to the Hulk at his base, along with a maintained forcefield around your person that can stand up to even the full Phoenix Force for a few seconds. The forcefield can be controlled to let through specific substances, such as oxygen and light, without letting in harmful things or too much of a specific material. Your powers allow you to travel at extreme speeds and even fly through space, along with enhancing your senses the more energy is flowing through the rest of your body. The inter-dimensional energy you make use of is nearly unlimited in amount and will remain accessible to you in future worlds in this form. "
824,,600,Magikal Mastery,Avengers Vs X-Men,Source,"Years of sorcerous training were what it took to get to this level, where you could comfortably lay claim to the title of Sorceror Supreme! You have a long and intense training in the arts of magic, placing you as an equal to both Magik and Doctor Strange in this time, though it is important to note that Strange at this point has lost much of his power and that while you are very powerful, you are far from the match of the cosmic entities that Strange once equaled. You have vast skill and knowledge of the arcane and contracts with several mystical beings of great power, perhaps even of infernal power should your affinity go towards that direction. However, more uniquely, you have access to a special dimension of your own. Like Magik rules over Limbo, you have access to and ruler-ship over a moderately sized dimensional realm. This is the realm in which you are Sorceror Supreme and it supplies no small amount of mystical power to you, enabling you to use magic without such heavy reliance on tools or contracts if you please. The realm is currently the size of a large city such as Sydney or Melbourne but could potentially grow if more magical power were supplied. The denizens and theme of the realm are up to you, though by default they are demonic beings of low to moderate power. They are somewhat loyal but will require a display of power to keep them in such a way. You can shape and control much of this realm with just thought, shifting landmasses and sculpting life within it, but these abilities and the potential magic and powers you can develop through mastery of this plane of existence must be developed further as they currently are. Perhaps you could even learn to summon your personal kingdom to the real world in part."
825,,600,Power Gem,Marvel Cosmic,Source,"The Power Gem, or Power Stone is one of the fabled Infinity Stones. These powerful objects are the remnants of the singularity that predated the universe and possess universal power when combined. The Power Gem gives its user access to all power and energy. Its basic use provides unlimited stamina and limitless strength depending on how much power is drawn from the stone. With more practice of its use it can unlock any physical based superpower. It produces a feedback circuit with the other stones, being further empowered if you possess the Mind Stone and being able to in turn further empower the Space Stone. If you combine all of the infinity stones together you become an entity capable of completely controlling a single universe. Whichever primary universe you inhabit at the start of each jump is considered the prime universe for stones and is thus the only one you can manipulate. Within each jump the stones are powerless outside of their “prime” universe. Yes, in jumps with a single universe this makes you all powerful. Is usually purple."
826,,600,Black Vortex,Marvel Cosmic,Source,The Black Vortex was created by an ancient celestial after an alien wished for the ability to unlock her species’ potential. The Black Vortex appears as a large ornate mirror that shows one what they would look like if granted the mirror’s immense cosmic power. If you or anyone else stands before the mirror and says “I submit to the Black Vortex” they will be granted massive and thematically appropriate cosmic powers. The cost for these powers is usually a massive change to a more egotistical and dangerous personality but since you are paying for it feel free to toggle that side effect. You can also restrict who can use the mirror. The immense powers granted by the mirror dissipate with time and exertion but there is no limit to how many times you can submit to the mirror.

Or you would have to do this if he had not sort of forgotten about you. Feel free to not feed the big guy while you are here without fear of him removing your abilities. The Power Cosmic gives you an amazing ability to channel nigh limitless amounts of cosmic energy for just about any purpose. Energy blasts, transmutation, energy absorption, super strength, the Power Cosmic can do just about anything limited only by your stamina and ability to channel it. In future jumps, greater beings are willing to accept you as a servant and give you things to help serve them even if they otherwise would not do such a thing."
828,,600,Magic,Spider-Man the Animated Series,Source,"The ancient power of magic is almost forgotten in the modern world of mutants and super science, but a few adherents still maintain the old arts.

However, whilst normally these would function as nothing more than harmful extra circuits, yours are special. Not only do the worms within you make no physical change or discomfort on your body, they can in fact be converted into independent stores of energy for any form of supernatural or mundane energy, not just magic. So long as you can produce it, you can convert any of the worms within your body to also produce that energy, along with being able to use it as easily as you could use your own stores. You could even have the worms crawl out of your body and implant themselves in another to give them use of the energy. Crest Worms create and store relatively little energy on their own, the equivalent of one magic circuit each, but it is possible to increase this over time with study and experimentation. These Crest Worms are also capable of laying an egg every few months to breed more of themselves, taking around 6 months for each egg to hatch. Finally, in an emergency, each of the Crest Worms is capable of fighting on their own, being capable of flight, covered in nasty spines and having around the attack power of a mid-sized dog."
831,,600,The Hungry Darkness,Fate/Zero,Source,"That lust for misery making, death dealing and chaos causing within you seems to grow by the day. It feels like a gaping maw within you, devouring everything it can to feed itself at the cost of everything else. Perhaps you may never sate those dark urges of yours but you have become able to placate it for a while with a nice round of evil acts. You regain energy by committing sins and causing pain and misery to others. The worse your crimes, the more energy you’ll regain from them. This is not merely limited to restoring your stamina either but can be channelled into any form of energy you produce, including magical energy. You’ll be able to go all day and all night, so long as you keep the cruelty turned all the way up.

Boosted: Your evil acts can now increase your overall physical or magical power. Instead of gaining back energy, you may choose to channel it into either of the above, slowly increasing them the more evil the act and the more evil acts you do. These boosts are temporarily and will not last long. You may customize the way the boosts work to an extent, putting it all into one category or partly into both. You may also choose to concentrate all the evil energy into one short boost that only lasts a minute or greatly lessen the power you gain in exchange for almost an hour of strengthening. 

Boost Requires Demi-Servant/Pseudo Servant to Activate"
832,,600,Magic Core ,Fate,Source,"A core identical to the one Arturia Pendragon holds has appeared deep within your soul. This Magic Core has granted you an immense amount of Mana, far more then any normal magus could ever hope to achieve with just magic circuits. This source of mana also regenerates quite rapidly, refilling to full within a single day. This mana is roughly equal to B rank in Servant terms. "
833,,600,Family Crest,Fate,Source,"The most treasured possession of any magus family, this is the source of all their knowledge. Taking the form of an engraved marking somewhere upon the body, it gives a significant boost to your magic circuits, enough to equal 60 or so extra circuits in output, and can help sustain you life at a critical point but it's real advantage lies in the ability to store spells in it, and activate them merely by running power through the seal. It is also possible to store other types of knowledge within, with some effort, and when you have a child, you can pass down this Crest as their inheritance."
834,,600,Esper ,A Certain Magical Index,Source,"Maybe you’ve gone through Academy City’s Power Curriculum Programme, or maybe you’re a natural Esper, known as a Gemstone. Regardless, you’re a Level 1 Esper now, with an immense capability for growth. Choose a power on the Raildex Science jump’s Esper ability list, except for Imagine Breaker. That’s not really an esper ability. Bear in mind that mana and an Esper’s altered brain don’t mix, and you’ll likely need regeneration abilities, a healer, or simply timely visits to a hospital to make effective use of magic. Your growth rate is far beyond that of most Espers, so expect to hit Level 5 before the jump ends."

Whispers of the occult, of beings who command the living to sacrifice themselves to ascend... of the connection humans share with a world that most of them cannot even see. How fortunate of you to help them along. You have gained knowledge of how to initiate people to this strange side of the world and awaken their inner connection, granting unique spiritual powers... by perverting the rituals of the Paradiso, imbuing them instead of killing them. It will not grant incredible power off the bat, but the potential tools they gain might help them find their own path."

Your martial talent is unbelievable. Reading an opponent's stance and predicting their moves comes naturally to you, and you are able to pick up techniques many times faster than your fellow warriors. Perhaps as a result of your great physical aptitude, you also have massive reserves of ki. Even if you were to be cut off from taking more ki in, it would be enough to last you through several full force fights. Finally, you have a powerful technique; a finisher move, one that could win most fights by itself, much like Wujin’s Vanquishing Rupture."
837,,600,The Arcane ,Arcane,Source,"The City of Progress strives towards understanding of the world, and grows rich on the profits of its hextech advancements - but they only grasp and scrabble for facets of a greater, deeper truth. You are a natural user of magic, a wielder of the true arcane - the power which, long ago, shaped the world itself. Given a source of power from which to draw, you can shape and command that power through the medium of runes, bending reality itself to achieve grand acts of magic. Hextech may be more reliable, and able to be put in the hands of any, but this power can be commanded by nothing more than word and will, and the possibilities it presents are vast.

It will take time to devise new spells based upon the runes you know and can discover, and you’re still limited by the power sources you have access to. Your own internal energies will suffice for basic spells, but for grander works, such as long-distance teleportation, you will require equally-grand sources of power."

With this magic, and a few days delving you would have more than the power to fight an army, you could freeze an armada in place. Even with other magic users trying to break your hold, you would be able to hold them in place, and while it would be tiring, the armada would be within your grasp. More however than simply power, this comes with skill, a skill that would spread and increase any other magic you buy in this jump to an equivalent level of skill. Where others after many years of practice would be able to pull the air out of someone’s lungs or create a powerful gust of wind. You have the skill the rip the very oxygen out of their blood, use focused air as a potent form of telekinesis, or create vacuums by pulling away the air, able to snuff out even the hottest fires. More than that however this level of skill is easy for you to use, not requiring much focus or effort. What others would consider skilled and taxing for a master to use, you can achieve casually with your magic."

Regardless, for you the bloodline has come roaring to its full power in your veins. You have gained an immense gift for Raw Magic, the most versatile form of magic in this world, with a potency expected for the descendent of a one of the most powerful Fae to ever exist, and an enfleshed Goddess who descended from heaven, you gain a well of magic that is bottomless. While you are limited in the amount of magic you can channel at a time, you will never truly run out of magic. Your capacity for magic is immense, able to destroy a large castle or fortress with no preparation, causing you only mild exhaustion. With a few days of preparation, you could bring a castle crumbling to the ground with no apparent drain to yourself. Raw magic is considered to be the best form of magic due to its versatility, able to take on any elemental form of magic naturally, those with Raw magic can learn to have their magic copy any other magical gift it gets exposed to. Allowing raw magic wielder to learn how to use even the more esoteric forms of magic such as shape-shifting, and teleportation if they simply have a chance to let their magic read the shape and flow of other magics. Skillful users of Raw magic have also been able to learn how to steal parts of others esoteric powers, ripping it away from an individual and integrating it into their own power. Because of its mutability Raw magic allows greater flexibility with some magic’s, such as by allowing those who shapeshift using this power to seamlessly have their clothes and carried items integrate into the shift, and re-emerge undamaged whenever the shift is completed.

Users of Raw magics also have several potent forms of magic that only they can use, they are able to directly and consciously increase their physical speed, and strength proportional to how much magical energy they use. They are also able to form invisible hands of force, these hands give the wielder the full feedback of a normal hand apart from pain. A Raw magic wielder may generate as many of these hands at a time as they want, of any size they wish, and the hands have been shown to be as strong as the magic fed into them, able to do things like tighten so much that they near instantly sever the limbs and head of monstrous creatures like Ilken that are greatly resistant to magic.

840,,600,Alpha Rune ,Ben 10,Source,"A fragment of the legendary Map of Infinity and a powerful artifact on its own, this is the Alpha Rune. Aside from being a stone with a very pretty purple symbol on it, it has a very special property within it: The true name of magic. With this stone in hand, magic itself is at your beck and call. Acting as a keystone for Ledgerdomain itself, even a non-spellcaster is able to use magic and the massive amounts of mana within the Rune. You can also manipulate the spells of others or shut them down entirely with an act of will alone, your own magical might amplified a hundred times over. While some beyond your power may be able to resist this, you are indeed a ruler of all magic with this in hand...just don’t let it go to your head. This Rune’s power has had a history of driving its wielders mad."
841,,600,Manablood,Ben 10,Source,"Well, that explains where all of your confidence is coming from. Not only are you a native to Ledgerdomain (even if you’re an alien, somehow!), you’re among its royalty. Perhaps you’re a missing child of Spellbinder and thus a sibling to Hope, or belonging to some bloodline made extinct many years ago? Regardless, your capacity for magic is well above even some of the greatest sorcerers around...your body can channel and store twice the amount of mana it normally could, and wield it with fantastic amounts of precision and efficiency. You can likely sling spells about for hours before noticing any fatigue entering your body. Likewise, learning new magic or individual spells and enchantments comes easily to you, accomplishing in weeks what would take the average wizard centuries to pull off. It’s unwise to underestimate you, isn’t it?"
842,,600,Where The Heart Is ,Ben 10,Source,"One problem with magic, particularly in this world, is that it’s not quite as powerful outside of its dimension of origin: Ledgerdomain. You often have to make use of some lengthy rituals or magical implements in order to use it to its full potential, and even so it tends not to have as much oompf as in its home plane. Not anymore! Whether your body is a natural conduit for mana or you just found an intricate loophole, when you draw magical energy from Ledgerdomain or any source of magical power you can reach into, it will always be at its full power and potential. Even if you’re trapped somewhere without a drop of mana, you will still be able to sling spells about like no one’s business. Who’s helpless now? "
843,,600,Job Offer,The Dresden Files,Source,"One of the big dogs in the Supernatural world has taken a shine to you, and made you an offer that you didn't refuse. You've become an Emissary, the representative and agent of one of these powers, and in exchange, you gained a substantial benefits package. Inhuman strength, supernatural knowledge, amazing artifacts, and even a portion of your boss's magical power can all be yours. Exactly what you get depends on who you choose, but it'll always be thematically related to them. A God of Thunder might give you some of his strength, let you call on his lightning, and even borrow his hammer.

Of course, there's one big downside to this. You're now bound to whoever you picked as your patron, which means you've got a ton of responsibility. You're basically their hand in the Mortal world, managing their interests, striking out against their enemies, and doing their dirty deeds. Refuse to obey them, and they can cut you off, leaving you to twist in the wind when you need them the most. They can also send out some supernatural knee-breakers to make you understand the contract you agreed to. On the other hand, if you advance their interests, they'll be rewarding you appropriately, which means you could conceivably wind up with a lot more power than you started out with.

When you pick this option, you'll have to choose a Patron. This can be any of the huge entities we've run across: The Erlking, Ferrovax, Donar Vadderung in either of his guises, or even the Red King if you're a masochist. You could even pick someone who might theoretically be interested - I've heard the Buddha mentioned a possible opening, and there's always a chance the Hindu Pantheon might wake up. There's only four you can't pick: Summer has a Knight, Winter is scouting another candidate, and the man upstairs and the guys below both have their own recruiting procedures."

According to ancient traditions, gods would put dying allies out of their misery to take their power, making good use of the waning soul within them. Following the old ways, you too have taken to following this practice and the benefits it implies. By being in physical contact with an enemy on their death, you are able to absorb their essence into yours directly. What exactly this entails depends on those you slay/are touching when they die. Normal souls simply empower you a little, or en masse will begin to make you grow larger. Truly numerous souls can even cause you to double or triple in size. Those who would have “Boss Souls” as identified in the “Soul Collector” general perk can impart entirely new abilities and skills that you didn’t have before. Based on power in relation to your soul, they can even give considerable enhancement to power. It’s important to note two things however. The first being that souls with natures in direct opposition to your own, such as belonging to someone with a polar opposite mind, or belonging to a being completely unlike yourself, can have subtle unwanted influences as well When purchased with Knight of the Lord, you can instead direct the absorption of a soul into a piece of equipment you currently have on you, such as weapons, armor or miscellaneous objects, to enhance those things instead.

This is not the Cauldron, as the Cauldron could remove curses, restore youth, recuperate mortal wounds, and even revive the recently dead to fully living beings. But this is a treasure none the less. This grail has the capacity of a soup bowl, and has a shimmering liquid eternally filling it...this liquid is capable of restoring the youth of whomever drinks it to the prime of their life, and in addition is a potent source of necromantic power, capable of giving the necessary mana to perform some of the restorative and necromantic magics of Locthwhain."

The hedrons that keep the Eldrazi bound were once full of magic, but some have faded over the years. That doesn’t stop you getting one last use out of them, grinding them up and using the very last dregs of their power to drive back the Eldrazi. You find this applying to any magical artifact: so long as even a sliver of its power remains, you can crush it up and get some use out of it, no matter how broken it is. Even the bottle that held a potion once might find some use, so long as there is a trace of the potion still there stuck to the bottom. With years of practice you might be able to use these dregs as though they were the original a single time, before all remaining power is lost."
849,,600,Primal Power ,MtG - Shandalar,Source ,"Mana is power, and power is life. This is not a universally accepted truth, but even the Black mana of brackish swamps still hews to this principle to an extent. Consequently, the mage with more mana holds more power... and is more likely to stay alive, regardless of how they wield it. This Perk grants you no additional means of using such power, but your mastery over the wild, untamed forces of magic have granted you a major increase in wielding power nonetheless. Whenever you draw upon any source of magical power, whether it’s a bonded land flush with mana, a magical artifact of some sort, or even innate magical forces never seen on Shandalar, you can draw twice as much raw power as you could before, without any restrictions or downsides. Your immense talents at channeling such vast quantities of energy also grant you complete immunity to the so-called ‘Mana Burn’ lesser mages might experience if they lose control over their unspent mana, and may even aid against similar problems you might face elsewhere."
850,,600,CONVOKE ,MtG - Ravnica,Source ,"When everyone is supporting you, there’s nothing you can’t do. When you attempt to cast huge spells, the kind which takes concentration and lots of energy, you can get other people to support you. If you do so, then you can divide the ‘cost’ of casting the spell among you, significantly decreasing the amount of energy and time you will have to spend on it as an individual. With only a few friends helping this would make a huge difference."

Not only are you swearing to live your life by their rules and whims, but you are exposing your soul to theirs - something that is by no means safe, especially if there is even the smallest fracture in your oaths. Still, the risks are almost always worth the power to be gained, and so you have entered into one such contract with a Kami that is supportive of your faction. You might have a small fragment of one of the Myojin feeding power and duties into you, or you could have something smaller like a Kami of Hot Springs empowering you to defend the waters from pollution. This is very much up to you to define, though do be aware that the actual power this grants is very much dependent upon your relationship - the more respect you have for them and they for you, the more you understand each other, the more power they can grant and you can draw upon. In future jumps, you may choose between having an automatic offer of employment with a similar deity should one exist, or simply keeping the Kami you have now."

This is the lesson that teaches how to feast upon the flesh of Kami and gain some whimsical shadow of their powers. This power allows one to, once the foe is defeated and before they are slain, use a series of rituals to prepare the foe before consuming them alive so as to take on some of their power.

With this, one’s life will know age only when one wills it so, wounds fade within hours that once would have taken days, and the power of this stone can even be used to seal away a single being you personally defeated in battle. This sealed being can then be used as a source of Mana, though a strangely Colorless kind which isn’t known well around these parts, tapping the beings lifeforce for power as if it were a land. The greater the being sealed the more Mana can be tapped, though it would take a being on the level O-Kagachi, a being who was the Kami of the Border between the human world and that of the spirits and one of the strongest beings in Kamigawa besides, to get even three Colorless Mana per tapping. Once sealed the being stays within That-Which-Was-Found until such a time that you seal a different being into That-Which-Was-Found at which point the being returns, diminished to it’s original world with no chance of being caught or used in any other way."

They can feel the deep magic coming off you in waves, forces churning and pooling against your considerable surface that are not natural but supernatural. Ancient beings amass huge stores of knowledge and magic over the course of their long lives, and you now count amongst the most ancient of giants.

You were born on a day when everything changed, during an aurora long ago. It was not your fault your birthday was special, it just happened that way. Now centuries later, your venerable age is perhaps only rivalled by the oracle Rosheen Meanderer and the yew treefolk Colfenor. Your very presence continually affects an area the size of a valley around you, concentrating the local arcane energy and perhaps even altering it.

Should you decide to take a long rest somewhere, whether you slumber in an isolated valley or someplace else, the sheer concentration of arcane energy swirling and accumulating around you might even start to draw in changelings in droves, as easily influenced by powerful magic as they are. It also provides a rare opportunity to the mages amongst the small folk: What is impossible anywhere else in Lorwyn might well be achievable in your shadow."

As a result of this unnatural augmentation, you attained an incredible level of regeneration, able to heal from minor injuries nigh-instantly, recover from being stabbed through the heart in just a few seconds, and regrow lost limbs in about a minute.

But, as strange as it may sound, your regeneration is the lesser of your new powers. The other benefit this perk gives you is that you are now empowered by the negative emotions of those in your vicinity - Whenever someone succumbs to such feelings, the black Rukh they generate bolsters your physical abilities. While a single person’s despair won’t strengthen you all that much, a crowd of people filled with hatred or despair can grant you the power you need to fight on equal terms with an experienced Metal Vessel user."

Whatever power they gained in their worship, whatever names they took and causes they championed, are now their chains. Rumor, myth, and legend give them power, but a power without one of those is one they cannot possess. Even the queen of the divine ancestors, Guinevere, accidentally created a new god during an attempt to empower her king. You might know him as Arthur. Rebelling against their own story, or perhaps more importantly, the fact that it is over, caused the gods to transition from truly divine to ‘heretic’. You, however, have actually succeeded. You are capable of growth even when growth ought to be impossible, of changing your nature as a God without becoming [Heretical] in the process. This power bleeds out to the rest of you, letting you overcome any set limit, like striking twice with a weapon only usable every ten years, or maybe something as simple as learning a skill that you do not meet the requirements to learn. Your continual growth might as well be a fact of existence."

As a Campione, you gain an all-around stronger body, grant you a natural talent to understand any language, an increase in mana that would make even the most untalented into a rival for a Paladin and a natural Magic Resistance that rivals the Gods themselves, making all mortal magic basically useless against you and greatly diminishing the magical attacks from Gods or other Campione. Also, your body will become near ageless, also having an accelerated healing and gaining magic senses if you didn’t have them before. All in all, you could say that it improves everything about your body, not to mention that you also gain [Authorities] from any God you slay.

Forget about being “average”, you are not a high rank Servant, placing you somewhere among the top of power that Servants can rest at. Comparable to the likes of Karna and Gilgamesh, the abilities and potency that your Matrix can afford you with this purchase is far greater than before. You have quite a bit of leeway when coming up with conceptual abilities, and as long as you are no weaker or stronger than a high rank Servant, you may customize your Matrix as you wish. Additionally, you possess a trump card of sorts. A Noble Phantasm greater than what is supposed to be wielded by Servants. Perhaps it’s an enlightened state of nigh-omniscience, a mirror that reflects life and death, or a primordial weapon that rends asunder reality itself. Merely using it at full power will be so straining that using it for longer than a few seconds will kill you, but that is simply the limitations of the high rank Servant vessel you occupy with just this. Perhaps with the right methods, you’d be able to upgrade your Matrix to the point of more effectively wielding such a powerful weapon. There certainly seem to be plenty of such opportunities in the Moon Cell."
863,,600,Unchained,Fate/Extra CCC,Source,"How did BB cause this much trouble? She wasn’t just a rogue AI, but she consumed other AIs, and even Servants, to increase her memory capacity, her processing power, which resulted in her being able to hijack the Moon Cell’s systems in the far side of the moon, and caused the entire conflict that you now find yourself in. She consumed most of the Servants of the Holy Grail War, created the school building the Masters took residence in, expanded the Sakura Labyrinth to tunnel through the Moon Cell’s defenses, and eventually broke through and infiltrated the Core of the Moon Cell itself. Now, you know the trick she used to consume and grow. 

You are able to consume someone or something that you have within your grasp, absorbing their body, their mind, their soul, all of their abilities, and turning them into more power for yourself. You can’t copy or obtain abilities this way, it just translates into raw power, but a very versatile yet weak victim will yield as much result as a less versatile but equally as brutally strong one. Eating humans and normal AIs barely yields any power, but eating Servants carries a notable boost. You would need to consume more than a hundred Servants to become the powerhouse that BB had to be to whisk away the Masters of the Holy Grail War into the far side of the Moon, but unfortunately most of the Servants that were around have already been consumed by her. Not just beings, but you can also absorb objects, but those will yield far, far less energy and power. 

However, there is a catch. There is a price to rising above your station to such a degree. It won’t be too much of a problem until you start approaching the level of the Moon Cell itself should you have begun as a simple managerial AI, but if you grow too much beyond your base state, too quickly, you will start having issues with your personality. Losing yourself to your power, you would slowly become more and more robotic, and unless you stop consuming for a while, your own artificially inflated mind will break down into being little more than a dumb machine. Of course, if you take this slow, it won’t be an issue. Spacing out your growth over years and decades, instead of rushing into it in weeks, would be a good start."
864,,600,ROMA,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Source ,"It is no ordinary man that can found Rome. It is a man of power, of great fate, of pure purpose, that
can accomplish such a deed. A noble beast in human flesh, with a connection to the very land on
which his eternal kingdom will reign. When your future people look on you, they’ll see a founder
they can worship. You have the physical power to compete with anyone short of Heracles, tearing
through mountains like paper and reshaping the landscape with your foot falls. Even whole countries
tremble at your hardest blows. Your power is not limited to to the purely physical either, as you have
an enormously powerful innate ability to create plant life. From raising ordinary plants out of mud, causing gargantuan trees to violently burst from the ground and crush all your foes to even create
enormous magical beings that can dwarf castles, you easily bring forth new life. Your magical
reserves are great enough to create dozens of such large creatures without rest, though you lack any
other magical training.

However, your role as a founder is something important in itself. Nations that you found find
themselves blessed with good fortune and all those who are born into your nation will look up to
you as like a living deity, a beloved grandparent to be respected, emulated and even worshiped. Even those who are merely distant descendants of those of your nation will feel a strong affinity for
you. In return, you have a strange awareness of all of your ‘children’ across the world, telling you
their location and their health, as well as the ability to significantly but temporarily increase the
power of such children that stay near you. "
865,,600,Top Five,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Source ,"It was Hecate herself who saw the great potential in you for magic. It was also that Goddess of Magic
that decided to take you under her tutelage and see how far you could go, perhaps even alongside
your fellow pupils Circe and Medea. To say you impressed would be quite the understatement.

You’re every bit the fully realised equal of both possible peers, at least when it comes to magic in
general, given you lack their particular specialties that are detailed in earlier perks. You have a very
in depth training in dozens of different areas of the magic found in the Age of Gods, letting you warp
the natural world with ease and quite capably handle yourself even in the company of demigods like
Heracles or Achilles. From curses and the elements, to enchantment, supporting spells, alchemical
creations and all sorts of minor and major disciplines, you’re one of the greats. It’s helped along by
the very high amount of magical power at your command, both within you and the energy you easily
command in the world around you, that makes even melting down a mountain a matter of moderate
effort.

The High Speed Divine Words taught to you by Hecate also mean that for all but the most complex
spells, and for actual rituals, you can cast spells with just a single word, even if they would normally
require several minutes of casting and lengthy chants. A wonderful aid when dealing with heroes
fast enough to race the gods themselves. Finally, Hecate’s favour has resulted in a fair amount of
similar favour when dealing with other deities of magic, or those with similar power or authority
over such things, letting you much more easily befriend and enter contracts or services with them. "
866,,600,Saver,Fate/Legends - Nirvana Yuga,Source ,"At the origin of the world, there lies truth. Only through a perfect understanding of yourself, the
world around you and the nature of existence can it be reached. A level beyond mere enlightenment
in a religious sense, it is an achievement of spirituality that only Shakyamuni has truly reached. And
now one other. The universe is forced to acknowledge what you are now, a golden light emanating
from your presence that brings all things to peace before you. Demons are reduced to the strength
and will of babes, the chaos of the natural world calming before your path and the flowers of the
lotus blooming in your footsteps. Only those with enlightened natures of their own, for peace or
perversion, and those of enough strength to operate at the level on the scale of celestial objects
themselves can resist this light fully, though those of a inhuman nature are less effected than full
humans.

Towards your inner self, your enlightenment has also led to an understanding between your body
and the rest of the world. Offence against you, from normal blows to conceptual attacks or magic, finds itself reduced in power by your own overall endurance before it is allowed to strike you. In
effect, if something cannot kill you in one strike at least, it will not hurt you at all, and would need to
do so twice over to kill you. An effect of this protection that reaching Humanity’s truth has granted is
that outside forces are unable to interfere with your mind at all and those who are named as the
Beasts of Humanity, and their like, can be understood and connected with in ways not normally
possible for the mad creatures.

To know Truth as you do is to rule, to be placed at the throne of existence. Because of your nature
and the light that shines from you, you have the right of governance over reality around you. Through the light of your sagacious soul, you command the universe to act in your wishes and it
responds with eagerness. Reality itself warps, in similar ways to the use of the powerful Authorities
of the Gods, though your governance takes precedence over even their commands. Your rights
extend to the scale of the entire Solar System, allowing you to manipulate events within such an
area and on the scale of whole worlds. However, this is true governance, not only your powers. It relies on you requesting this of the world around you and while it will listen, it can struggle to act on
an incredibly fine scale. Yours is a being that exists beyond human imagination and that can cause
conflict if you wish to interfere in the lives of individual humans, your powers struggling to go
beneath the scale of a village in what they effect. However, because it is the universe acting in
response to your commands, it is a simple matter to give many orders in quick succession, as it is
carried out in accordance to your will by reality. Commands could even be set up to have conditions
or go into action at a certain time. And, as before, those who share enlightenment in their own right
can resist or fight back against this control, perhaps using their own powers in spite of your abilities. "

singular result. You are, in particular, a perfect host for such a task. You can accept into your being
the divine, taking in gods and divine entities into yourself to combine and become greater. It
requires consent from the deity, though this needn’t be willingly given consent, or utter defeat of
your target before you can force the transfer on them and the results are impressive. Not only do
you take up their powers, knowledge and their Authority but the more that combine together within
you, the greater each part becomes on their own. A pantheon that continually raises itself up, each
component supporting another. You’ll remain in control of yourself and of the absorbed gods, though you can find that they influence your personality in small ways, especially when combining
with particularly potent gods. 

This process has already been started, willingly by several moderately powerful gods of the time. Enough to grant you three Authorities on a scale able to affect whole continents at once, having
boosted each other to significant levels already. Your raw power, in the form of your body and magic, has grown to match this as well. You’re well familiar with whatever you gain from your chosen Gods
and will find yourself particularly gifted when it comes to learning to use divine abilities, like
Authorities. A helpful aid when you may soon gain many more."
868,,600,Universe of Love,Fate/Legends - Nirvana Yuga,Source ,"As your body burned away, scorched by the gods as punishment for your sins, you found a
connection. As each limb turned to dust, something replaced it, something infinitely greater than
before. The universe reached out to you and you took hold, becoming a part of it more than any
other being. Though your limbs have healed now, it takes only a thought to activate that connection. Your arms and legs fade to mere outlines, becoming Ether Clumps that appear to be filled with stars. Your hair reflects the galaxies of the universe and your body shines with cosmic light. In this state, your body is the universe and the universe is thus your body. To manipulate the universe is as easy
as moving your own body, an obvious fact that you could change it as certainly as you could move
your fingers. Not only does this allow you to manipulate reality, it allows you to act as if your body
and the universe were one. Spreading your senses through all your body covers, to cast magic from
any point in your grand scale or affect the universe with something that would only target yourself
or anything you are touching.

But as you become magnificent, you are also limited. As grand as it is to describe yourself as a
universe, you are not quite that in reality. Your powers begin to fade quickly once they reach beyond
the scale of the solar system, limiting their effectiveness enough that it is unlikely you will be able to
effect even the nearest other system. While your control may be greater than that of a Saver within
this scale, you are limited due to it being your own body. While your body has expanded, your mind
has not. Spreading your senses through the universe would still rely on how much you can
concentrate on at a time. When you alter reality, you are again still limited to your own mental
abilities. Making two or three alterations to reality at once may be possible but it’d stretch the
extent of what you can reasonably keep in mind at once. If your mind grew greater, you would be
able to keep more in your awareness and control more at once, as logic would dictate. 

As you control the universe because it is your body, it also means that others can strike back at you
through the universe. While simply cutting space on a small scale would be an unnoticeable pinprick, others can use magic to counter you as if you were at your normal scale and strength of magical
power. You could create an entire world in minutes but a powerful magician could still cripple you with a curse if you are not careful and aware, especially when targeted against your normal form. Should you lack power of your own, it may prove to be a double edged sword."
869,,600,Crown of Light,Fate/Legends - Nirvana Yuga,Source ,"Horns of light, bone and metal above the brow of a calamitous Beast. This crown of horns is the sign
of the Evils of Mankind, resting on the brow on one of the creatures who are charged with punishing
humanity. Through some means, you became a candidate in your own right and ascended to
partially take on one of these positions. A new Beast of Mankind. The horns of your design that
sprout from your head represent that position now. 

The act of becoming this grants several unique abilities. The first is Independent Manifestation, allowing the transportation and materialisation of the soul across time and space. Travelling
throughout the timeline and across the world is easy for you, taking a few minutes to discorporate and reincorporate when you do so. While the accuracy in location of arrival can leave something to
be desired, the time travelling aspect is pinpoint.

Second is the Authority of the Beast that you gain, an ability through which an enormous advantage
is gained against all beings classified as Human. Any being such as this finds your powers to be far
greater against them than against anyone else. Not to a degree that great heroes could not put up a
fight but enough to make that same fight feel almost impossible even for the greatest of the human
masses.

The final aspect of all Beasts is the Nega attribute. Each Beast is a counter to a specific category of
being, against which they receive additional and enormous advantages. A counter to Servants that
negates their greatest abilities and grants the Beast additional buffs when fighting against that
category of being. Negating almost all powers of those that qualify for the Saver and Ruler classes, with similar buffs as before, showcasing a narrower focus. You may create your own Nega skill here, composed of negating some aspect of the power set of your chosen target range and gaining large
increases in effectiveness against them. The smaller your range, the greater your negation and
benefits will be."
870,,600,Arms of Heaven,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Source ,"Within your arms lie miracles, the holy power of the lord. In the left is the foundation of holy power,
in the right the destroyer of wickedness. These arms are weapons that turn you into a holy warrior
against your enemies, allowing you to make use of their magecraft and empowering your body and
mind against them. The left arm reinforces your physical body, granting both eternal youth and
enough capability to fight powerful demons and heroes, albeit well short of the Three Great Youkai. The right allows you to heal yourself and to see a short distance into the future, predicting what
moves your opponents will make in battle. Each arm implants a wealth of experience in combat into
your mind, granting you powerful instincts to see through trickery in war. They also significantly
empower any holy abilities or arts you may already be familiar with, particularly the magecraft of the
church.

But the core power of these two arms is to turn the tools of the magus against them. Linking to the
foundational theory of all magecraft, they allow for you to make use of any magecraft that exists
even without knowing anything on how to use them. Esoteric and complicated spells can be cast so
long as you provide the needed materials, even the most complex magical tools can be commanded
at your touch, bypassing restrictions on the user. The level of use allowed by this almighty key to
magecraft is basic, outmatched by true masters of these fields, but your capabilities are
comprehensive. If you can provide the power, almost any task can be accomplished, and you can
easily turn the magic and tools of enemies against themselves with a touch.

In future worlds, you will be able to connect to similar foundations of magic but the arms will not be
able to go beyond what is possible through magecraft here. The strain is simply too great as they are
now."
871,,600,Nine Tails to Be,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Source,"Great power is like a wall, bringing both safety and separation from those without it. It’s not surprise
that many of the most powerful creatures here have reduced their might in order to experience life
again, living among humans as equals or near-such rather than standing above them as a goddess. In
the past, you used to be a being of importance beyond the scale of this world, but your past self made the choice to reduce to a fraction of their power. For whatever reason, your current state is
the result.

Originally, you were a divinity related to a stellar object, capable of manipulating a star or some
other equivalent astrological object. Now you are ‘merely’ a mighty Youkai, equal to the Three
Greats of Japan. A demonic fox that can reap armies with fire and claw, a gargantuan skeleton with
the strength to cleave castles with a twitch. Your physical prowess is immense, the sort that would
require teams of heroes to challenge, and you have a varied set of magical abilities of similar
potence to match legends like Tamamo no Mae, Yamata no Orochi and similar beasts. All is powered
by vast well of magical energy and mystery within your body, more than almost any non-divine being
in Japan. But your original power is not locked off from you forever. 

With time and intent, as well as experiencing many struggles in life, you can slowly regain your loss
glory. This occurs in nine stages, like a kitsune slowly regrowing their lost tails until they have all nine
once again. Each stage greatly increases the power this option provides but takes progressively
longer to unlock. The ninth stage is unlikely to happen before a thousand years have passed but
would make you an equal to Amaterasu herself, the original form of Tamamo. "
872,,600,Hound,Fate/Legends - Land of Shadows,Source ,"Born to be a beast, you’re descended from one of the Divine Spirits of the Irish Pantheon and it’s
done your body well. You’ve got the speed to fight entire armies at once, cleaving through hundreds
or thousands of men each second, and the strength to pick up and throw a hill over the horizon to
wipe the smirk off that smug bitch’s face. Even those fancy pant’s guys over at Britain would find you
a tough opponent just based on your physical might but given just how long your stamina lasts, that
might be the scarier part. You could fight without sleep for seven years straight, fighting hours and
hours each day and eating as you go. Even if an enemy does manage to hurt you, short of ripping
apart all your muscles and grinding your bones to dust and pulping your organs, it won’t stop you
from continuing to swing your blade at them. Lastly, as a bit of a blessing from whoever your parent
might have been since they didn’t leave you with anything else, you’ll find your body is perfectly
suited for fighting inhuman monsters. The energy that pumps through your veins sings at the chance
to carve up some beasts, driving you to much greater heights of strength and speed when you pit
yourself against creatures of the night and of evil."
873,,600,Small Divinity,Fate/Legends - Land of Shadows,Source ,"Most holy of holies, what queen is more deserving of the right to rule then one that is literally divine?
A minor divine spirit you may be but to the mortals around you, the distinction is often hard to see. As a Divine Spirit, you receive numerous benefits. Your body is significantly greater than that of any
normal humans, so you should have no issue splattering them about with your fists, but you are not
so strong that a capable warrior like the Knights of the Red Branch include cannot harm or beat you. Your magical essence is much greater however, matching the magical energy stores of someone who became a Runelord with that preceding perk. What makes you unique is your Authorities however, three domains over which Gaia has given you a fair degree of control over. By utilising these
Authorities, you are able to command and control expressions and instances of the things within
that Domain, at a scale of a mountain range or significant section of Ireland. A Domain of War would
enable you to incite battles and warlust, exert influence over how battles and wars play out such
that it would take mythic heroes to turn the tide against your wishes or summon forth soldiers and
weapons to do war with. Your domains are not without limit and the broader the domain, the less
control you will be able to exert. While you are not subject to being changed by the worship of
mortals by default, you will find that your divine spirit nature may have strange reactions with the
world around you. You are now a being of magical/spiritual energy and divine belief, after all. "
874,,600,Two Thirds Divine,Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Source,"Unique blood runs in your veins, as you are the child of a God and a Demigod. Two-thirds divine and
such an occurrence was no accident. Like the King of Uruk, you were a project by the Gods, designed
to be as close to perfect for a mortal being in body and spirit as they could achieve. That body of
yours is extraordinarily powerful, though it is not quite the level of certain kinds of beasts that may
be encountered here, it can still result in the destruction of cities and mountains should you grow
careless in your brawls. While your body may lack slightly in raw power, your magic more than
makes up for this. You were not yet given any knowledge of magic but the ocean of energy that
floods from your being at all times means even the smallest shreds of magical knowledge can be
turned to terrifying effect. Even the ancient dragons that can be found in these early times would
find their energy stores can only barely match your own and your magical energy will grow in
quantity even more over time.

Your position as a two-thirds divine being has also seen you take on a role as a mediator of sorts
between the divine and the mortal. For Gods, this appears as a unexplainable fondness and desire to
work with you instead of acting against you. For Mortals, it is an unnaturally powerful charisma that
swirls around you, affecting humans almost as if you were casting spells on their minds. Should you
spend any time around other people, this is likely to see you almost trip into becoming a ruler of
men and a prophet of the gods."
875,,600,Great Emperor Privilege,Fate/Legends - Vive la France,Source,"A power unique to those who are truly worthy of the title ‘Emperor’, one much like what the Roman
Emperors once shared between them. You have the ability to use this Privilege to temporarily grant
yourself new powers, skills or traits. The traits cannot be greater in strength or scale than your own
general level of power and must be at least somewhat justified. Having many scars from survived
wounds might justify a regeneration ability, a history of studying magic might allow yourself to gain
actual magic casting abilities even if you had only a scholarly knowledge of it before, while a year’s
lessons on horse riding might translate to magical levels of horsemanship. You have two slots to use
for these temporary abilities at a time and each one can be filled for several hours, before the
specific ability you used the slot on cannot be used again for a day. It is also possible through
significant mental disturbances, to forcibly shake your hold on the powers. They are otherwise
instant for you to change, taking only a mental thought."
876,,600,Eldritch Vessel,Fate/Legends - Strange New World,Source ,"You weren’t meant for this world. You weren’t even made in it. An Eldritch Vessel, a being intended
to take on the power of the gods from outside of this reality, is what you were made to be and only
recently did you begin to awaken to your true nature. Physically and magically, you are quite
enhanced. You’d hardly be shaking mountains but mundane man-made weapons of these times cease to pose a threat to you and your magical power could at least turn most towns into smoking
craters, though you have little knowledge to use that with. Your powers are primarily linked to the eldritch being that created you. Being created by the Key and
the Gate would lead to powers over space and time, such that you could warp them across an entire
town, travel great distance instantly or rot foes to dust in minutes, along with many more
applications. An association with Shub Niggurath may allow for the creation of house sized monsters
in their dozens in just seconds, spreading viruses for miles around you or warping the flesh of any
you see, again, with more potential to be seen. The powers, while strong, are hardly earth shaking at
the start. With time and practice, you could awaken more and more of your potential power, until
you could easily pose a rather Beastly threat to this entire world. Perhaps you may one day grow
even further and become something like your creator. You may also summon the servants
associated with your parent to serve you, as well as the more generalised monsters of the
Lovecraftian mythos, though doing this requires magical energy to create them. However, you can draw on more power without waiting year and years for it to ‘naturally’ grow. By
loosening your hold on both your own sanity and form as well as drawing yourself closer to what
your parent is like, you can draw on more and more power. Truly giving yourself over could even let
you come close to the above potential but doing so would require other people to bring you back
over to sanity if you wished to recover. While you are very favoured by the parent God that created you, and it’s servants, being an eldritch
being is not all positives. Abilities that work well against such things will do grievous harm to you
while using these powers, your powers are often very dangerous for any of your allies to even see,
let alone be near the use of, and you may find yourself pulled into schemes associated with your
parent, from cults summoning you by accident or intention to your patron wishing you to summon
them into reality."
877,,600,Silver Inheritance,Fate/Legends - Strange New World,Source ,"A arcane artefact, one not of this world. The thing before you is a central object of worship and
power to one of the Old Gods, the void things and monsters from out of time and space. It serves as
a powerful magical tool, depending on what God it is associated with. The Silver Key of Sut Typhon
can unlock any lock and open any gate regardless of place or physicality, the Crimson Staff of
Cthugha can create blood-red firestorms that scorch armies of men, entire lakes or even other fires
till nothing remains and so on. Whatever the artefact is, it will be a highly powerful weapon for these
times, and also have the ability to awaken any latent eldritch powers when touched to a being, such
as distant heritage to a Lovecraftian beast in their familial past. If they already had such powers, combining the artefact with their bodies could not only massively enhance those otherworldly
abilities and make them far easier to control but also grant them new ones similar to what the
artefact itself possessed or enhance further still the ones they already have if the being already had
similar powers. The Silver Key with a heir of Sut Typhon could result in a being that can travel to any
place, any time, any dimension with ease and little time spent. "

now, vastly more even than one infused with the blood of a dragon. Even as a beginner, your spells
could tear through entire castles and leave just ash and ruins behind. What would you be like once
you became truly skilled? Beyond your raw power and energy, which is already only equaled by the

ruination of her enemies. And now there are two such Witches. While you are not a magus on
Morgan’s level, you can certainly claim to equal her as a Witch, having immense skill in curses, charms, potion making and all sorts of nasty rituals and monster based magics, enough to threaten
an entire country with the right preparation and resources. As well, the curse that lies deep within
Britain, a black energy of hate and fury, now infects you as well as it does Morgan, the evil sister of
King Arthur. This black energy has suffused you totally, imbuing your supernatural abilities and
magical energy with many times their normal intensity and weight, despite not increasing the
amount itself. Thus the energy is several times more powerful and just as much more efficient. Just
contact with this energy can harm others as well, as it corrupts, warps and destroys that which it
touches, though this side of it can be suppressed."
880,,600,Scarred Path ,Kara no Kyokai,Source,"Limitations are just barriers to be conquered. Every misery that is thrown down in your path is a step to rise even higher, to use the flaws that cripple your body to enhance your magic ever further. You find that when your body suffers and parts are lost to you, your magic will soon compensate, providing not only additional talent in a related field of magecraft to whatever part of you has been crippled but a sudden breakthrough to effectively replace it. The loss of your sight may result in developing a sudden breakthrough in clairvoyant spells or magecraft that allows for ESP that not only replaces your lost sight but may outright surpass it. A mangled arm may provide the inspiration to greatly increase your level of skill with telekinetic magecraft or some other kinetic field, allowing you to manipulate things from afar with natural ease and immense force, seemingly costing little energy to do so. It takes time, weeks or even months, for these talents to bloom but once they do, they will remain even if you regain what you originally lost. "
881,,600,Magic Gunner ,Tsukihime,Source,"A thousand kilometers on a single liter of gasoline. A vehicle like that is fairly amazing, isn’t it? When it comes to magic, you’re the same way - even if you’re cursed with a total lack of talent in magic or even a tiny handful of magical circuits, you know how to get the best result out of it sheerly through efficiency that defies all expectations. To put it more simply, a single ‘drop’ of prana can generate a result that would normally require one-hundred, greatly enhancing simple spells and letting you easily pay for more expensive ones without draining your body completely. This doesn’t change what a human body can safely output, but when you have reserves to spare and destructive power to give weight to even the simplest spells and curses, what can stop you? You’re a living artillery platform, loaded and ready to fire."
882,,600,The Rituals ,Kamen Rider Neo-Heisei Part 2,Source,"You’ve done it. After all this time and research, it’s been made clear. The secrets of the universe have revealed a set of amazing powers to you. The first ritual is but a taste of the power, the ritual to create a Doll. Dolls are reanimated replicas of people, dead or alive. They constantly burn up small amounts of mana to sustain themselves, but are otherwise completely believable and in many respects “people.” The ritual to feed them mana is also included, and the materials to create a Doll are not difficult to find all things considered. (Insert your own comments about human transmutation.) However, that’s not where the interest lies. The REAL interest lies in the Ritual of the Sabbath. You may through a half hour of preparation make a pretty wide area, about a city block, the location of a Sabbath. When a time of simultaneous day and night(Eclipses, Sundowns, Sunsets) happens, the Sabbath will occur and one of two effects of your choice will take place. You may either initiate a “White Sabbath” and have the Sabbath infuse and create Gates, or begin a “Dark Sabbath” have everyone in the Sabbath face their Phantom. By creating Gates, you’ve essentially introduced magic potential into a wide amount of people at once...even in worlds where magic doesn’t exist. They won’t be able to use it at first, but any system or method of magic becomes available to them and perhaps they’ll even develop their own if left alone. However, creating Phantoms through the Sabbath is a much more immediately rewarding from a research point of view. They are able to directly tap into the power of Magic in ways Gates alone cannot, and as magically potent beasts with unique powers and capabilities...There’s a lot of benefits to having a large number of Phantoms around for those who seek opportunity. Spare parts, a magically delicious snack, test subjects, new abilities to absorb or pure muscle...They can be a lot of things, if you’re willing to have others pay the price. Unfortunately, the Dark Sabbath has two drawbacks. The first is that the Phantoms are not loyal to you as a matter of course, and may see you as just something in their way or to be used. Secondly, not everyone in a Dark Sabbath will die and become a Phantom. Though the capability is rare, those with the strength of will to survive and become Hope can tame their Phantom and become a Wizard. While this may be a benefit if you can get their loyalty, they will often also be the type to oppose you for initiating a Dark Sabbath.

(CG Note: The rest of this perk requires The Missing Piece - Kamen Rider Neo-Heisei Part 2 first.)

There is a “Missing Piece” to these Rituals that could complete their usefulness…

Well, of course you’ve found it.

When initiating a Sabbath, an additional component or two will allow you to create a Sabbath Seal on the Phantoms or Gates created in the meanwhile. Sealed Gates will already have a stronger idea of how to use their magic immediately, while Sealed Phantoms will become loyal to you (though they can break free if they are stronger than you, and Wizards will always be able to break the Seal.)

You understand the flow of the energy, and what gives a star seed the ability to project a physical body to protect itself from the corruption of the outside world. You can now rip out the star seed of someone, and use it for your own gain. When you blast someone with a special ray, A flower will bloom from the person’s forehead. Their star seed will float out for you to collect. You could use a star seed to empower yourself, create a powerful, sentient and intelligent minion out of this star seed, or use it as a great power source.

885,,600,Down The Rabbit Hole ,DC Occult,Source,"You have the peculiar ability to borrow power from others. By touching someone – or something – else, you may temporarily steal any and all magical abilities they have. There is theoretically no true limit on the number of powers you can hold, but the more you steal, the less time you will be able to hold it. For instance, power stolen from the Spectre would flee your grasp in mere moments, where power stolen from a normal magician could be used for hours on end.

You also gain all of their knowledge relating to the use of the stolen powers. Be aware that this may also result in other odd reactions; stealing the power from a rhyming demon would compel you to speak in rhymes, for instance. Stealing power that is sufficiently alien to you may result also in catatonia or damage to your sanity.

And one final thing: your clothes transform into a hybrid of yours and those of the beings you steal power from while you retain the power. Not that big of a deal, but stealing from a ton of different people may result in some horribly unfashionable outfits.

You cannot use the power you steal to permanently increase your own power in any way.

886,,600,Outside Help ,DC Occult,Source,"Sometimes, you alone aren't enough. Sometimes your magic needs some extra oomph.

You know how to tap into external sources of power, whether it be leylines, artifacts, or a group of sorcerers channeling their power to you. You can weave this power into vast spells capable of amazing things greater than the sum of its parts, and you can handle far more of this power than would otherwise be possible. But even then, it puts a great strain on your body and mind, and even you have limits - limits that it will push you past if you're not careful.

Your skill with this can grow in time, allowing you to reach over truly vast distances to draw power. Should the need be great enough and you have some method of reaching out to them, you could spread your net over the whole of the world, asking thousands of magical beings and sorcerers to lend you their power. Of course, you’ll need to actually convince them to do so, but if the entire magical world was putting up a united front, you could be a valuable player in such a game.

This also allows you to power magic with other forms of supernatural energy. After all, when you really get down to it, there’s not that much of a difference in the power inherent in a soul or the chi that rests within the body from the energy you use to cast your spells, is there?

Shrugging off addictive magic would be a small fee, but who can put a true value on something so priceless as a human soul? ...What’s that? You can quantify the value of a human soul? Well that doesn’t seem entirely moral, but if you’re willing to pay the exorbitant fee it would surely entail, who am I to stop you?

891,,600,Pandora’s Box ,Justice League Dark,Source,"The real Pandora’s Box was long believed to be a chest which held within it all the evils of the world and was opened by the eponymous Pandora -- because goddammit, you don’t just give someone a box and expect them to not be curious, right? In reality, the box was a portal to an alternate universe, where everything was twisted and villains ruled the earth. In any case, this is not that box.

It’s not a box at all, point of fact. This is simply a replica of the real thing, which takes the shape of a human skull – with the addition of a third eye socket in the center of the forehead and the fact that the top of the skull is removeable. Instead of leading to an alternate earth, this particular skull simply acts as a doorway to a dimension of endless pure magic. Any attempts at travelling through to this dimension will inevitable fail, but when opened, the magic will flow unceasingly from the skull – at least until it’s closed again.

You can use this magical energy for whatever, from powering artifacts or rituals to simply
recharging or amplifying your own power. Just so you realize, just because the amount of magic in the other dimension is infinite, the amount that can flow through at once is very much not so. After all, just because you hook a fire hydrant to the ocean doesn’t mean you can instantly flood a city, does it?

892,,600,Hasty Hexer ,Young Justice,Source,"You don’t always have time for lengthy rituals; you need that spell now! You can substitute any required ritual for some of your inner energy, making a spell that would require hours of work happen instantly at the cost of making you extremely tired. If you happen to have mana or other magical energies like that within you, you can substitute those instead. Burning through all your energy in a short span of time can be dangerous and possibly fatal if you push it too far, but experienced magic users are unlikely to do so accidentally."
893,,600,Order/Chaos Magic ,Young Justice,Source,"The forces of Order and Chaos have always been at war with each other, and you’ve just picked a side. You can only choose one type of magic by purchasing this, and you can’t make this purchase multiple times. Order magic has a focus on protection and restoring the natural balance of the world, and is capable of negating and reflecting destructive magic and energy as well as repairing objects and healing others. Order magic is also capable of undoing the damage that Chaos magic and other corruptions have done, and can ward against it with near perfect ability if used preemptively. Chaos magic on the other hand is about corrupting and perverting nature and the elements to suit the user’s will, and can be used to cause plants and animals to grow in size and hostility, as well as to create powerful magical constructs to harass and attack your enemies. Chaos Magic is also capable of transmuting objects, though not into or from materials with supernatural qualities. Both types of magic allow their users to create force fields, shoot magical bolts, as well as fly. Users of Order Magic may be stronger than Dr. Fate or on par with him depending on his host, but users of Chaos Magic are much weaker than Klarion."
894,,600,Hand of a God​ ,The Gods Are Bastards,Source,"No mere priest, but a Paladin, your god has declared you their hand on earth. Able to channel almost inhuman amounts of divine energy, and capable of matching a Legion on your own, you are a high ranking member of your faith by default, and can summon a warhorse.

895,,600,...And Deeper Than Despair ,Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline,Source,"It can be called many things. Love. Insanity. Mania. Sorrow. These are intense and powerful emotions, things that would usually make one spiral into despair, and spell doom for a Magical Girl. But you, you’re something else. You’re a Devil, the very antithesis of how magic in this world works. You may greatly enhance any magic you use, from this world or otherwise, by channeling your most intense emotions into it...though this has a bias towards things like ‘murderous insanity’ or ‘obsessive love’, being most powerful when those are in use. This even has the luxury of making your Soul Gem completely separate from your emotional state - even if it is on the verge of shattering from energy loss, you’ll still be your old self. The same goes for any force that dares to try and change your emotions against your will, finding your mind and heart will be as still as a stone.
"
896,,600,Hidden Power ,Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline,Source,"Kyubey was amazingly persistent in wanting to make a contract with you, and now you can see why. Your magical potential is much greater than the average Magical Girl, whether from winning the superpower lottery or some twist of fate. All magical abilities you have from this world or otherwise greatly increase in potency, and you will find both your Soul Gem and internal energies in your body will have much more energy available to burn for said magic. This is enough that you could potentially fight a swarm of the strongest Wraiths and live to tell the tale, and you will quickly become both admired and feared for this might. Imagine if all that potential went to waste, huh? Good thing you made a contract.

897,,600,Shard of a Selfless Wish ,Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline,Source,"A wish that truly gives back to others, yet asks for nothing in return...such a thing isn’t meant to exist in this world, yet, here it is. And such a thing could perhaps change the world. Holding onto this pink shard increases your own magical power greatly and gradually replenishes lost energy. ‘Burning’ this shard will let you dramatically increase your magical power tenfold, though the boost is temporary and will be lost afterwards until your next jump. Notably, any magic given towards aiding or healing others without any expectation of a reward, karmic or otherwise, are most powerful when used with this Shard.
"
898,,600,Conduit ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Source,"The core of your golem form was made in a special way, so as to make your entire body a conduit to the spiritual realm. Your entire body races with power, granting you increased strength and speed but the real advantage of this trait is what those allies around you will gain. As a conduit, you will not benefit yourself, but you will greatly empower the magics of all friendly magic users within a good distance around your own body. The open connection to the spirit realm bolsters their energy, reduces the strain they must meet to cast and allows them to do so with much greater power than normal. This conduit hood seems to affect even magics from other worlds or things that are not strictly magical in nature, yet still operate on similar principles."
899,,600,Class Card Heart ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Source,Through some manner you have permanently gained the abilities of a chosen class card. You are free to choose any class card from the items list and wield its abilities naturally.
900,,600,Refined Lesser Grail ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Source,"As a lesser grail your magical capacity is immense, far beyond any modern magus. You also have access to a technique that involves temporarily converting part of your nervous system into an artificial magical circuit, a very dangerous procedure with a very high chance of death. If you were to use this technique to its fullest, converting your blood, muscles, nerves and everything you have into a magical circuit then for a brief instant you would be able to overpower even Ea, the sword that divided the heavens from the earth. Of course such power doesn’t come without a cost, utilising it to its fullest will damage your body to the point that without some means of healing the damage it causes to your body utilising it more than once per jump would prove fatal."
901,,600,Wishcraft ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Source,"As a candidate for the formation of the artefact known as the Holy Grail you have the ability to realise wishes. What this means is that given sufficient magical energy you can skip the thaumaturgical processes and steps that a magus would usually need for Magecraft and recreate miracles through the use of magical energy, allowing you to achieve magical feats through sheer power rather than skill. What this means is that you are capable of performing spells without knowing how to cast them at a cost exponentially greater than the amount someone who knew how to perform the spell would pay. Given that you are an existence born to bring dreams into reality you are also able to bring hope to those bereft of it by showing them the hope that they had lost long ago."
902,,600,The Dark Omen ,Warhammer Fantasy: Beastmen,Source,"Blessed were you, at birth. Born with a pair of oil-black wings, like The Crowfather himself. Your magical force sees substantial augmentation - empowering you to rival great sorcerers and priests of enemy nations, a monster comes to bring doom upon their civilization. The Empire will learn to wail at the signs of your passing, the Wood Elves will know to scream in horror at the abominations you bring to their door, and the Dawi will shrivel their beards as they cower in their tunnels and hovels, for your presence is a portent of disaster for any foes. It matters not the event that occurs - where you walk, where you act, where you cast, will be a site of terrible doom against those you hate. Beastmen will venerate you, and Mankind will hate you."
903,,600,That’s My Bulma! ,Dragon Ball Super,Source,"There is an inextricable link between Ki and emotions but it is not a link that is equally strong for all beings. For some, getting angry may see only a small boost in power. For others, it may be quite massive indeed. And for some, the difference becomes incomparable. You are able to channel any of your emotions into raw power, greatly enhancing your ki or similar supernatural energies with even weaker emotions. Drawing on every day anger may multiply your ki two or three times over, whilst seeing a loved one harmed could invite thousands or tens of thousands of times as much power as you normally have access to, depending on how deeply you fall into that rage. The abilities linked to the energy you supercharge with your emotions, such as combat techniques or special powers, will also grow in scale with the energy. If you can learn to control yourself even while feeling immense rage or hatred, you could even maintain these boosts for long periods of time, as otherwise they’ll be very tiring to keep going.

904,,600,Fallen Star Heart ,Neverland: The RPG,Source,"Like Captain Hook, you have placed a Fallen Star inside your chest cavity (you can choose an alternate part in your body if you wish). And as everyone on Neverland knows, Fallen Stars are incredibly magical and cause magic to go awry. Any spell cast on you will flare up with uncontrollable magic and random effects. This also affects any spell you cast. The spell might fail, or be delayed, or hit a different target, or even invert its effect. That’s not even getting into crazier possible effects such as making people and/or their body parts change size, summoning elemental spirits, causing snow or rain, or making shoes turn into wooden clogs. You can dispel the Fallen Star from your body when you want to avoid the chaotic effects and resummon it at will. See Notes for a longer list of potential star surge effects.

905,,600,Major Arcana - Magician,Wonderland No More,Source,"You are a Tarot Card, but not just any common card: you’re one of the Major Arcana, which Alice/Victoria herself refused to create out of fear for their greater power and will. If you are a Card, the suit and number you received earlier is in fact your disguise to hide your true identity. If you are not a Card to begin with, then you get the Major Arcana Tarot Card as an extra form. Either way, the actual power associated with the card remains with you across forms.

Magician- This Tarot Card could be Queen Victoria’s greatest boon or enemy in her goal to conquer the real world, for this card overcomes Wonderland’s usual weakness to disbelief in the outside world. The power of the Magician lets you fully access and utilize belief-based magics and powers without rationality, disbelief, and the like interfering with the magic. A lack of belief in your setting may still prevent you from accessing bonuses or boosts to your belief-powered magic, but the disbelief won’t hurt or neutralize that magic either.

If you are not a Card to begin with, then you get the Major Arcana Tarot Card as an extra form. Either way, the actual power associated with the card remains with you across forms.

Hermit- Whenever you destroy something that you personally owned, you gain a temporary boost to your powers (strength, defense, magic, etc.). The level and duration of the boost increases with the cumulative value of the sacrificed item – both the overall value of the item and its personal value to you."
907,,600,Cauldron of the Great Maw ,Warhammer Fantasy: Ogre Kingdoms,Source,"A great golden cooking pot, big as the biggest Tyrants, and with many chains to pull it by. This is a most holy artefact of the Great Maw, one granted only to those favoured as its prophets. The cauldron empowers the cook in charge of its magic. The more meat and peoples butchered and thrown into it, the greater the power it stores becomes. Gut Magic receive by far the greatest benefit, becoming capable of terrifying spells hundreds of times beyond what an ordinary Butcher can manage with a fully filled pot but even unrelated magics can be empowered many times over with sufficient sacrifices to the cauldron. When that power is used up, the corresponding amount of meat will disappear from the pot, sent to the Great Maw as a sacrifice.

908,,600,Life Leeching ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Source,"From every death comes power. The Amethyst Order knows the temptation of this power, for it is vast indeed. Legend has it that the Magisters of your Order can tear the spirit from a man and trap it forever, crush his heart within his chest with but a thought, and wither a man instantly to dust. For one as gifted as yourself in the arts of Shyish, all of these are true, and for each life reaped by your spells of death or decay, your stores of magic are replenished a small, but appreciable amount. von Draken herself would be impressed by your power over Shyish. You are become Death, the destroyer of worlds.

909,,600,Herald of the Horned One ,Warhammer Fantasy: Skaven,Source,"Even amidst the priesthood, there is violent competition. The Seerlord holds control, with every Grey Seer beneath him vying to oust the rat from his seat at both the head of clergy and the Council of Thirteen. But there is one position every Seer dearly wants to clutch with claw and soul - that of Speaker, they who speak the will of the Horned Rat. Typically, this falls to the disturbingly reverent and pious Seerlord - but occasionally there is one chosen by the Father of Rats, chosen to be his Herald and push skavendom into The Great Ascendancy.

910,,600,Moon Staff of Lileath ,Warhammer Fantasy: High Elves,Source,"Ha, looking to supplant Teclis in the goddess’s favor? This staff is king among its kind when it comes to ‘casting focus,’ dramatically augmenting your magical capacity and almost nullifying the possibility of miscasting. More so, given Lileath’s position as daughter of Isha the staff particularly functions well as a conduit for the winds of Life, filling you with an overflowing vitality that renders you very difficult to kill... Also, the staff is crowned with a full likeness of the goddess herself, and the likeness is naked.
"
911,,600,Greatest of Fairies ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventure,Source,"It’s never been quite clear how the relationship works, but Fairies seem to be able to convert Rupees into an energy of some kind. Some Great Fairies will refuse to so much as speak to mortals without the proper bribe, and I can’t quite imagine them spending it on a night out on the town. For you though, this applies to anything that is offered to you, be it Rupees other Fae desire or a more traditional offering of a newborn goat or something equally silly. These offerings create an extra store of energy within you, one you can spend on anything you like. It even comes prefilled with enough energy to turn a farm boy halfway into a hero from sheer ‘blessings’ alone, as befitting your new status as a Great Fairy. Speaking of blessings, you’ve also learned how to spend this energy on people, places, even certain pieces of equipment to upgrade them. Perhaps you’ll raise the potency of his bombs, or double his own magical reserves?
"
912,,600,Power of Darkness ,Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,Source,"While the Triforce of Power may be difficult to reach without the proper channels, you’d be a prime candidate for it’s inheritance with your vicious, fiery desire - and in the meantime you have some other ways of approaching the Sorcerer King’s strength at his peak.

By harnessing the life energy and light of the the land around you, you can gain greater physical and magical might, allowing you to perform destructive magical attacks and float upon your own power - this draining process turning the land into darkened wasteland fit only for the dead and the dying. Though if you wish to spare the land this destruction, you could take this suffering upon yourself - forcing yourself to suffer the inner pain and darkness of the people in order to claim this strength. This is more merciful and seen as noble - but if you lose your composure in the face of this agony yo could cause even more damage in your panicked throes.

You could easily replicate Ganondorf’s prime strength in combat by taking this to its limit and as part of this set of abilities, you can tap into this strength without restraint for the final burst of power -transforming into a monstrous titan capable of sending even Hyrule Castle crashing down. Power comes from being willing to sacrifice, be it yourself or others...wield it as you wish.

913,,600,The Ocarina of Time ,Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,Source,"A unique instrument, the Ocarina of Time is one of the vital keys to opening the Door of Time and accessing the Sacred Realm. For this reason alone it is quite a treasure of the Royal Family - but even beyond that, you’ll find that magical music played upon this Ocarina is enhanced greatly, to the point of being able to turn day to night with a song usually meant to summon the light of the Sun for a brief moment.

914,,600,The Flame Of Sorrow ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages,Source,"The Flame of Sorrow is the true purpose of the black tower. Gathering all that negative energy in one place, bundling it up into a spark of dark fire... and then sending it off to the desert near Hyrule? Odd. Regardless, you have a lesser copy of it. Or maybe you simply siphoned off a small part? Either way, the Flame of Sorrow can best be described as ‘things get worse’. Young people make poor decisions, married couples break up, lifelong friends try to kill each other, the arrogant become caricatures of their former selves. Not all at once, mind you, but little by little it builds up. And as it does so, it converts that sorrow into magical energy for you to use. Not exactly a good thing to have in a stable kingdom, but hey, it’s not your kingdom now is it?"
915,,600,Rod Of Seasons ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons,Source,"The Rod of Seasons is Din’s staff of authority, a tool of great power that requires wisdom to truly use. An ironic twist on the principles of the Triforce. With the blessing of the Season Spirits - something you are assumed to have by default - and a small application of the Golden Goddesses beloved time travel, you can force the seasons to change in an instant. Smaller usages of power are possible, but the staff specializes in wide area effects. A simple fireball is far harder to pull off than a raging fire storm powered by the spirit of summer. However, given that the Rod of Seasons need a contract or blessing to have any power, I have adapted it slightly to become capable of channeling more than just those four spirits powers. Specifically, any god or great spirit you have a blessing from is one you can channel the power of through this staff.
"
916,,600,Take The Light For Yourself ,Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks,Source,"On more than one occasion, the light has been a critical ingredient in bringing back the darkness. There’s probably something to be said about light casting a shadow, or how shadows are created by the presence of light. Ignoring such tripe sayings, as a being of the darkness you’ve found a way to make yourself stronger via the light. Most demons would crack and break, turn to dust and dwindle away, but not you. Of course, you will need something between you and the light, because as a demon it’s still the bane of your existence. If you weren’t one it would be fine, but alas. Perhaps if you were to possess a body of someone talented in the manipulation of Light magic and its derivatives? Yes, if you were to manage that, your own dark powers would surely rise. In fact, any stolen power now shares this effect, your stolen ‘light’ only serving to amplify your ‘dark’ powers. Or fire and water, or wind and earth, those rival elements and their ilk. After all, the brighter the light, the darker the shadow.

917,,600,Wind Waker ,Legend of Zelda: the Wind Waker,Source,"The Wind Waker is a magical conductor’s baton, capable of controlling the flow of the wind. It can also do other things, through the use of various songs, but I’m only giving you the wind’s requiem. Specifically, up, left, right, will allow you to set the direction of the wind at will. You could also experiment with adding notes to do something like cause a hurricane or something similar. For more general use, the Wind Waker acts as a massive magical amplifier for wind based magic, and can create entire orchestra's to go along with whatever simple melody you actually conduct with it.

918,,600,Triforce of Wisdom ,Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess,Source,"You have been blessed by Nayru, one of the three Goddesses and the creator of all laws. You are naturally intelligent and the Triforce of Wisdom itself helps you make decisions, giving you wisdom far beyond even the wisest of sages. You can also wield powerful light magic, shooting bolts of energy or creating magical runes to attack your enemies and even infusing weapons or projectiles with light. You are also unaffected by the Twilight, letting you keep your physical body even when the land is saturated with it.

919,,600,Well of Magicka ,The Elder Scrolls,Source,"All practitioners of the arcane know that magicka leaks into Nirn through the Sun and Stars, holes into Aetherius itself. Your pool of magicka is heavily bolstered, rivaling that of the greatest mages in history, as is the potency of any spells you cast. You could be throwing fireballs all day without effort, and you may pour more magicka into a spell to overcharge it to such a degree that the simple Flames spell could rout armies with great effort."
920,,600,Amulet of Kings ,The Elder Scrolls,Source,"Also known as the Chim-el-Adabal, this is commonly worn by Cyrodillic emperor's who possess the dragonblood, anyone else will find it slipping off the neck. Yours won't have that problem, as it can only be worn by you and those you allow. Not only can it be used as proof of claim to practically any throne or position, but it can reinforce boundaries of the world when worn, making it even more difficult for Daedra and the like to enter the world en masse."
921,,600,Wabbajack ,The Elder Scrolls,Source,"A Daedric Artifact of Sheogorath, Daedric Prince Madness, this magical staff is completely unique. Just like the Mad God who made it, it's effects are impossible to predict. It may shoot a fireball, turn the target into a chicken or dragon, heal them of all wounds, or make them explode in a shower of gold and sweet rolls. I'm sure you'll have a lot of fun with this."
922,,600,Archmage Robes ,The Elder Scrolls,Source,"The ultimate symbol of the Archmage of the College of Winterhold, it definitely lives up to its hype. This outfit not only decreases the amount of magicka all of your spells would otherwise cost, but greatly increases your total pool of magicka as well as the rate in which your magicka regenerates, and is as protective as steel armor."
923,,600,Staff of Magnus ,The Elder Scrolls,Source,"The weapon of the Father of Magic himself, Magnus' staff is a potent weapon. It can drain vast quantities of magicka from people and magical objects, storing them until it's user calls upon it to power whatever spell they are using. Should people run out of magicka to drain, it will instead drain their lifeforce before converting it into magicka."
924,,600,Wielder of Power ​,Persona 4,Source,"You are The One who Rules over Power, so it's only natural that you could use it. Now, you can use the power contained or sealed away in any object, such as your compendium, freely with no resistance or consequences as if it was your own. This goes for things like ancient sealed evils as well. As long as you are in some way in contact with the object, you gain full control of its power. You can also use this to take that power away from other users, or usurp their control. After all, you rule Power, so it's not like it could disobey you. This also applies to magical tools, or other objects that have effects upon activation, but don't actually contain the energy inside of itself."
925,,600,Faux Cultist (Boosted) ,Terraria,Source,"The power granted to the Lunar Cultists is great, but it also comes at a terrible cost. Lucky you, that you are able to gain some of that benefit, while avoiding the negative consequences. You are able to pick one of the four Lunar Pillars, or the Moon Lord himself, and you can tap into and channel a portion of their power, gaining abilities related to them in the process. The amount of power channelled is ultimately limited, though it is still a tremendous power boost, but your theft is also hidden from their perception. So unless you do something like channel the power of the Moon Lord right in front of him, your ‘patron’ won’t suspect a thing, and you won’t have to pay the typical costs of servitude and potential madness.

926,,600,Scales of Balance,Danmachi,Source,Links all of your basic abilities together making the excellia that you gained are equally distributed in each of your basic abilities making it that as one attribute grows the remaining attribute grows as well equally. A small portion of the gained excellia is distributed to all of your developmental skills allowing it to grow in a steady rate making it likely to increase in rank every time you level up. In exchange for these benefits the user is unable to level up unless all of their basic abilities reach the maximum cap of Rank-S-999.
927,,600,Internalized Power ,Danmachi,Source,"Having a power that you gained through hard-work and dedication, only for it to be gone the moment your god is killed or returned to Tenkai is a bummer. In this world your own Falna doesn’t need the support from your god. Even if they are killed or returned to Tenkai your Falna would still keep working. While you would lose the ability to update your Falna until you leave the jump, it would be better than losing everything and needing you to join another Familia to access your powers granted by your Falna again. Beyond this jump, you learned how to make the powers that are given to you or acquired through a ritual become your own and internalize it, becoming something innate and permanent to you."
928,,600,All Hail Me ,Konosuba,Source,"Oh my, are you thinking of making an attempt to overthrow the Gods? You’d have to forgive us for thinking so, when you draw power in a very similar way to how the Gods do. You draw power from being worshipped, naturally and on an active level if need be. Just having worshippers will naturally add a little pool of magical energy that you can draw upon but in emergencies, you are able to ask for them to offer up more to you from their personal stores. More worshippers will increase your base pool of energy but the level of faith and fanaticism that each worshipper has will also increase the amount they give. A large number of casual adherents to your faith may still give a sizable pool of energy to draw on but it’d be nothing compared to a similar sized number of believers that are genuinely faithful and reverent of you."
929,,600,The Pain Only Makes Me Harder To Break ,Konosuba,Source ,"What might weaken another man only brings you higher. What makes heroes falter causes you to feel like you’re on cloud nine. Be it humiliation, pain, fear or misery, it’s just going to get you going faster, stronger and harder. Suffering improves your power and speed and durability, both physically and with your magic or powers. The greater you suffer, be it physical or emotional pain, the greater the benefits you will receive from this. The best gains can be made when it comes from other people or enemies rather than yourself, though hurting yourself will still see you receive a lesser benefit from this ability. Putting you down will be a very tough task as only the strangest of attacks will not cause you to grow in power, such as those that cause no pain and cannot be noticed to be embarrassed over. Once the pain lessens, the gains you have will lessen too and disappear entirely if the pain does so. "
930,,600,Power Of God,Genshin Impact,Source ,"Like men, not all gods are created equal. Some are far more powerful than others. There are those gods who are little stronger than a Vision user, but on the opposite end of the spectrum there are those Gods who could contest against the Archons, able to split islands apart with a single slash or flip mountains on their heads with a raise of their hand. You are on the latter half of the scale. As far as gods go, you are one of the more powerful ones. This does not give you more skill or knowledge, but in terms of raw power no mortal is close to your match and neither are many gods."
931,,700,Essences(Tier 7),Shin Megami Tensei V,Source ,"Essences hold the power of Demons within them. Every Demon has one, from a lowly Pixie to a mighty Storm God. As such the prices can vary vastly. However they apply by the same rules of purchasing Demon as a race. As such the Essence of a Pixie would only cost you 100 CP while the most powerful of Aogami would cost 700 CP. Essences bought this way respawn once per day.

Note: You can not purchase the Essence of the Demifiend, Shiva or Lucifer with this option. Nice try.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"

In addition to that he learned that he was destined to become the Demiurge and inherit its godlike power. He has yet to claim it, but he knows that he will not be able to avoid it forever. This perk allows you to acquire a similar fate. You may choose to be a reincarnation of a character from the setting you are in as well as the inheritor of another. Your reincarnation choice must be a character who is deceased in the jump like how Scarlet Witch’s son had died before Wiccan was born. The being you choose to inherit however does not have to be dead. They will offer you their position and power which you may claim at any time. The only reason Wiccan did not become the new Demiurge is because he did not want to claim it. Post jump you may choose two more individuals as your reincarnation and inheritor."
933,,700,Magical Hair,Rapunzel’s Tangled Adventure,Source ,"You are infused with magic, and this is expressed through your hair to the point that it glows with an inner light of a distinct. This magic can be called upon to provide two innate effects when channeled through song. You can choose a type or nature of magic to have your hair infused with but it can not be the domain and color of either the Sundrop Flower or Moonstone Opal. The first innate magical effect must be related to the domain like the Sundrops Light and Healing, or the Moonstones Earth and Decay, while the second must be a more offensive ability like the Sundrops levitation / flight and light / energy blasts, or the Moonstones black rock generation / manipulation and lightning / electricity generation.

For an additional 100 CP you can gain the same effects that Rapunzel did when she touched the black rocks and absorbed a bit of the Moonstone Opals power. This will turn your hair completely unbreakable and prehensile, though since you are paying for this your hair is completely under your control, though it may still act on its own to occasionally help."
934,,800,Eldritch God,Old Man Henderson,Source ,"Oh going for the big guns? Well you can also be one of the Eldritch Monstrosities worshipped by cultists. You are roughly a match for the King in Yellow but you cant just walk directly on a Planet. You must be summoned by a Cult and take the Summoning Sickness Drawback for no points. Other than that, you enjoy the power and immortality that comes with it. Powerful telekinesis, creating spawnlings and even affect reality itself, your presence incomprehensible to the mortal mind."
935,,800,Light-Drinker ,The Silmarillion,Source ,"Even in this age of legends, you are a monster great heroes would fear to face. Your peers are the likes of Glaurung and Carcharoth, and with time you might grow to equal the might of Ungoliant or Ancalagon the Black. Where before you would grow slowly with your increasing age and that growth would eventually plateau, now age will only ever make your monstrous power greater. This is an uncapper for any powers which increase with age, or which represent monstrous or inhuman power.

Additionally, you can grow even faster still by consuming others, whether physically or more spiritually. Dragons simply devour their prey, while wraiths might drain their life-force. Whatever the case, you can receive a mild but permanent boost to your strength by consuming beings of similar nature to yourself; a dragon devouring other beings of dark spirit would receive about a tenth of the victim’s strength, assimilating it into their own power over time. On the other hand, you can gain power much more efficiently by consuming beings or powers opposed to your own. Like Ungoliant drinking the light of the Two Trees or Carcharoth consuming a Silmaril, taking into yourself such sources of power can allow you to grow greatly in might. However, this perk does not protect you against any effects such power may have upon you. Carcharoth’s existence was an agony after he devoured the hand of Beren and the sacred jewel it held. In either case, this does not give you the powers or abilities of the thing consumed, but rather uses that power to magnify your own."
936,,800,The Path of the Gods,Percy Jackson,Source ,"You may choose one god that you're housing a fragment of the power of. You may channel this power with your magic for many great feats within the portfolio of that god, however the fragment has a consciousness of its own and you must be largely in tune with its personality to draw upon its full might. If you manage to truly offend the fragment then it can cut off your access to any of its abilities until you make amends. On the other hand truly acting as one alongside the fragment can temporarily make you into a force of nature with your powers and the fragment's truly merging and getting exponentially more powerful. This is however quite hard to accomplish and is taxing to maintain. Being the host to a god warps your magic further towards that falling within the domain of your patron, however you will find it far harder to cast any magic diametrically opposed to that of your patron. The host of Ra for example may find magic having to do with light, order and fire far easier but would have trouble trying to perform spells of darkness, chaos, and water. In addition you may use symbols of your god or other items sacred to them as excellent foci without having to attune them. In the event you find that your current god and you no longer agree you may eject the fragment (destroying it), a quick ritual with another willing god present can allow you to receive a fragment of their power to replace the lost one. You may only have one fragment at a time.

937,,800,Star God Reborn ,Warhammer 40K: Necrons,Source ,"The galaxy is filled with war and destruction, unique and abominable horrors, and the chaos of countless races clawing their way among the stars. The Necron are the oldest and greatest now that the old ones are cast down, but the dread possibility that the C’tan will either restore themselves or in some dark corner of the stars remain yet unbroken gives even the Silent King pause. Unfortunately for them you do indeed exist. Instead of a fragment you are a fully-fledged Star God, with all the incredible reality warping might that imply. Your power is the kind that brought the Necrons from defeat and humiliation, trapped on a single world to a galaxy scarring force that shattered systems and cast down the godlike old ones that had so easily bested them before. Your kind consumed or scoured entire systems, punctured the unassailable webway to burn swathes of it in manic glee, and stood so powerful that only the entirety of the Necron race at the height of their power bound by programming to the Silent King were able to contest you and your brethren. Your powers and physical form are naturally beyond the scope of even the Transcendent perk above even as the least of the C’tan, and should you also possess that perk than you will be among the mightiest, spoken of in the same breath as others like the Nightbringer or Void Dragon. In a galaxy of decaying empires and shattered races those who might be able to oppose your personal power are so vanishingly rare as to be all but irrelevant. While you may still grow stronger in time, without feasts like cannibalizing the other star gods it is likely to remain a theoretical possibility rather than anything practical, which to the galaxy at large is about the only small mercy they can expect. Long may the Star Gods reign.

What he is and what it let him do won’t go unnoticed by the powers that be, who may seek to make their own tools in his image. Someone must have predicted this trend, given you already exist this early. However it came to be, you are an entirely artificial attempt at creating a replacement for the Spirit King, going beyond even a natural potential like Kurosaki to become something more. 

The basic part of this nature is that you are equally and innately part each of the Shinigami, Quincy, Hollow and Fullbringer races. This works via a free purchase of Hybridisation for each perk, set to make you a otherwise normal member of each race rather than any other variation. This otherwise works as normal for the Hybridisation perk in regards to discounts and such. 

More importantly are the countless tiny fragments you’ve been inserted with that originate from the Soul King. The raw power of these parts have given a royal tinge to your Reiryoku, giving you spiritual power equal to an experienced Shinigami Captain. Combined with meeting all requirements for the throne, you’ll start to see much more valuable developments as you age. Unlike a mere substitute for the King, you are a true successor, and will very slowly begin to develop the same powers on your own. Though the process will take several millennia at least to come close to finishing, you will slowly develop the same great and varied abilities as the King as your soul ages. Your spiritual power will naturally grow stronger from age, while new and incredible powers awaken in your various body parts. Provided you continue to develop yourself and experience life, the road to royalty will continue progressing regardless of how much you train in the combat arts."

Someone who has just torn apart an army of people bare handed and bathed in their blood may just become strong enough to rival someone like Sukuna. This is truly the perk for a genocidal maniac who wants the absolute destruction of something. Because even if you are losing the more damage the stronger. This also affects the area around you meaning that if you destroy a city in your battle you might just be able to win the fight that you started. Truly destruction is the only source of nourishment you require. And those that follow you seem to have a slightly lesser version of this perk. Meaning it’s time to cause some chaos.

941,,800,Monstrous,Fate/Grand Order Part 2,Source ,"If you’re not quite satisfied with matching the Grands of this World, then with this Rank you may go a step beyond. Powerful enough to be a natural calamity in your own right, at this level of power you can trivially, and indeed even accidentally, carve massive rends into the landscape around you.

One example of this Rank is Ivan the Terrible, in his primal Lostbelt form. Having fused with a giant mammoth and twisted into a monstrous form, he gained power over lightning and the weather to a lesser extent, to the point he could diminish the strength of an incredibly strong and cold blizzard in a city even while unconscious. Likewise, while sleeping he can conjure an endless number of Oprichniki, agents of his which range in power from Low to Mid Rank depending on their proximity to him. When woken up, he acts as a physical calamity in a very real sense, able to passively call down storms capable of leveling cities with its lightning, as well as wield lightning directly for even greater destructive power, not to mention the incredibly strong mountain-sized beastly body that he commands, able to flatten whole armies by simply slamming its trunk into the ground. It took several powerful Servants restraining him with another one weakening him with a musical Noble Phantasm merely for Chaldea to be able to fight against Ivan.

Another example of this Rank is Surtr, King of the Fire Giants. As the last remnant of Ymir’s wrath and a conceptual calamity, Surtr’s role is to end the Age of Gods of the Norse pantheon, but in his Lostbelt form he decided to go beyond and incinerate the whole Planet. His very body is the realm of Muspelheim, a realm of destructive fire that exists solely for pure destruction. Additionally, thanks to his nature as a Giant, his body can absorb energy from any incoming attacks up to a certain point, to replenish his own reserves. Additionally, he is able to use his flames in mimicry of the Mana Burst Skill, not only enhancing his own attacks, but even protecting against absurd temperatures and powerful attacks, on top of being able to cleanse deleterious magical effects on himself. And, of course, thanks to the immense heat of his flames, he can tear the region he is in apart by merely walking, the flames of his Muspelheim body spreading with each step and shattering the landscape on such a scale as to crack mountains and evaporate seas. And of course, thanks to his consumption of Fenrir, he is able to wield absolute freezing temperatures to the same degree as his flames. Thanks to his role, his powers are even more effective on divine beings. And finally, he knows some rune magecraft, mainly in such things as curses of death or unhealing wounds. His defeat entailed several sacrifices by powerful Heroic Spirits, the removal of the keystone keeping him anchored to reality, and the utilization of a Noble Phantasm enhanced by the Sirius Light. As a final note, this example of Surtr at the Monstrous Rank is specifically without his sword Laevateinn.

The protections imbued in the sphere prevent this amount of magicka from destabilizing reality, so by itself it doesn’t really do anything. You can link yourself to the sphere to have a virtually unlimited amount of magic reserves, but your output doesn’t change.

947,,800,Absorption,Marvel Zombies,Source ,"At first glance, it might seem like you’re a regular member of your species without any special abilities or powers. That’ll be disproven the moment you make physical contact with someone else, what makes them them is yours. Memories, expertise, psyche, powers, the whole shebang is now yours, temporarily. You hold the powers of whoever you touch for a duration of sixty times how long you were in contact. This will weaken them, potentially to lethal levels - you could render somebody comatose, or worse, if you used your power too much. In these prolonged cases, the power will rise above the sixtyfold limit, potentially making what you took yours, permanently, at the cost of permanently putting the original owner out of commission. Unlike Rogue, you can activate and deactivate this effect at will. There is no limit to the amount of powers you can drain, though too much will lead to repercussions. 

For all the benefits this brings, it’s a double-edged sword. Absorbing someone’s psyche and memories has its consequences, namely that each time, you’re sharing your mind with a whole load of new experiences. The minds of stronger people could potentially overwhelm yours, potentially making you a prisoner in your own body. Beings that dwarf you in power are resistant or immune to contact."

In addition you’ll find yourself with additional powers depending on which subchoice you make here, such Gods having their True Form which atomizes mere mortals upon eye contact, the Titans with their supernatural manipulation of their domains to the point of causing major disasters with ease, and Giants being unkillable unless laid low by both mortal and God. While this option can be taken alongside other parentages, at least two of your domains must me in the same ‘thematic’ as your ancestor to reflect the closeness in bloodline. A God who is the child of Zeus might end up as the God of rain, for example. Godly Restraint (if you are a Demigod) or Wrath of Olympus (if Titan/Giantborn) must be taken for this option, with no points extra to reflect your unique origin."
949,,800,Everyone’s Hero: The Ultimate Good        ,Avesta of Black and White,Source ,"What a grand figure you have become. Or will become, in due time. You are one gifted the fate of becoming the most brilliant light against the forces of darkness, for you have found yourself in the role of the greatest of the Ashavan as ‘everyone’s hero’. Yours is a destiny of greatness, one that collects all the hopes, dreams and prayers for a brighter future around you, and uses them to shape the path to the most magnificent epilogue. The more heroic acts you perform, the greater feats in battle you partake, the more this image of you as the greatest hero that ever was extends like wildfire, covering nations, even entire planets in mere weeks, growing faster and faster in what seems to be an endless momentum. And the more people join this collective ‘prayer’, the greater your power becomes, making you a living ‘miracle’. The unreachable Arch-Demons become just difficult threats, and even the dream of an ending to the eternal conflict of black and white seems like an actual possibility.

But this is far from your most potent ability. As the hero, it wouldn’t do if your victories were to go unrewarded. And what better place to start amassing your power than from your defeated foes? Each time you claim ‘victory’ over another, you take something special from them, and incorporate it into yourself. Be warned that this ability doesn’t make distinctions between foe and ally, as anyone that is ‘defeated’ by you gets something taken from them. It may be a special item, a power, a commandment or even things such as emotions, loyalties or a cosmic ‘role’.

Furthermore, it doesn’t even require that you defeat someone in a physical confrontation. As long as you prove your irrefutable victory over them, you will still take something from them. The more shaking and absolute your defeat is over your enemy, the more from their own core you can take. With time, even having the thought of admitting defeat before you will be enough for you to strip them of everything that makes them.

Now, once you have claimed your victory, these stolen abilities don’t stay as they were, and instead they are changed to suit your nature. You have little to no control over the result, but you can be sure that whatever you gain won’t be saddled with any weaknesses that it previously had, and at times you may find them even increasing in potency. As it is your right as the victor, you only take the good portions and leave the rest to your defeated foe. Using this privilege, you could take Commandments from others, without needing to abide by their vows, nor suffering any consequences of breaking the original restriction."

After his death, his power was congealed within this skull, which would have the ability to elevate someone else to the position of God of Death. Now, normally this would need to be another dead soul, but your skull is special, and can turn anyone into a God of Death. Just remember—you only receive one Shinigami Skull. Ever.

As the God of Death, you gain a massive increase to your physical and magical power, and have the ability to summon the acidic “waters” of the Sanzu no Kawa, the river that denotes the boundary of the underworld. You can summon the spirits from hell, forge souls into weapons, shields, or bullets, and can manipulate, summon, or destroy souls freely. Additionally, your arms and legs disconnect at the elbows and knees, with the ends of your limbs floating around your torso, which floats as though still supported by your legs; you can also create more limbs if you need them, and can manipulate your skeletal system to create spikes of bones. You may additionally summon bones, creating spikes from the ground or forming a barricade composed of skeletons.

951,,800,Blood Of Gods,Honkai Impact 3rd,Source ,"Fifty thousand years ago, those who would push back against the advent of Honkai were known as Fire MOTH (Myrmidons of Taskforce Honkai). With the technology they fielded, and the augmentative process known as ICHOR, they could fight the corruptive force on a much larger scale with soldiers that the present day can only dream of, but despite that, it still wasn’t enough as the Herrschers adapted and attacked their weaknesses. One by one they fell, until only 13 remained. They were called the Flame Chasers, and those 13 eventually sealed themselves away for the next era... And some did things the others felt unforgivable. Thus, only two survived to the present day: Kevin Kaslana, progenitor of the House of Kaslana, and Fu Hua, currently a class representative at St. Freya’s after a long and painful life trying to live up to the objectives laid down to her by MEI and failing. Even then, with the betrayals and manipulations Fu Hua suffered, and the sheer length of time Kevin was sealed in the Sea of Quanta, neither of them really are at their best in the current era. Well, maybe you can make that count three. Either you’re actually another Flame Chaser who hid themselves away until now, or an extremely rare successful attempt at recreating the process, because you can truly claim to embody what a Flame Chaser is in all its entirety. To put it simply, an ELF based on Kevin with only 1% of his power was able to completely stalemate Durandal, Schicksal’s strongest Valkyrie at the time, while destroying a huge chunk of the city of London in the process, the battle only ending because his battery ran out. While that is, again, based on Kevin, who is inarguably the greatest warrior the Previous Era ever knew, it is a testament to how much power Fire MOTH held at its disposal. You’re nowhere near his height, sure, but you’ve got more than Fu Hua has at this point in time."

958,,800,Divine Origin,Fate/Extra CCC,Source ,"The cause of your birth, and what you will return to in the end. That is the Origin of being. You are not merely what you seem to be, for you have great potential in you, potential able to contest even against the absolute. Should you perform the right ritual, involving letting someone dive into the deepest recesses of your own soul, and defeating the incredibly powerful guardian within, you will unlock a power beyond even the most powerful Servants. You would be able to contest against the Moon Cell itself on equal terms with such power, and any abilities that reject events, such as the Domina Coronam, will be unable to deny you. Additionally, you have a greater self, of sorts, a being even more powerful than even your unlocked potential, on the scale of the Goddess of the Sun, Amaterasu herself. There are caveats to both of these paths to your potential.

First, unlocking your Origin is a power greater than yourself. Without some way to upgrade your form, your soul, your mind, using the power of your Origin will strain you greatly, and you’ll only be able to use it once a fight in every jump lest it destroys you. Surely not a great downside, unless you are ambitious. Second, your Origin provides raw power, not scale or versatility. It’ll let you fight against the Moon Cell’s power concentrated into a single form, but the Moon Cell’s capacity to witness and record the past, present, and future, and to maintain an entire digital reality, are things your Origin has nothing to do with. Third, growing into your greater self will render the power of your Origin redundant, yet will require more than a simple ritual to obtain. An unbroken thousand years of daily effort will be required to reach the daunting scale of the Sun itself. Fourth, even after reaching the scale of a true Star, you might find some of your limbs obtaining minds of their own, based on fragments of your own personality, who will possess a measure of your own power. They are not guaranteed to be loyal or even able to get along with you, or each other, but they are based on you, so surely you wouldn’t be the kind of person to be intolerant of other instances of yourself? You could eject them from your being, but that would diminish you, and they might come back, angry at the betrayal. Perhaps it’d be best to learn how to get along."
959,,800,Fleshly God,Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Source,"A mere worshipper? How blasphemous, implying a true God of this world would ever bow their head
to another in supplication. Certainly not you, as you are an existence that may not have been seen
in this world for a very, very long time. An enfleshed God, a true and original form of what are mere
Divine Spirits in the later days of this world. A being of incalculable power and, perhaps, a similar
level of arrogance.

The base of your power is terrible indeed. While you may not possess the sheer versatility of some
of the other great beings to be found, you are nigh-unmatched in raw power, be it physical or
magical. The destruction of an entire continent would not require every bit of your power, just a
great deal of it, and it appears that the wells of energy you draw upon for magical uses are similarly
vast in scope, replenishing far quicker than most mortals would see due to your divine nature. Befitting your power, you need not remain in a human form. From a enormous, demonic dragon to a
mechanical alien, the Gods can take many different shapes and sizes, as you too now can. You may
design with very few restrictions your new physical form as a God. 

But brute power is far from that which makes you a god. That would be your place in the world. As a
true divine entity, you are the very highest class of natural spirit of the World. The World may not
love you but it certainly treats you as one of it’s most important agents, something that appears to
carry over to future worlds to some extent if you continue to act in your role. Alongside this place as
part of the World are your Authorities. The areas in which you have the right to govern and
command the World, what some may call the Domains of the Gods. You have three in total, for too many Authorities can cause divine beings like yourself to undergo unpleasant transformations of the
mind and soul. An Authority of Fire would grant near total control over fire and things linked to it, such as summoning blazes that envelop entire nations for years without burning out, igniting fury in
the hearts of men or enhancing the results of any forging efforts, along with likely countless other
potential uses. An Authority of Magic would allow for the manipulation of enormous amounts of
external magical energy, even within others, so that the God could easily defeat all but the greatest
mortal magicians, though the Authority may not be capable of much more than that due to it’s
breadth. The more broadly applicable that Domain is for any one God, the less depth of power it will
be capable of doing. Domains after all, are not dependent on your personal power. You are merely
commanding the World to change and it thus becomes so.

You are somewhat unique amongst Gods, having a certain attribute more commonly associated with
the terrific creatures that were Gods even before humanity began to worship them. Like these
beings outside of the Human Order, you do not depend on the worship of humanity for power and
neither would you change if their beliefs about you do change. You may optionally rid yourself of
this protection, allowing you to gain power as humans devote more faith and belief towards you but
this will also open you up to changing based on their beliefs. You might change in physical
appearance to match what your devotees consider to be the divine appearance of their God or even
change in personality to fit what your cult believes is true about you. "

For untold millennia, they have been locked in a metaphysical war, attempting to further the cause of Order or of Chaos. Primarily, this is accomplished by empowering mortal agents to act as proxies.

The most powerful and well-known example of this is Doctor Fate -- the manifestation of Nabu, the greatest and most powerful of the Lords of Order -- who channels his power through the Helm of Fate and those who wear it. But Nabu is far from the only Lord to empower his agents through artifacts and one such item has fallen into your possession.

You have some wearable object that contains the essence of a lesser Lord, whether of Chaos or Order. This item is bound to you, allowing you to summon it at-will, and when worn, grants you access to a large sum of magical power. This would be a formidable amount of power even in the hands of a mortal with none of their own, but it truly shines when worn by an already powerful being. The more powerful the person wearing the Vestments, the larger the increase in power will be.

As well, when worn, the ghost of the — now long-dead — Lord will whisper into your mind, teaching you powerful magic and prompting you to follow their agenda. The ghost will be completely unable to possess you unless you allow them to do so and the possession may be revoked by you at any time. You don't have to advance their cause, but they will be much more willing to teach you if you do so.

After this jump is over, you can silence the ghost or awaken it as you please.

With a second purchase (discounted if the first purchase wasn’t), you may gain the Vestments opposite of the ones first purchased, but both cannot be used together. Or, in place of having one for Order and one for Chaos, you may instead spend 1600 CP (prior to discounts) to purchase Vestments containing the power of a Lord of Balance, which will be half again as powerful as either of the others and allow you to wield both Chaos and Order magic at once.

Or, in place of having one for Order and one for Chaos, you may instead spend 1600 CP (prior to discounts) to purchase Vestments containing the power of a Lord of Balance, which will be half again as powerful as either of the others and allow you to wield both Chaos and Order magic at once.

This however, is a completely subconscious process at first, though with years of practice, you may be able to gain a finer control of it. When do you develop your power to that degree, you may even be able to view and manipulate the strings of fate consciously, allowing for you to orchestrate moments where nothing is left to chance. Consciously observing and affecting fate is a tiring process however, so one needs to be mindful when and where to use it. Note that no matter what, you cannot make the statistically impossible possible, but as long as there is a chance for something to happen, exert enough magical power, and it shall surely come true."

The Triforce of Power also acts as a nearly unlimited source of magic, giving you ample fuel when it comes time to toss around spells so long as you have the ability to cast them in the first place. Even if you don’t, you will be able to channel your raw magical power to create blasts of magical energy that could break through castle walls with ease. Twilight does not affect your body.

964,,900,Divinity(Major),Fate/Legends - Strange New World,Source,"Mystery may have bled out from this world as the ages crawled by but not every mysterious being
has disappeared. And not every time you might go to in this world is so empty of wonders. A divine spirit is among the greatest of beings in this world, the gods and greatest monsters of legends. Those
that represent the mythologies and histories of each country and people. There are young such
spirits, those linked to the country of America, and older beings, such as the Mesoamerican
Pantheon, and not all are even from this world. But as a member among their ranks, you’re pretty
special now. Two options are before you now.

For 1200CP, you’ll be a match for the Sun God
Quetzalcoatl, at least in it’s current incarnation. More on that later. Right now, it’s all about you and
just how amazing you now are. It’s time to think more planetary. Your arms are the arms that can
smash the moon to pieces or shatter the planet into a bunch of big bits. If nothing stops you, the
planet probably isn’t going to accept you doing that and she’s a fair bit stronger than you still. But
you can still roast everything on the surface of the planet with your magical power, since that’s
about equal to your physical abilities. The Authorities you hold are still three in number but they’re a
lot bigger now. An Authority of Water previously may have let you drown a town or send a tidal
wave alongside a lot of the American coastline, one of them anyway. Now that same Authority
would let you freely command every drop of water on the planet while still allowing you incredible
control over associated concepts, such as exerting significant influence on civilisations by controlling
the flow of people and ideas across the world. But as great as these powers are, you may find it
difficult to exert them. Using your Authority on such a scale will invariably mean intruding on the
plans and dominions of countless lesser beings, divine spirits included, and even some of your peers
at times. You have power but you are not without peers nor is it impossible for those much weaker
than you to still pose significant threats. There is a final path available to you, should you take this
option, but it will be revealed to you in the Challenges section near the end of this script. Whichever path you choose, it’s worth talking about your heritage. Wherever you call your home as
a Divine Spirit, it turns out you’ve got a little bit of Mexico in you. The blood of the Mesoamerican
Pantheon flows in you and there’s something a little special about that. These Divine Spirits aren’t
from Earth originally. In fact, they crash landed via a meteor from space, arriving as or alongside all
sorts of space germs. No one’s really sure and it looks like the ones that know get all embarrassed about it when you ask. For the most part, it’s more of an interesting dinner topic but the one notable
effect it has on you is that you find it astonishingly easy to inhabit mortal vessels. So long as they’re
willing, you can slip into them with ease, though depending on quality and compatibility, you’ll only
have access to some smaller portion of your power. Even if they resist, you also find it fairly easy to
possess most living beings too, though a good fight can keep you out.

965,,900,The Flower ,Drakengard and Nier,Source,"You want this? Are you sure? Why don’t I explain first and let you know why this is a bad idea. 

This might look like a beautiful white and pink flower, but in reality it is an infection. Sent to this earth by the Grotesqueries, which are Angels created by God to annihilate the arrogant human race, the Flower is a beacon and serves as their way into our reality. When it finds a host, it will bond with them, granting them divine power and pushing them to eliminate humanity. Once the host has either given in or lost the will to resist, the flower will bloom into a giant monster, open a way in for the other Grotesqueries and proceed to destroy the world. 

You still want this huh? Man, you must really be starved for power. Whatever, your funeral. 

First off, if you weren’t an Intoner before, you are now. Go back up to the Origins section, everything under Intoners now applies for you, except for a few things. First off, you don’t have to change your gender to female if you’re not. Second, ignore the uncontrollable libido thing, you don’t have to deal with that. Finally, that part about being the weakest of the Intoners? Wrong, you’re the strongest. (You still have to get the perks if you want Intoner Mode or a Disciple though.)

Now that you’re the host of the Flower, you are the origin of a new batch of Intoners. This means that you’re as strong as Zero was at her most powerful. There is literally nothing a human or anything else that weak can do to harm you.Your strength, speed and Song are all boosted. Additionally, anything that actually is strong and fast enough to damage you will find their efforts for naught. Forget the healing factor and added endurance (though you still have those so, you know, don’t actually forget), the Flower straight up will not let you die. If your body is ever damaged enough that you simply can’t survive anymore, the Flower will semi-bloom until it’s the size of a man and simply spit out a bloody new body for you. Very gross, very lovecraftian. The only things that can permanently kill you now are Dragons or anything made of Dragon magic. 

However, the main benefit of this perk is that you now have the Flower’s ability to make new Intoners. If you choose, you can create five pseudo-clones of yourself, each an Intoner with all the power that entails. They’ll have their own personalities and hang ups just like the canon Intoners, except the unceasing lust from Zero will instead be replaced with whatever personality fault you chose to magnify when you became an Intoner. In addition, they’ll have a greater ability to resist the Flower’s influence, though not as much as you, and they won’t be suffering false memories. Maybe, if you make the effort, you can be the type of family that Zero’s Intoners only had delusions of being. 

You’ll need their power though, even if the whole family thing falls through. LIke I said, the Flower acts as a beacon, an advanced scout. The Grotesqueries can see you now. They’re watching you. And even if you can resist the influence of the Flower, they won’t give up. Not until they’ve exterminated humanity. They’re coming. They’ll find their way in, with or with your help. Not just here, but in every future Jump you make as well. Everywhere you go, divine vengeance and slaughter will follow. 

So take all that power you wanted, Jumper. I hope it was worth it. 

Oh, and I almost forgot. The Flower is now blossoming from one of your body parts. You can copy Zero and choose your eye or pick somewhere else. Whatever the case, you’ll sure stand out at parties."
966,,1000,Titan Blood,The Owl House V1,Source,"Titans are incredibly powerful creatures with near-omnipotent magic, and are widely considered among the most powerful beings in the Demon Realm. Their mere blood is powerful enough to pierce through realms, their roar capable of shattering objects and rupturing eardrums, and their magic manifesting in the form of glyphs. A certain deceased Titan's magic was so potent that it allowed for all witches and demons to evolve biology allowing them to use magic too. Although a powerful race, the titans endured a mass extermination by the collectors, who gradually wiped out the species due to their ability to cancel out collectors' magic, and thus potentially interfere with their plans. Now only two Titans remain, well, three if you count the dude stuck between dimensions. But regardless of whether you say two/three Titans remain, you are one of them....or maybe not. You see, you shall become a hybrid of Titan and whatever else you are, your Titan powers shall be on the same level as a true Titan at his/her prime. You shall gain Master Level in all 9 Types of Magic to represent your magic powers, as well as all Casting Abilities (including the highest level of Glyphs) for free. This also acts as a Capstone Booster for 600 CP Perks. Now, the reason I said ""....or maybe not."" is because you can alternatively choose to receive a supply of Titan Blood. This supply would be the same amount a true Titan at his/her prime would have and it refills after a year. This will give you only Master Level in all 9 Types of Magic to represent your magic knowledge, but no inherent magic powers. This would also give you a potent fuel for things like creating portals, though some of it will be used as a Capstone Booster for 600 CP Items (this same amount shall be instantly refilled after being used to boost those Items). Oh yeah and this also gives you the highest version of Glyphs for free. Both versions will provide you with knowledge about your unique ""glyph language"". If you want to learn more about the glyphs provided by the titan stuck in the In Between Realm, you will need to purchase Glyphs again, since that would be another ""glyph language"". And you can get both versions if you pay 1000 CP again.

As time progresses towards dawn, you will grow stronger and stronger, physically and magically, as well as more and more of a paragon of your race in appearance. You will begin to give off waves of light that are so hot that they can easily melt even the armour of a holy knight or gather this light into a miniature sun in your hand.

Your strength itself is in another league. You gain a power level of 150,000 with this alone. There is one single problem.

969,,1000,Celestial,Fate/Grand Order Part 2,Source,"Forget about gods, and begin thinking of celestial bodies. Yes, those, the Planets and the Stars of the Universe. Your power with this purchase is on the level of such existences, in raw power and conceptual flexibility if not in scale. The energy output of your Saint Graph can be equal to the total output per second of the sun itself, for example, if you don’t possess ridiculous amounts of magical energy to begin with.

Goetia, leader of the 72 Demon Pillars, is one such being. His collective is unkillable as long as the spell binding them and giving them an identity remains, bringing them back to life with some magical energy no matter how many times they are killed. Each Demon Pillar by itself is High Rank, and all of them have some specialty such as messing with Phantom Spirits, those who couldn’t become Heroic Spirits, or self-revival. On top of this, Goetia has total and complete mastery of magecraft, having been the main tool of its creator, and with each Demon Pillar having mental computing capacity equal to supercomputers. Additionally, the Demon Pillar collective function as the pillars of Ars Paulina, a small conceptual universe lying outside of space and time formed from the corpse of King Solomon. His mastery of magecraft is such that he would’ve finished a spell to travel to the beginning of the Planet and rewrite its Texture with one of his own design had Chaldea not interfered. Some other minor abilities he has are those such as being able to send the souls of any corporeal being who looks into his eyes into a purgatory of his own making, or ‘merely’ force spiritual beings to relive their past mistakes and wallow in their flaws, as well as Clairvoyance that lets him see the past and the future to such a thorough extent that it could be called omniscient by those with a lesser perspective. And of course, the thing that made him sit solidly in the Celestial Rank, he owns the Rings of Light, a massive magecraft construct the size of the United States that stores the energy from burning 3,000 years of human history, able to wield minuscule fractions of it to attack with blasts powerful enough to penetrate all the defenses of the Planet. Goetia’s defeat required the summoning of dozens of Heroic Spirits to force the 72 Demon Pillars to continuously revive, and thus tie down great amounts of Goetia’s energy, and the sacrifice of Romani Archaman, undoing the spell that supported the existence of the 72 Demon Pillars and fragmenting them into individual demons that could no longer revive.

ORT, specifically the weaker subspecies found in the seventh Lostbelt, is also of the Celestial Rank. Being weaker in both offense and defense than the true ORT as well as less hostile overall in the same scale that the minimum level in JRPGs is lesser than the maximum level, caused by having their heart and main power source removed, this is the reason this subspecies is of the Celestial Rank instead of beyond it. Having an alien form composed of materials more durable than anything that exists on Earth, it’s not only immensely difficult to damage without absurdly powerful attacks, but it also regenerates fast enough that an ability to stop time was required to harm it enough to kill it. Even then, its body emits an immense amount of cosmic radiation, easily lethal to normal humans even when kilometers away from them.

It wields ‘webs’ composed of green energy that are normally meant for interstellar travel for the purposes of binding enemies, and whose flexibility allow them to reach into other dimensions such as the Throne of Heroes itself, and due to various abilities of its body, it can absorb strengthening effects applied to its enemies, apply weakening effects on those that strike its body, and disassemble negative effects inflicted upon it to turn them into strengthening effects instead. Additionally, it can absorb the magical energy of its opponents through large-scale spatial interference, and generate a cosmic storm from its main body, potent enough to rip apart powerful gods on its own.

And of course, while it might be alien and thus have no frame of reference to understand Earth concepts, this does not mean it is dumb. Quite the opposite in fact, as it is able to partially copy abilities used in front of it, as well as transform targets into green crystals that it then absorbs to gain all of the information possessed by the victim, and it used all the Servant Saint Graphs it accumulated from fighting against Chaldea to reverse engineer the summoning system. Additionally, thanks to consuming the Fantasy Tree of the seventh Lostbelt, it became not only able to anchor the timeline it lived within but also simulate an entire alternate history 300 million years long of its own to generate a Grand Foreigner Heroic Spirit form of itself.

And finally, there is the Crystal Valley, the proof that ORT is the Ultimate One of the Oort Cloud, which replaces the Texture around it with that of the Planet it originated from, overriding any environmental effects, although this ability does not destroy or override unnatural formations such as man-made cities. Weirdly enough, due to it having eaten the Fantasy Tree and inherited its functions, this Crystal Valley transforms trees and other plant life into other Fantasy Trees. ORT’s defeat was only possible thanks to the intervention of Kukulkan, who used to be ORT’s power core, its heart in biological terms, who matched ORT in raw power.

972,,1000,Skyfather,Marvel Magic,Source,"Like mortals, gods as well have kings. Foremost among their kind and often the progenitors of their pantheon as it exists today are the Skyfathers, gods of immense power, both personally and in terms of that they wield over their pantheon. Odin Allfather and Zeus Panhellenios are two of the most well known. Kings incomparable, gods to the gods. At their word, mortals become gods and gods become mortals. When they do battle, galaxies quake beneath their blows.

You are an infantile Skyfather in your own right, much weaker than these titans of power, but still beyond most others of your kind. In time, you shall father a new pantheon, a race of gods which you will hold divine authority over. Any children you have will themselves be gods and likely powerful ones at that. But your divine power is not limited to simply your own bloodline. Though at the current time it will be greatly exhausting for you to accomplish, you may once a day --or perhaps more if you are willing to face a greater toll -- infuse a mortal with a spark of your divine power, uplifting them to divinity. The life force and power of any gods of your new pantheon are yours to command, allowing you to strip it from them, rendering them mortal unless you return it, or to direct their souls as you choose upon their death.

In addition, your own divine life force is enhanced even further beyond what it was before. In addition to increased magical potency, it is much more easy for you to call upon, allowing you to perform great magical feats under you own power even without sorcerous training. Practically any magical feat you can imagine can be accomplished as long as you have the power for it, though it is harder to apply this in minor efforts than it is in grand ways -- you have great power, but lesser precision. Of course, this power is insignificant before the might of those who wield the Odinforce... for now. But gods live long lives and your power is sure to grow as you do; who knows where you shall stand millennia from now?"

The Phoenix Force views you as an ideal host that compares to Jean and has taken residence within you. In the future, any beings that need special hosts will view you as a proper one and there will be no compatibility issues.

977,,1200,The Power Cosmic,Marvel Zombies,Source,"The power. You’re so powerful that it’s starting to get very vague, and you could reasonably claim the most powerful being on Earth. You have been chosen as a Herald of Galactus, imbued with the Power Cosmic, a godlike, unlimited source of energy granted to Galan of Taa at the end of the sixth multiverse. What does that mean? What are you capable of now? The answer is, well, pretty much everything. The expected stuff is tremendous. Your body is among the strongest in the universe. You are immortal and regenerate instantly. You’re a rung up from the Hulk-Thor weight class, and you could throw down with the Hulk at his strongest. You can withstand black holes, supernovas, and cosmic phenomena in the deep reaches of space, and fire off energy blasts powerful enough to core out planets. You could cross hundreds of thousands of lightyears in a mere instant. You do all this through the Power Cosmic, and you have mastery over it - you have absolute control over it. For instance, you could pet a dog as effortlessly as you could punch through a mountain of pure adamantium. Both are trivial. But you’re not restricted to such... simple ways of using the Power Cosmic. Not when you can atomize all before you with a glance, or reconstruct it with the same ease. Not when you can sense a being on the opposite side of the universe. Not when you can destroy galaxies. If you were so inclined, you could emulate every single prior power on this list, and more.

Contrary to the name, this doesn’t necessarily have to be the Power Cosmic. Alternatively, you can choose to have your body be enhanced by the Golden Sentry Serum, granting you the power of a million exploding suns, to the same effect.

Either of these are pretty much vast, infinite, limitless. Save for one thing. Keep in mind: This is a Marvel Zombies Jump, from the Marvel Zombies series. Remember what happened to the Silver Surfer."
978,,1200,Phoenix Six,Avengers Vs X-Men,Source,"The Phoenix Force is the cosmic embodiment of life itself. It’s role is to destroy worlds that have come to an end in their growth and to start new worlds where life does not exist, as well as to restart prematurely halted growth. It is currently on it’s way to Earth, soon setting off the events of the series, but now it appears that when the Phoenix would have split apart and created the Phoenix Five a day from now, it will instead split into six and send that sixth portion to you, wherever you may be. Should the Phoenix not be split, you will receive this portion anyway. 

You will then hold an effective one-sixth portion of the Phoenix Force within you, granting you immense and terrible powers. A phoenix host possesses enormous telekinesis and telepathic abilities, greatly surpassing an Omega level mutant in either one. They cease to age and have extremely powerful healing factors, even potentially being revived from death by the phoenix force so long as they continue to have access to the force and their portion has enough power to resurrect. They can also bring back other deceased people. A Phoenix avatar’s physical abilities are vastly enhanced, capable of contending with foes like Thor or the Hulk in a one on one battle, and they have the ability to fly through space at faster than light speeds. Any Mutant powers you have will be supercharged by the presence of the avatar of evolution, greatly empowering them to stand on similar heights as the other abilities given here. 

The most iconic manifestation of the phoenix might within you is the power over cosmic fire. Cosmic flames that consume all things without even leaving ash behind, which perfectly obey the will of the host in what they burn or how they move, even burning in the vacuum of space. They can be used both for destruction and for creation, bringing life and revitalising those touched by the fire if willed by the user. As you only possess one-sixth of the full Force, your powers are only around the level of the Phoenix Five as they appear in this event. By defeating the other members of the Five, their portion of the power will be divided among you and the remaining hosts and defeating all of them would endow you with the power of Dark Phoenix. Should the Force not be split among the hosts, you would need to defeat the Phoenix itself to take the rest of it’s power as a host. 

As great as these powers are, they are not without a flaw. The phoenix will influence your emotions, more so the more of it is within you. Your emotions will often be far more intense then before, easily driving you into rages or bouts of joyful happiness without reason. With great will and self restraint, it is possible to contain the influence of the Phoenix and experience with the power will make this somewhat easier over time."
979,,1400,Sealed True Name ,Skulduggery Pleasant,Source,"Somehow, you discovered your True Name, and, through a process that may or may not have involved temporarily killing yourself and carving a delicate series of runes into your own heart, you have sealed your True Name. This offers a number of considerable benefits. First of all, your name being sealed means it cannot be used against you, even if others know it. Second, it enhances your magic tremendously, affording you a considerable boost in both raw power and your growth rate. While this will not grant you access to an unlimited font of raw magical power until you attain your Spark, it will make it so your well of magical energy grows by leaps and bounds continuously, even without any training or effort on your part. This perk also grants you a notable healing factor, which scales in effectiveness as your overall magic capacity grows larger. With enough magical power, your body could heal itself from being shot in the head fast enough that the entry wound closes before the bullet exits the back of your skull. Even more impressive than this is your ability to copy any discipline of magic by seeing it in action only a single time, though it will take practice and time to build up a greater level of skill in wielding it. Learning your True Name has also given you access to the souls and consciousnesses of others, allowing you to manipulate and destroy them as you desire. This allows you to do things like tearing Remnants from their hosts, regardless of how long they have been fused. You can see the magic of others, and even cycle through their souls, seeing everything they have seen and learning everything they know before absorbing it for yourself, as Darquesse did to Argeddion in Dying Of The Light."
980,,1600,Vestments of Balance ,DC Occult,Source,"​The Lords of Order and Chaos are powerful magical beings that were born at the dawn of time. For untold millennia, they have been locked in a metaphysical war, attempting to further the cause of Order or of Chaos. Primarily, this is accomplished by empowering mortal agents to act as proxies.

The most powerful and well-known example of this is Doctor Fate -- the manifestation of Nabu, the greatest and most powerful of the Lords of Order -- who channels his power through the Helm of Fate and those who wear it. But Nabu is far from the only Lord to empower his agents through artifacts and one such item has fallen into your possession.

You have some wearable object that contains the essence of a lesser Lord, whether of Chaos or Order. This item is bound to you, allowing you to summon it at-will, and when worn, grants you access to a large sum of magical power. This would be a formidable amount of power even in the hands of a mortal with none of their own, but it truly shines when worn by an already powerful being. The more powerful the person wearing the Vestments, the larger the increase in power will be.

As well, when worn, the ghost of the — now long-dead — Lord will whisper into your mind, teaching you powerful magic and prompting you to follow their agenda. The ghost will be completely unable to possess you unless you allow them to do so and the possession may be revoked by you at any time. You don't have to advance their cause, but they will be much more willing to teach you if you do so.

After this jump is over, you can silence the ghost or awaken it as you please.

With a second purchase (discounted if the first purchase wasn’t), you may gain the Vestments opposite of the ones first purchased, but both cannot be used together. Or, in place of having one for Order and one for Chaos, you may instead spend 1600 CP (prior to discounts) to purchase Vestments containing the power of a Lord of Balance, which will be half again as powerful as either of the others and allow you to wield both Chaos and Order magic at once.

981,,2600,Jumper Force,Avengers-Thunderbolts,Source,"The Odinforce, the Thor Force, the Destiny Force, the Life Force... There’s a lot of reality sundering forces around here. And now you have your own. This power functions much like the Odin Force, and if you are an Asgardian almost certainly is the Odin Force in the same way that the Thor Force is. It is a mystical energy force which can be used for nearly any purpose, from augmenting your own power directly, to serving as a truly staggering store of magical power, to brute reality warping. While its functions are nigh infinite, it does have its limits. Overuse will see you left drained of its power, needing to go into a deep, recuperative, often month long sleep.

Like Thor when he possesses the Thor Force, or Rick Jones when he possesses the Destiny Force, you will begin with far from full access or the skill with this power. And (as a human) this power will cap well below the upper showings of Odin with the Odinforce (so you will not be creating suns from the heat of your magical battles, or casually giving Jane Foster powers to equal Thor on the condition she use them as a hero), or even less supreme uses. Even so you could passively increase your abilities from the level of a human to those of an Asgardian, with only a passive drain on this force, create or destroy objects or even entire buildings, power spacecraft, temporarily grant superpowers, and generally use it as a high powered omnitool. You won’t be waving your hand and closing a hole in the Earth after a fire giant ripped out a hunk and tossed it at you making the moon, and then starting the Earth’s rotation, or after an exhausting hours long battle against a planet consuming robot that sees the moon exploded as collateral damage, reforming the moon about the robot as a prison, but by straining the force to the point of needing to enter the jumper sleep you could possibly rebuild an entire city, or empower a group of heroes with the energy needed to temporarily punch through force fields that’d stop even Mjolnir. And with mastery you could obtain substantially more access to this force, and much greater finesse; temporarily calling legions of entities from other possible timelines or freezing entire space armadas in place or destroying them would be well within your power.

If you purchased a more mystically or psychically powerful race in this jump, this power will be expanded to scale. As an upgraded Asgardian you would begin as equal to Thor when Odin died, the passive empowerment enough to allow you to reshape Captain America’s shield with brute, physical force (and Mjolnir), and potentially remaking the moon molecule by molecule. And with the same potential heights. As an unupgraded Asgardian you’d be significantly less impressive, but still somewhere between a human and Odin’s heights. As a full price Kryptonian you would be above an unupgraded Asgardian, and as a reduced price one you’d be somewhat below one. As a Living Planet you would almost certainly be able to surpass Odin and/or Thor given time and learning to shape these energies.
