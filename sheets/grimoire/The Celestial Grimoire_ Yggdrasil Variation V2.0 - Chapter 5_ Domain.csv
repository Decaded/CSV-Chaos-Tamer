1,,Free,Celestial Kingdom,Valkyrie Crusade ,Domain,"Of course, you’ve got to have somewhere to stay while in this universe and where better to stay than your own kingdom? This large floating piece of land is mostly empty at first, save a basic castle, requiring you to fill it with buildings at your leisure. Measuring 5km by 5km, this has plenty of room on it for construction. Post jump, this will be attached to your warehouse via a stone portal. The kingdom will fill in any ‘empty spots’ with NPCs to replicate the feel of an occupied city. Even when connected to the warehouse, you can choose to keep time flowing within the kingdom."
2,,Free,Teleport Gems ,Wild Arms 2,Domain,"A shard of a special crystal similar to the one that enables communication worldwide, this one enables transportation. Holding one shard of it allows a few people to teleport to a city or town visited before. You have a small amount of shards and will find a couple more once in a while inside your warehouse."
3,,Free,Catasterism,Virgil’s Aeneid,Domain,"The most illustrious of privileges has been granted to you, jumper - that of immortality through the stars. In all future jumps in which stars are seen in the night sky, a constellation will be retroactively added, named after you and shaped (vaguely) like one of your defining characteristics or symbols. The origin of its name will be long lost to time, but of course, you’ll know."
4,,Free,Inventory ,Stranger Of Paradise - Final Fantasy Origins,Domain,An inventory that allows you to carry an almost limitless amount of items in a subspace that makes them weightless. You can also quickly use healing items when they are inside your inventory.
5,,Free,Fast Travel,Stranger Of Paradise - Final Fantasy Origins,Domain,After visiting a location you gain the ability to fast-travel to it. This allows you to get there in a mere fraction of the time it would have normally taken you otherwise.
6,,Free,The Speed of (Paracausal) Light,The Destiny Universe,Domain,"While there is no known limit to the flight speed of a Ghost, it is at least known for certain that they are capable of levitating in Earth’s gravity, forever, without any need for thrust or propellant. Extrapolated, this means a Ghost at minimum is capable of accelerating through space at a rate of 1G forever, meaning that the speed of light is not a distant goal as much as it is a minor challenge to be reached. Taking into consideration the many planets and objects in the solar system whose gravity is stronger than Earth, and their minimum acceleration grows higher, and the time necessary to approach lightspeed grows shorter. By taking this perk, unless you are damaged or weakened, you are capable of the same thing. Furthermore, you shall be capable of reaching those same luminal velocities in a fraction of the time as other Ghosts, and due to the fact that you are reaching these speeds through paracausal means, things like time dilation or deceleration are no issue for you."
7,,Free,Domain,RWBY: Age of the Gods,Domain,"A deity like yourself should have a place to rest and be contacted in. This Domain reflects who you are as a God, maybe being a desolated wasteland if you represent destruction or being an idyllic Oasis for a God of Light. You can place this Domain anywhere on a World you are on, allowing others to know where it is automatically. Here they will feel close to you and may come to you with offerings or requests. You can place a Domain on any World where you are recognized as a God."

9,,Free,The World’s Stage,Super Dragon Sword ,Domain,"Thus let us be actors! You are capable of expending enough mana that even a veteran adventurer would be spent in order to create a massive enchanted “pocket space”, one that is related to either one of the Historic Moments or one of your Legends. While this space can be escaped, you have a great amount of knowledge of what hazards and benefits this “Stage” holds.

11,,Free,"""Bonfire Teleportation""",Dark Souls 3,Domain,"Bonfires are mystical flames that surround a sword embedded in the ground, around the size of a campfire. These Bonfires are found scattered about this world. While they have a number of abilities, this perk grants you one in particular. When resting at a Bonfire, this perk allows you to teleport between any other Bonfire that you've already discovered, allowing you to quickly navigate the world as needed."
12,,Free,Flight ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Domain,"You can fly, a power that is nigh-universal in Gensokyo. Flying as fast as you can walk is simple, and you can push yourself to fly faster, up to how fast you can run, which will tire you proportionately."
13,,Free,Flying ,Peter Pan,Domain,"You have the basic ability and understanding of how to fly, though you still need pixie dust and consistent belief and happy thoughts. With enough belief, you can defy all laws of physics and even fly through space. Everyone in Neverland has this ability, though for fairies you do not need pixie dust (well, technically, you always have the dust since it’s a part of you) and don’t need happy thoughts to fly. Moreover, by taking this freebie, you are able to fly whenever you have access to pixie dust and happy thoughts, no matter how old you are (normally flying is only possible for the “gay and heartless”).
"
14,,Free,Hearthfire - Basics,The Elder Scrolls,Domain,"At this point, there isn't much to your home. It has an entryway, the main building has two floors, a fireplace, a kitchen, an outhouse, and you've even got a large bed. It may not be much at the moment, but you've got to start off somewhere."
15,,Free,Hearthfire - Aesthetics,The Elder Scrolls,Domain ,"Much like a certain purchase for your Warehouse, you can have your home take on any aesthetic found in this universe, from the glass/insect wing-like style of the Altmer to the mushroom towers of the Telvanni to the mudhuts of the Argonians to the spiky architecture of the Daedra, to anything in between.

(CG Note: Requires Hearthfire - Basics - The Elder Scrolls first.)

16,,25,Astral Projection,Final Fantasy XV Kingsglaive,Domain ,"From what the legends say of them the Astrals possess massive bodies, but in spite of their size, it would seem that Astrals possess the ability to move about Eos completely unnoticed. While it seems plausible that the Astrals possess some manner of ability to traverse through unseen dimensions, unfortunately you’ll have to settle for something a bit more practical.

The ability to instantly warp from one place to another isn’t anything to scoff at of course, but unlike the Astrals, you’ll run out of juice if you try to abuse it too much. Not unlike the same warping ability granted to those receiving the Crystal’s boon, the distance can go a fair ways – and thankfully you don’t need to toss an object to the destination to go anywhere. This modification can be taken multiple times, each time increasing how many times you can use this in rapid succession. If you happen to be in the service of an Astral, the nature of the warping ability will shift to reflect the elemental domain of the Astral you are serving, such that flames may appear where you warp to, should you serve the Infernian Ifrit for example.

17,,25,The Bounty of the Earth,Scion ,Domain ,"From the orichalcum of Greek myth to the metals from which Mjolnir was forged, many Godrealms have divinely touched materials from which Birthright weapons may be forged without the spilling of ichor by those with the talent. Your land runs deep with veins of such wondrous ore.

18,,25,The Fat of the Land ,Scion ,Domain ,"With all that lives in the land of the gods, some question how each hungry mouth’s kept fed. You have one such answer: A variety of plentiful, replenishing and often surprisingly humane food sources common as grass throughout your Godrealm ‘s wilds and easily farmed with no penalty to taste or nutrition. Some examples from the Celestial Bureaucracy being the magical grain Muhe (Tre Grain) which grows on stalks 40 feet tall and five handspans wide. Or the Shirou (Seeing Flesh), a substance shaped like a cow’s liver with two eyes that is the finest of meats and grows back instantly no matter how much is eaten. It also covers divinely perfected wood and fungi.

19,,25,A Foothold on the World,Scion ,Domain ,"A location in the mortal world so strongly aligns with your Godrealm’s mythology, that while you exert no direct control over it (yet) it can actually rejuvenate the Legend pool of you and any aligned gods who go there. An example being the British Museum’s display of Egyptian culture, which benefits the Pesedjet. One such building in the mortal world serves your Godrealm and eventual pantheon this way too, and each repurchase here creates another.

20,,25,Britta’s Tacos ,Star vs the Forces of Evil,Domain ,"A mexican-and-more fast-food restaurant in Echo Creek that’s popular with Echo Creek Academy students, including Star when she’s there. (They also sell hamburgers and horchata.) Somehow, it ended up in your warehouse, the well in back not included. No, I don’t know where they’re getting their inventory from. Yes, they will do takeout via dimensional scissors."
21,,25,"Here, have a castle",Star vs the Forces of Evil,Domain ,"There’s more than a few castles, temples, and other ancient structures laying around the universe, and nobody should notice if one disappears. So spend your points and you can have one that matches your preferred aesthetics. You will have to plant it in the worlds as you go, however. There might be a spell for that. Adding sofas and other furniture will take manual labor."
22,,50,Wayfare,Changeling The Dreaming,Domain ,"The Art of Wayfare deals with a changeling's ability to move through space. This involves bouncing and covering far distances, speeding forward on feet that move impossibly fast, and even teleporting from one place to another. The Eshu have a deep connection with this Art, though as it is a common Art, any can learn it. In some freeholds, the nobility has come to fear the power of Wayfare, and may act to make it somewhat harder to come by.

Rank 1: Produce an impossible leap, either up or down, and suffer no damage from the resulting collision.

Rank 2: Allows an object to move at an incredibly fast speed.

Rank 3: Creates a temporary opening through any barrier, allowing it to be moved through.

Rank 4: Allows a target to fly, taking to the sky as if they had wings.

Rank 5: Instantly disappear, and reappear somewhere else in the world, or in the Dreaming, though it is usually unwise to use it to cross between the two.

24,,50,Memorial Ticket,Castlevania - Lament of Innocence,Domain ,"As it turns out, there actually are a number of places inside Castle Bernhard that are neither trapped to high heaven nor there to lull you into a false sense of security. These ‘safe rooms’ are there for potential contestants to relax for a short while, perhaps get a good night's sleep. No sense letting them work themselves into exhaustion right? That wouldn’t be much fun. This magical ticket, when torn in two, will teleport you to the nearest location that fits such a description. You may only have one such ticket at a time, and it will restock one day after being used."
25,,50,A Hidden Manse​ (Tier 1),Generic Exalted,Domain ,"Now we're talking. You get a Manse, the Manse of course being a piece of land that is somehow magical in some fashion or another. They're aspected towards a certain type of Essence, either elemental essence such as Wood, Water, Earth, Fire, or Air or alternatively they're aspected towards the Celestial elements such as the Sun, Moon, Stars, or even Infernal or Abyssal (which are quite rare normally). Aside from being a spot of land that you now own (as long as you can protect it) a Manse also produces a Hearthstone.

Hearthstones, when socketed into certain weapons/armor/amulets, provide both unique magical effects and act as channels of the Manse itself allowing for vastly improved regeneration of Essence. Did I mention you also regenerate Essence faster while in the Manse? Yeah, you do. Anyways there are far too many Manses to actually list here in this document so we'll just go by price. For 50cp you can get a 1dot manse. You can choose any Manse you want from the Core books or official supplement books for Exalted that you have paid the appropriate cost for. 

Of note is that while you can have more than one Manse only ones you purchase here will follow you between jumps, inserting themselves flawlessly into new worlds (or as an addition to your Warehouse, your choice either or). Additionally you will need at least one open hearthstone socket for every hearthstone you have if you want to make use of them. Manse's can range from the size of a small forest clearing to the size of a reasonably large nobles estate (call it 100 acres), you choose what size yours is, the more expensive the Manse you bought the bigger it can be.

26,,50,Observatory,Final Fantasy XIV,Domain ,"You can’t really call the existing attic room an observatory. For one thing, while it’s very spacious, there’s basically no furnishing up here! For a small price, you can furnish your entire attic, complete with a crystal telescope. Working off of the same concepts of a Linkshell, this Crystal can be used to either observe anything on the estate grounds, or can be used like a normal space telescope, though its strength is directly equivalent to how much magic you pump inside. That said though, they did quite a bit of work with the furnishing – making the attic space a wonderful place to rest.

27,,50,Crystal Foci,Final Fantasy XIV,Domain ,"At first, this may seem like a random ornament, but this large Crystal Shard in the center of your estate acts as an amplifier. All of the other facilities which rely on Crystals will perform better – and so long as the Shard is present, magic casted within vicinity of the Estate is slightly more potent.

28,,50,Estate Hall ,Final Fantasy XIV,Domain ,"Every estate needs a grand hall, and while your existing one isn’t bad, it could do with a good makeover. This expands the size of your Hall quite substantially – enough that you could probably hold a court case inside the room now. In addition, in case you need to transform it for any functions the Crystal in the Hall can make any cosmetic modifications that you require. Good for ballroom events and parties.

29,,50,Aether Garden,Final Fantasy XIV,Domain ,"A very pleasant garden, with rows of herbs and flowers already planted, and a network of pools and fountains set up. The individual greenhouses that come along with this can be freely adjusted in terms of the atmosphere inside, to account for the different biomes which your plant samples may require. The Crystal underneath the Garden will ensure that the soil here is fertilized all year round.

30,,50,Chocobo Stables ,Final Fantasy XIV,Domain ,"Attaching a new wing to the estate, these stables are quite substantial, and obviously built to sustain more than simple horses and chocobos. You’re not quite sure what the architect and the engineer were thinking, but in an odd turn of events, at least you won’t have any problems finding a place for that dragon steed of yours to rest!

31,,50,Estate,Final Fantasy XIV,Domain ,"This estate is, at a glance, quite luxurious, and comes with all of the accommodations which you might expect from a manor of its size.

For 100 GP you may have a destination like Helheim, in which the souls of the unworthy dead in your eyes are punished out of sight, out of mind and barring a single god of uncertain temperament or truly heroic efforts out of your control. For 200 GP you may have an elaborate system build in place to winnow, nurture, judge and ascend souls under your guidance similar to the Egyptian and Greek gods.

37,,50,Halls of the Gods(Tier 1),Scion,Domain ,"The residences of the gods themselves can vary greatly across different Godrealms, and here you may determine the complexity of yours. For 100 GP before other modifiers, your courts may be similar to those of the Pesedjet, Loa or Aesir, having wondrous interiors but fairly mundane-if still quite reinforced-exteriors. Such residences can still be quite powerful of course; while being comparatively modest to some of the options below Atum-Re’s solar barque is built of enough divinely glorious wood to flatten the forests of Lebanon and provides all solar light to the entire realm while proceeding on its fixed course between the Overworld and Underworld.

And for 300 GP, a great sprawl of marvellous buildings for specific purposes and not merely radiant, but cosmically significant palaces seldom witnessed outside the domains of the Celestial Bureaucracy and Devas populate your domains. Your own residence can be utterly absurd and cosmically significant, like Brahma’s 800 miles wide bungalow or Surya’s palace being a scant few miles in circumference yet being so grand within it can hold the sun.

40,,50,Terra Incognitae(Lesser),Scion ,Domain ,"A Terra Incognitae is a part of the mortal world so steeped in Legend, that due to the influence of sceptical historians on the collective subconsciousness and therefore Fate they were literally ejected from the mortal world into a sort of subdimension stranded between the Underworld and Overworld. Many contain useful things to gods, whether directly or indirectly.

For 100 GP you may choose for your Godrealm to border a Terra Incognitae which contains an advantage commensurate with a loyal force of modified mortal champions, such as the island residence of the Myrmidons. Or the life-preserving Plain of Joy (although one is encouraged to instead choose a Terra Incognitae that also restores injury, illness and pain.

42,,50,Great River,Scion ,Domain ,"While you were always able to have rivers in your Godrealm, with this one particular river has a divine significance in your pantheon’s life. Perhaps like Iteru, it consists of primordial waters covering most of the Godrealm from which the oldest gods arose-and perhaps, may give forth new ones. Perhaps it is a smaller river, but no less significant-like the Ganges of the Devas or the great river of the Celestial Bureaucracy that embodies the Milky Way itself. Either way, it contains great divine power and symbolic status. At your discretion this may be another cosmic body of water(y substances), like the Devas’ ocean of milk. This option may be repurchased to have additional similar bodies of water, which may crisscross each other or in bizarre cases-result in skyborne rivers or rivers that flow consistently through other rivers.

For 100 GP your Godrealm has numerous subrealms, like the various barques which are akin to smaller pocket dimensions for the Egyptian pantheon.

Such realms may be like as esoteric as the Atzlanti’s Acopa, forming entire layers of reality reached through esoteric passages like climbing through the smoke of a cook-fire or diving into a constellation. Or as complex and intricate as the Celestial Bureaucracy, in which the largest river flows with stars instead of water and a mountain range of fire as well as a black river guards the Godrealm from elsewhere in the Overworld.

45,,50,A Head For Heights ,Scion,Domain ,"The topology of your Godrealm is particularly mountainous, sufficient to form a natural defence against anything that can’t fly. This can include very unusual formations of geography and grants you more direct control over it, like needle-thin mountaintops or deployable rainbow bridges that can lead anywhere in the realm. Additionally, for a total of 100 not only may this be a part of your Godrealm but your entire sky may have cosmologically significant features such as divine incarnations of the sun and moon or constellations deeply attuned with the power of Magic, Mystery and Prophecy.

46,,50,SIMULATION ROOM,Final Fantasy X,Domain ,"Perhaps part of the reason you’ll have wanted the Monster Arena in the first place – this room is another annex entirely in the Monster Arena, and allows you to face off against your “pets” in an environment that remains completely safe. Even should you or your pet fall here it is of no consequence, as no lasting damage will be done to either party – it might serve to be a good testing area, or a good training area, both the same thing really.

The default appearance resembles that of the Calm Lands, but you can configure it to resemble another locale you’ve visited before – it’s just for aesthetic purposes.

51,,50,The Crossroads of The World,Godbound,Domain ,"Fast travel is rare in this world, which makes even the limited access you have here quite invaluable even to many Godbound. What you have is a teleportation device, underground tubeway car or even Night Road that discreetly connects two important locations, like the Bright Republic and a stronghold of the antipriests. In future worlds similar such locations can be linked by whatever form this transportation takes, though generally interplanar locations like Heaven and Hell will require more exotic means of transportation."

The White Sign Soapstone allows you to draw a glowing sign on the ground, visible to certain strong beings in overlapping, parallel worlds. Beings who can detect the sign may temporarily summon you to aid them as a phantom with some kind of task or battle. A Red Sign Soapstone is similar, but broadcasts very different intent. A being that summons you from a Red Sign will oft be looking for a fight or duel. You do not have much to fear from being summoned as a phantom, for you are operating through a proxy body and death of the phantom body doesn't translate to death of the real one. Useful for an adventurous outing, but little else."
61,,50,Quickening,MtG - Shandalar,Domain ,"A small cup crafted from still-living oak, drinking from this item will grant the user an immensely potent burst of vigor. You will be able to move significantly faster, though this manifests less as superior reflexes and more the ability to sprint at full speed without slowing. The effect lasts for about three hours, and completely eliminates physical fatigue in the user while it is active. 

The Quickening cup can be used once per day for free, and can be recharged instantly by spending a Green Amulet (such as from the ‘Jewelry’ or ‘Gemcutter’ options below)."
62,,50,Leap Of Fate ,MtG - Shandalar,Domain ,"This meticulously carved sapphire seems to flicker and shift out of the corner of your eyes, hinting at its otherworldly nature. Imbued with the essence of unpredictability and escape, the so-called ‘Leap Of Fate’ allows its user to escape almost any predicament. When activated, the user will experience an immensely powerful teleportation effect, transporting them to safety in an instant. This effect will pierce any kind of barrier, ward, restraints or other method that might be used to prevent your passing... but the inherent randomness of the magic that the stone uses to achieve this freedom means that predicting where exactly you’ll arrive is effectively impossible.

The Leap Of Fate gem can be used once per day for free, and can be recharged instantly by spending a Blue Amulet (such as from the ‘Jewelry’ or ‘Gemcutter’ options below)."
63,,50,Basic Land ,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Domain ,"The bare essentials for a Planeswalker, a basic land. The basic lands are the Plains, Mountains, Islands, Forests and Swamps. These generate one mote of White Mana, Red Mana, Blue Mana, Green Mana, and Black Mana respectively. If you desire you can instead have a Wasteland which generates Colorless Mana."
64,,50,Merlin's Circle,The Sorcerer's Apprentice,Domain ,"Essentially a practice circle, Merlin's Circles are big, bulky inscriptions that focuses and contains the magical energies of anyone who steps inside it, effectively making them a better sorcerer. It's used as a training aid to help an apprentice contain and cast their first spells, and speeds up the learning process for anyone inside of it. Making a new one is a very simple process, and can carried out by a sorcerer."
65,,50,Path of the Lotus,Fate/Legends - Nirvana Yuga,Domain ,"The favour of the world as you journey on the path, showing in the flowers that bloom beneath you
whenever you need to rest. A lotus is most common but other kinds can appear to your tastes, supernaturally large and stable plants sprouting whenever you need a platform beneath you. It may
be a traditional seat on which to meditate or act as a path across hazardous surfaces, continually
sprouting flowers to separate you from the dirty ground. Should you use them for the intended
purpose, you’ll find that sitting on the lotus allows you to far more easily get in touch with the
spiritual side of the world, for use in understanding the truths of the world or becoming more aware
of the magic that flows through it."
66,,50,Forest Hideout,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Domain,"Every outlaw needs a place to retreat, even when fighting the good fight. While it does take a little
while to get there, you’ll find that small hidey-holes are available for you out in the wilderness when
you need them. Often barely more than a bolthole in the ground, a hollowed out tree or a
abandoned hut beneath a rocky outcropping, these places still contain food and a small amount of
medical supplies. It could save your life, as could the map of the local area and simple but sturdy
weapons found in each one."
67,,50,Sonic Boost ,Lyrical Nanoha,Domain,"The simplest way to improve a flight spell is simply to pump more power into it. However, the fields that adjust for G-forces, altitude, temperatures and aerodynamic profile (especially important for those that wear capes) all have their own tweaks that need to be made so the increased speed is survivable. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)"
68,,50,Natural Domain ,Golden Sky Stories,Domain,"As a Henge, you’ll likely find yourself living out in the wild for the most part, and chances are you’ll have to look for a place to set up camp. You can go and see if the humans are willing to lend you shelter of course, but I can also help you out by allocating you a section of the domain around town, a place for you to rest easy at night. Just don’t expect it to be much larger than an apartment suite – you’re sharing the forest with other Henge too! Though...to think of it, it’s really strange to describe your domain as an apartment suite.

Should you eventually depart, you should decide for yourself how this follows you.
"
69,,50,Natural Elements ,Golden Sky Stories,Domain,"In places overflowing with nature, it’s said that sometimes, the lines between the “modern world” and the “spiritual world” blurs a little, resulting in strange supernatural locales. Choosing an element of nature, you can exemplify this element beyond its limitations in the “modern world”. A river of stars that only appears above your domain, a sprawling forest of bamboo that blocks out the sky; it’s up to you to decide what element suits you best. 

Each time you take this, you can choose a new element (Though it does have to be something natural), and the size of your domain grows by half. For each 100 CP you place into this, you’ll also find that natural animals will show up, appropriate to the element you’ve chosen – and with time, these little critters may also become Henge as well. (CG Note: Requires Natural Domain - Golden Sky Stories first.)"
70,,50,A PLACE OF WONDER ,Golden Sky Stories,Domain,"As a Henge, without having to worry about hiding your appearance, your Domain allows you to concentrate on building a connection with others. Granted, it won’t be often that a human or another Henge actually intrudes on your Domain – but you could invite them in temporarily of course. So long as they remain within your Domain, it becomes much easier to bond with them and the same goes for your companions as well. (CG Note: Requires Natural Domain - Golden Sky Stories first.)
"
71,,50,Wheel of Magic ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Domain,"In the days of Supreme Patriarch Paranoth, it was determined that a visual representation of the relationships between the different Winds of Magic was necessary. You have acquired a small dial, to be placed in a building or extradimensional space of your choosing (among those which you own, that is) in the style of this precise depiction. Just as Supreme Patriarchs announce a new era in the Colleges by turning the wheel to place their own Lore and College at its apex, so too may you turn the wheel to produce an interesting effect - the building’s appearance and decor will shift to match the “theme” of the Wind whose symbol sits atop the wheel once you are finished turning. Enjoy turning your castle verdant and your picture frames to Jade, covering even the walls of your storeroom in Gold, or draping your home in shades of Grey. These alterations will obviously be purely cosmetic.

72,,50,Sorcery - Convoyence Ritual (Teleportation Ward) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Domain,"Teleportation, flight, and other means of magically swift transportation are covered by this path.

Some, but not all, Paths also have rituals, which take an extra ten minutes to cast, but are easier to perform, more powerful, and often capable of producing effects that cannot be replicated with normal sorcery. A sorcerer must have the appropriate dots in the appropriate path to learn a given ritual.

Teleportation Ward (2): The sorcerer creates a magical boundary around a room or building that interferes with any attempt to teleport into the area - unless the teleporter knows the passcode, of course. This ward degrades over the course of months if not tended to, but is easily maintained by an active sorcerer.

Some, but not all, Paths also have rituals, which take an extra ten minutes to cast, but are easier to perform, more powerful, and often capable of producing effects that cannot be replicated with normal sorcery. A sorcerer must have the appropriate dots in the appropriate path to learn a given ritual.

Getting Out of Here (3): Another ritual cast mostly ahead of time, this ritual allows the caster to return to a specified location with a single word, so long as that location is within 50 miles. Additional power can expand this range, but must be expended during the initial casting.

(CG Note: Requires Sorcery - Convoyence (Three Dots) - World of Darkness: Sorcerer first.) "

Some, but not all, Paths also have rituals, which take an extra ten minutes to cast, but are easier to perform, more powerful, and often capable of producing effects that cannot be replicated with normal sorcery. A sorcerer must have the appropriate dots in the appropriate path to learn a given ritual.

Teleportal (5): Master sorcerers can create permanent gateways between locations. This ritual requires multiple days of preparation, some of which must be spent at both sites. Once this is done, the sorcerer may invest as much power as they wish into the portal, which determines the range, the number of uses it has before it degrades, and any and all specifications they wish to add to who or how the portal can be used. As a final measure, the sorcerer permanently invests a small fraction of their will to complete the portal. Such an endeavour would be beyond the power of most sorcerers, if not for the fact that lesser practitioners of this path may add their own magic to the ritual, but the final sacrifice must be the master’s.

(CG Note: Requires Sorcery - Convoyence (Five Dots) - World of Darkness: Sorcerer first.) "
75,,50,Sorcery - Mana Manipulation Ritual (Shape Mana) ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Domain ,"Some, but not all, Paths also have rituals, which they take an extra ten minutes to cast, but are easier to perform, more powerful, and often capable of producing effects that cannot be replicated with normal sorcery. A sorcerer must have the appropriate dots in the appropriate path to learn a given ritual.

Shape Mana(2): The sorcerer alters the flow of magical energy in an area, changing its direction or effects. This can be used to attract luck and spirits of a desired type, at least in a general sense, but it can also be used to redirect ley lines and alter spells that are affecting the area.

(CG Note: Requires Sorcery - Mana Manipulation (Two Dots) - World of Darkness: Sorcerer first.)"
76,,100,Hidden Armory,Duel Monsters – The Shadow Realm,Domain ,"You need somewhere to keep all your shiny new weapons, don’t you? With this spell, you can create a pocket dimension capable of carrying an armory’s worth of weapons within it, being able to draw out whichever weapon stored in there you want with a thought."
77,,100,Teleport,MORTAL KOMBAT 9-10,Domain ,"You can teleport a short distance, either through magic, temporarily disassembling yourself and rapidly reassembling yourself, or something else like creating a portal. If you’d prefer, you can instead teleport your opponent with this move, though the distance is still short and it must be avoidable somehow; alternatively, it can work on the attacks of yourself or your opponent, increasing your range or letting you redirect their attacks. For an additional 100 KP it can do two of these things, while spending 300 KP total will let you do all of them.

78,,100,Teleportation Rings,Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous,Domain ,"Of all the structures built by Mendev, this is likely to be the most popular. A teleportation ring can be connected to a network of similarly constructed rings, allowing instant transportation even across entire countries. Each ring requires a small building to contain arcane workings and components but these buildings appear to spring up from nowhere alongside any keep, settlement or other major property that you are considered to own or command. The network has seemingly no limit on range but can only be used once every few hours, limiting the way it might affect any unlucky economies."
79,,100,Retraining Bar        ,Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous,Domain ,"A shop never too far away from any town you visit. It may seem like a humble bar but within is a
veteran adventurer who claims to be a member of the Pathfinders Society. He’ll always have some interesting story to tell of his adventures but the primary service he offers is ‘retraining’. He’s able to help you quickly relearn pretty much anything you gained from actual learning, training and growth and transfer that experience into something else that could also be trained. A master wizard could become a master fighter and vice versa, though the lack of acquired equipment or copied spells might leave both slightly inferior. 

The first few instances of this are free but afterwards, the man will charge a fairly hefty price. He can help your allies the same way but he’ll only be able to retrain you in one thing at a time. It might be your adventuring class here or a similar skillset from another world, but he can’t help you reallocate your entire life at once. "
80,,100,2 D World,Anima Ark Of Sinners,Domain ,This game is in 2D but perhaps you can turn that to your advantage. You can at will make the world go into a 2D plane which would mean that enemies could only ever come from either your right or your left. This makes surrounding you almost impossible.
81,,100,Gem Mine,Valkyrie Crusade ,Domain ,"A few shiny gems can go a long way. These basic mines are chock full of gems and crystals just waiting to be harvested. Some of the gems mined might even be slightly magical, having been infused with magic from the atmosphere. These mines will replenish each month.

82,,100,Magical Ticket,Castlevania - Order of Ecclesia,Domain ,"A ticket to where, you ask? A ticket to safety - or at least, to somewhere safer than wherever you might be. When this scrap of orange paper is torn in half, the holder of the ticket will be warped away to a small but pleasant place known as Wygol Village. Or, since Wygol likely won’t exist in future jumps, to a sleepy little town that’s one step short of being abandoned. There’s a statue of an angel that amplifies the power of healing magic and potions not too far away, as well as a merchant who will sell you more tickets. He’ll give you one free per week, but anything more than that will cost you. By default, these tickets take you back to Wygol - and to his shop - but after the jump ends they may be altered to a single similar location, such as the location of a monk holed up in castlevania and selling potions to passing hunters."
83,,100,My Oh My A Butterfly,Changeling The Dreaming,Domain ,"In popular media, it is quite common to see fairies flitting around with insectoid wings on their backs. Though it does not apply to all of the Kithain, there are a number who do fit this stereotype. You can now live out that primal dream of humanity, taking to the skies. At will, you can conjure a pair of wings on your back that will give you the ability to fly. What these wings look like is ultimately up to you, be they a butterfly’s, the wings of an eagle, or those of a bat. Either way, the sky is yours to do with as you see fit."
84,,100,Shack In The Woods,Castlevania - Lament of Innocence,Domain ,"While alchemy is not exactly frowned upon by the church, it is poorly understood by the common man and thus something for which you might be accused of witchcraft. Hence this small cabin, deep in the woods. At first glance it's a cross between a simple shop selling supplies to travelers and a place of relaxation for a man weary of the city life, but a secret back room and some underground chambers reveal a small but well stocked alchemical laboratory. There are even a number of barriers around the place that will subtly warn you if someone approaches the house... and if they're friendly or not. Or even human."
85,,100,Wooden wings,Grimms’ Fairy Tales,Domain ,"Woods made of wood, that you can clasp on your back and let you fly as a bird, leaving your hand free, and also let you carry an additional person. The wings will never tire and will moves as if an extension of your body."
86,,100,Flight,Hyperdimension Neptunia,Domain ,"Have you tried walking when you’re 4 feet tall? Flying is much better. So you fly. Also, you can fly now. In case that wasn’t clear. It’s not much faster than your walking speed, but the mobility can be helpful."
87,,100,Witch’s Broom,Touhou Luna Nights,Domain ,"You have an ordinary-looking broomstick. When you are seated upon this you can magically fly around in every direction; ducking, weaving, standing on it to cast spells, and similar feats of skill are second nature to you. Even ramming it into someone won’t damage it somehow. Surprisingly comfy, despite being wooden and being a broomstick means it’s very useful for sweeping."
88,,100,Not Going Home Yet ,Touhou Luna Nights,Domain ,"You’re very good at stopping people from leaving before you’re done with them. If you so choose, you can bar all the exits from your location, and more importantly, completely stop anyone from travelling between dimensions. This effect can cover an area roughly equivalent to the Scarlet Devil Mansion at once. This effect will end when you no longer wish to keep them, or they defeat you in combat. Note that they will not necessarily know you are behind it, though they will likely realise something is up."
89,,100,Aportation Feature,Wild Arms 2,Domain ,"Rather than an object, this is a feature that can be applied to any vehicles you own and makes them teleport to the closest location when you’re teleported yourself, or at your command. Any means of transport with this feature will be teleported to the nearest place they can stay close to you: Boats stay at the nearest port, cars at the nearest parking spot etc.

Anytime you teleport, your vehicles will follow behind you. Applies to any vehicle you obtain in the future if you choose to apply it. You can revoke or reapply this feature at any time."
90,,100,Enough is Enough!,Wild Arms 2,Domain ,"This world has a lot of locked doors, passwords, switches, blocks and dozens of puzzles, therefore you will be spending a lot of time making IQ tests to advance on dungeons and on story... Unless you would rather not.

This will take care of all that annoying stuff, now you can “skip” any legwork directly and instantly solve all puzzles you encounter, it will still require you being capable of solving the issue, but you do not have to suffer the bore of actually moving the blocks in the hole, pressing switches, finding clues etc. All that gets done automatically and can be glossed over with no one finding anything strange about this."
91,,100,Universal Dream,Mage: The Ascension,Domain ,"There’s not much call for a shaman in a world without spirits. As you enter each new jump, you can choose to cause the creation of a spiritual reflection of any mundane dimension, much like the Middle Umbra and populated with Umbrood, so long as there isn’t already one."
92,,100,The Beasts of Naggaroth,Warhammer Fantasy: Dark Elves,Domain ,"A chunk of Naggaroth is now yours with each purchase here. Each environment is dominated by a different specimen of war animals native to Naggaroth, thriving in such numbers that an army could break in dozens from their population without decreasing it. From the Dark Pegasi of the Iron Mountains to the scorpion-tailed Manticores of the Chaos Wastes to the ill-tempered Hydras, you have a resilient breeding population of terrifying animals at your disposal.

After this jump, a new attachment to your Warehouse will connect to a separate subspace in which the beasts thrive in a microcosm of their natural habitat-an island similar to Naggaroth on a smaller scale, in which you may continue to tame and rear such creatures. Be warned; Naggaroth’s animals are as vicious as the Dark Elves themselves and should you not be a skilled beastmaster it is strongly advised that you use The Merciless Host to invest in a contingent of those who know how to handle such creatures.

94,,100,Teleport Stone        ,World of Final Fantasy: Mirage Keeper,Domain ,Teleports you and anyone with you to the entrance of a dungeon.
95,,100,Tomb,Mummy: The Curse,Domain ,"Though probably not the place you were originally buried, a tomb is a geomantically designed area where you can meditate to restore the Pillars of your soul and where your corpse can rest. By default your tomb will be fairly small and only slightly aid your regeneration of Pillars. You can choose to have it be highly geomantically blessed, giving a huge bonus to Pillar regeneration or have it full of traps and curses or fill it with wealth and tools. For each 100CP extra you spend, you can add one of the other benefits to your tomb.

With each new jump, your Tomb will reset to being a Warehouse attachment. You can choose to deploy it somewhere in the world, including adding it as a secret room or basement to another structure.

97,,100,Jigokuchō Garden,Bleach,Domain ,"Jigokuchō, also known as Hell Butterflies, are a type of spirit being resembling black butterflies. These insects are used by the Shinigami for two important purposes. The first is as an escort, allowing them to use the Dangai, which is a gate that allows for travel between Soul Society and the human world. The second is as messengers; near undetectable owing to their low levels of reiatsu, hell butterflies are able to transport incredibly important and covert messages between worlds. Upon purchase, you will receive a small garden where Jigokuchō reproduce at a consistent rate, with any one of them able to be commanded for whatever tasks you may have for them. They also make for surprisingly affectionate pets, despite being bugs. "
98,,100,Soul Ticket,Bleach,Domain ,"Black and white slips of paper with a diamond shaped seal at one end. One of the many useless products of Soul Society’s aimless R&D, this ticket allows for free passage to Soul Society by non- Shinigami. Needless to say, they’re not given out often. In future settings, this ticket will instead allow you to enter whatever the default afterlife is, and serve to placate whoever is keeping watch providing you don’t act up. For an additional 50CP each, you may buy additional tickets to share with others. Obtain replacements at the start of a new Jump if given away. 

Note: Additional purchases grant two tickets each time.

Be it the far reaches of space or the bowels of Hell, so long as you have a message to give to the Hero of a tale, you'll always find your way to them with just the words they need to hear, even if they don't quite get what it is you're telling them just yet."
100,,100,Sorothustran Space Yacht ,A Mage Of Sorothustra,Domain ,"No one says going about official business has to be all work and no place. This is a luxurious and mobile palace that is capable of moving at speeds that tremendously dwarf the speed of light. It is staffed with servants and staff who are slavishly loyal to you, see to all of your needs, and fit your aesthetic preferences."
101,,100,Faster!,Generic D&D 5e,Domain ,"In combat. you’re faster than the majority in the realms - at least as fast as a skilled bandit captain, or Hobgoblin Warlord. How much faster, is proportional to how fast you are. This makes an average Joe commoner equal to a Bandit captain, while if Durnan took this, the strongest canonical fighter we know of, he would probably be roughly equal to Drizzt, the fastest character we know about."
102,,100,Do You Consider Walking Magic?,Frieren - Beyond Journey's End,Domain ,"Magic is the domain of demons, but they only focus their entire lives into a single spell. Then, why were also the skies something that demons used to rule? That is because demons don’t understand flying magic as something to be ‘learnt’, but it is no different to them than walking.

Whether you are a demon or not, you are quite adept at flight magic and aerial combat."
103,,100,A Hidden Manse ​(Tier 2),Generic Exalted,Domain ,"Now we're talking. You get a Manse, the Manse of course being a piece of land that is somehow magical in some fashion or another. They're aspected towards a certain type of Essence, either elemental essence such as Wood, Water, Earth, Fire, or Air or alternatively they're aspected towards the Celestial elements such as the Sun, Moon, Stars, or even Infernal or Abyssal (which are quite rare normally). Aside from being a spot of land that you now own (as long as you can protect it) a Manse also produces a Hearthstone.

Hearthstones, when socketed into certain weapons/armor/amulets, provide both unique magical effects and act as channels of the Manse itself allowing for vastly improved regeneration of Essence. Did I mention you also regenerate Essence faster while in the Manse? Yeah, you do. Anyways there are far too many Manses to actually list here in this document so we'll just go by price. For 100cp a 2dot. You can choose any Manse you want from the Core books or official supplement books for Exalted that you have paid the appropriate cost for. 

Of note is that while you can have more than one Manse only ones you purchase here will follow you between jumps, inserting themselves flawlessly into new worlds (or as an addition to your Warehouse, your choice either or). Additionally you will need at least one open hearthstone socket for every hearthstone you have if you want to make use of them. Manse's can range from the size of a small forest clearing to the size of a reasonably large nobles estate (call it 100 acres), you choose what size yours is, the more expensive the Manse you bought the bigger it can be.

104,,100,Heavenly Wings,Diablo 3,Domain ,"A shining pair of wings adorn your form, allowing you flight. You can keep yourself off the ground perpetually, without tiring and can move a bit faster than if you would walk. With training you can even move them as limbs to either grab things or even walk with them."
105,,100,The Servant World,Fate/Grand Order Part 1,Domain ,"Hanging out in the Throne of Heroes all day can get somewhat boring, y'know? Thankfully, Servants aren't quite stuck there. Aside from the relatively rare summoning, there's the annual Servantfes festival to have some fun among fellow Heroic Spirits. Additionally, thanks to the Incineration of Human History, it has become a lot easier to make small Singularities to host events within. In this world you'll generally be invited to most of these events, but the main benefit of this purchase is that you can still attend them in future jumps. From the Servantfes, to holiday related events, and even to some extra events like the occasional Nerofest, you'll find that entering the Singularities to participate sees no time at all passing in the jump itself, letting you wind down without worry. Additionally, while in these events in future worlds with histories divergent from the human history of Fate's Earth, you'll come across new Servants, based on historical, mythological, and perhaps even some fictional figures from the world you are in and the worlds you have visited. Quite the opportunity to make new friends. Talking with the people who shaped history can give quite strange insights, too."
106,,100,Hammer Go Bang-Bang ,Heroes of the Storm,Domain ,"On the other hand, the wizards and warriors from more archaic lands may feel left out. Never fear, this random blacksmith and his magical forge(-equivalent) is here! If you arcane staff is damaged in battle, they can repair it. If your sword or shield is wrecked, they can bang it back into shape or whip up a replacement in a reasonable amount of time. As for who exactly is doing this, well-you have a lot of freedom to decide here but do try to keep it relatively related to your loadout. A surly dwarf, a reclusive demonic spirit, a spirit of the woods-whatever could reasonably restore your arms and armour on short notice. Don’t expect them to be drawn from their work without good reason, but if you get to know them in time you might just learn a little more about your talented friend."
107,,100,"“But First, They Must Catch You”",Heroes of the Storm,Domain ,"You would expect a lot of enemy groups to attack the smartass buffing and healing the rest of the party right off the bat, wouldn’t you? Well here’s the problem: Folks who don’t have combat as their main focus tend to stay very, very mobile in the heat of combat. And like them, whatever means of mobility you have available to you is significantly better than it would normally be; a subtle buff with mundane capabilities perhaps, but know that it scales with any form of mobility you have.

If you are but a normal human medic or engineer, you inexplicably can run at speeds that would make Usain Bolt green with envy. If you can take to the skies, you can acrobatically duck and soar in ways beyond your kin. And if you have access to teleportation, you could push the limits of what it’s capable of-innovating short range flash-teleports for a normally long-charged teleportation spell, or vanishing over many more miles than your peers. And that’s before you start actively training your mobility, at which point you’ll find yourself unlocking unique skills that further boost your means of travel in subtle but permanent ways."
108,,100,Swift Wings ,The Elder Scrolls: Dovah,Domain ,"You have been given a great gift that the vast majority of mortals will never experience, flight. So why not do something more with it? Through long practice or natural talent, you are nearly thrice as fast when flying, putting most other dragons to shame with speed alone. But speed isn't the only factor in flight, as you are much more agile and graceful in the air than anything your size has any right to be."

110,,100,Ancient Knowledge ~ Sharlayan ,Final Fantasy XIV,Domain ,"With recent expeditions into Sharlayan, the architects have found plenty of inspiration, and while not all of its secrets have been unveiled to the outside world, the architects have still managed to adapt plenty of things. Hopefully, you like books, because this renovation seems to be intent on making your Estate resemble a massive library.

The mechanical hallways and rooms are a nice feature, though still reliant on the power of the Crystal in order to facilitate movement. Some facilities within the Estate may now remind you more of a production line rather than a living space, but you certainly can’t deny the efficiency that it brings.

You’ll also get used to the little robots that scurry about the house no doubt, but it will lead you to wonder – why are they carrying parts around, and what are they building in that new chamber underneath your basement?

111,,100,Aura of Frost ~ Ishgard,Final Fantasy XIV,Domain ,"The architectural style of Ishgard has always demonstrated an inclination to build towards the sky, rather than expanding across the land. Accordingly, your Estate will also increase in terms of how many floors in has, and you’ll find that there have been many observatory pavilions added on every single floor.

The halls, constructed to reflect the solemn style of Ishgard’s many religious sanctums, have very high ceilings and its walls are lined with glass windows to reveal the surrounding environment. The sheer abundance of stairs may tire your guests, but a series of Crystals facilitate quick transportation around the Estate, acting as a limited Aetheryte Grid.

But just as Ishgard has its walls, your Estate comes with its own considerable modifications for the sake of protection. A wall of frost can be conjured at will, keeping the Estate isolated from the outside save for controlled entry points.

112,,100,The Power of Wealth ~ Ul’Dah,Final Fantasy XIV,Domain ,"Transforming your estate into a desert palace, intended to mimic the intimidating architectural style found in Ul’Dah, your visitors will think they’re visiting a fortress rather than a manor. Having a massive exterior wall definitely contributes to the architect’s original intentions, and you’ll even find functional wall defenses inside the fortifications.

The internal décor however, is made to be lavish, so while the exterior seems very utilitarian and hostile, the interior is a veritable palace fit for royalty. You’ll find however, that the architects chose to install many secret passages throughout the manor during their renovations and under the estate grounds lay the biggest modifications yet.

To properly reflect the wealth of Ul’Dah, your basement has been converted into a mine – albeit not any type of mine that you’ve seen before. The architectural style still reminds you of a palace, but in the corners of the walls, you’ll find mineral nodes cropping out. By manipulating the Crystal in the center, you can control what minerals and gems can line the walls – but you need to have an adequate amount of the resource in question first.

113,,100,Arboreal Charm ~ Gridania,Final Fantasy XIV,Domain ,"To match the element of nature found in Gridania, the architects took many liberties in redesigning the entire estate – even changing the materials lining the walls. When the transformation is finished, you won’t be living in so much of an estate, but more of a tree.

Your new estate is certainly the exemplar of green architectural design, so much so that you can even cultivate plants in your hallways. The Crystal’s magic is tuned so that nature Elementals will spring forth to tend to the house, and you’ll soon learn to expect that whatever grows here tends to end up being slightly bigger than you might see in the outside world.

Gardens are present on every floor naturally, but the top floor of your estate will be transformed into an open air pavilion both for growing plants, and attracting wildlife to your Estate. Hope you like birds.

114,,100,Naval Blessing ~ Limsa Lominsa ,Final Fantasy XIV,Domain ,"Renovations made in a style to reflect the seaside beauty of Limsa Lominsa, you’ll find that after these renovations are done, it will feel like your estate is simply an island floating on water. In fact, with all the renovations complete, you won’t escape the sound of water flowing anywhere you go – since even your corridors will have designed channels flowing through them.

With all the water flowing in and around your estate grounds, even the Crystals will be tuned to the element of water. Each major Crystal in your estate, once you introduce a sample of water into them, will produce a steady trickle of that water – even to the point of reproducing its effects, albeit in a much weakened fashion.

While the water produced from these crystals generally pool around the Crystal, you may instead choose to direct their flow in channels to a central lake in your estate grounds. The Crystals will also purify water running through the Estate, so there is no worry about water going stale.

You might want to consider setting up a drainage system though, with all this
water moving about.

115,,100,Independent Manifestation,Fate/Tale Of The Beasts,Domain ,"A skill which may be vital to what makes one a Beast. This skill allows you to exist and manifest in a time period and place of your own choosing. Furthermore, with this skill you can also time travel. Though it will take a couple of days for you to charge up the energy to jump to another time. Don’t worry, You won’t cause any time paradoxes and/or time shenanigans when using this skill.

Speaking of time, one of the reasons time paradoxes don’t happen is because time seems to ‘heal’ itself. While major alterations to the timeline will cause damage, minor things will simply be fixed and ignored. So moving a chair two inches to the right in the past won’t change anything, essentially stopping the butterfly effect in its tracks. While this perk makes it so that any actions you commit in the past/future will automatically heal, if you want to bring time’s ability to heal itself for the entire setting in future jumps it will cost an extra undiscounted 100CP."

The abandoned 10th Heaven constantly bombards visitors with fiery napalm-like liquid. The 12th is directly controlled by Xipe Totec, who sends those who wish to access the Axis Mundi on his level on quests of worth. And on the 11th level, all attempts to use the Purview of Prophecy automatically succeed if the seeker is willing to shed their blood for it, and a labyrinth conceals Tlazolteotl’s subrealm from outsiders. You too may have similar obstacles or rites throughout your Godrealm, which brutally smite outsiders and/or grant them divine boons for acting in compliance with your realm’s principles. Generally a single rite holds sway over a division between subrealms, or different gods’ influence. These do not impede you and your fellow properly enfranchised gods’ passage throughout the Godrealm, though you may still enjoy any beneficial effects they provide.

You have a wide discretion to define the parameters of your Axis Mundi, and for 200 GP you may secure an additional Axis Mundi.

More importantly for the gods, sometimes this fruit falls elsewhere and it’s juices form a river of sweet liquid in which sometimes just the right amount of conditions permit sweet, sweet amrita to emerge. A similar event regularly occurs in your realm for 200 GP, requiring certain cosmological natural processes to create a substance similar to amrita that is wondrously restorative to you (even if you are a Titanspawn) and baneful to your enemies. It may not necessarily incorporate an ocean of milk; if you already have a great river subsuming your Godrealm it may bubble up from its depths like natural gas or rain from the sky like manna, for example.

For 200 GP it may instead be an advantage commensurate with the hidden Hesperides tree, sealed by Hera to deny mankind eternal youth and health (and it is rumoured, by eating the entire crop of 12 apples in one sitting a truer form of immortality akin to rising from the dead like the phoenix, rapid regeneration or imperviousness to harm), and it’s draconic guardian.

When in a perilous situation, you can outrace jackrabbits and cheetahs and move at speeds at which you’d become a blur to the human eye. Grab some guns and become a sentient machine gun.

Being a controlled environment, if you have a creature creator active, you can also use this arena to test out potential monster combinations and modifications – though these will be simulations unless you actually proceed ahead with them of course. It’ll be a good environment to see what potential modifications you can make in any case.

At least, there should be, because wild monsters keep wandering in. Thankfully a barrier prevents them from wandering into the Arena proper.

What this means is that you now choose a location you own, now you can bring it with you, not just through jumps but physically, are you stuck a few districts away and it’s almost night?

You have also gained some control over the ‘fall’ that follows these jumps, allowing you to speed up your fall to the ground, as well as slightly alter the direction in which you fall, in order to cover a greater horizontal distance. This control only applies to falls which follow your jumps; it does not apply if you are pushed, trip, or otherwise sent into the air without your intent.

Additionally, you have the ability to perform a physics defying ‘double jump’, the quintessential platforming skill. In time, you may learn how to perform an additional third, or perhaps even fourth jump on top of this."

Upon signing the invitation, the guest will be teleported to a location of your choosing, with a portal behind them allowing them a means to escape. Once the portal has been used or the guest is killed, the portal disappears. Guests are allowed to bring help along in order to complete whatever the task is. If you wish, once an invitation is sent, you will witness the circumstances of the guest(s) from the moment they receive the invitation to the point where they sign.

It bears delicious fruits, whatever kind of fruit you want, And is seemingly in season all year round. No matter how many fruits you take from it, it always seems that there’s a few more not quite yet ripe fruits left. This only happens when you’re the one grabbing the fruit though. And of course, it’s quite solid as an anchor to the mortal world, or whatever world you happen to insert it into. In future worlds you’ll have to insert it somewhere, it can’t just be in your warehouse. Given it’s a mostly normal tree though, that shouldn’t pose too much of a problem."

Now you share this affinity with underwater life, maybe your mother was a mermaid or you have merfolk blood somewhere else in your ancestry. You can swim really well, as easily as you can comport yourself on land, and as mentioned you have no issues breathing underwater. Strangely, your voice also carries as far and as clearly underwater as it would on land. Perhaps there’s a smidgen of the magical in the blood of merfolk?

Whatever it is, it’s a natural environment the size of the average mountainside forest with a stark beauty and the pristine state of the wild as it was before the advent of mankind. Even if you are wholly human, being here is soothing to your mind and soul. There’s plenty of game and fresh water here, but no predators. To a wild beast, it’s practically Heaven."

With that comes quite a bit of experience in seeking out obscure corners to hide out in. Whether or not you fit this description, you certainly seem quite lucky when it comes to finding secret places to hide away in. Maybe it’s a graveyard, maybe a run-down warehouse nobody visits, or perhaps an old hotel, whatever it is with this purchase you gain a hideout that few will ever notice existing, even without any magical defenses to shroud its presence. The best part is that it’s connected to halfway decent leylines, allowing you to use it as a passable workshop in a pinch. It might not be high quality as a home, but sometimes a hideout is all you need, yes?"
168,,100,Winged Sandals,Hades,Domain ,"Getting from one place to another quickly enough to deliver the messages of the divines is even less easy than one might expect. After all, blaming the messenger is so easy should a dispatch arrive just a few moments too late.

170,,100,Underworld Pomegranate,Hades,Domain ,"The Underworld is not known for producing much in the way of edible goods. The pomegranate is the rare exception, brought down with Lord Hades himself when he first came to take up his throne. They have grown sweet and tart despite the lack of sunlight and proliferated to all corners of the Underworld. There are those who suggest they can see Olympus itself when ingesting one of these fruits, but that is just a fanciful rumor. You will be given eight fully grown pomegranate trees, two of which will always have fruit on them in their own season."
171,,100,Lava Moat,Hades,Domain ,"Few things truly express how little you desire visitors like a moat filled with bubbling, boiling, never-cooling lava. For a small fee, the river Phlegethon, ever filled with molten stone, can be directed to encircle a home, castle, or other similar structure that you own. TheHouse Contractor will even throw in a drawbridge that is guaranteed not to catch on fire or melt under the extreme heat now surrounding your property. And for those of you who happen to be avid fishers, you will be happy to know the river Phlegethon has a wide array of rather unusual fish to catch in its waters."
172,,100,Chocobo Farm,Final Fantasy II,Domain ,"A farm for raising Chocobo (or other farm-like animals). Has a fenced in field, stalls, food, equipment and a staff of workers needed to safely contain twelve creatures."
173,,100,Wind's Blessing,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Domain ,"A blessing from the Winds themselves, you will find your movement while wielding this aided by the wind, making you faster. Additionally, the wind will help guide your bolts, making them more accurate.

Requires Crossbow to Purchase"
174,,100,Menacing Float,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Domain ,"Most Eldritch creatures don't bother with the terrestrial movement of 'walking.' They usually float through the air through some strange mechanism. This movement takes less effort than running, and is also somewhat faster than it. You are also still capable of walking, if just for the novelty of it."
175,,100,Magical Transport,Out of Context: Disney Princess Supplement,Domain ,"You have your own form of magical transportation that matches your theme and origin, it could be a carriage that can transform to and from a vegetable, flying furniture or a chariot that calls birds to pull it."
176,,100,“Where was she keeping them?”,The Road to El Dorado,Domain ,"Probably the same place you hide your stuff. You are able to hide objects up to the size of a large book on your person... even if you honestly shouldn’t have a place to hold them. Whenever you need to retrieve an item you’ve tucked away, all you need to do is just reach into your coat or shirt or even just reach behind your back if you need to, and the item will suddenly be in your hands."
177,,100,A Horse And His God,Godbound,Domain ,"What demigods of great might and wisdom require first and foremost in these days is not wealth or riches, but reliable transportation. You now have some form of vehicle or steed that enables you to cover significant amounts of terrain faster and more tenaciously than even the hardened hovercraft of the Bright Republic, generally only sized for one or two riders but with plenty of room on the sides for sacks of loot. It could be a prototype theotechnological racing vehicle. It could be a divinely touched horse with wings, flying as fast as it can gallop. Regardless of whether with onboard weapons or mighty hooves, such vehicles are also adept at defending you, and fiercely loyal to you/locked onto your spiritual signature such that common thieves stand no chance of stealing it.

These may be purchased multiple times if you want additional steeds or vehicles.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
178,,100,Etheric Energy Node,Godbound,Domain ,"The ancient etheric energy nodes are each the size of industrial buildings, and uniquely safe for mortals to operate for the most part. However, the Focused Flow Control module that selectively depowers devices in areas powered by the node can be safely used by a divine being. Each node stabilizes natural law within a 30-mile radius and broadcasts subtle waves of etheric power, allowing the operation and powering of advanced mundane technology such as that created in the Bright Republic. You own one such node, and may buy more.

179,,100,Security Measures,Wizarding World,Domain ,"A tradesman lives and dies by their trade. What happens then when their very livelihood is threatened by outside forces? Regardless of your answer, you’ve taken steps to ensure that never happens to you. From now on, whatever property you own or run, shall automatically be adorned with magical security measures of all kinds.

From stairs that turn into slides the moment an intruder steps on them, doors disguised as paintings and walls, magical alarms that can alert you to intruders no matter where you are, and so many more. But do be careful. While these defenses are varied and strong, they mean nothing to truly dedicated witches and wizards.

Of course, we can’t exactly have you be unaware of the traps in your homes and businesses. To alleviate that little problem, you’ve been provided with a booklet. Its contents are neatly categorized, allowing you to quickly read through its pages to discover and learn what types of security measures have been implemented into your properties and where exactly they might be located. And if you add any more security measures, the booklet will automatically update itself.

Feel free to copy it down so that if you have any employees or visiting friends, they’ll be prepared for what lies within. That is, if you don’t turn it off when you or them are around."
180,,100,Firebolt Supreme,Wizarding World,Domain ,"It’s been mentioned before, but a witch or wizard will often have their first taste of flying within whatever wizarding school they attend. And for you, it shall only be fitting that your method of flight be better than most others. Enter the Firebolt Supreme. Outclassing its predecessor, a broom already capable of reaching 150 miles per hour from a standstill in ten seconds, the Firebolt Supreme would not even begin to be made until the turn of the 21st Century. Coupled with its unchallenged balance and precision, letting you stop and turn on a dime, there are very few things that could hope to match you in the air on one of these, let alone catch up to you. It’s also rather comfortable to sit on, ensuring you won’t be aching too much from a long and hard day of Quidditch.

To help you out with your new purchase, you now have a brand-spanking new Broomstick Servicing Kit, perfect for making sure your Firebolt Supreme and any other broomsticks you possess will always be in tip-top shape."
181,,100,Knight Bus,Wizarding World,Domain ,"Serving as emergency transport for the stranded witch or wizard, you’ll likely encounter a few people who’ve ridden on the Knight Bus in your time here. Which is why you now have the chance to bring it along with you. Now, everywhere you go, all you have to do is raise your wand with the intent to call upon it and it shall appear. Hop on board and the bus shall bring you to wherever you want to go. Within reason of course. You won’t even have to pay! Be careful though. The Knight Bus is not exactly what you would call a comfortable ride.

Fittingly enough, as proof of your ownership, you will receive a portion of the proceeds the Knight Bus makes every week within a small deposit box in your Warehouse. The proceeds are entirely dependent on how many people board the Knight Bus so depending on where you are, you could receive as little as a hundred and eleven Sickles or up to eleven hundred Galleons."
182,,100,School Explorer,Wizarding World,Domain ,"If you’ve ever been in a school, you’ll probably have noticed that these institutes are always a bit more maze-like than you might expect. There’s a lot of hidden areas and secret nooks and crannies in places that you’d never expect. And this goes more than double for wizarding schools, with their space-bending labyrinthine structures and their utterly colossal sizes. Luckily for you, this won’t be much of a problem.

You have a knack for travelling through labyrinths like Hogwarts with ease. You never need to worry about getting lost unless something or someone is making sure you get lost. More than that, your skill at direction also helps you out whenever it comes to stumbling onto secret passages or chambers. With a bit of time and effort, perhaps you could even map out a place as confusing and maddening as Hogwarts itself."
183,,100,Three-Dimensional Travel ,Wizarding World,Domain ,"While many wizards will often have some experience with flight during their childhood, mostly as a result of Quidditch practice, the bulk of their skill in such a thing most often comes from their school years, especially if they find themselves as part of a Quidditch team. And now, you can certainly qualify, your skills with a broom so good that with a bit more meat to your bones, you can even find yourself playing for the big leagues. In fact, your skills here apply to more than just flight. So long as it involves a third dimension, such as swimming underwater, you’ll find that your skills in flight somehow transfer there, almost as if it were magic."
184,,100,Cloud Carpet,Gummi Bears,Domain ,"A magical flying,floating transportation option which seems to be able to move about twice as fast as you can run. You can also cause it to thunder, rain and strike things below it with weak lightning."
185,,100,Teleport Rune Stones,Wizard 101,Domain ,"A set of three pairs of stones, done in whichever style you like from across the spiral, that can shift you from one stone to its marked partner. The traditional way to set up a system like this in the Spiral is to have one stone from each pair in a hub area, with each paired stone in a separate key location. Only has the range to cover a large neighborhood. May be taken multiple times.

186,,100,Rusted Iron Ring,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Domain ,"An iron band that has been terribly rusted, stained faintly of blood. Those who wear this ring will find their footing more assured, allowing them easier movement through difficult terrain, such as in a murky swamp or walking along a sheet of ice."
187,,100,Swift Wings ,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Domain ,"All dragons and drakes are gifted wings capable of flight, traveling through the Archtrees faster than the wind itself. You now possess this very same power, manifesting as two great wings near your shoulders. Should you have not taken the dragon origin, then you can either fly unaided, or have the wings disappear when not in use. They can also change in aesthetics, depending on what origin you possess."
188,,100,SR-71 Blackbird,Hellsing,Domain ,"Still one of the fastest aircraft today, this enormous aircraft is one of the few left over after it’s retirement. At thirty two meters of length and the ability to fly at over Mach 3, the black beast would be a terror if anyone could ever catch sight of it. But extensive stealth capabilities aid it in hiding from many forms of detection. Normally, piloting the ship would require two highly trained pilots but it seems this aircraft will operate itself according to your will simply by being in contact with the ship, even from the outside."
189,,100,Gravity Discount ,Star vs the Forces of Evil,Domain ,"You can spit gravity in the eye and fly. Whether it be due to magic, twirling your ponytails like helicoptor rotors, or simple “I don’t know”, you can fly as fast as you can run, and you have no height ceiling (so long as you can survive). Oh, and you can move around in zero gravity without a problem now. (How does it work when there’s no atmosphere? That falls under “I don’t know.”) "
190,,100,Benny The Cab,Who Framed Roger Rabbit,Domain ,"“If you ever need a ride, just stick out yer thumb!” By doing just that, Benny the Cab will zip along, ready to give you a ride wherever you need to go- within reason, he’s still a car, ya know?"
191,,100,​​A Place That Perhaps You Have Seen In Your Dreams,The Nightmare Before Christmas,Domain ,"When you sleep and dream you can choose to go to the place where holidays come from. Christmas, Easter, Thanksgiving, Halloween and so on. You can’t bring anything in or out but what you’re wearing (and food here will not sustain you) but it all seems real while you’re in there."
192,,100,Entrance to Lalotai,Moana,Domain ,"No matter where you go in your travels, you will always be able to find an entrance to Lalotai, the realm of monsters. Why you might want to go there is anyone’s guess, but it is said that (since it lies at the bottom of all oceans) the treasures of countless cultures lie there... and there are mysteries to explore down there, and monsters to fight, so there is that."
193,,100,Pixie Dust,Disney Villains Victorious,Domain ,"This small cloth pouch contains a handful or two of a familiar, sparkling gold dust. Aside from being pretty to look at, sprinkling it on someone will give them the ability to fly!...so long as they think happy thoughts. Since thinking happy thoughts in the sky is a bit harder these days, it also works with things like ‘hope’ and ‘trust’ if happy thoughts aren’t on the table. It refills daily, and generally lasts several days per person."
194,,100,Seven League Boots,Marvel Magic,Domain ,"​Legends that speak of these enchanted boots say that they allow the wearer to take seven leagues with each stride, allowing them to cross great distances unfathomably quickly. These boots, though sharing the name and being enchanted, do something a little different. Instead of increasing the length of the wearer’s stride, they simply allow them to walk upon anything, be it air, water, or walls."
195,,100,Hell Charger,Marvel Cinematic Universe - Volume 2,Domain ,"Why should you have to walk or run everywhere you need to get? Worse, why deal with the pains of public transportation? With this 1969 Dodge Charger, you’ll be able to ride in STYLE. Even better, its composition allows you to channel fire of any sort into this vehicle and make it quite durable, enough that it could smash through other vehicles head-on and suffer no issue... so long as the one driving it has the sufficient firepower for it. Get it? Firepower? ...come on, work with me. Anyway, for an undiscounted 100CP you may instead have this property manifest onto any one vehicle you happen to possess, but why would you give up the classic appearance?"
196,,100,Flight ,X-23,Domain ,"One of the most common abilities among the X-Men, you just don't get anything to go along with the power of Flying. You get to choose what type of flying you have: gravitational, magnetic, telekinetic, magical, or energy."
197,,100,Stolen Sling Ring,She-Hulk & Ms. Marvel,Domain ,"Seems you took a souvenir from Kamar-Taj. Just like practitioners of sorcery around the world, you can use this magical artifact to open portals that span great distances and open into remote locations. This isn't foolproof, as it still requires uninterrupted concentration and a clear mind to create a precise and stable portal, but it sure beats taking the bus. Just be careful where you open your portals to."
198,,100,Infraspace,Marvel 2099,Domain ,"You have been linked - cybernetically or otherwise - to a pocket of extradimensional space. You can summon or store objects within this space, up to the size of a large gun, or send them back while holding them in your hands. This space can store about a large, walk-in closet’s worth of volume. It does, however, take time to render an item able to be transported this way, and you cannot transport a living creature. If you’d prefer you can forgo this pocket dimension, and instead use this to take or stow objects from/into your warehouse. The limits on objects transferred remain."
199,,100,Puzzle(100),Helltaker,Domain ,"A puzzle of your very own! Right now, however, it’s about as difficult as Modeus’ or Pandemonica’s - that is, solvable in 30 seconds or less. Immobile but movable bone demons, giant pushable but un-pullable blocks, a restart button, a locked block with the key needed to open it, and gaping floor-maws with optional intermittent patterns - the works!

In-Jump, this is an actual location in Hell. Post-Jump, you can tap someone to consciously send them to this puzzle until they solve it. After they do so, they will be unable to be trapped again for a year, so as to forget the puzzle’s solution. Attempts to trap an individual before this year is up will allow them to ‘Skip’ the puzzle. 

This ability is fiat-backed to take at least the purchased possible completion time to succeed, even if the individual trapped is a genius. Until they’ve spent enough time, even Reed Richards, Albert Einstein, and Steven Hawking would have difficulty solving it with their intellectual powers combined - let alone some random person taken from the street.

Multiple people may be sent to the puzzle at the same time. In theory, and based on the personalities and intellect of those sent, the individuals may help each other or work against each other to great or terrible effect.

There is no food or water within this puzzle. An individual who dies within will be on a respawn timer equal to the total amount of time they have spent within the puzzle since being trapped (not since last death). When the target solves the puzzle they’re transported back to the same place they were targeted in."
200,,100,Puzzle(200),Helltaker,Domain ,"A puzzle of your very own! The puzzle is now as hard as Zdara’s or Justice’s - gimmicky and easy to mess up a time or two at first, but easily solvable after the gimmick is unearthed. Can take as long as half an hour to solve.

In-Jump, this is an actual location in Hell. Post-Jump, you can tap someone to consciously send them to this puzzle until they solve it.

201,,100,Good Dog,Marvel Cosmic,Domain ,"Lockjaw is the goodest of boys and has saved his Inhuman family on numerous occasions. You, like him, are able to teleport as far as the distance between the Earth and the Moon without error and take up to a dozen or so people near you. You can also open pathways to other dimensions."
202,,100,Dancer’s Footwraps,Darkest Dungeon,Domain ,"A pair of footwraps meant to pad the feet when dancing among the dunes; they increase speed, and make it much harder to move the wearer."
203,,100,Bonus Package,Bayonetta,Domain ,"When you're fighting otherworldly beings, you need to keep up! You're so fast that you could keep up with all kinds of attacks, and if you put your mind to it your balance is so great you can surf on a missile. As you manage to jump up and land on it. Your agility is likewise boosted with your reflexes, and with training you can even surf a moving fighter jet."
204,,100,Laboratory,Generic Alchemist,Domain ,"A fully stocked and ready to use alchemical laboratory, complete with burners, storage containers, disposal units for failed experiments, personal safety equipment, an air scrubber and recycler, and an automatically updating log that takes your observations on an experiment and transcribes them directly. This comes with a basic set of materials necessary for the most common forms of alchemy. The laboratory keeps any upgrades made to it and can either be imported into a setting as a building or kept as a warehouse attachment."
205,,100,Recall Amulet,League of Legends ,Domain ,"This simple blue pendant is imbued with powerful teleportation magic. Whenever you want, you can invoke the power of this pendant to return to a set location- Such as a safehouse, a fortress, or a Fountain. So long as you remain undisturbed for a full eight seconds while the amulet powers up, you are teleported instantaneously past any and all barriers to the preset location. You can change the preset location by spending at least an hour attuning the amulet to your location of choice. If you are interrupted by taking damage during the eight seconds while the amulet readies itself, then the magic is lost and you will have to start over."
206,,100,"""Dancing Revenant""",Dark Souls 3,Domain ,"There's something distinctively wrong with the way you're able to move, how you're able to carry yourself. It may, perhaps, be rooted in some vital human quality, but that isn't something to concern yourself with. Your unnatural movements are a product of the world's loosened hold on your form, such that falling or maintaining your balance are less of a concern now. You fall a bit slower, and when jumping you get more hang time. Additionally, as long as at least one foot is firmly on the ground, you may contort, twist, lean and bend in whichever direction or way you wish without concern of falling or tipping over. Enemies will be end up perplexed by your impossible movements when you get used to this."
207,,100,Gathering Moss,Dark Souls 2,Domain ,"“Cast as barbarians by the invading kingdom of Drangleic, it is true that giants care little for clothing or complex architecture as man. However, what they aren’t are simple folk, just a race with appreciation for other aspects of the world and reality. You too have this appreciation in your soul, possessing a natural connection to nature. Plants grow more freely in your presence, animals become a bit less hostile, and you will find that should you live sedately enough then plants can even begin to grow in harmony with your body.”"
208,,100,Divine Seed ,Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,Domain ,"This seed behaves strangely when planted. It seems to make the ground incredibly nutritious, which allows any sort of thing to be planted if the weather is compatible. The divine seed itself will grow into golden grass that will always regrow as long as you don’t pluck them out. You can even cut the blades and replant them to further spread it. It takes a week for a handful of grass to grow and if you consume it, it will heal all wounds and cures you of any illness, although it takes quite a while to chew through unless you have some way of liquifying it for easier consumption."
209,,100,Old Hunter Bone,Bloodborne,Domain ,"“An Old Hunter's Bone formerly belong to a Hunter that apprenticed under Gehrman. Temporarily grants the one who uses it the ability to use the Art of Quickening. 

Quickening allows you to move in bursts of speed so fast, the untrained eye could mistake it for teleportation. More can be read under the Tier 3 perk on this power. Requires 5 bullets worth of blood to use, but lasts for a short time each use.”"
210,,100,Hunter’s Dream ,Bloodborne,Domain ,"“Fleeting images of an old workshop, an old hunter, an old doll, and a moonlit field of flowers dance in your head. The Hunter’s Dream is a place existing in another level of reality, where you can be empowered, commune benevolent figures, and return to on death. Yes, for the duration of this ‘nightmare’ you will have a connection to the Hunter’s Dream that resurrects you on death, and are able to travel to it through unique lanterns found in this world. Once your duty is done, you will lose your connection, but may still visit it through spending 100BE. 

Regardless, you will no longer be able to resurrect with this after the end of the initial nightmare. For strict clarification, that means the events taking place in Yharnam.”
"
211,,100,Stable Movement,Demon's Souls,Domain ,"​Not all environments are easy to move in such as ice, or beams for instance. You don't care about that because you can move them like it was just normal ground. This lets you run stuff like ice or wooden beams without falling down."
212,,100,Death Cell,Fantastic Beasts & Where to Find Them,Domain ,A pure white room with a chair floating above a pool full of a rippling death potion. Replays the happiest memories of a person’s life as the potion envelopes them to keep them sedated during execution. A warehouse addition.
213,,100,Basic Lands,MtG - Ixalan,Domain ,"For those who rely on access to lands in order to draw upon mana, you may purchase a pair of any two “basic” lands for 100 points. The basic lands, if a reminder is needed, are Plains, Islands, Swamps, Mountains, and Forests. Each one generates a charge of mana aligned to its respective color identity, that being White, Blue, Black, Red, and Green. The mana generated from one of these lands is enough to perform an impressive but not massive show of mage, such as destroying a group of twenty soldiers or empowering someone with the strength to attack and defeat the same."
214,,100,Fruit Of Sustenance ,MtG - Shandalar,Domain ,"This simple, apple-shaped brooch is in actuality a potent magical item. Rather than causing any direct effects, it instead bleeds magical energy into the environment around the wielder. This energy allows fruits and other vegetation to thrive regardless of local conditions, though after you leave the area there is no guarantee they will endure without the brooch’s support.

These plants are guaranteed to not only provide nutritious sustenance, the food they provide will always fit the tastes of whoever bears the brooch. The brooch ensures sufficient food on your path to feed three adults, provided they do not over-indulge, though you’ll find the amount increase if your own form requires more food than ordinary humans."
215,,100,Soothing Sights And Neon Lights(Duo Mana),MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Domain ,"For thousands of years, magic has been measured in motes of energy, the amount of power or life force that a certain amount of land - originally known as a Land - can produce inside a certain timeframe, be it minutes, hours, or days. If you have none of these, performing magic becomes significantly harder. Regardless, for 50 cp you may start the jump with a connection to one such land, be it a river meandering through a forest until it reaches the seas, or an Saiba experiment on a small pavilion where the waterfall flows upwards. For 200 cp, you may instead start with five such Lands, your choice between five of one, one of five, or any combination thereof. 

Separate from the above offer and its packaged deal, you may also make a one time payment of 100 cp to acquire a bond to a Land capable of providing two kinds of mana. This could range from anywhere between a highly futuristic zen garden and its air of tranquility and yet intelligence, to a downtrodden and crime ridden neighborhood with its reeking of decay and yet opportunity. As a small aside, these locations have a unique benefit to them - if left alone for a few weeks, they can be called upon for a small surge of healing - nothing major, but enough to drive a mild sickness from you or heal over a number of minor cuts. 

In both cases, once the jump ends you may choose between outright gaining the property rights to a similar stretch of land in future jumps, and turning them into a warehouse attachment."
216,,100,Honden of Jumper,MtG - Kamigawa,Domain ,"Honden’s are the inner sanctums of the Myojin, strongest spirits of the world of Kamigawa besides O- Kagachi, and thus they are places of power. This one seems to be mostly for show though, as it allows you to aesthetically alter the Warehouse to appear like an impressive palace upon a large mountain or something else. The exact details are yours to decide, but you must remember it is still the Warehouse, not a true world. The walls are still there, merely changed aesthetically into a sky box. This interacts with attachments and such in a simple way, allowing you to make those simplistic doors to other places much better looking and you could even make the doors into entire buildings, though then they’d take up space within your limited warehouse."
217,,100,Mosswort Bridge,MtG - Lorwyn,Domain ,"Green mana

A bridge set over a small forest brook with an oddly-shaped, barren tree on one end of the
structure. The entire thing is covered in moss, hanging especially thickly from the tree that
blocks normal usage of the bridge. Strangely, those branches look almost like fingers..."
218,,100,Spinerock Knoll,MtG - Lorwyn,Domain ,"Red mana

A lonely, strangely-shaped mountain covered in grass and spine-like rocks. From a distance,
you’d almost think this was a sleeping dragon. Aside from the fact that dragons don’t exist of
course. Maybe this is where all those silly legends and myths of dragons came from?"
219,,100,Howltooth Hollow,MtG - Lorwyn,Domain ,"Black mana

A watery swamp, filled with mists and surrounded by large rocks jutting up from the ground
like great stone teeth. Most peculiarly of all, a large rock shaped a bit like the head or skull of
a truly massive canine juts out from the shrubbery-covered land and over the water."
220,,100,Shelldock Isle,MtG - Lorwyn,Domain ,"Blue mana

A small, bulb-shaped island set in a river, with a modest bit of forestry, a small dock built on
one side, and a large opening that would allow a boat to row under (or into) it. Yes, it looks
like the shell of some sort of turtle, but what beast could possibly have a shell this big?"
221,,100,Windbrisk Heights,MtG - Lorwyn,Domain ,"White mana

A sunny, grassy plateau raised so high you can see clouds roll by. A quiet, peaceful place
with a great view. Though, if looked at from one angle, the cliffside looks surprisingly...
avian? Those outcroppings a wing, that one a beak, those trees a feathered crest?"
222,,100,Town ,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Domain ,"A town which you have attuned to, perhaps even your home town. You choose two colors which the town will be aligned with permanently. When generating a mote of Mana it can be one of the two chosen Colors. While you can gather Mana here that is not the only benefit this town makes an excellent place to recruit people to your cause and as a source of revenue."
223,,100,Fortress,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Domain ,"A fortress from which you can stage a defense in a fairly remote and out of the way location. You choose two colors which the fortress will be aligned with permanently. When generating a mote of Mana it can be one of the two chosen Colors. This place makes for an excellent staging ground for military maneuvers, is extremely hard to breach by an army of similar size even accounting for mages and is a fine place to make a last stand. The fortress also comes with a water supply and a place to grow food."
224,,100,Temple ,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Domain ,"Your own personal temple dedicated to a concept, the concept will depend on what Color’s it can generate. You choose two colors which the temple will be aligned with permanently. When generating a mote of Mana it can be one of the two chosen Colors. In addition to being a place of worship from which you can gather clerics, or scientists depending on the kind of temple. It is also a place of foresight, providing some method of minor divination, whether that be from divine inspiration, scientific prediction, or raw instincts."
225,,100,Winged Sandals,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Domain ,"A pair of Grecian sandals with small wings attached to the ankle areas. Perhaps Perseus’ most minor
gift but one that remained vital for him. The one that wears the sandals will find themselves able to
levitate and fly at their will, moving as quickly and agilely as they would on land. The sandals move
through magic, meaning that there is no propulsion effect, but the wings must be able to beat at
your heels and thus the sandals are ineffective at moving through water at speed. "
226,,100,Vimana,Fate/Legends - Nirvana Yuga,Domain,"The all in one flying fortress used by the gods. Your own Vimana appears, a golden-white vehicle
intended to soar through the heavens as a worthy ship for any deity. Able to take on a sleek fighter
jet like winged form or a larger aerial fortress capable of holding a small group of people, this
machine moves at the speed of thought to ensure even a deity is not displeased with it’s mobility. A
huge array of magical artefacts placed into Vimana allow it a dizzying array of abilities. Optic
camouflage, 3-D movement, laser attacks, ancient machine guns and nuclear weapons, biological
attacks and far more. On it’s own the vehicle would not threaten notable heroes or gods but it is
more than enough to rout mortal armies on it’s own or reshape the landscape on a more local level.
It moves according to your thoughts, allowing you to direct the machine even from a distance. "
227,,100,Hermit On The Move,Fate/Legends - Land of Shadows,Domain,"A life alone doesn’t need to be a life of greater danger. So long as you have the right skills and
knowledge of where you travel, a lonely life can be quite pleasant. You’ve been travelling around
Ireland for many years now, becoming quite skilled at making your way across long distance quickly, safely and without making much fuss. It’s also given you a pretty extensive knowledge of Ireland, or
the country you find yourself in in the future, such that you’re aware of everything from the local
politics to where many of the less well hidden supernatural factions, creatures and locations can be
found. And this life has also led you to take on quite the mysterious vibe yourself, people often find
themselves interested in you for no other reason then that you are you. A question for others to
hopelessly try to unravel."
228,,100,221B Jumper Street,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Domain,"A comfortable home, squeezed between the rows of houses in the inner city. Two storeys and rather
cluttered inside, but still furnished and styled to your personal tastes. It’s filled with a variety of
curios and personal interests, things fitting to your own particular hobbies and sure to entertain any
guests. Whoever the owner of this house is, they appear to have an exceptional reputation with the
local and national law enforcement, the sort that has them draw on the occupant for advice and
support quite often. The perfect place for a private eye to make his business from."
229,,100,The Books of England,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Domain,"Value far beyond money to the eyes of any collector or lover of literature, this victorian-era building
contains a copy of every written work published within England and the British Empire. First editions
in perfect condition, from the oldest fairy tales and manuscripts to more recent plays and novels, even the scripts for modern entertainment programs can be found. Provided it is public, an
impeccably maintained version can be found within this library, which is also fitted with many
comfortable lounging chairs, fireplaces and a variety of refreshments to make the reading all the
more pleasant."
230,,100,Childhood Home,Fate/Legends - Vive la France,Domain,"The place you grow up or at least somewhere that brings out the same nostalgic feelings in your
heart. This simple homestead farm is not some place of great profit but rather a quiet place, where
spiritual reflection becomes easy and recovering from the wounds of the world is a much more
pleasant task. A loving family runs the farm, either the one who raised you or one that has come to
consider you part of their clan despite your other origins. Whatever happens in the rest of the world, whatever deeds you do for good or ill, they’ll always welcome you home with a warm bowl of food
and some chores to busy your mind with. The skies are always clear and blue here, the fields healthy
and green. It is a place for the soul."
231,,100,Dark Place,Fate/Legends - Garden of Avalon,Domain,"The enemies of Camelot can hardly live in the open, not with the immense power the Round Table
may wield against their enemies. But that is why those enemies keep places like the one you have
now, dark places hidden from the searching eyes of the king’s men. You have a hideaway, such as a
witch’s hut in a swamp or a small home made deep in a cave system. Not only is it very hard to find
through normal means but it also heavily warded against magical forms of detection or searching. There are a fair few monsters around this home but they’re fine with leaving you alone so long as
you don’t disturb them."
232,,100,A Corner Street Newsstand ,Cultist Simulator,Domain,"A small newspaper stand with a small selection of literature. The papers here holler with confidence, knowing that only the initiated will listen. This stand only seems to sell newspapers of the tabloid variety, that just so happen to be written with rather truthful stories. These daily news sometimes include useful information regarding the many demi-real Secret Histories.
"
233,,100,A Dusty Workshop  ,Cultist Simulator,Domain,"A cozy but unkempt mechanics workshop. The clattering of tools livens the machines inside it, and they open at the seams from the laughter. This workshop contains all the tools needed to service any vehicle, from a small motorcycle, to a large truck. The big parts need to be called in, but the little plugs and bolts always seem to be on stock. There’s a hidden room in the back of the building that leads to a private shrine, where influences of the Forge and Knock congregate.
"
234,,100,A Velvet Cabaret ,Cultist Simulator,Domain,"A gaudy cabaret in a corner of an alley. In here, talent comes through the front, while the real patrons go through the back. This establishment is always run by a local gang, loyal dogs who will provide the much needed ‘protection’ free of charge. The music is smooth, the drinks are free, and the company is never lacking. In the private rooms, influences of Edge and Grail bleed with pain and ecstasy."
235,,100,A Candle-lit Monastery  ,Cultist Simulator,Domain,"A quiet monastery lit by thousands of candles. The wax of the candles flows endlessly, and the light inside never dims. This monastery includes a church, a library and a cloister where your followers and practitioners may take residence. The candles, the larder, and the cellar, refill themselves every night when no one is watching. When the doors of the parish are closed to visitors, influences of Lantern and Moth descend on these halls.
"
236,,100,A Quiet Hotel ,Cultist Simulator,Domain,"A lovely hotel with the words “Overlook” emblazoned at the entrance. During the day, bustling caretakers tend to the precincts, at night cold winds sweep the orchards. This countryside hotel is managed by the spirits of the dead, who keep things stocked and tidy for their ignorant guests. In the gardens there’s a particularly large hedge maze where the influence of Winter wanders, while the ballroom soaks with the influences of the Heart from the floors above.
"
237,,100,Flying​ ​Leap​ ​,Sailor Moon,Domain,"Superman, in his original appearance, could not fly, but he could leap over entire buildings without even taking damage or suffering pain. You can do the same, swiftly jumping from your high place and landing perfectly on your feet or enemies, if you’re inclined. You can also do the opposite--jump across the gaps of buildings or jump out of the way of huge blasts. You can land perfectly, without stumbling. This perk will not save you if you are knocked from a high place. Only if you jumped of your own volition, and from a reasonable distance. Jumping from a helicopter or airplane without a parachute remains a bad idea.
"
238,,100,Favored Library ,Libriomancer,Domain,"Attached to your warehouse you gain a small but well stocked library filled with all of your favorite books with a small sitting area and comfortable lighting. They are mint condition with authors signatures and first editions available to you if so desired. Furthermore, any book you bring in here will be stored, labeled and sorted onto the appropriate bookshelf for easy retrieval. While the library will expand to accept more books it will not take in duplicates and any items left in the library will be shunted back to the warehouse after an hour."
239,,100,Sonic Form ,Lyrical Nanoha,Domain,"The layered fields that make up the appearance of a Barrier Jacket include protective fields, mobility-improving fields and other miscellaneous utility fields. By removing energy from one set of fields, it is possible to direct that freed power to another parameter. In this case, almost all of the power is diverted from armor and barriers into raw speed and mobility. The user can expect themselves to become far, far faster than normal, but at the cost of durability, with only one good hit being required to remove them from combat. (CG Note: Requires Device - Lyrical Nanoha first.)
"
240,,100,Riddles of the Sphinxes ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Domain,"At the gates to your tomb and every door within, an animated carving of a Sphinx guards without fail. The presence of this Sphinx greatly enhances the durability of any gate or door and allows it to deny entrance to any who cannot break the door or answer its riddle. You can always decide what riddles the Sphinxes will give, though each one is quite an intelligent and crafty riddle crafter on its own. The only limit is that it must be at least somewhat possible to figure out the answer, even if that somewhat is nigh impossible. (CG Note: Requires Tomb - Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings first.)
"
241,,100,Screaming Skulls ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Domain,"Attached to the inside and outside of you tomb are hundreds of enchanted skulls. Imbued with the spirits of loyal servants, each skull can be commanded to ceaselessly speak or scream out certain words or phrases, at volumes ranging from shouting to ear rending in power. If you want your glories to be recited without end on every day or simply wish for your sieging foes to hear the screams of dying men at all hours of the night, the Screaming Skulls can do it for you. (CG Note: Requires Tomb - Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings first.)
"
242,,100,Until Next Time... ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Domain,"Given that you are actually a sea creature magically in the form of a human, your body is more of a manifestation than a physical form, even though you can interact physically with things. Due to this, you have an innate teleportation ability. Whenever you wish, you can make yourself instantly vanish and reappear somewhere you have designated as a safe zone (this must be in the dimension you are currently in, and cannot be the Warehouse). You can also teleport people you are physically touching to the same location when you make the jump. You can only determine one safe spot to teleport to at the beginning of each jump. However, you need to remember to activate it, which you might forget in the heat of battle."
243,,100,Gift of Flight ,Lyrical Nanoha,Domain,"Who needs a Device? You can fly just fine on your own! You have a natural talent for using mana to lift yourself up to levitate or even fly, moving at roughly your personal running speed. This can be draining if used excessively, but with time and enough energy, you’ll find the skies open to you."
244,,100,Tourou Nagashi ,Golden Sky Stories,Domain,"Lanterns serve as guideposts for lost souls and lost folk alike. Illuminating pathways both mundane and supernatural, for some, lanterns illuminate the pathway towards another world. With this, you’ll be able to conjure forth stone lanterns, which will serve both as a static guide marker for individuals at night – and also serves as a guide marker for spirits and souls alike.

In places without a netherworld for spirits to pass on to, the lanterns will still calm undead beasts and spirits – it can also serve as a holding place for them.
"
245,,100,TORII GATE ,Golden Sky Stories,Domain,"A marker to divide the outside world away from your domain, the Torii gate exists to clearly identify that this is your domain – and as such it actively repels mundane folks, preventing people from accidentally wandering in. A helpful defense mechanism for those who would prefer to be left in peace, by inscribing a name on a Torii gate, you can utilize the gate’s magic to bless the individual in question. Naturally, the blessing improves one’s luck. (CG Note: Requires Natural Domain - Golden Sky Stories first.)"
246,,100,SHIMENAWA ,Golden Sky Stories,Domain,"Often used in conjunction with Torii gates, the Shimenawa binds your territory with sacred rope, acting to repel off evil spirits and supernatural individuals alike. On top of that however, should you take a length of Shimenawa and bind it around an object – say a tree or a rock – in time spirits will inhabit that object. Perhaps you could use it as a way to gather the souls of the dead? Thankfully, using the Shimenawa like this will allow the removed section to replace itself over time.

When both the Torii and Shimenawa are combined, the Shimenawa will actively restrain those who would bear ill will against you even if they manage to cross the boundaries of your domain. (CG Note: Requires Natural Domain - Golden Sky Stories first.)"
247,,100,Soar ,Touhou Project: Parasol Paradise,Domain,"In Gensokyo, the ability to levitate and fly are very common, and is crucial to Danmaku battles. With some practice, you can learn to travel just as fast around sharp bends and even backwards as you can dead ahead.
"
248,,100,Magical Girls... Can Fly Can’t They? ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Domain,"Maybe it’s the way you view the world but flight comes naturally to you. Any magical means of flight is easier for you and seems effortless. If you have high enough magical power then you might even be able to fly without the aid of a kaleidostick.
"
249,,100,Fairy Dwelling ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Domain,"You have a special home for fairies, a large tree perhaps, or even a flower or underground home. It’s vastly larger on the inside than it is on the outside, allowing you to make a very nice home out of something you normally couldn’t even fit inside, and very difficult for non-fairies to find. The perfect spot to hide after pulling pranks.
"
250,,100,Secret Home,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Domain,"You have a pocket dimension of sorts with a small home inside, with a small traditional Japanese house and enough room for all kinds of pets. It can only be entered by following a specific secret path that you may change on a whim. A side benefit is that inside this pocket dimension the weather is generally mild all year long – even a hurricane outside will cause nothing more than a particularly strong downpour inside.
"
251,,100,Comfy Chair ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Domain,"You have an extremely comfy armchair. While seated on the chair you can continue to move around as much as you normally could, perhaps by flying if you can fly, and is the perfect place to sit. You need not worry about getting tired or sore from sitting down too long – it’s simply too comfy for that.
"
252,,100,Advanced Flyer ,Peter Pan,Domain,"You have become an exceptionally good flyer, to the point that you no longer need pixie dust to fly. In fact, defying all sense, you have no weight at all unless you wish to. As long as you are awake, you can move fluidly through the air without ever touching the ground for a second. If you wish to sleep, you only need to rest on a sharp breeze to stay afloat, and if you fall asleep and start to fall, your descent will slow down so that you gently drift down like an autumn leaf. Although as a Fairy you do not need fairy dust to fly, you will need to purchase this perk for the additional abilities such as riding the wind, constantly flying even when asleep, and a slowed descent if your flying fails.
"
253,,100,Palanquin ,Warhammer Fantasy: Lizardmen,Domain,"A floating, ornate chair that glides without effort and in spite of your (possibly) considerable weight. Allows you to move around without touching the Chaos affected ground. Has room on the arm-rest for a skink attendant to sit.
"
254,,100,Strider of Ulthuan ,Warhammer Fantasy: High Elves,Domain,"Given certain magical territories on the Asur continent, it really would be a crying shame for your adventure if you were waylaid by something so simple and inconvenient as malleable geography. Hence, with this Perk you will find the inscrutable machinations of Saphery and the specific territorial conditions of Ellyrion do not apply to you. For 100 CP, you may keep this feature, and apply it to other magical terrain meant to mislead you.
"
255,,100,Asur Aesthetics ,Warhammer Fantasy: High Elves,Domain,"Surely, once you have experienced the incomparable beauty of the Asur’s flawless architecture you would never want to leave such splendor behind, yes? Well, then don’t. This simple option allows you to “re-skin” your Warehouse or other such properties in the particular architectural flavor of the Asur, which primarily involves a lot of white stone and gold trimming, massive arches that look too delicate to support themselves, and lots of shining spires. In the purest of respects, “beauty above all,” and the structure generally just works. Remember, magic was probably involved.
"
256,,100,Tingle’s Certified Aeronaut Training Course ,Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,Domain,"An Aeronaut is the pilot of a balloon or airship. For you, this means you have acquired Ballooning skills equal to Tingle’s. Capable of sensing and seeing the winds to stay afloat as you call a magical balloon into place to keep you from the reaches of most monsters. However, this balloon you summon may be popped by particularly agile, or sharp shooting adversaries. You will be able to summon another one in a minute, you just will have to contend with whatever shot you down. You... wouldn’t be planning on using this to get away from anyone after filching their hard earned Force Gems would you? That... doesn’t tend to end well with certain people.
"
257,,100,Mystic Agility ,Hyrule Warriors,Domain,"From Lana who bounds across the battlefield to Zelda who appears to dance through her enemies, the magical ones of this world use magic to enable agility. 

Your body is naturally enhanced with magic that improves your agility, allowing you to more easily move with grace and speed. With this effect alone, you can move far faster, taking long leaps with each step and gliding back to the ground. 

Alternatively, by actively pushing magic into the ability you can levitate at running speeds like fairies or the evil wizard Wizzro, ignoring such things as rough terrain and hot ground. 
"
258,,100,Magic Beans ,Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,Domain,"These beans don’t seem very special, besides being multicolored and when eaten rather sweet and chewy like candy. When planted and fully grown, however, they sprout into hefty flying platforms! The leafy platforms don’t reach very far, and have to return to the plant after reaching a certain distance, but they’re VERY fast. You could go across most of the lost forest in less than a minute at the speeds the platforms could reach."
259,,100,Zora’s Armor ,Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess,Domain,"A special suit of magical armor that grants the aquatic abilities of a Zora when worn, allowing the wearer to breathe underwater and swim with more ease. It has a major drawback, however, as it makes the wearer share their vulnerabilities to ice and fire when worn."
260,,100,Sorcery - Convoyence (One Dot) ,World of Darkness: Sorcery,Domain,"Teleportation, flight, and other means of magically swift transportation are covered by this path.

[1] The sorcerer may transport themselves across roughly 10 feet."
261,,100,Sorcery - Convoyence (Two Dots) ,World of Darkness: Sorcery,Domain,"Teleportation, flight, and other means of magically swift transportation are covered by this path.

[2] The sorcerer’s magic may transport themselves, along with 20 pounds, across roughly 100 feet.

262,,100,Sorcery - Convoyence (Three Dots) ,World of Darkness: Sorcery,Domain,"Teleportation, flight, and other means of magically swift transportation are covered by this path.

[3] At this level, the sorcerer can transport themselves and one other person across roughly a mile.

(CG Note: This perk requires Sorcery - Convoyence (Two Dots) - World of Darkness: Sorcerer first.)"
263,,100,Sorcery - Convoyence (Four Dots) ,World of Darkness: Sorcery,Domain,"Teleportation, flight, and other means of magically swift transportation are covered by this path.

[4] The sorcerer may transport themselves and two other passengers across roughly five miles.

(CG Note: This perk requires Sorcery - Convoyence (Three Dots) - World of Darkness: Sorcerer first.)"
264,,100,Sorcery - Convoyence (Five Dots) ,World of Darkness: Sorcery,Domain,"Teleportation, flight, and other means of magically swift transportation are covered by this path.

[5] The sorcerer’s master allows them to transport themselves and up to three other passengers across roughly ten miles.

(CG Note: This perk requires Sorcery - Convoyence (Four Dots) - World of Darkness: Sorcerer first.)"
265,,100,Sorcery - Convoyence (Six Dots) ,World of Darkness: Sorcery,Domain,"Teleportation, flight, and other means of magically swift transportation are covered by this path.

[6] The user may transport themselves and five other passengers across roughly 100 miles.

(CG Note: This perk requires Sorcery - Convoyence (Five Dots) - World of Darkness: Sorcerer first.)"
266,,100,Magic Mirror ,Terraria,Domain,"A simple fancy mirror that can be designated with a ‘spawn point’, and which, when you gaze within, will teleport you to that exact point, shifting you to the next clear area if that spot is occupied. Must be within several hundred miles of the ‘spawn point’ for this to function."
267,,150,A Hidden Manse​ (Tier 3),Generic Exalted,Domain,"Now we're talking. You get a Manse, the Manse of course being a piece of land that is somehow magical in some fashion or another. They're aspected towards a certain type of Essence, either elemental essence such as Wood, Water, Earth, Fire, or Air or alternatively they're aspected towards the Celestial elements such as the Sun, Moon, Stars, or even Infernal or Abyssal (which are quite rare normally). Aside from being a spot of land that you now own (as long as you can protect it) a Manse also produces a Hearthstone.

Hearthstones, when socketed into certain weapons/armor/amulets, provide both unique magical effects and act as channels of the Manse itself allowing for vastly improved regeneration of Essence. Did I mention you also regenerate Essence faster while in the Manse? Yeah, you do. Anyways there are far too many Manses to actually list here in this document so we'll just go by price. For 150cp a 3dot. You can choose any Manse you want from the Core books or official supplement books for Exalted that you have paid the appropriate cost for. 

Of note is that while you can have more than one Manse only ones you purchase here will follow you between jumps, inserting themselves flawlessly into new worlds (or as an addition to your Warehouse, your choice either or). Additionally you will need at least one open hearthstone socket for every hearthstone you have if you want to make use of them. Manse's can range from the size of a small forest clearing to the size of a reasonably large nobles estate (call it 100 acres), you choose what size yours is, the more expensive the Manse you bought the bigger it can be.

268,,150,A Mount’s Homestead,Heroes of the Storm,Domain,"You’ll soon find out that in the Nexus, there’s all manner of strange and wondrous devices and beasts for you to ride-both in and out of battle. Now, this other Warehouse attachment resembles some mad genius’ cross between a garage and a stable-except with open air and numerous landscapes reminiscent of the Nexus’ various environments. The dimensions within are spacious enough to house a small population (or collection) of each type of mount found in the Nexus or it’s overlapping worlds, and some enchantment keeps the infrastructure perpetually prosperous. The feeding habits and upkeep procedures for every steed in the Nexus would take too long to list here, so suffice to say that somewhere in this attachment is the perfect place for any mount you find and convince to follow you home here, and all the tools you need to maintain any single person vehicle from these worlds. And yes, living mounts stored here and in future worlds can follow you along in your journeys.

Additionally, for 50 CP each you may populate this property with instances of any mount in the game. Each may have its own quirks depending on its species (or construction, for vehicles) but is at least guaranteed to be a hardy, loyal specimen of its species or make."
269,,150,Arboreal Glory,Scion ,Domain,"The glorious apples of Idunn and Hesperides are not the only divinely restorative fruits recorded throughout time. The Tree of All Seeds native to the Yazata’s Godrealm is the progenitor of every plant, and naturally it’s seeds can grow into any plant that has ever grown in the mortal worlds, and always takes root. It’s juice is rumoured to grant incredible physical ability, mental clarity and immortality-even restoring the bodiless dead to corporeal life. Whether you wish for one grandiose tree or a grove similar to Idunn’s, your Godrealm may boast a form of plant life potent enough for gods to lay down their lives defending.

270,,150,Touchstone,Scion ,Domain,"Archetypal wonders reflecting concepts and objects rather than entities, as both the Flame of Liberty and Durance Vile prove Touchstones can be quite significant in divine struggles. Divine efforts resonant with the concepts they represent are greatly empowered. One such structure has a place in your realm, and under your control-such as the Great Henge that blesses all use of the Prophecy purview.

271,,150,Of Things Feared And Known,Scion ,Domain,"The mysteries of Magic, Fate and Prophecy are many, and it’s no coincidence the Aesir revere two separate sacred sites that provide great insight into all three. For 200 GP you have a location or artifact, be it a subrealm or a grand tapestry constantly weaving the fate of all beings as it is being made that stretches endlessly onwards, that provides great insight and power over such things. But for 300 GP your Godrealm includes a location deeply rooted in Fate’s power like the sacred Well of Urd. It holds great wisdom, though it generally takes great sacrifice or art to pry its greatest secrets for your own benefit. Not only does it somehow empower your Godrealm as the Well’s waters preserve the life of Yggdrasil and it’s clay whitens the tree’s bark, but three beings with great power and insight into Fate attend the Well. While the Aesir sometimes struggled to commune with the Norns, these ones seem quite compliant towards your wishes insofar as they are also effectively terminals of Fate. Also while not required to be so, traditionally such beings are female.

272,,150,Super Speed        ,Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Domain,"The speed and reflexes needed to weave in and out of a fight. This can be purchased three times; the first will allow you to run at Mach 1, the second will allow you to run at double that speed, and the third will allow you to run at Mach 3. Your reflexes and perception scale with your speed, allowing you to utilize your speed to its full extent.

273,,150,Dragon Lair,King Arthur ,Domain,An attachment to your warehouse that adds a large cavern. About once a month it spawns a large amount of gold coins and gems inside of it. If you have a companion has a draconic form or is a dragon themselves they may take up residence inside the cave without taking up a companion slot.
274,,150,Bonded Lands ,MtG - Shandalar,Domain,"Every mage starts with some basic lands they possess a mana bond with, allowing them to draw on this mana for magical effects provided they can establish the bond itself. However, that doesn’t mean everyone should satisfy itself with merely the ‘basics’. You may spend 50CP to gain one copy of any land seen in Shandalar, from the humble Forest to the magnificent Library Of Alexandria and anything in between. You may also spend 150CP for a set of five lands of your choice (these do not all need to be the same type).

Mana bonds from lands purchased this way can’t be destroyed by hostile mages (using effects such as Stone Rain or Sinkhole), though they otherwise act as any other land you might establish a magical bond with.

In future worlds, you will find yourself the owner of a stretch of terrain with the same nature as the lands you bought here, ensuring you can maintain bonds with these lands even after leaving Shandalar."
275,,150,‘Basic’ Land,MtG - Kamigawa,Domain,"Mana rich environments which can be summoned into the world, this may raise a few eyebrows, which comes in five flavors. The classical Island, Forest, Mountain, Plain, and Swamp are available, they need not be those things exactly but they should follow the premise closely. One may buy a bundle of five Basic Lands for 150 CP.

The lands of this world are rich in mana, which is the easiest way to cast without any risk to the self in many of the magic styles you can learn in this jump. Bonding with a normal land takes days, but these lands available to you will instantly have a bond and their power can be ‘tapped’ once per hour, which may not seem like much but mana from an entire land is enough to fuel army killing spells at the least. You may ‘tap’ a land you are already bonded with for mana at any time, though the sudden upsurge of mana might intimidate some folks. Each basic land may only be tapped for a single mana, two for the named lands.

To physically access a land you can either access it through a door in the Warehouse or via summoning the land into the world. People will likely notice you summoning large masses of land into the world so be careful with that. Bonds with lands bought here do not break as you continue Jumping, in case of confusion."
276,,150,Chess Board ,Neverland: The RPG,Domain,"A 40-foot chessboard of black and red tiles – each 8 x 8 ft. Standing on a red tile makes you immune to physical harm, and standing on a black tile makes you immune to magic. Touching more than one color of tile gives you no immunities."
277,,200,The Cathedral of Shadows,Shin Megami Tensei II,Domain,"Another mainstay of this world you will likely need, this is the infamous Cathedral of Shadows. Its function is quite simple: Demons have a static amount of power tied to their forms in this world and don’t quite ‘level up’ in power the same way humans do. One way around this is to fuse two compatible demons together to create a new and stronger demon, which this very ritual chamber has been designed to do. It is managed by a helpful if somewhat creepy looking robed fellow who will tell you how strong the end result will be...though he is reluctant to create anything stronger than the summoner, for the obvious reason Demons tend to ignore or outright attack those weaker than them. You may spend 200 points to keep this post-jump as a property or a warehouse attachment, where you may fuse any sort of Demon you can summon through the Compendium or the Demon Summoning Program.

Requires COMP + Demon Summoning Program to Purchase"
278,,200,Fissure,Duel Monsters – The Shadow Realm,Domain,"Don’t count out the earth. Fires rise and become smoke on the wind, but when the earth shakes and rages everyone can feel it...and people will die. You can create fissures and holes in the earth, underneath people’s feet. While this isn’t as fast as fire, someone caught in these cracks and fissures is going to have a lot harder of a time recovering. Even flight may find issues if you can shake the earth hard enough to drop boulders on top. Either way, you can make the earth quake within an area around you with ease."
279,,200,Try And Stop Me,Castlevania - Rondo of Blood,Domain,"There are arguments to be made for the superior physical abilities of every age. Children possess an ungodly amount of energy compared to their parents, but often lack stamina. Adults on the other hand possess strength and stamina both, but are often slower as their body betrays them to the aches and pains of life. You? You’re somewhere in between, able to move faster than most grown men all day long without the risk of exhausting yourself. Better yet, you have a level of skill at acrobatics that allows you to do cartwheels and rolls, and even to jump a second time off the air itself to gain some extra height."
280,,200,Ritual Chamber ,MORTAL KOMBAT 9-10,Domain,"Havik conducts many profane rituals in the service of Chaos, some of which may have been performed in this very chamber. Now located in your Warehouse, the room’s architecture and strange energies make it slightly better for magical workings of all types. Also found in the room are several golden chalices, with a thought, they can be filled with the blood of any being you have personally killed before."
281,,200,The House of Ten Thousand Delights,Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous,Domain,"A palace of delights, stolen from out of the Abyss. A mansion stands before you, the mere sight of which brings a blush. The House of Pleasures holds ten thousand temptations within, staffed with many succubi and experienced demons. The rooms within are ever-changing, each offering a new kind of excess or depravity. From the simple pleasures of the body or the intoxication of chemicals, to shapeshifting slaves that take the form of those you want to kill the most to let you live out fantasies in reality. 

The staff consider you as the owner of the mansion at present, using their prodigious skills to charm and interrogate any you desire. They can even leave and bring some of the delights with them if you have a target not able to be brought in. The mansion itself is somewhat of a fortress, with powerful magical wards and a great many demon guards, even before getting to the various potent demons who are fond enough of the mansion to defend it. You could draw on such important figures for favours, exchanging the services of your servants for influence in the Abyss."
282,,200,Awakening Lab,Valkyrie Crusade ,Domain,"A lab within which is the equipment and instructions on how to combine various elemental crystals to make bigger, more powerful crystals. The perfect environment for such work."
283,,200,Elemental Shrines,Valkyrie Crusade ,Domain,"When one of these shrines are erected within your kingdom, you will gain an increased affinity for the element that the shrine is dedicated to. Within your kingdom, you may construct up to three shrines of each element. Constructing one will boost your elemental affinity and strength by 20%. The stronger your elemental affinity, the easier it is to cast magic of that element, and the stronger that the spells cast will be. The four classical elements within the celestial realms are as such: Fire, Ice, Light, and Dark."
284,,200,Protection of the Count ,Shin Megami Tensei ,Domain,"You have learned of an extremely rare spell, which allows one to protect an area that they have an emotional connection to by creating a massive magical dome over it. It can be a direct connection, such as your beloved hometown, or an indirect connection, such as a place important to someone you love. Those who you give permission to may pass through the dome as if it simply did not exist. The dome is extremely powerful, being capable of holding fast against legions of demons for years, and while it is tiring to create you will be back to normal in just a few days. However, if you leave the area protected by the dome, it will soon break apart. If you used another’s connection to the protected area to create the dome, they too, must never leave lest the shield fall."
285,,200,Terminal Networker ,Shin Megami Tensei ,Domain,"Seems you got a pretty interesting job some time ago. You've aided Stephen in the creation of his teleportation system, and have acquired great knowledge of it, enough that you could replicate it yourself. First, you can create a Terminal, which... doesn't do much by itself. However, by connecting multiple Terminals together through the Internet or any similar network, it is possible for users to transport themselves from one to another instantly. Additionally, it's possible to open direct portals to unconnected places or other dimensions, though this is not a properly supported feature. Do try not to open the gates of hell."
286,,200,Virtual World,American Gods,Domain,"Also called the dreamspace, or the world of imagination or whatnot, by the Old Gods and their people. Yours call it the cyberspace. You have your own little pocket world of it, a world where you can rule at will.

This isn’t very vast a realm, about the size of your average town, though you can grow it by feeding it power. You control every aspect of it utterly, as if it were your very own graphics program or lucid dream. Maybe it is?"
287,,200,Egyptian Queen,Kane Chronicles,Domain,"A magical boat, crewed by magical servants. It can only be summoned once a year, and only in times of great need. Still, if it’s yours, it is well stocked and well defended, and can travel to places even normal magic would find dangerous or impossible to access, such as the Underworld or the Sea of Chaos."
288,,200,Magic Boat ,Kane Chronicles,Domain,"A magical, flying boat that can transverse the Duat with relative ease, making taking an extra-dimensional shortcut significantly easier. In future settings, it can access other adjacent dimensions as well. Its ability to do so safely, on the other hand, is very much up to you."
289,,200,Large Cavern,Castlevania - Order of Ecclesia,Domain,"If the Training Hall is a challenge for your ability to move, then the Large Cavern is a brutal and unrelenting challenge for your ability to take a beating and dish one out in return. Much like the Hall it’s supposed to be under Castlevania, but you can find an entrance inside your warehouse if you feel like suffering. Consisting of four levels of some of the toughest enemies Dracula has available, and a fifth with a Vampire even more durable that he is, fighting your way through this place would be a challenge even for him. Presumably, that’s why he created it, for the challenge. If you can punch your way past all the monsters found here, there are a decent number of chests scattered around it’s pathways, ones that may hold some exceptional rewards. Or they could hold junk. It rather depends on how lucky you are. Unlike the Training Hall this place will never change in power, always being the best Castlevania had to offer, but it’s rewards will never run out either. If you’re killed inside this cave system, you will be ejected for a year and a day before you will be allowed to try again."
290,,200,Training Hall,Castlevania - Order of Ecclesia,Domain,"I will be honest with you, this place is a small fragment of Castlevania itself, and by all rights ought to be buried deep below it, deeper still than the portals to Hell and the Abyss that sometimes pop up. And yet, a doorway that leads to this place can be found within your own warehouse. Another lie that this place tells is its name, the ""training"" hall. One imagines that it is a place to practice, a place to unlock new and creative uses of your powers, a sanctuary of simple but endless tests until you have mastered yourself. That is not true. This is a hellscape, a trial put together by someone with every power in the world, for someone with every power in the world, where if you make even the slightest mistake you will be violently dismembered and your corpse fed to the wolves. And yes, there are sometimes wolves in here. Each jump, this place will rearrange itself for all the powers you possess and present a challenge that will push you to your limits. Most of it is movement-based, but there are some foes to be found here. Reach the end and you will be rewarded with a single Glyph or similar prize each jump. Fail, and you will be ejected for a year and a day. If someone with less skills than you were to enter... Good luck to them, it won't be any easier for them to be weaker."
291,,200,Flying Carpet,Twisted-Wonderland ,Domain,"It’s a bit faded, but it works like a charm, allowing you to fly! You could fly around the world in one night and crossing over intercontinental distances is an one hour journey at most. Might or might be not the same carpet as the one in the Aladdin world."
292,,200,White Rabbit’s Pocket Watch,Disney Lorcana,Domain,"Why, no wonder you’re late, this watch is two days slow! While you carry this pocket watch and keep it wound, you benefit from the dreamlike passage of time in Wonderland, where there can be a lot of flexibility in what order events happen in."
293,,200,Seven league boots,Grimms’ Fairy Tales,Domain,These boots allow you to traverse seven leagues in a single step.
294,,200,Dreams Set You Free,Princess The Hopeful,Domain,"For all that they were built as a prison, the Dreamlands can be a wonderful place to visit as an embodiment of the more optimistic, happier sides of human consciousness. Not for them the constant predation and destruction of the Astral Realms, when the rebellion of the Queens against their jailers have rendered the Dreamlands truly comforting places despite the Gales blowing through them which transform others based on the hopes, thoughts and aspirations of mankind. With this purchase you now have a small segment of the Dreamlands ensconced to you (roughly equivalent to a single Kingdom and it’s environs), through which you may always visit by using your Warehouse key or portal dreams-which now are never far from your reach, when asleep. Instead of all mankind’s aspirations defining the Foundation over which phantasmal phenomena, environments and entities emerge it will be your aspirations that shape it-though should others have access to the Light, they too may contribute and visit-potentially helping it grow. So too will the alien boundaries of what lies beyond your settlement depend equally on your own perception of what is “other” and what truly lies beyond human ken in other worlds."
295,,200,Crystal Cavern,Castlevania - Judgment,Domain,"To find this place, you need simply go downwards. Into the sewers, into the basement, down down and down some more. You will find a pathway leading to this large cavern no matter where you are so long as you head down. Inside it’s bounds, you will find magic to be both more and less effective than normal, a consequence of the unusual crystalline growths that dot the watery landscape. Each one emits a magical energy field that modifies the outcome of any spell near it that belongs to a specific category of spell, such as fire or ice. A simple tap to one of the crystal spires will alter its effect. You may enter to find it weakening fire, but if you take a moment to strike the corresponding crystal it may strengthen it instead after a moment. Finding which crystal does what is likely to be an arduous task, but the sheer amount of knowledge that can be gleaned from practicing here is even more phenomenal. If you had any skill at alchemy, you could even use the crystals to create magical foci to take their boost or dampening effect elsewhere. A hunter would probably try to create something that explodes, but I trust you to be more refined than simply ‘crystal go boom’. Do try not to betray that trust."
296,,200,Saint Germain’s Pocket Watch,Castlevania - Judgment,Domain,"A gift from the saint to house Belmont in ages past, this pocket watch contains a small fragment of the ability to stop time. Though if I may have a moment, I feel I should point out that this particular.... instance of the watch has the decidedly useful trait of increasing its effect, from a few seconds of time in exchange for a good chunk of energy up to several moments depending on certain factors. Those being your already existing skill, affinity, and knowledge of time. If you know naught, you’ll get the seconds a Belmont would. If you know even half as much as I do, you could stop time for perhaps half an hour for a trivial amount of energy. Should you have also purchased a copy of my Timepiece, you may merge the two watches together."
297,,200,Haven of the Spirit Dragon,MTG - Tarkir                                ,Domain,"Filled with the debris of Ugin’s Crucible, and bathed in the power of the Spirit Dragon for a millennium, this ravine is a place of great spiritual strength. It can be drawn upon for a mote of colourless mana, or a mote of any colour which can only be used to summon or cast draconic creatures or spells. Far more importantly, however, once per jump you can perform a lengthy ritual to stir its magic into full life, conjuring a true dragon tempest. You can control what mana colours these dragons can appear as, and they will respect you as their origin and a guide."
298,,200,Tomb of the Spirit Dragon,MTG - Tarkir                                ,Domain,"In this deep ravine, the spectral bones of Ugin remain. The ravine can be drawn upon for a mote of colourless mana, or to channel life-force to you through any colourless creature to heal you - but most importantly, time is strange and convoluted here and nearby. Prophetic visions come more clearly to those in this area, and by delving deep into the ravine itself, you may even be able to cross to parallel timelines, other dimensions or to certain vital points in the past, or return to the Tomb, though you can only make this crossing once per jump (with a return)."
299,,200,Mystic Monastery,MTG - Tarkir                                ,Domain,"Set high atop a pinnacle of stone, you are the head of this monastery. Populated by a hundred or so students of the martial and mystic arts, the monastery has little in its library, but is an excellent training site for either of those disciplines. Furthermore, you’ll find that (unless you act to stop it) the reputation of this place will spread and draw prospective students to you in each new world. If drawn upon, it can provide red, blue or white mana."
300,,200,Nomad Outpost ,MTG - Tarkir                                ,Domain,"One of the many camps established across Tarkir’s plains and plateaus, this one is under your command. Food, water and shelter can be found here for many, and enemies seem to find it almost-impossible to locate the camp, buried in the vast emptiness of the wastes. If drawn upon for mana, this camp can provide white, black or red mana."
301,,200,Opulent Palace,MTG - Tarkir                                ,Domain,"You are the master of one of the palaces of ancient Sultai, with all the luxuries you could hope to own present in its halls and chambers. Silk and gold are common here, as are a small army of sibsig slaves bound to your will and able to see to all the business of the palace itself. If drawn upon, the palace can yield up green, blue or black mana."
302,,200,Frontier Bivouac,MTG - Tarkir                                ,Domain,"You are acknowledged as the holder of a frontier camp in the Qal Sisma mountains - the camp itself not being much to look at, but the land grants visions of past and future to the sensitive, holds a wealth of dragon bones (the bivouac is built inside a skull), and is rich in game and a common place to see elementals. If drawn upon, it can supply blue, red or green mana."
303,,200,Sandsteppe Citadel,MTG - Tarkir                                ,Domain,"You are the commander of a strong Abzan fortress-town, situated in the desert, with internal arboretums and an oasis, and supplied to stand against an extended siege. You also command its garrison (though they will not leave the fortress), and can draw upon the land for white, green or black mana."
304,,200,Torii,Touhou Luna Nights,Domain,"You have a pair of wooden torii, that you carry and place anywhere you like. Anyone, whether they are friend or foe, who enters a torii can instantly teleport to any other torii they choose. You do know how to make more, as well. Note these are not subtle things; in addition to being large, the entrance glows with a brilliant white light."
305,,200,Gemcrafted,Touhou Luna Nights,Domain,"You have the ability to turn use the power of gemstones to create an alternate dimension full of replicas of terrain and people. Additionally, you know how to create loyal, obedient monsters and replicas of other people who can fight for you, or perhaps just guard your alternate locations, and you may communicate with them clearly regardless of distance. A weak monster might require a couple of amethysts, while one that can fly around, fire lasers and take a terrible amount of damage might require at least a high-quality diamond. Creating alternate dimensions will require on the order of thousands of gemstones even for a relatively small patch of land. Also note that none of them are truly intelligent and just follow pre-programmed orders."
306,,200,Flight,Touhou Luna Nights,Domain,"You can fly. You can fly as fast as you can walk (or run, this will tire you like running), and can easily manoeuvre in three dimensions."
307,,200,Flying Snow,Kill Six Billion Demons,Domain,"You become light and agile, and you are able to fly for short periods of time, as it is tiring."
308,,200,The Empty One,Kill Six Billion Demons,Domain,"No one can run from you. So long as you know where your target is, and the location of them, you can “teleport” there, so long as the place you teleport to is unwatched."
309,,200,Sanctum,Mage: The Ascension,Domain,"A Sanctum (or Laboratory to Technocrats) is a place ideally suited to performing your Paradigm(s). It could be a consecrated workshop full of mystical ingredients for a Hermetic or a sterile laboratory filled with exotic machines for a Technocrat. Beyond being an ideal location that helps to channel and empower your will working, your own Paradigm(s)’s magick is always coincidental here, while any other Paradigm is considered vulgar."
310,,200,Node,Mage: The Ascension,Domain,"Nodes are place where Prime energies naturally pool. This Quintessence can be absorbed through meditation or harvested in some form appropriate to the Node itself (such as glowing mushrooms or crystals that grow in a magic cave) as a material called Tass, which can later be used as Quintessence to fuel your will working. You possess an incredibly powerful Node, which stores up to 10 points of Quintessence at once, refilling each week, while also producing 10 points of Tass every week."
311,,200,Paths of the Wyck,Mage: The Ascension,Domain,"It is said that the Wyck left secret paths in the Umbra for their successors to find. For you, this is not limited to the Umbra. Whatever otherworld you manage to wind up in, you will find paths that assure impossibly safe and quick travel through them."
312,,200,Garden of Avalon,Cereza and the Stray Demon,Domain,"The plants of Avalon Forest are as powerful as they are beautiful. Petals that can be collected into a new flower, bolstering the collector’s vitality. Magic butterflies and crystal crescents full of the natural world’s power. Crystalised magical energy that forms moon pearls and Avalon drops as well as fruits and flowers normally only found in Inferno, that can enhance the power of witches and demons alike. And that’s not even getting into all the plants capable of defending themselves or the sheer magical energy within. You now hold dominion over a grove of trees vast enough to surround any earthly palace, as rich in magic and wonder as Avalon Forest but with none of its malice. All the useful plants and other bounties of Avalon Forest are particularly rich on the ground, while the dangerous plants seem amicable to you even if you are not a fairy."
313,,200,Tír Na Nóg,Cereza and the Stray Demon,Domain,"These pocket dimension were designed to break the human spirit and extract bad vibes...by pitting unsuspecting humans against all manner of puzzles and challenges. You have acquired on yourself that with a simple magical incantation, you can pack up and set up somewhere you need to harvest human suffering into magical energy. It also contains various rewards native to Avalon Forest that you can extract-whether by doing the challenges yourself, or simply disabling them and taking the loot for yourself."
314,,200,Forest Guide        ,Cereza and the Stray Demon,Domain,"Ah. You have been around for a while, haven’t you? Your knowledge of this world’s deeper mysteries is bolstered. This pertains mainly to locations and personages, the course of important events and the location of valuable artifacts rather than spellcraft, binding pacts or such; you can know quite a lot of the occult, but most of it is academic for the average wielder. Last but not least, some subtle magic has given you the power to set up sanctuaries in certain locations by carving then enchanting a magical lantern, a moderately difficult task for an ordinary human-and synchronising them so that someone can “fast travel” between them. Sanctuaries are safe places shrouded and warded by protective magics from otherworldly forces and others who would intend a wayfaring stranger sheltering at them harm, in a lesser way to how Avalon Forest is warded against all but the innocent. They’re not truly impermeable, but more than a match for bands of wandering fairies here."
315,,200,Organized Healing,Final Fantasy Tactics,Domain,"You have a chain of hospitals that use Clerics and Chemists. They act as great faces for the public and are great for getting information. After all their vows say nothing about silence and everyone gets hurt eventually. For some reason though this is also a dang good way to introduce open magic to the world, as the supernatural healing is accepted by the rank-and-file and the local governments with little more than the equivalent of a full trial course."
316,,200,Avatar Production Facility,"Hunt, Kill, Repeat",Domain,"For the enterprising Olympian who wants faceless, gold-plated, brainwashed goons of their own. You’ve got a hospital somewhere remote, with all the necessary equipment to erase the memories of any volunteers or “volunteers,” plus enough avatar-grade armor and weapons to arm them all. The facility is also a hospital, but suffers from a lack of medical equipment... but wait! It makes up for that with enough sedatives to keep someone in a coma indefinitely!"
317,,200,Forge ,"Hunt, Kill, Repeat",Domain,"Here’s a place where you can ply your craft. It’s got everything you need to make a lot of weapons and armor, and it’s got a restocking supply of material. You’ll have iron and steel, and even some Olympium, the fancy metal of the gods. You also have all the tools you need and then some. Furthermore, everything seems to work well. The forge won’t run out of fuel to burn, nothing needs maintenance, and you’ll never hurt yourself or anyone else in an unfortunate accident."
318,,200,Teleport to Friend,Guild Wars 2,Domain,"Seven small stones with collapsible sides. Each side is linked to the other stones, and teleports itself, and the holder to the appropriately linked stone, regardless of distance. Can only teleport one person, a reasonably small amount of equipment/luggage."
319,,200,Chronomancer,Guild Wars 2,Domain,"Time is an illusion, and you're a master of illusions. You can manipulate time freely within a small radius of yourself. This allows you to do things such as rewind time for a few minutes, slow it down, speed it up and several other such tricks. Keep in mind that the more you try to do with time, the greater the strain. Jumping backwards a few seconds to avoid a critical hit? Easy as pie. Trudging back a whole half-hour, because you absolutely need to correct a horrible mistake after the fact? Expect to need bed rest afterwards."
320,,200,Blessing of Strife,Darksiders,Domain,"You gain a speed boost the more enemies you fight and the more they hate you. You also gain a short range dash that while fast and can be used often, does not move you far, only about 20ft."
321,,200,Flying Devices,Bleach,Domain,"In the human world, which has little to no ambient spirit energy in the atmosphere, Shinigami and other Spirit Beings are able to diffuse their own spirit energy into the air in order to stand or fly. This same task becomes impossible in places with with spirit energy, such as Hueco Mundo or Soul Society. To give you an edge over others in places like these, we bestow you with two devices that enable flight. The first is a long wand of bone and some other material; by channeling their spirit energy into the wand, a tentacle will wrap around the user’s arm, while a series of bony protrusions will stretch outwards and form a wing. The second is a brown mantle displaying the Shihoin Clan Crest, which is as easy to use as slinging it over your shoulders. While the wand allows for speedy flight but takes up one’s hand while in use, the mantle allows for sustained floating and causes no real impairment. Neither are very hard to use at all, with even beginners being able to use them with ease. "
322,,200,Shadow,Bleach,Domain,"The shadow is a curious ability that elder Quincy have access too. For beings that associate themselves so much with light, it can seem odd that one of their most powerful abilities lies in darkness. With their Reiatsu exerted, they can create and manipulate shadow energy around their bodies. The primary function of the shadow is transportation, even between worlds, as one can exit from the summoned shadow into any other existing shadow within range. A master could step into a shadow on Earth and appear within a highly guarded laboratory in Soul Society at Division 12. 

You’re not quite there yet, though you can still travel across countries with each shadow step. A master can not only travel between the Three Worlds or across each one with a single step, they can even cross into the inner worlds of the Shinigami, albeit a connection is usually required with said Shinigami. The shadow step can be halted by warded barriers and magical protection, that being one of the great barriers to the Quincy plan to invade the Soul King’s Palace, but a sufficiently skilled master can bypass this. "

For an extra 200CP, also discounted to Quincy if chosen, this perk can be upgraded to Shadow: The Key. Not only does this grant the mastery described above, which may have required years of work, but it also allows for your shadows to bypass even the strongest of wards if you are able to get physically close to them. Even the tiniest shadows can be manipulated to massive portals and instant movement mid combat is a viable usage of the shadows.

324,,200,Boogie Woogie,Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Domain,Boogie Woogie activates when the user claps their hands together. The technique switches the positions of the user and anything they desire that has above a certain amount of cursed energy. The user can also switch things or people not including themselves (i.e. The user can swap their partner with their adversary's position).
325,,200,The Cantina,A Mage Of Sorothustra,Domain,"You are the owner of this traveling inn and pub that floats through the multiverse at a pace that’s agreeable to you. There are a range of enchantments on the pub that grant it a series of abilities, some of which are impressive and others of which are minor quality-of-life things. Some of its abilities include the power to teleport to you, the ability to animate to protect you, and a series of enchantments that allow food prepared inside of it to feed living beings no matter their dietary restrictions as well as an effect it has that facilitates communication between people inside of it. This thing recognizes you as its owner and can serve as an enforcer of magically binding deals made within it. There is also room inside of this for anything like portals to your pocket dimension or a master suite for you and somewhat lesser or smaller suites for your family."
326,,200,Gravity   ,Seven Deadly Sins,Domain,"You are able to manipulate gravity in localised areas. You can increase or decrease the gravity over small spaces, enough to catch a giant within your affected spaces, and an average Holy Knight would be able to increase it up to ten times over or reduce it to a tenth. You can also learn how to use a variety of other effects such as flight or more specific increases of gravity over time. "
327,,200,World of Void,Dragon Ball Super,Domain,"The battles of divine beings can’t be carried out within the universes, else they’d destroy everything around them. Instead, a special dimension was created to allow for battles of any magnitude without harming the outside. The World of Void, a dimension of infinite emptiness, where the only matter within it is air and an innumerable number of empty stone arenas floating here and there. You have a key in your possession that allows you to open great dimensional gateways that lead to this realm, even allowing you to make the gateway suck in yourself and your opponent should their strength not be great enough, letting you force any battle to occur in a safe location. While in the World of Void, not even attacks or methods of movement that travel across dimensions will allow you or your opponent to damage the outside world. The key is always in your possession, even repairing if broken or reappearing if lost. "
328,,200,Botamono Bay,Dragon Ball Super,Domain,"What good is offence is no one can break through your defense? You have access to a special dimension, private to you alone, that appears to be significantly larger than an entire universe. Unfortunately, you don’t seem to yet be able to take things out from this massive empty space. Fortunately, that doesn’t matter much because it makes for one of the best defences in existence. You are able to open up invisible portals at any point on or around the whole of your body, taking merely an instant to do so, allowing you to harmlessly suck away attacks or enemies that touch you into this private dimension. You need to be able to activate it in time for an attack so if you don’t maintain it constantly, you can be hit by sneak attacks. As well, enough power can overwhelm that private dimension from within, causing the attack to burst back out from you and deal a lot of damage. But it’d take something that was beyond the power of a universe destroying blast to do that. As your personal power increases, the amount your dimension can withstand before it belches back the absorbed damage at you will increase. "
329,,200,Triad Formation,Final Fantasy Type-0,Domain,"Three people are better than one. Between yourself and two of your trusted companions, you can form a temporary squad formation. As long as you remain in sight of each other, you can freely teleport between one another. As you are not corporeal until your body completely materializes, for a very brief moment after the teleport you and your partner cannot be harmed."

This will allow for training while asleep, though it won’t work for physical skills, and only mental ones. If you poke around enough, though, there may be more to be found in the Dreamscape. Lucid Dreamers are known to be able to get into others dreams, sometimes."
331,,200,Katabasis,Virgil’s Aeneid,Domain,"The descent to the Underworld is easy. Night and day the gates of shadowy Death stand open wide, but to retrace your steps, to climb back to the upper air—there the struggle, there the labor lies. Thankfully, this is your specialty. Now and in any future world which features some kind of equivalent to an underworld, you know a ritual means of getting both in and out without significant difficulty (stock up on pig’s blood). This perk does not protect you from any potential dangers of Hades and other Hells, but it does ensure you have a means of getting in and out relatively unscathed."

This also grants you access to an archive folder where you can review past events.
333,,200,Boost,The Seven Deadly Sins,Domain,Boost is a power that allows the user to propel themself at high speeds. This allows one to both increase the power of their strikes as well as escape an enemy with great speed.
334,,200,Eight-Fold Geomantic Mastery,Generic Exalted,Domain,"You possess the inherent understanding and skill with geomancy and the manipulation of natural energies such that you may now create manses in any area where such a thing could conceivably be created. The stronger the mystic or magical significance of a given place the more powerful the manse that can be built there, but even in the barest and most mystically barren areas you will still be capable of producing, given some time, a manse of the least (1-dot) power. The process of creating a Manse is tremendously faster for you than it would be for others, the necessary geomantic arrays and arrangements seeming to simply leap to your mind with a clarity of insight few if any could match.

The Eight-Fold part of it is that you understand the methods for creating manses aspected towards all five of the elemental essences of fire, earth, wind, water, and wood as well as manses aspected towards solar, lunar, and stellar (sidereal) energies. Given time and effort you may discern methods for creating other types of manse, twisted mockeries of what nature intended, but such insights will take considerable effort, time, and resources to bear fruit. Taking this perk explicitly allows you to create manses even outside of Creation and, indeed, is the only way to create manses outside of Creation."
335,,200,Leyline Founts,Shin Megami Tensei V,Domain,"Everything is connected. Leyline founts are scattered thourgh out Da’at and are terminals connected to supernatural energy. At them, for a small monetary offering, you can heal yourself and your Demonic allies (even reviving them). Other artificial terminals exist in Bethel and the Da’at equivalent of the Diet Building. One can teleport from one of these Terminals to another. If you purchase this you can find and create Leyline Founts and Terminals in future Worlds with the same properties. You can decide who can use them."

She can sell you any consummable item within the setting as well as various common weapons and accessories. She can also give sage advice if you get her to open up to you. You can of course use this shop to sell your own wares.
337,,200,Smithy,Final Fantasy XVI,Domain,"You receive a smithy helmed by a grumpy smith who likes alcohol. His smithing skills scale with yours, he can craft any item as long as you bring him and the material and can even upgrade them though it will cost you gils/whatever currency exists in the setting. You can of course use the smithy to sell your own services as a smith."
338,,200,Famiel’s Luck,Final Fantasy XVI,Domain,Famiel is a member of the Mysidia tribe whose cowardliness actually saved him and his companions quite a few times. This offers you a great boost to your speed and wit while also guaranteing that you and your companions can get away from any foe as long as your intent is merely fleeing instead of say luring them into a trap.
339,,200,Agility,Final Fantasy XVI,Domain,"Many times you will notice that people in this world even non dominants are capable of feats of agility that beggar the mind. From leaping a few meters in the air without taking a running start, the acrobatics of Dhalmekian ninjas to the absurd leaping capabilities of imperial dragoons.

This perk enables the feats of agility, parkour and such seen throughout the game though you may need to train a bit to reach the levels of imperial dragoons who come close to flying with all their leaps. This of course translates into whatever forms and/or transformations you may have such as Eikons."
340,,200,Isolated Island ,Greek Myth,Domain,"Hidden behind swirling mists, cruel rocks, and rushin currents lies your domain. This island lies off the coast of Greece and is untouched by man. Only you and the gods know of the secret paths that must be taken to reach this place from the land. Those who sail the seas fear this island and without a touch of the supernatural only great or terrible fortune could let a man wash upon its shores rather the being beaten along the rocks.

Only those who are destined to reach this place or those who have power surpassing ordinary men could come hear of their own will."
341,,200,Divine Chariot,Greek Myth,Domain,"A masterfully crafted chariot made by the forge God Hephaestus. It is hitched behind two immortal horses each one supernaturally swift and enduring. It is perfectly made for you and can be controlled with even the lightest of touches.

The true boon of this chariot however is that it can be hitched to almost any creature and pulled by them at their top speed."
342,,200,Sandals of Hermes,Greek Myth,Domain,"Hermes winged sandals allow him to run through the air like a bird. Now you to may take flight while wearing a copy of his legendary shoes. While wearing these the air itself seems to form a solid and flat surface to walk on. They also increase the length of your strides three fold allowing you to walk at running speeds and run even faster. Furthermore they are a snug comfy fit and golden.

Completely silent and leave no footprints in case you need to engage in the less scrupulous domains of the thieves God."
343,,200,Den of Serpents,Greek Myth,Domain,"Men whisper amongst themselves huddled around their fires of a place no man may enter and live. They speak of the Hydra's swamp where it's poison blood has turned it into a pit of death and the Charybdis pulling ships to their death. They also speak of you, you can turn any place you live into a wasteland. If you wish you can make it so no mortal can approach you lair and live or so the survivors of your wrath whisper. Only the strong and those who wish to die would be willing to approach somewhere you have prepared this defense for."
344,,200,Logos Reenactor 2.0         ,Fate/Grand Order Part 2,Domain,"From the dusty corner of some storage room in the Wandering Sea, you’ve come to obtain this strange large box, about half a meter long and a third wide, with a blue color theme and futuristic aesthetic. It looks completely useless, but thankfully this one comes with a manual for some reason. Turns out this is the Logos Reenactor, an immensely powerful computing device that can simulate a region about half the size of Honshu, Japan (the mainland basically), to such a faithful degree that you could jump right into it with dimensional travel abilities and be unable to tell you’re not in normal reality. Normally, the sheer degree of simulation from this thing would generate real Singularities the moment the simulation began, but this version has that particular bug fixed. Of course, if you would like to retain that particular issue for some reason, you can for a surcharge of an extra 100cp.

Of course, you can also configure the simulations yourself. Perhaps you’d like to play out an alternate version of the Warring States period of Japan, where nearly every single relevant warlord is some variant of Oda Nobunaga? Regardless of what you simulate, unfortunately it won’t be able to expand or account for things outside the boundaries of the simulation, so without reverse engineering the thing and making a bigger one you won’t be able to play real time strategy games with insane detail on a global scale or something, but at least it comes with a power source installed so you won’t need to worry about the energy it consumes to operate. So what kind of simulations will you make with this?"
345,,200,Egg,Fate/Grand Order Part 2,Domain,"The Human Order has its own laws to ensure the prosperity and survival of humanity. The Textures of the Age of Gods were formed from the beliefs of its mortal inhabitants. And now, you’ve become a nascent World in your own right, complete with your own laws of reality. Unfortunately there’s quite a few things that are simply constant across all Planets, and you’ll still have to inherit some traits of the Earth, a minimum required to be at least recognizable by those native to this Planet. Beyond that, however, it’s your World, and your rules. Perhaps you’d like to completely reject Pan-Human History, rendering any human Servant unsummonable? Of course, such things aren’t absolute, and just like there are ways to bypass the laws of the Human Order, there will be ways to bypass your rules. Not that it’s much of a downside, as you are still indeed a baby World.

Of course, to begin with the contents of your World will be based on your own mentality and view of the World, essentially being a Reality Marble on a slightly larger scale. With the right resources, you could potentially grow your World into a full Planet, although the amount of energy required would certainly be immense, not to mention needing to evacuate Earth if you don’t want to be kicked out violently by the Human Order.

Additionally, as a bonus, you’re able to absorb living beings to obtain the information of their makeup (even something as small as a hair is enough), and can later recreate them within your World with an appropriate investment of magical energy, although if you don’t have enough to, you can merely recreate a weaker version instead. This process of recreation is instant, of course, and the only limit is the space within your World and the magical energy available to you, letting you potentially create whole armies. Of course, you have some influence over the recreation, able to ‘program’ them, in a manner of speaking, however you wish, such as instilling unbreakable loyalty in you, or perhaps allowing them full individuality. Unfortunately if you want to create new life or modify the ‘templates’ formed from absorbed creatures, you’ll need to obtain that ability yourself, but if you’re trying to grow yourself into a full-sized World, you might obtain such conceptual Authorities automatically, depending on how much ego the natives of yourself have and how much they develop into a civilization. That is a long way to go, of course, but the potential is definitely there. What kind of World will you craft out of your own self?"
346,,200,Cathedral of Shadows,Shin Megami Tensei 3: Nocturne,Domain,"Welcome to the Cathedral of Shadows! Here, you can fuse Demons together to create new ones! Now that you've bought this, you now have access to it from your warehouse. Furthermore, you now have access to a new function. You can now summon a copy of any non-companion Demon you have ever summoned, as long as you no longer have the original with you. This does also work with any other Demons or spirits you have join you in any other Jump."
347,,200,Fountain of Life,Shin Megami Tensei 3: Nocturne,Domain,"Throughout Tokyo, random doors will lead to a fountain. There, you can pay the lady that resides there to heal your wounds. Now, your warehouse has one of those doors in it as well! Plus, you don't have to pay when using that door."
348,,200,Devil Bringer,DMC 5,Domain,"A literal arm, this demonic arm takes the place of your own, and is the physical manifestation of your demonic power. The arm possesses superhuman strength, which it can also manifest through a larger, spectral arm, and is capable of absorbing items of power and manifesting their power."
349,,200,Chilling Hatred(Tier 2),Diablo 3,Domain,"Most think that the Burning Hells have only fire and flame to offer. But the freezing depths of Hell can also be a chilling surprise.

For 200 you can activate a Frostaura that slowly freezes anything you touch or slows down anything that steps too close to you. Good for gaining an advantage over enemies in melee.

For 400 you can instead turn the area around you into freezing wasteland. Freeze entire fortresses with a powerful gale of ice, create shards of ice to shoot at enemies from a distance, create spikes of ice resembling brittle spears.

Requires Chilling Hatred(Tier 1) to Purchase"
350,,200,The Road Of The Homeless,Fate/Grand Order Part 1,Domain,"What happens to those that survive the end of their world? What remains of one's future when their timeline dies? While normally such a situation is lethal, a strange twist of fate has turned you into someone who wanders between worlds. Like a certain swordswoman, you will occasionally find holes of a sort, undetectable to any but you. Jumping into these holes will drop you into a black abyss dotted with countless stars. These stars are in fact entire worlds or timelines, the distinction isn't very relevant in this particular case. After a brief moment where you're simply drifting among these potential destinations, you'll be drawn to a random one of these stars, and then find yourself within that world.

Unfortunately this process seems uncontrollable, at least without a lot of magical prowess on your part. Parallel worlds, alternate timelines, even Singularities can be among the possible locations you end up in. Thankfully, all of the worlds you end up in seem to be magical in some way, never being fully mundane. And, of course, you can simply not jump into the hole, to remain in whatever world you are in for longer. A certain parallel world version of Musashi used these holes as an opportunity to hone her swordsmanship against quite varied opponents. What will you do, wanderer with no home?"
351,,200,Tower of Babel,GrimGrimoire,Domain,"As you embark on future jumps, you will come to possess your own Tower of Silver Stars, an impossible structure that pierces the very heavens. This towering structure is yours to own and control, staffed with an array of loyal familiars that can be marshalled together to form an unstoppable force that could put even the most powerful rulers to shame. Within its vast halls and spacious chambers lie endless opportunities - you might establish a school for magical instruction, or harness its boundless energy to become an unstoppable force in your own right."
352,,200,Havens ,Final Fantasy XV Royal Edition,Domain,"A curiosity of this world is that there are places that are great for camping marked with glowing blue runes and are perfectly secure even during the Long Night; spacious enough for a group of peoples to train at ease; strangely comfortable enough to get a good night's sleep and still offer a great view absolutely for free, wouldn't it be a shame to leave that behind? For the low price of 200 CP, we at Jumpchain Inc. will make places like these exist in future Jumps, come on, we know you want it. Just remember to bring your Coleman brand camping gear or any other, no problem."
353,,200,Celestial Banquet ,Journey To The West,Domain,"No food on Earth is able to compete with that of Heaven. Even the least heavenly snack is incredibly delicious. Now you have a reliable source of heavenly food, as a kitchen stocked with any kind of food you can imagine, all beyond the highest quality that mortal food might achieve. From fruits, vegetables, meats, drinks, practically any food at all can be made in this kitchen, with its neverending stock of celestial ingredients. The kitchen comes with about a dozen minor spirits to take care of the cooking, but if you wish you can dismiss them and cook food yourself. Even if you’re inexperienced in the culinary arts these minor spirits will be eager to teach you all they know. Oh, yes, a minor note, all the celestial ingredients in here make those who eat it eternally young. It’s the food of the gods themselves, what did you expect?"
354,,200,Fertile River,Journey To The West,Domain,"Why? You are now the official owner of a large river, of clean water and large fishes. It’s not just a mundane river, however. Anyone who drinks water directly from the river, whether woman, man, or animal, will immediately become heavily pregnant. The water has to be drunk directly from the river for it to work its magic, but it looks like completely normal water, so tricking people into drinking from it might not be difficult. You could easily maintain a whole kingdom composed of nothing but women with no issues on producing the next generation with this river. Additionally, you also possess a natural wellspring of water hidden in a cave somewhere relatively close to the river (as in, ten miles away), that immediately and painlessly aborts any pregnancy of whoever drinks it, even if the pregnancy is natural instead of produced by drinking the water of the river. You should be careful no one drinks more than a few sips of this abortion water, though, as that can be very lethal. Not that you’re under any obligation to show people where this wellspring is."
355,,200,It Was Revealed To Me In A Dream,Journey To The West,Domain,"You’d be surprised how often dreams are used in the operation of Heaven. There’s been at least one execution carried out within a dream, and dreams are common ways of transmitting information to mortals. Whether or not you have other powers, you’re quite adept at manipulating dreams, able to enter sleeping minds and showing them what you want to transmit them information, or leading the target’s dream self elsewhere for whatever purpose, such as being the executioner of a disobedient dragon king. You can also force someone who is awake to fall asleep into a dream you set up, if you’re feeling impatient.

Lastly, any dreamers you interact with will be able to recount their strange dreams and will be completely believed. You could safely transmit important information to others through dreams and they will not only remember it but the explanation of ‘it was revealed to me in a dream’ won’t be laughed off and will be taken seriously instead. To be fair, Immortals and the dead sending messages in dreams is a known factor here, but this works in future worlds anyway if you buy this perk."
356,,200,Pseudo-Instant Dungeon,Generic Angels and Demons,Domain,"In most universes, interaction between supernatural beings and mundane people are highly regulated, in some cases, even by transcendental forces that might be pretty willing to curse the ones that break these rules or just outright smite them. Fortunately, a special technique was developed as a way to avoid this, a technique that you also have access to. You’re able to create “Protected Space”, a kind of pocket dimension that is basically a reflection/shadow of the place where they were created. When creating one of such spaces, any being more powerful than a mundane human will be able to freely enter and fight with each other, as any force that would regulate their actions will ignore whatever happens inside the pocket dimension. The default size for a Protected Space is around the size of a city block, but, by adding extra power, you can make it as big as an entire city. Lastly, any damage done within this dimension won’t actually affect the world outside it."
357,,200,Open Door,Fate/Legends - Voyage to Valhalla,Domain,"Suffering builds character and don’t genius artist suffer so? There is something about misery that seeks them out. Or is it the other way? Much like a certain devil, you find the door to ‘Hellscapes’ is always open for you. Horrible environments, horrific circumstances, you need to but seek them out and find a way to get there. In particular rare and outrageous cases, you may even end up in a different time all together without the use of advanced magic, science or the byproduct of both. What will you do when in hell?"
358,,200,Pursuer,Final Fantasy XIV,Domain,"Those who have fought a Tonberry will be aware of their dangerous tendencies. Once a Tonberry gives chase to a target, it is uncommon for their quarry to escape. Whenever you’re chasing after an opponent, you seem to move a little quicker – on top of that, should you be chasing after a fleeing opponent, you’ll move faster yet.

Let none escape from the edge of your knife."
359,,200,Fortress City,Mushoku Tensei ~ Jobless Reincarnation ~,Domain,"Nobles tend to have higher stations and have important occupations or rule certain locations. This grants you a Fortress City with a population of hundred thousand and protected by heavily fortified walls that can resist any invasion and attack. The walls, floor and castle are made of resistant materials that can resist Emperor-Rank Magic or Physical attacks along with it being inscribed with Magic-Circles that emit Healing Magic at Saint- Rank that is capable of healing most injuries aside from lost-limbs. The soldiers are also trained quite well with foot-soldiers being a thousand Advanced-Rank Warriors with ten Saint-Rank Warriors and they can be local or humanlike automation if you like. This city is a central hub of trade and commerce that produces revenue and tax with a minimum of ten thousand Gold Coins monthly with the tenth of it goes into your pocket and the rest goes to the salary of the staff, maintenance of the building and reserve for rainy days. Post-Jump this city would merge with your warehouse and you can deploy it to any location that you want or merge with an existing city. In modern settings this takes the form as a private land with a private city that you develop and once you deploy or merge it the paperwork for it is hand waved and already finished and legal too."
360,,200,Adventurer’s Guild ,Mushoku Tensei ~ Jobless Reincarnation ~,Domain,"Being an adventurer is good and all but should you retire you're unlikely to find jobs fit your skill set other than joining the military of your country. This gives you the ownership of a branch of Adventurers Guild in the major city of your starting along with it being staffed by locals of the city or a humanlike automation if you like. The building is made of resistant materials that can resist Emperor-Rank Magic or Physical attacks along with it being inscribed with Magic-Circles that emit Healing Magic at Saint-Rank that is capable of healing most injuries aside from lost-limbs.

361,,200,Item Shop ,Mushoku Tensei ~ Jobless Reincarnation ~,Domain,Even if you have the goods to sell it would be hard if you don’t have a shop or booth to sell it from. This gives you a shop merged with your warehouse where you can deploy it to any location that you want or merge with an existing building. The building is made of resistant materials that can resist Emperor-Rank Magic or Physical attacks along with it being inscribed with Magic-Circles that emit Healing Magic at Saint-Rank that is capable of healing most injuries aside from lost-limbs. This Item Shop has the tools you need to build any Magic-Tools that you plan to build and the quality of the tools start off as master-crafted and it would improve from there as you improve your crafting skills. Should you don’t want to stand around all day to attend your shop this shop comes with a humanlike automation that would become your clerk and with it being smart enough to pass off as a human and be left alone for a long time if you want to go on an adventure. Post-Jump in modern settings this takes the form of a hardware store and once you deploy or merge it the paperwork for it is hand waved and already finished and legal too.
362,,200,Ship on Call,Elder Scrolls Online – The Vestige,Domain,"A steed is well and good, but there are places that cannot be reached on foot. Every time you need to reach a location across the water, you can call a ship from the ether. It will transport you to your destination with a small fee and then disappear into nothingness. In future jumps the ship will automatically upgrade itself to an appropriate technological level, even transforming into a different kind of ship, like an airship or a starship."
363,,200,God's Secret Hot Spring,Akame ga Kill!,Domain,"Located on the Empire's borderlands, this hot spring is basically an excellent place of healing, made up of all different kinds of therapeutic and medicinal hot springs, with the property of greatly extending someone's lifespan if they had it decreased due to some external factors, such as diseases, usage of life-consuming abilities, extended usage of drugs, effects of potent toxins, among other possible factors. There are reports of people who were diagnosed with half a year left to live from some disease, going on to live for as much as another five years or even longer in some cases, and this is through only by being treated with its waters, so, if combined with other healing treatments, their lifespan could be extended far longer. Such a place is also perfect for treating someone’s addiction, as its waters also heal the withdrawal effects they might suffer. You receive your own secret hot spring, becoming an attachment of your Warehouse or of any other property you might have."
364,,200,Heaven’s Hole,Fate/Tale Of The Beasts,Domain,"An ability similar to a Waste Hole or Black Hole. At will you can activate this ability which will drag all who dared to oppose you inside your own body, dragging them into your own internal universe.

The inside of your body is a separate universe of your own choosing. Whether it’s a paradise of pure pleasure or an absolute hellscape is up to you. Anyone drawn into your internal universe essentially loses their existence, their consciousness liberated and their will melted. No matter how strong their body, or how much armor they have, this is meaningless when they enter your body.

It’s nearly impossible to escape as well, only beings with an incredible ability to escape or great manipulators of spacetime could ever hope to leave, and that's assuming they somehow survive being inside you. If you desire, you may also choose to retrieve people from your internal universe."

368,,200,Small Shrine,Chinese Mythology,Domain,"Small shrines and places of worship are everywhere in this land. With how many gods and spirits there are, it’s no surprise that most places will feature some tribute or offering to the local deities. This is a small shrine to receive offerings from. Anything that is offered to you and interred into this shrine will be teleported next to you. It can be disguised as a shrine for other gods or as something for yourself. It will follow you in future jumps, manifesting in a location you find suitable, in a form appropriate to the setting that won’t draw undue attention unless you want it to appear foreign or incongruous to its surroundings."
369,,200,Sancrosanct,Final Fantasy XIII-3,Domain,"As the saviour of prophecy travels, surely she will shepherd those around her to salvation. Well, you’re not quite sure about shepherding people to salvation, but it seems in the Order records there had been discussion about creating a magical barrier – for use to protect specific ritual sites.

With the magic from your background, you figure that you can reproduce the same effect. Setting down a marker with a pillar of light, the magic will establish a barrier zone similar to the one inside the Order’s Cathedral. In order to keep the field manifested, you’ve had to conjure four altars, with the altars forming the boundaries of the zone in the shape of a diamond. One thing’s for sure, the farther you moved the altars away from you, the more energy it started to drain from you. Attempting to move the altars by hand once they were set was also fruitless, and after a short while you were too drained to maintain the field. Thankfully, standing inside the zone, you also noticed your wounds and the wounds of those around you closing up. At least, for the rabbits that weren’t dead yet anyways.

You did notice something distinctive about the zone however.  Everything inside seemed to be pacified, and requesting the system to generate an aggressive rabbit resulted in it being pacified as well. You figure that it probably would not work on anything stronger than you, but it’s still an interesting quirk regardless.

It’s also more than likely that a ranged projectile or a magical projectile will just blow right into your zone – you can’t see it being able to pacify a bullet or a fire spell."
370,,200,Chronostasis,Final Fantasy XIII-3,Domain,"Reports of Fal’Cie being able to freeze time have inspired enough essays and studies to fill a library, and after reading through the available material, you’ve started to understand the fundamentals behind the Fal’Cie’s time manipulation. It seems that the scientists’ original theory of AMP being able to affect Chaos to control time, and the Fal’Cie’s ability are related to each other.

With a bit of effort, and a little bit of tweaking on yourself, you’ve managed to isolate a small area, where the flow of time is indeed halted. Unfortunately at your current level of understanding, the moment your attention strays away from the area, reality reinforces itself and time corrects its flow.

Following some experimentation, which involved the system generating live rabbits for testing purposes, you’ve confirmed that whatever is inside freezes in position and cannot be affected until the field is lifted. You’ve also confirmed that whatever enters into the zone will freeze – like that rabbit that is now stuck in mid-air.

Right now you need to be physically present and staring at the area to maintain your concentration – but a theory hits you, that perhaps you could maintain a field at distance, through a camera of some sort. It is, probably best however, if you don’t try to drop a field over yourself. If time stopped while you were thinking about it – would you ever be able to stop thinking about it?"
371,,200,Quicksilver,Devil May Cry,Domain,"Shout out to the big man, who'll probably choose this one out of sheer narcissism. Quicksilver Style allows you to slow down time. Not much else to it. However, as with other Styles, you really shouldn't underestimate this one either. When you initiate it, time is actually completely frozen for an entire second that only you can experience (Invincibility frame), which lets you move out of the way of an attack. Furthermore, you can use this Style to keep up with opponents who are way faster than you, as a way to level out the playing field. However, this ability takes up a lot of energy to maintain, so be sure to use this sparingly, unless you're a stamina juggernaut. 

You're also able to function during other people's time altering shenanigans, so you don't have to worry about getting blindsided by some one-trick time-pony."
372,,200,Trickster,Devil May Cry,Domain,"Ah, Trickster Style, what a life saver you are. This here is the easiest style for beginners, but don't go thinking that it's some sort of newbie exclusive deal. 

Trickster allows you to quickly dash and dodge around enemy attacks in the blink of an eye, allowing you to quickly weave away from their attacks and get behind them, strike from the blind spot, and then dash away before they know what hit 'em. You can also do some sick wall running, dash while in the air, and do a short-range teleport that'll either get you some breathing space, or put you right above your enemy, ready to deliver a badass plunging attack."
373,,200,Threadrunner ,The Destiny Universe,Domain,"The Hunters never knew Freedom quite as well as they did when they were exposed to Strand. Utilizing the Weave, they were capable of applying their generally evasive and chaotic tactics in all three dimensions, swinging around the battlefield, binding their enemies, and suspending them in the air. Now able to take to the skies just as easily as they could maneuver on the ground, Hunters became practically untouchable to their enemies, and you are no exception. You can conduct entire battles without ever touching the ground, double or triple jumping to great heights, throwing yourself through the sky, from wall to wall, and even from flying enemy to flying enemy, so fast that your enemies below barely track you, let alone actually get a shot on you. Furthermore, purchasing this perk grants you the 100 CP Grappling Strands perk for free, as well as access to the Threaded Spike - a dart made of Strand Matter that can chain to multiple enemies, damaging them and severing their connection to the weave, before returning to you."

With your grappling hook, your skill grows by the exponents as you are no longer limited by your own momentum to stay in the air. You can conjure and attach your grappling hook to the Weave as easily as breathing, using it to swing and toss yourself through the air as though you’d been born in it. You have such a skill at throwing yourself into and maneuvering yourself through the air that Warlocks wonder if you had gained their ability to fly. Unless your enemies can do just that, you may very well never be touched by them again. Finally, purchasing this perk grants you the Silkstrike Super - a rope dart made of Strand Matter that does tremendous damage to your enemies by severing their connection to the Weave with each strike.

375,,200,Arcstrider ,The Destiny Universe,Domain,"When approaching combat, Hunters typically follow one of two schools of thought: Surgically strike their enemies from extreme distances, or, if that isn’t possible, allow their enemies not even one chance to get a shot on them. Where Titans plant themselves in the ground and become an immovable object, and Warlocks fashion themselves an irresistible force, Hunters move. They scramble over rubble, under tables, jump high into the air, climb onto ceilings, and dart around wildly. In a protracted fight, there is no opponent faster, wilder, or more nimble than a Hunter. You embody this philosophy, finding yourself able to control a battlefield by moving through it with peerless speed and freedom. If given an inch, you can run a mile - it is borderline impossible for your enemies to hit you. Finally, you acquire the Blink - a paracausal ability that Hunters originally learned from Warlocks, that allows you to teleport about the battlefield, ensuring that even if surrounded and with nowhere to run, you can still find the freedom you so thrive in."
376,,200,Behemoth,The Destiny Universe,Domain,"As the enemies of the Last City grew in strength, the tactics and powers of the Titans grew to match. When the Fallen besieged the City at the battle of Six Fronts, the Titans built the walls. When the Guardians failed in the Great Disaster, Titans led the push for three-man fireteams. When the enemies began making mass use of the Darkness, Titans began to take direct control of the battlefield to steal away their enemies’ advantages. Through the Light and the Darkness, you know how best to create traps, walls, and wells of your chosen element to control the movement of your enemies, funnel them in desired directions and even prevent them from moving at all. Finally, purchasing this perk grants you access to the Assault Barricade, a barrier made of Light that you and your allies can fire through."
377,,200,Inventory Management,The Destiny Universe,Domain,"Up to a certain limit, Ghosts have shown the ability to dematerialize the weapons and equipment of a Guardian, storing them in their Guardians’ Light in the same way that Ghosts can ‘hide’ themselves. While the exact mechanics of this ability are as unknown to the Ghosts as their ability to dematerialize themselves, it is nevertheless a fact that Guardians can carry with them a veritable armory of equipment. For free, you the ability to store your Guardian’s equipment and recall them on command. Your limit is not by mass, but the number of items you can store, with a total of eighty one pieces of equipment, and fifty total ‘odds and ends’ items. By spending 100 CP, you can increase this limit to scale with the strength of your Guardian, effectively allowing them to carry anything they could want at all times. An extra 100, 200 in total, allows you to even carry and store personal vehicles as well. You’ll get an Item Manager thrown in, for good measure. You’ll need it."
378,,200,The Speed of (Paracausal) Light(FTL),The Destiny Universe,Domain,"While there is no known limit to the flight speed of a Ghost, it is at least known for certain that they are capable of levitating in Earth’s gravity, forever, without any need for thrust or propellant. Extrapolated, this means a Ghost at minimum is capable of accelerating through space at a rate of 1G forever, meaning that the speed of light is not a distant goal as much as it is a minor challenge to be reached. Taking into consideration the many planets and objects in the solar system whose gravity is stronger than Earth, and their minimum acceleration grows higher, and the time necessary to approach lightspeed grows shorter. By taking this perk, unless you are damaged or weakened, you are capable of the same thing. Furthermore, you shall be capable of reaching those same luminal velocities in a fraction of the time as other Ghosts, and due to the fact that you are reaching these speeds through paracausal means, things like time dilation or deceleration are no issue for you. By spending 200 CP on this perk, you can go faster than Light, and open up the entire universe for you and, should you have one, your Risen.

379,,200,Hoho,Epic of Leviathan,Domain,Hoho refers to the high speed movement arts. This is the third of the Shinigami’s main fighting styles. These are primarily used as auxiliary techniques to enhance the combat capabilities of other moves. The highest level of Hoho is the Shunpo technique otherwise known as the Flash Steps. Taking this power will grant you experience on par with Yoruichi Shihoin and Tenjiro Kirinji. Lastly there is a synergy bonus if you purchase all four of the Shinigami fighting styles. Your skills and power will instead be boosted to that of the members of Zero Division and Yamamoto.
380,,200,Isle Of Beasts,Greek Mythology,Domain,"An island prison of your design could be a desert, jungle, mountain, actual labyrinth, etc. anyone who steps foot on this island will find themselves being turned around since the island acts as a labyrinth with the intent to keep what enters it contained you are the only one able to navigate without issue."
381,,200,"Nymphs, Naiads, Dryads, Oh My!",Greek Mythology,Domain,"Like the many races of nymphs you are able to tie yourself to a piece of the natural world such as a certain tree (Dryads), a river or stream (Naiads), the sea (Nereids), even mountains (Oreads). When you tie yourself to this location you become a spiritual caretaker to it gaining the power to manipulate it as you see fit (the more vague/vaste your claim such as the ocean or this mountain range the less control you have) your life force will also be shared with the location allowing you to heal it if it's damaged or transfer damage done to you on to it (Be careful placing to much damage on the location will end up harming you if left unattended). Note: Higher powers and stronger individuals can cause your location to betray you (Will Check)."
382,,200,A Sacred Cave,Scion ,Domain,"Under a series of tunnels and shafts is a huge, beautiful cavern larger than any mortal stadium. A spring gushes from one end through a series of low terraces into a deep crescent-shaped lake, and a pair of flaming braziers flank an altar on one of the few outcroppings of land in it. This cave has two purposes: As long as they are lit, the braziers greatly confuse your location to all mystic and Fate-based senses-tying you to this cavern if you are not within it, or to a faraway location if you are. The second purpose is that it’s waters are an equal to the famed oracle of Delphi that Gaia once wielded before Apollo seized it. Such is its power that even a god of Mystery or Prophecy would find their efforts to divine the future greatly enhanced by soaking in its water, allowing the normally motherhood-focused Gaia to exceed Prometheus’ notorious foresight in subtler ways. Such is it’s closeness to the World Titan Terra herself that constant use risks coming to its notice yourself-and while this spells the loss of consciousness for most Scions, a true child or ally of Terra might be able to solicit her blessings through this meagre link."
383,,200,Elemental Vitality,Scion ,Domain,"The Jotuns are a people in exile. Since the death of Ymir at the hands of Odin and his brothers, their chieftain Utgard-Loki (no relation to the trickster god; he’s a Muspel boy) has pursued a cautious détente with the Aesir knowing that the closest Titan avatar to his kind, Surtur, actively desires the destruction of all there is. Yet they continue to survive in Jotunheim’s icy wastes, thanks to the inherited affinity of ice they have-and which you share. Choose a Purview-a concept broad enough to be encompassed by a Titan. While you lack the fine control the gods have over it, you are capable of creating vast amounts of it at will for tiny expenditures of Legend. Even the weakest Jotun could easily freeze up to 10,000 gallons of nearby water at will. Better yet, you may rapidly heal injuries to yourself by exposing your injuries to such elements and spending yet another miniscule amount of Legend. And should you already have been a Jotun yet taken this perk anyway, your mastery over ice will be the envy of your kind."
384,,200,Last Resort,Fate/Faerie Britain,Domain,"Perhaps in weaker worlds, the queen is merely a title without any accompanying power, but in Faerie Britain it is impossible for someone to rule over faeries without already being powerful. And it is the burden of the powerful to be, or possess, a weapon of last resort, a final blow in the event that the battle turns against you. You possess such a technique, a Bounded Field allowing you to provide a vast increase to the power of both yourself and your entire army, one that can allow your soldiers to temporarily resist death and strike with crushing might that defies rationality. But, as the name implies, this can’t be used at will, but only after battle has already been engaged and it appears that defeat is around the corner. Only in a terrible situation can you bring out this trump card.

This also ensures your skill in creating territories and Bounded Fields in general, especially if you have some form of magecraft to back it up."
385,,200,Gangleri Gangari ,Germanic/Norse Mythology,Domain,"You possess the gift to traverse the nine realms and beyond. You are free, as long as you are free to journey, to journey wherever you please, no land too distant or kingdom unknown. You can even travel to places beyond physical reach given time. No tireless journey by foot or under your own power would take more than the cycle of the moon or 27 nights and upon the back of a mighty steed no journey would take more than 9. This also provides you and your steeds the stamina to survive such long treks over natural terrains without break. While this does not provide any specific safety or protection from the environment or allow you to bypass blockades, walls, gates and the like it will let you come to the edge and interact if need be and improves what capabilities you hold while journeying.

388,,200,Inner Lotus World(Upgrade),Cultivation Chat Group,Domain,"You have your own inner world, initially the size of two football fields or so with the potential to grow larger. It’s a part of you, an ability as much as a possession. With it, you can stir the power of space a bit, teleporting yourself or others inside it, even before you’re a Tribulation Transcender. Inside it, you’re more powerful, or rather the world is yours and works towards your will. You aren’t all powerful - Cultivation goes against the Heavens after all, and your world is smaller than the Heavens.

The number of ways you can use your world - as a foundation, as a tool, as a refuge - are numerous enough that we can’t hope to list them all.

For an additional 200 CP, discounted for Modern Man, you can add a feature as powerful and flexible as the corruption-consuming Lotus Roots to your world.

391,,200,Wings of Vercingetorix,Final Fantasy XIII,Domain,"Crystalline wings spring forth from your back, relative to your size. The more you invest into this, the more wings you have, from two wings to capping at six wings. The wings let you maintain flight, but they seriously look out of place on you.

Even with a single set of wings, you can maintain flight capacity for up to ten minutes. You can also whirl about in place – you cannot move or attack during this – and it will knock opponents back. You’ll find some opponents may resist this however. You may only do this once per minute.

Upon two sets of wings, flight time is extended to twenty minutes. Your whirl now has a chance of removing equipment from enemies on top of the knockback.

When you reach three sets of wings, flight time is extended to half an hour. Your whirl remains unchanged, but by closing your wings together, you can create a barrier that deflects projectiles and magic in the direction you’re facing. You cannot change direction unless you unfurl your wings.

The wings are wholly alien to you, and since you are not C’ieth, they will not naturally grow more wings. They also drain your energy substantially as you use them, so perhaps when you start off, you will not have enough energy for the full ten minutes.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
392,,200,Deal​ ​With​ ​The​ ​Devil​,Demon:​ ​The​ ​Fallen,Domain,"It’s dangerous to get into a bargain with you. If you will it any deal you make can be backed with Divine Fiat. Nobody would dare willingly renege on a deal with you. Why? They simply can’t. This doesn’t stop you from backing out of a deal in progress, but expect your reputation to take a well deserved hit. Deals can be cancelled if both parties agree to it amicably, of course. If the deal does fall apart and your victim can no longer go through with the deal, you gain power over them as if they were your thrall, and you may ravage them for Faith at your leisure."

395,,200,Raindrop Iron Body,Cradle V1,Domain,"To attain this Iron body, the practitioner must play games that focus on speed and hand-eye coordination. Such games include (but are not limited to): catching birds as they run off, running as fast as possible, and hitting balls with sticks. This Iron body is usually attained by those whose eyes, senses, or “detection” are faster than their hands. It is said that an individual with this Iron body should “...be able to thread through drops in a rainstorm without getting wet...” hence its name."
396,,200,Humble Shrines,Egyptian Mythology,Domain,"Poor is the god with no shrine to call their own. There are roughly a hundred of these small shrines or petty temples scattered throughout the land, located in nome capitals, small villages, by the sides of roads or carved into nooks in wild cliffs as you please. It is up to you whether these shrines are well known by the locals of each region, housed in secret locations marked only by signs that your faithful can determine, or are wholly forgotten and lost from current knowledge.

When the faithful hail you with their worship and you are beside any one of these shrines, you feel where the hail is coming from, and may transport yourself between the shrine you are currently at, and the shrine you are being hailed from."
397,,200,Nome of Egypt,Egyptian Mythology,Domain,"A large region of land from along the banks of the Nile. Possession of this item alone makes you a Nomarch, or the leader of this area, which affords a significant political influence in the government of the Two Kingdoms. In modern terms this is somewhere between a small state and a county, a province or electorate division. It has its share of towns and cities, pasture, cropland and wild hills. The populace of your nome are followers. In future worlds, your nome can be inserted into a suitable location in any Egypt or fantasy Egypt on the banks of the Nile, or may be accessed through your warehouse."
398,,200,Black Earth,Egyptian Mythology,Domain,"A house in the Egyptian style, with a walled courtyard, outer communal rooms, and private rooms in the rear, seated in the centre of a large division of farmland with all of the tools and oxen you will need to sow and reap your crops. The bountiful, dark earth provides generous harvests to grow each season, and the canals and wells will not run dry.

These fertile fields are you spiritual homeland, and thus this land may be found when wandering between worlds: if your ba was banished into Duat, it might find this home in the shadowy realm; if your ahk finally arrived in the green fields of Aaru, it would find this home there too, exactly as you left it. When it is found in other realms of existence, it provides something of a safe haven from the natural dangers of those realms; the malevolent spirits of Duat tend to avoid it."

Through your warehouse or another property, you may access a space resembling the twisting canals of the Nile delta. It is a rich hunting ground for water birds, if you enjoy the sport, fishing in the shallows, harvesting papyrus, or simply idly boating in the pleasant air and calm waters. Venturing into the wilder regions will allow you to hunt the occasional crocodile or hippo, if you have no fear of meeting your death."
400,,200,Taxi,Marvel Zombies,Domain,"This power’s pretty handy, if situational. You can teleport. Not in the sense that Nightcrawler does, but between universes. You’re a living dimensional teleporter. The catch is that you have to be encased in some sort of container. Anything can do - you can hide out in a fridge and travel the multiverse, or you can use a vehicle like a jet or a spaceship. You’ll be a hot commodity."
401,,200,Nimble as a Diarmuid,Irish Mythology,Domain,"Diarmuid na Duibe was a particularly agile fighter, and would oft amuse his fellows by displays of balance, such as riding rolling barrels down a hill, or dancing on the sword-blade of a man trying to stick him. It is said, also, that he could leap from the ground up atop a high castle wall and back again, so that no fortification could stop him. All these things, you can do."
402,,200,Beneath the Waves,Irish Mythology,Domain,"There’s some debate whether the Fomor lived across or beneath the Western Sea. Well, consider that debate settled, you are quite aquatic and can breathe underwater, and cope quite easily with darkness and pressure."
403,,200,You Are On A Path In The Woods ,Slay the Princess,Domain,"There are many stories of heroes slaying terrible monsters and saving the entire world, and I suppose you could consider this to be the same yet different. This story is one that ebbs and flows, that shifts and changes, writhing and turning upon itself like trillions of bodies crammed into too tight a space. You may use this to weave a story, any story, and you may force it into reality and make it real. A means of enforcing something constant upon the imprecise, a small oasis of permanence amidst ceaseless change and transformation. The more well-defined your story is, the more concrete its edges and boundaries, the greater its degree of stability."
404,,200,Wings Of Silence,Slay the Princess,Domain,"Two large feathery dark wings have burst from the small of your back, staying firm and silent behind you. You can ‘fly’ with them, but it's more akin to a quick leap of incredible force, like their very presence acts as a rejection of whatever phenomenon keeps things bound to the Earth - or perhaps more accurately, it suspends those laws for you and you alone for a brief period. Perfect for providing the means to take the Princess off-guard."
405,,200,Auction House,Final Fantasy XI,Domain,"The Deed to an auction house, this deed allows you to place an auction house in your immediate area, anyone who wishes to use this auction house may do so simply by stepping to the window and browsing the goods.

You may also find items from your past jumps here however things bought will often face a large mark up in price and nothing truly rare is possible to be bought here."

When used a stable capable of housing and caring for chocobos of all ages will appear over the course of a day (complete with any chocobos you have raised). Here you can find specially trained personell that take care of and can help train chocobos as well as have the expertise to aid in the complex science of chocobo breeding and raising. The stable has its own stock of chocobo feed and a rather large crate of specially stored chocobo eggs of varying colors for the purpose of raising into the mighty steeds adventurers know and love. The personell found here seem to be drawn from whatever world you are in at the time, though they all seem to be experts in chocobo care for some reason. As a side bonus the chocobo stable can also be used to generate a steady stream of income as they rent out the specially trained birds to those with the proper licenses (which may be acquired on site)."

409,,200,The Dark Spectre,Dies Irae,Domain,"Rather than spend your whole life trapped in some other realm, unable to interact with reality, why not just pass a small version of yourself down to meet everyone? You are able to travel between dimensions and even project a fraction of your being between them instead. This projection possesses only a small fraction of your power but is able to pass into dimensions normally blocked off to you and will not cause trouble or damage in that dimension, even if your presence normally should for some reason. Normally, this would be used for a higher being to interact with those in a lower dimension without killing them but you can potentially visit the realms of those higher than you, perhaps even the exalted seat of God himself. Be prepared though as if you are not, you might cease to be just from entering that place."
410,,200,Personal Meditation Room,The God of High School,Domain,"There may come a time when you need to be kept locked away, not out of punishment but for the safety of others. However, as you grow in power and skill, less and less prisons are able to hold you. If it were merely a matter of isolating yourself from other humans, perhaps you could simply travel far into the mountains. But if for example, you were attempting to master a technique that could cause you to go into a murderous frenzy, even hunting down humans far outside your range? Then perhaps this room may come in handy. It is the perfect prison, built for yourself and yourself only. So long as you willingly and without influence enter here, or enter here under conditions that you have previously set while not under the influence of anything save your own will, you will be imprisoned with no way out. The exact conditions of this confinement are up to you. You might well have yourself completely imprisoned and all but comatose to ride out an infectious disease that only you are immune to. Whatever the case, this room is linked to either your warehouse or a property that you own."
411,,200,Jack the Ripper,The God of High School,Domain,"The infamous murderer of misty London, who is a surprisingly calm, reasonable and level headed spirit, though he has little patience for loud and noisy sorts. He will be quite happy to teach you how to use his powers, namely the creation of blades from any surface near you. Sprouting giant curved blades from your clothes or body, raising a field of sharp swords from the ground around you or even on your own weapons to extend their range. They can’t be created at more than a few meters away from yourself and you’ll need to use physical motions to bring them out but both these traits can be worked off over time with your new partner."
412,,200,Now We Can Fight to the Fullest,The God of High School,Domain,"You have the ability to create small, overlaid pocket dimensions around yourself. Within this pocket dimension, which looks exactly like the environment around you before you activated it, any damage or destruction dealt to the surroundings will not carry over to the real world and living beings other than yourself and your opponents cannot be harmed from within the pocket dimension. The dimension will cover a few city blocks at first but as your power grows, so too does the size of this ability. Perhaps you will one day be able to carry out entire wars within one of these bubbles, preventing the precious land from being torn up by the fighting."
413,,200,The Monster Arena,Final Fantasy X,Domain,"The Monster Arena is a replica of the same facility and landmark that can be found within the Calm Lands. However, with the technology that’s at your disposal, you’ll find that you can probably make better use of it than the Crusaders – certainly you can make more customizations to it than they can.

At its very base, the Monster Arena is a nice cave facility that makes use of Machina to store, develop and cultivate monsters. It has a dedicated set of 10 pens, each of which can contain a monster breed. That being said, just because you have the arena doesn’t mean you can magically force different species to breed. There are limits still to what Machina and Al Bhed science can do. Well, I’m not taking your own abilities into consideration here of course.

The Monster Arena will follow along with you as you travel – in what format exactly is something I’ll leave to you. Maybe you have a pocket dimension you’d like to toss it in, or maybe you’d just like it to reappear in each world as you visit it. Barring modifications, only the contents of each pen will be saved, and with only a single species per pen – well 10 species should be a fair amount, no?

How are you going to capture monsters? Well you can go about it with brute force and wrangle them into the pen – or you can use the specialized capturing weapon options. How you get those is your own problem!"
414,,200,Whether on Land or Water ,Final Fantasy X,Domain,"Training for blitzball is best done in a body of water...but sometimes, you’d be right to have reservations about diving into the ocean, and other times you might just not have any respectable body of water nearby. Don’t fret though, with such intensive training, whatever you can do on firm land, you’ll be able to reproduce within water as well. The presence of water doesn’t seem to hinder your skills, though some things may be slightly weakened – like if you’re trying to launch fireballs underwater."
415,,200,ORIGINAL CAMPAIGN,Inscryption,Domain,"Traverse the realm of the four Scrybes, visiting the woods, the cemetery, the factory, and the tower. Beast, undead, machine, and mage; gather each to your side with card packs, either by collecting them throughout the world or buying them from the Trader, who accepts the foils gathered from surplus damage on the Scale. Additionally, drop by the Mycologists’ hut to fuse two of the same card together, creating a single card with doubled abilities. (Note that in this campaign, the Mycologists are picky, and will not fuse cards that have been fused already.) Finally, defeat the four Scrybes, and challenge one to a rematch at their peak to prove your ambition.

416,,200,LESHY’S CAMPAIGN,Inscryption,Domain,"Venture through deep woods, wade across the wetlands, and finally ascend the snow line in search of Leshy’s cabin. Along the way, you may recruit wild beasts to your side, warm your creatures by the campfire to make them tougher and stronger, sacrifice animals to grant their spirit (and abilities) to another, and obtain powerful totems to grant special abilities to every creature of a certain type (reptilian, avian, canine, insectoid, or other, more esoteric sorts). Additionally, visit the Mycologists to fuse two of the same card together, combining their strength, toughness, and any modifications. But beware, for the unhinged Prospector, the taciturn Angler, and the enigmatic Trapper and Trader will surely try to bar your path.

418,,200,GRIMORA’S CAMPAIGN,Inscryption,Domain,"Descend through frozen sepulchres, crypts echoing with the bay of wolves, and flooded catacombs to track down Grimora, the necromancer at their heart. As you descend, reanimate the bones of the dead as allies, entomb your cards in sarcophagi and later unearth them in a more powerful form, disassemble several undead to graft their parts together into an enormous abomination, and use lightning machines to give your skeletons a variety of electric enhancements. Uncover the Mycologists’ Tomb for fungal remains that sprout into copies of your other undead. Remain wary at every turn, for the frozen Kaycee, the mauled Sawyer, and the dread pirate Royal will not tolerate an intruder in their final resting place.

In your travels, you may excavate powerful gemstones, recruit wayward mages cast down from the tower, perform an implanting ceremony to insert gems in your other cards, and use sacrificial rituals at hidden altars to improve the strength of your cards’ magicks. Discover the abandoned Mycologists’ temple to teach your mages Duplication Magic, replicating themselves in combat. But your actions will not go unnoticed: one by one, the Goo, the Impaled, and the Lonely will seek to stop you in your tracks, desperate for their master’s favor.

420,,200,CUSTOM CAMPAIGN,Inscryption,Domain,"Were you a fifth Scrybe? If so, you had a personal campaign, to be revealed if you ever accessed the OLD_DATA. Let’s look at what this campaign involves, with the examples we’ve used before. (Remember, these are just examples! Feel free to invent your own options as well.)

Firstly, each Scrybe has three lieutenants to assist them in battle, often in a similar theme to the Scrybe themself. A potential challenger must defeat all three before they can face the Scrybe. Leshy has the Angler, the Prospector, and the Trapper. P03 has the Inspector, the Melter, and the Dredger. Who accompanies you? For the Valkyrie, perhaps a fearsome spearfisher, a combat trainer, and a battlefield commander. For the Astronomer, perhaps a reclusive scholar, a frantic chart-maker, and a field researcher. The details are up to you. In the original game of Inscryption, one of the three was responsible for finding the OLD_DATA in the waters below, though post-jump this is less relevant.

Secondly, consider the area. The geography, the terrain. The entirety of the campaign should be themed around the Scrybe, but each area within the campaign should reflect the lieutenant that holds them. Botopia is all robotic, but within are the Dredger’s scrapyard, the Melter’s smeltery, and the Inspector’s assembly line. How is your campaign assembled? For the Valkyrie, there might be a series of haunted combat zones–the Spearfisher’s flooded, bloody wreckage, the Trainer’s ruined drill grounds, the Commander’s final battlefield. For the Astronomer, maybe a college in perpetual nighttime with danger at every skylight, with the Scholar’s library, the Chart-maker’s observatory, and the Researcher’s waterside field station.

Next, the method by which a challenger gathers cards. Battlefields might be strewn with monuments to the fallen, from which the spirits of soldiers can be recovered. Viewing ports might have constellations catalogued and waiting to be gathered. As always, the details are yours to arrange.

With cards gathered, how might one improve them? This is done differently each time, but there should be ways to both make your cards stronger, and grant them new abilities. In the Valkyrie’s world, abandoned training spaces could hone both offensive and defensive potential, while old armaments can have their spiritual imprint stripped away, granting the former wielder’s abilities to someone new. In the Astronomer’s campaign, mirrored refraction chambers can imbue your cards with strengthening light, while dusty scrolls strewn throughout the campus can be used to teach your cards unusual talents. (The Mycologists may be present, too. They show up all over.)

Lastly, the crossover mechanic. Just as Leshy drew from Grimora’s bones, so too may you draw upon another Scrybes’ efforts as a minor influence for your own. The Valkyrie might also use Grimora’s bones to make use of the death of her own, and the Astronomer might use Magnificus’s gems to filter and enhance starlight. Whatever you choose, try to integrate the choice into the rest of the campaign.

If someone else is challenging the campaign, you’re free to stand in as the final boss. If you decide not to, or if you’re the challenger, there’ll be a Scrybe version of you in that place instead.

421,,200,My Room,Fate/Grand Order,Domain,"It’s Your Room. Very specifically so. It even says ‘My Room’ on the door. Don’t get confused. The room seems to show up in any home or business that you live or work at, a personalised quarters that’s always there for you to laze off at. As long as you’re relaxing here, people don’t seem to mind you shirking your duties either. Talking to people here also has far better results than normal too. Just a few conversations is enough to have people spill their life story and some of their most personal details, not to mention how much it can speed up any bonding process between you and another being."
422,,200,Laundry of Dreams,Library of Ruina: HamHamPangPang,Domain,"People aren’t the only thing that can distort if enough people share in the same despair in the same place such as a preparatory school, or even just a laundromat in a bad neighborhood. These places could distort in nightmarish ways and trap those within in a continuing hell, or it could simply be a case of good intentions leading to bad consequences, regardless either by your actions or those of another, a piece of property in your possession is distorted to such a degree. The longer someone spends in there the more they start to understand your truth, following your will if you so desire, they usually distort in ways similar to how you have or would distort. Though if you just gently guide them instead of directly pointing them onto your path they will awaken in their own way, though this can backfire should they come to the wrong truth."
423,,200,Jumper Atelier,Library of Ruina: HamHamPangPang,Domain,"What’s a Meister without a Workshop? Well, usually a washed-up failure but sometimes they go into Fixer or Syndicate work. You don’t need to worry about having that happen though since you got a good deal on a nice piece of real estate, complete with all a budding Workshop would need to become a true Backstreets merchant of death. Coming fully supplied with any machinery and non-patented materials you could get in the City, as well as an automatic and customizable security system for any pesky Syndicates trying to get a 100% discount, the system is set up with a basic alarm by default but will seamlessly integrate any guards or traps into its network. In terms of size, it now takes up about the same space as a decently spacious apartment on the ground floor, while the basement is about twice as large for floor space and ceiling height. The Workshop will also follow you to other jumps, along with any of its employees."
424,,200,Room of Fantasy,Bibliomania,Domain,"This is a kilometer wide room that allows you to experience any fantasy you desire, it's not your room though since this is only focused on pleasure and joy so aside from games it's mainly for sexual and power fantasies allowing you to experience any you can imagine with no consequences including changing who you are physically such as allowing you to experience the events of a manga as a character in it or a new character joining along or simply screwing that person that caught your eye to no consequences, be the little girl or simply play games with your favorite youtuber. It should be noted that this room also has a time dilation since you can’t gain anything other than experiences and memories with it, as such 1 day in the room is only a minute outside the room."
425,,200,Majestic Bog,Bibliomania,Domain,"You now have the proud ownership of your own bog, now normally a bog is a muddy crap piece of land but this one is something special being over 5 kilometers in radius always having a nice cool air, bright yet soft sun, comfortable level of small wildlife and an always pleasant smell. It always has a layer of mud that only goes upto your ankles but always slides off you and your clothing spotlessly and a small amount of water layer that reaches a light bit higher than the mud. There's always a nice amount of plants, trees and space for you to do as you please, nothing is violent or vicious in the bog but that's not all. The mud has a soothing and beautifying effect and will only cling to you if you intentionally cover yourself and wipe cleanly in one sweep. A 5 minute mud bath is the equivalent of a full professional spa day and minority helps you increase your health and fitness to the point that simply laying in the mud for an hour is the equivalent of 3 hours of intensive physical training for all muscle groups and leaves you feeling refreshed to the point staying in the mud for 1 hour is the same as 4 hours of restful sleep when you are active and 8 when resting. You can also breathe the water and mud as easily as air to no ill effects and even sleep in the bog happily though you will only sleep 2 hours and feel fantastic since the bog is shockingly comfortable and will passively clean you while you're there. Lastly you can plant any form of plant in the bog and it will be added to the ecosystem safely and can’t harm you or others while in the bog, to the point Audry 2 from Little shop of horrors would be so docile and happy in the bog you could sleep in her man eating mouth and at worst have to deal with bad breath even if you pissed her off. No plants can leave the bog without you taking them and once a single species of plant is planted you will be able to simply will them to grow to their peak state and while it still takes time you can grow them simply by willing them and at a rate of 1 years optimum growth for a any plant as if in perfect conditions(so even pick plants grow in the bog)per second. This works for all plants so if you get an example of a plant that can grow more powerful over time like from cultivation worlds then this bog is a god send, though keep in mind that each instance has to grow over time and they stop growing at peak state if they can’t grow better unless you will them to grow more."
426,,200,Door to Nowhere,Jujutsu Kaisen,Domain,"In each Jump, you’ll know the location of a special door. It’ll always be somewhere unremarkable, such that no one would pay it any attention normally – in this world, for example, it may just look like any other door in an apartment building. It’s what’s on the other side that has value, though. When you or those you permit to open it, it doesn’t lead to its normal destination, but a scenic tropical beach, undisturbed by mankind. From the pristine sands to the waves lazily lapping upon the shore, it’s an idyllic, peaceful place, the perfect location to relax.

This isn’t an ordinary beach, though: in fact, it’s none other than a Domain belonging to a cephalopodic cursed spirit, who seems content to just lazily drift about in the sea. For some reason, they’re surprisingly obedient to you, adjusting the conditions within to your liking. They’re not much of a fighter – in fact, they don’t seem to have any combat ability at all – and if they’re killed the Domain will disappear. Given that they (and by extension, you) can freely control who’s allowed to enter or not, fortunately that shouldn’t be much of an issue though."
427,,200,Broom,Jujutsu Kaisen,Domain,"This unassuming-looking cursed tool takes the form of a traditional broom, with a straw head and a wooden shaft, which is slightly curved up towards the end. By making physical contact with it, the broom will respond to your cursed energy and move according to your wishes, to the point that it can be used to fly through the air with great agility, weaving effortlessly between trees while moving far faster than a man could run. Its strong enough to carry you and anything you might have on you should you decide to ride it."
428,,200,Boogie Woogie,Jujutsu Kaisen,Domain,"Boogie Woogie allows the user to swap the location of any two things within range when they clap their hands, so long as they have cursed energy. Naturally, as almost all humans and all cursed spirits possess cursed energy, swapping their positions is the most common usage, with even those who are unwilling unable to resist this. You can use this to trade places with your opponent to disorient them or cause them to get hit by their own attacks, swap places with your allies to overwhelm your foes with unpredictable combination attacks, and many more uses besides. It’s not just people you can swap, though – inanimate objects with sufficient cursed energy, such as cursed tools, are even valid targets for this, opening up even more avenues of attack."
429,,200,Observatory,Final Fantasy VII,Domain,"Buganhagen isn't the only enthusiast for the stars, I see. This is a simple building that allows you to view a detailed holographic view of the local solar system, as well as any ongoing space phenomena in the surrounding area. It's also a surprisingly secure place to store items of power or importance. You know, if you wanted to, for whatever reason."
430,,200,Bandle’s Garden,Legends of Runeterra,Domain,"Bandle City is situated in a pocket dimension somewhere in the Spirit World, and the flora around here can be... curious. Especially the mushrooms. Now, you have a little garden attached to your Warehouse where you can grow plants unique to the City."
431,,200,Scout,Legends of Runeterra,Domain,"You’re a master of recon and deep strikes. In combat, you’re extremely fast, able to act twice while others just act once. That’s an incredible advantage, but doesn’t actually make you any tougher, so be careful."
432,,200,Quick Attack,Legends of Runeterra,Domain,"You’re speed. Or at least that’s what everyone thinks about you. Simply put, you will always strike before your opponent, either through sheer speed, some predictive ability, or some magical bullshit. This will let you strike at least once before your opponent has the time to react. Use this opportunity well."
433,,200,ServanFes 20XX,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Domain,"ServanFes shall never die, not as long as strange aeons keep bringing it back every year. The supposedly destroyed Luluhawa Singularity has been re-opened by the most charming Servant to ever live. BB’s sent you an all access pass to come visit the combined Hawaiian resort islands whenever you like, never more than an hours trip away. Though Summer BB still rules the Singularity, she’s gotten awfully laid back and doesn’t really mind everyone just having fun as long as they like now. You can even find her eldritch benefactor here and there, enjoying a holiday from the usual struggles of an Outer God. 

Many Servants and other characters from both Servant Universe and the Greater History of Man can be found on holiday here, in appealing Beach outfits and focused on having fun, putting aside any grudges they might normally have. There’s some sort of fuss each year with new alternate universes appearing, bizarre monsters threatening everyone and eldritch beings causing trouble. Weirdly, these incidents always happen when ServanFes starts up, the yearly Doujin making competition. Could there be a connection?"
434,,200,My First Rocketship,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Domain,"The old garage, back where you put together your first spaceship. It might look like just an ordinary house-attached garage, and it is, but it’s also a top class spaceship workshop. Filled with all the cutting edge tools needed to fabricate, refine and attach the parts and technology you need to fly up in the stars. Park a ship nearby and get to work, especially with the heap of design plans for warp drives, Artorium generators and other useful devices found inside. The house next door is also yours, a comfy family home, and there’s even a secret basement beneath the garage with two strange pods. Empty now but apparently useful for keeping Divine beings in hibernation. Not that you’d ever need to do that. "
435,,200,Workshop Of The Gods ,God Of War (2018),Domain,"No matter where Brok and Sindri are in the nine realms, they always have their forge and tools on hand. Similarly, you gain a ‘workshop’ that can be taken anywhere. It is not a physical item but rather a semi-sentient sub-realm so delicately superimposed with the environment immediately around you that it is all but undetectable. The ‘workshop’ doesn’t make you better at your craft nor does it improve the quality of what you create, but you may choose to incorporate any number of tools into this space with a few minutes of focus. Be aware that integrating any tool into the ‘workshop’ is permanent, and once bound the tool can never leave its boundaries. Accessing any tool in your ‘workshop’ is done by willing them to instantly materialize/dematerialize in any part of your current ‘workshop’ or you may temporarily overlay your chosen tool with another available object. You can overlay a sheet of parchment with the face of an anvil and the feathers of a quill with the head of a hammer and have every swing of your quill be with a different hammer in your ‘workshop’. For the more destructively minded souls, the ‘workshop’ serves a dual function as an armory for weapons and armor, with all the benefits and restrictions that apply to any other tool in your ‘workshop’. However, there is a hard distinction between the purpose of the armory and the workshop. No tool meant for creation may be put to destructive ends and no tool meant for destruction can be used to create."
436,,200,Natural Retreat,God Of War (2018),Domain,"Deep in the woods, where few dare to enter, lies a beautiful clearing with a tree atop a small hill at the center. Of course this hill is in truth a giant turtle and there is a small house built under, yet attached to the turtle. The house itself is a simple one. Possessing a basic kitchen, a work space, a section off bedroom, and a large living room. Perhaps the most unique feature of the house itself is that the window opposite the front door can show images of other realms and nearby dimensions. As long as they are not warded against such viewing of course. Other than that the clearing itself cannot be found unless you lead others to it, and it will automatically be placed in a forest (or some equivalent) a fair distance from civilization in any new jump unless you will it otherwise."
437,,200,Skíðblaðnir,God Of War (2018),Domain,"The flying longboat of Fryer, is now yours to command. This longboat takes the form of an ethereal blue longboat that seems to row through the air and water alike. The first benefit to this boat is that it is able to fold like a piece of paper to the point where you are able to hold it in your hand and easily carry it with you. The second is that the boat itself cannot be tracked by any means (be they technological or magical) other than by the physical senses. Furthermore if looked at from under the boat, nothing would appear to be there. The boat itself is able to move at roughly 317.6mph (551.1 km/h)."
438,,200,Palatial Residence,Thailand Mythology and Folklore,Domain,"Spirits are all over the world, and likewise they house themselves in all kinds of environments. You’ve come to own a peculiar abode. Whether or not you’re normally able to live underwater, this particular cave has some magic in it that lets you swim into and out of it without too much issue, although straying too far from it is ill advised if you can’t breathe underwater already. The inside of the cave is fully furnished and actually quite luxurious. The furniture and decorations are made of special materials that don’t degrade with simple contact with water, such as stone, jade, marble, and petrified coral reef. Actually stocking it with food is up to you, but given the location it’ll be quite safe from most threats. In future worlds, you can choose where to insert it into the world, or simply have a door in your warehouse leading into it. It’s quite a comfortable home, take good care of it."
439,,200,Occult Building,DxD Universe,Domain,"A fairly big building considering it's two stores tall, if you stay in this building there are lower chances of being found by people with supernatural powers."
440,,200,Church        ,DxD Universe,Domain,"A small church, it looks completely normal but for demonic beings being close to this church will cause severe headaches."
441,,200,Territory,Fate/Apocrypha V1.4,Domain,"You own...a place. Not a country, but more on the scale of a large town or village, which could be a castle, empty fields, a cave network, a small island, whatever – it’s land, belonging to you, and you can do with it what you like regardless of local planning regulations. Feel free to improve it, it will retain upgrades and any structures you establish. Villages and the like will have new NPC replacements for any population or staff."
442,,200,Neat Ride,Fate/Apocrypha V1.4,Domain,"You have a car! One that can be driven rather fast despite looking a little old and busted, especially by anyone with a Riding skill. Surprisingly durable, lots of storage space for any tools, and good on all terrain even when being driven by a complete maniac, and either the fuel gauge is broken, or it genuinely doesn’t need any fuel. You can import any other vehicle into this as an alt-form or to gain the properties. You’ll have it nearby whenever you need it, and if destroyed it will be back up and running within a minute."
443,,200,Interdimensional Rift ,Final Fantasy V,Domain,"A rift between planes, as one who has an affinity for the Void, you can safely use this. With it, you can precisely travel between locations instantly, as long as you have been there at least once before. Powerful monsters also exist in this Rift, making it dangerous for anyone who would choose to follow you into the Rift."
444,,200,Meteor ,Final Fantasy V,Domain,"While travel can be difficult for far-reaching (or potentially impossible) locations, not so much for you with this. This particular meteor functions both as a direct space flight, as well as able to travel to alternate worlds, provided they exist on the same plane. You will crash your meteor there each time you go, however."
445,,200,-Geomancer-,Final Fantasy V,Domain,"A type of spiritualist in tune with the earth. Purchasing the job will give you access to Geomancy, while Mastery will let you ‘see’ with your feet, sensing all land-based traps, and granting immunity to all floor hazards, including being able to walk upon lava without penalty.

Note: Can be Shared with Others at Normal or Mastery Level"
446,,200,A Forge,The Song of the Nibelungs,Domain,"You gain a big forge and a shop. The bellows work themselves and always keep a steady perfect temperature. Work done and items crafted at this forge will be more efficient and finished faster than normally. You will also never run out of metal ore, wood and coal as long as you use it in your work."
447,,200,Retreat ,Asura’s Wrath,Domain,"You have access to an idyllic property somewhere in the world, which follows you from jump to jump. There is a restorative hot­spring, and it is always stocked with enough food and refreshment to sate even a demigod’s thirst for relaxation. In addition to these creature comforts, it also can serve as a fortified bunker in the case of trouble."
448,,200,Little Shop of Horrors,Witch on the Holy Night,Domain,"Not every mage can afford to have a first class workshop when they’re on the move and trying to exact revenge on their dim- witted devil of a little sister. You’re not just every mage. This roughly schoolhouse-sized building has all the reagents and tools needed to create a plethora of Mystic Codes or at a stretch, a greater ritual. Suited for your style of Magecraft, if you have one. While the magical energy within is bent to your will and everything is both clearly marked as well as neatly sorted, it would take a skilled crafter of Mystic Codes to make the best use of it. One who could, would doubtless be able to unleash hordes of automatons or similar forces. Restocked weekly by what a very gloomy automaton designed to look like Aoko Aozaki, if she was naked and sometimes crawled around like a spider."
449,,200,Queen of the Fortress        ,Witch on the Holy Night,Domain,"The young lady of the house is neither late nor early. She arrives exactly when she intends to. Yours is a strategic mind, equally at home with grasping the schemes of enemies and expertly countering in the heat of battle as it is setting traps and laying protections. Even without magecraft, you have an intuitive grasp for the lay of any land you spend a considerable amount of time in. Furthermore, even if you have no other gifts for magecraft some intuitive gift for the concept makes magic similar to Bounded Fields (barriers of magical energy meant to protect something within, work a transformation on something without and/or both) or anything related to manipulating leylines particular efficient for you. Rank amateurs spend days getting done what you can accomplish in one."
450,,200,Big J Files,HighSchool DxD,Domain,"An orphanage mixed with a supremely unethical laboratory dedicated to kidnap kids and ran experiments to crystalize ill-defined qualities or affinities for stuff to be used either as materials, or as a means to imbue a given quality on someone. While this defaults to users of holy swords, you can select another kind of goal. While running experiments on kids to create artificial warriors is a bit frowned upon, the results will soon speak for themselves."
451,,200,Side Parade ,HighSchool DxD,Domain,"A deed that reflects the territory you own in the underworld or another ‘supernatural’ location of your choice. Won after a very heated night in the casino, so you don’t have to pay anything for it, at the expense that it doesn’t have much on it unless you work to make it a worthwhile place. It’s not larger than a city or an island, but has the type of weather of your choice and it’s a relatively good plot of land. After the jump ends it will become an extradimensional territory you can access at will."
452,,200,Chrome Shelled Regios,HighSchool DxD,Domain,"Rating Games are kind of a big thing in Devil’s society, and while you might not be a devil or live in a society that encourages live fighting with possibility of death, the truth is that most pantheons have something similar to it. Maybe a leftover from the multiple wars they had and the number of skills and powers around. This is an arena perfected for Rating Games and similar ‘sports’. It basically exists in its own pocket dimension, can withstand any amount of damage without breaking apart, and comes with an in-built amount of nigh-infinite options to customize it."
453,,200,Burning Crossroads,HighSchool DxD,Domain,"Your nature is still somewhat alien to this world and as such, easily connected to planes beyond the boundary, passing the Dimensional Gap and wandering into unknown worlds. In practice this means that you could earn the attention of some godly beings from other worlds, or even call them to assist you if you have enough power (and favor with them). Under the right conditions, this could mean an extra option, a way to dominate any battlefield and defeat any enemies just by conjuring superior powers on your side. Sadly, while you’re able to reach beyond the confines of the local universe, nothing ensures that you will meet or attract benevolent entities."
454,,200,Night In Csjete B,Fate/Csjete Halloween Trilogy,Domain,"A copy of Csjete Castle, Pyramid and Japanese Manor on top optional, as are massive speakers built into the front. For what it's worth Elizabeth would rather remove the manor and pyramid and add more speakers."
455,,200,Will to Live,God of War,Domain,"You seem to match Kratos in at least one area, being that insufferable tendency to not stay dead. Again and again you will rise from the grave, should you be up to the task. Upon death, you will enter a local afterlife, but not one many would expect. See, this realm of the dead has transformed itself into a trying gauntlet for you to break out of, filled with traps, enemies, and puzzles for you to overcome before being allowed to return to the land of the living. Should you succeed, you will return to life, no strings attached. Fail before your in-Jump time is over, or meet a second death, then your Jumpchains will end there."
456,,200,Wings of Icarus,God of War,Domain,"Crafted from bee wax and bird feathers, these wings were crafted by Daedalus for his son, in order to help them escape their imprisonment by King Minos. They are to be attached to the back, and can be freely moved as if they were a part of you, offering you the ability to glide through the air, as well as offering very limited flight."
457,,200,Field of Demeter,God of War,Domain,"The goddess of the harvest, her role was taken over by Hera after the death of her precious Persephone, yet this field stands as a monument to her divine role of the past. Measuring around one hundred acres, it is capable of greatly accelerating the growth of any plant, such that an olive would go from seed to full grown tree overnight, as well as holding them in stasis until harvested or removed. Additionally, any magical plants growing here are twice as potent as before."
458,,200,You And This Army,Fate/Apocrypha,Domain,"One of the most important things to a Magus is their workshop. After all, if they don’t have a place to work their craft, they can hardly be called a Magus at all. What you have here is an incredibly high-class workshop fit to whatever type of magecraft you specialize in, and with the potential to operate on a large scale. An alchemist might have a homunculus factory, while a kabbalist might have a golem manufacturing facility. It also comes included with plenty of high quality tools to work with. The only thing you’ll really need now is resources to conduct experimentation. Whatever this workshop might be, you could certainly produce small armies of troops here."
459,,200,Sliding Shadows,Hades,Domain,"While some beings of the void are rather sedentary in nature, others find themselves needing to cross long distances quickly to fulfil their duties. Thanatos, God of Death,makes frequent use of such a talent endingmortallives.Now you too will be able to travel through the nothingness that spawned you, or your mother, to reappear at another point known to you. The action takes but a thought to perform but needs a short moment between each usage. Disappearing into a puff of smoke is the traditional appearance, though you may choose something similar to better suit you."
460,,200,Mythril Mine,Final Fantasy II,Domain,"A full mythril mine that you have the ownership deed for. The mine follows you from jump to jump, and can become a different ore (or combination of ores) of your choice at the start of each jump, as long as you have some of it on-hand when the jump starts."
461,,200,Mansion,Hellblazer,Domain,"A huge, magical mansion. Secure and luxurious. Comes with a limo and a manservant. May be located in hell, dream, or faerie, if you’d prefer."
462,,200,Quantum,20 Minutes Till Dawn,Domain,"A modification developed by a strange Astrologian that decided to study 'that which is too small to see' before being driven mad with what they discovered. Each bolt is imbued with a strange uncertainty making it so that whenever you are not certain of its position while its flight hasn't come to an end, its position will randomly shift to somewhere in your vicinity, but keep its velocity and direction. It's never struck its own user before, but how certain can you be that it isn't purely by chance?

Requires Crossbow to Purchase"
463,,200,Feet of Air,Final Fantasy I,Domain,"Quick, nimble, and deadly as the wind. That’s what you’ve become. Your movements are incredibly quick and swift, able to move faster than the untrained eye can follow. In addition to being a bit faster, you’re able to leap great distances and run along flat surfaces as though you were the wind itself, your body much lighter for the purposes of jumps and acrobatics."
464,,200,Magic Carpet,Disney’s Aladdin,Domain,"A carpet of the finest quality, with embroidery, decorations and tassels making it look extra pretty. It’s pretty big,enough for eight people to sit comfortably. The thing about it is, it flies.

And it flies really, reallyfast. As in, it could take you to Beijing from Baghdad in a matter of hours, 6 at most. While flying, those seated are shielded from all environmental effects. Sapience optional."
465,,200,Inventory,Out of Context: Gamer System Supplement,Domain,"This system gains access to an anchored pocket dimension that travels with you, it has a maximum weight limit of 200 pounds and a total internal size of 45 inches cubed.

To access this inventory you must pick up the item, open a hole to the inventory and place the item within, if the item exceeds the parameters of the inventory it will be dropped out when the inventory is closed.

No multicellular living entities are able to be stored within the inventory and anything stored within can be sorted and organized while it is frozen in time."
466,,200,Personal Abode ,Out of Context: Disney Princess Supplement,Domain,"You gain a home fit for a princess, one that is specifically suited to your perks, themes and origins allowing it to appear as a giant sand castle, Ice tower, Elizabethan manor, eastern palace or even an underwater grotto."
467,,200,Glintstone Mine ,Elden Ring - Liurnia of the Lakes,Domain,"Should you wish to never part from the arcane crystals that can be found here, then you can take this option. A wealthy mine that is bursting to the seams with glintstone, do be careful when it comes to extracting, as they have been known to corrupt those who work with it unprotected. It will replenish each month."
468,,200,The Cleansing Flames of Hell,Godbound,Domain,"And for your next available, you have...a slice of Hell? Good heavens. An entire circle of Hell is now yours, bound to you by a shrine that with a modicum of divine effort may be used to travel to this realm of eternal torment and spiritual imprisonment, from which there is little hope of escape. Truly, there is little to do here save torture any souls you have a significant divine or mystical authority over as they burn in corrosive agony-or otherwise can wrest here with any relevant powers over life and death you have.

But it need not be so. There is a kind of metaphysical dial in this Hell-a spell or ritual you can perform, that can revert it back into the purification and transcendence that was once Hell’s chief purpose. This would also permit the Hell to release souls back into the world, to be reborn or move onto a final resting place depending on the world they hail from-or perhaps some other afterlife system if you own any. There may be other applications for those of a mystically studious bent, who are willing to study Hell’s fires and see what they can be used to forge and power, or how to summon them into other planes. At least one invocation of theurgy seems to bore a small hole into Hell to unleash hellfire on one’s foes, after all."
469,,200,Spirit Training Centre        ,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Domain,"This facility, either connected to your Warehouse, or located near your starting location, is designed to allow you to train your Spirits. The facility is self-sufficient, and all you have to worry about is bringing the Spirits in.

The facility is comprised of a special gym, and 15 special dojos. Spirits left in the gym slowly grow in power, until they reach their full potential. You cannot have more than 4 Spirits in the gym at any one time.

By taking a Spirit into one of the dojos, you can alter their style. What this means is you are changing how they influence those they link up with or control. For example, the Land Style increases the power the Spirit can give out on the ground, and improves the movement speed of those it is linked to or controlling. As a consequence, the Spirit can give out less power in the air, and the jumping ability of the linked or controlled party is reduced. 14 of these dojos will change the Spirit to a different style. The 15th dojo will instead ‘reset’ the Spirit, removing any style they may have. A Spirit may only have a single style at a time. The dojos work near-instantly, so changing styles in preparation for an upcoming fight is a snap.

Should these still not be enough for you, the facility will also sell as many candies as you need, provided you have the money. They will accept any form of currency. The candies can be fed to your Spirits to power them up quickly. 

Post-jump, the facility is connected to your Warehouse, should it not already be so."
470,,200,Spirit Summoning and Dismissal Centre,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Domain,"This facility, either connected to your Warehouse, or located near your starting location, is designed to allow you to summon new Spirits or dismiss old ones. The facility is self-sufficient, and all you have to worry about is bringing the Spirits in.

Dismissing a Spirit allows you to send it back to its original world, restoring it to its true form in the process. You will have no way of interacting with dismissed Spirits for the rest of your chain. In return for giving up an ally, you acquire a Spirit Core. These can be used to power up Spirits, and have a use in the other part of this facility. Should you dismiss a Spirit that is an extra copy (such as a Spirit you have individually purchased, one acquired via the Spirit Board item, or one created in the other part of this facility), you may decide whether they arrive in some vague “good place” or “heaven” (which you cannot reach during your chain), or simply cease to exist, whichever suits you. You and your companions may never be dismissed, under any circumstances.

By paying a nominal fee, you may combine 2 to 7 Spirit Cores, creating a brand-new Spirit. Any Spirit created in this manner is absolutely loyal to you, and will join you in your journey as a follower. All recipes demonstrated in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate work as intended, but there are additionally all sorts of unknown Spirits you may also create. Generally speaking, the more Spirit Cores, and the higher the rarity of Spirit Cores you used, the more powerful the result. A lot of recipes are also fairly intuitive, for example two Spirit Cores of characters that canonically fuse together are very likely to result in a Spirit of the fused character. 

Post-jump, the facility is connected to your Warehouse, should it not already be so."
471,,200,Spirit Exploration Centre,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Domain,"This facility, either connected to your Warehouse, or located near your starting location, is designed to allow your Spirits to go on an adventure and have some fun. The facility is self-sufficient, and all you have to worry about is bringing the Spirits in. 

To start with the centre has 3 different time sinks, a 2-hour time sink, a 6-hour time sink, and a 10-hour time sink. Each time sink can hold up to 4 Spirits at a time.

Spirits left in these time sinks will experience a self-contained adventure, which will always be enjoyable, and which will also allow them to bond with the other Spirits. As a reward for finishing the adventure, you will be given a small amount of money proportional to the length of the time sink. Rarely, you may also be rewarded with minor items found in Super Smash Bros, such as candies which can be used to power up your Spirits.

In each future jump, the centre gains a new set of three time sinks, with new adventures related to the new setting. The minor items rewarded from these will be from that setting, and any money given out will be in that setting’s currency.

In general, the amount of money received is roughly equivalent to a menial job working the same number of hours as the length of the time sink. Not a lot, but better than nothing.

Please don’t forget to take the Spirits out when they have finished. 

Post-jump, the facility is connected to your Warehouse, should it not already be so."
472,,200,Pocket        ,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Domain,"You have a pocket space you may quickly store and retrieve items from. It is only capable of holding a single item at a time. Pocketed items retain any momentum they had upon retrieval, allowing you to “catch” and fire back projectiles sent at you with skilful use of this power. Should you already possess a pocket dimension or personal inventory power, or acquire another in the future, you can choose to combine these powers. How this works specifically is up to you, but you must commit to this result until such a time as you gain another similar power, at which point you may choose again."
473,,200,Flying Car,Wizarding World,Domain,"While a great portion of pure-bloods hold tremendous disdain over the likes of Muggles and their technology, there is one notable exception to their aversion. Cars. There have been many an occasion of a pure-blood claiming to have never even touched a Muggle artifact and yet upon further investigation, they were found to be in possession of a magically modified Rolls Royce. And now, so do you.

The car’s model is up to you, but you can rest assured that your car is quite the piece. At its base, the car is already fast enough to fly from London to Hogwarts in less than 8 hours but it’s also been enchanted with an Extension Charm, enough that you can already fit in an entire family of eight with room to spare. It’s also durable enough that you can slam it full force into a tree and it’ll still be drivable. But most importantly, the car is very receptive to new modifications, whether magical or mundane. Surely you could take advantage of that, right?"
474,,200,Floo Flame Network,Wizarding World,Domain,"Ah, Floo powder. What would wizards do without it? First invented by one Ignatia Wildsmith in the 13th century, Floo powder is what allows the Floo Network to work. Through the Floo Network, instantaneous transportation across the entire world becomes possible for just about everyone, even for those who have not yet learned the dangerous art of Apparition. With this, the Floo Network shall follow you wherever you go.

First, you are now in possession of the recipe for Floo powder, a secret that has been kept safe for centuries. Not only that, but you also have a small box of the stuff, one that will never run out, no matter how much you take from it. Following that, every property of yours will now be connected to each other through a Floo Network, letting you travel across them with just a scoop of powder.

But more importantly, what you have now are the instructions to create your very own Floo Network. With this, you have the choice of adding the new locations to your already existing network or creating a new one separate from those before it. You won’t even need a fireplace. The uses of this should be rather obvious, don’t you think so?"
475,,200,A Garden of Trees,Wizarding World,Domain,"From Devil’s Snare to the Whomping Willow and more, there are no shortage of horrific and wondrous examples of flora within the Wizarding World. So why not bring them along with you across your lengthy journey. You now have a door in your Warehouse that leads to an endless greenhouse. For now, this greenhouse is unused but with the chest right by the door, you can change that.

The chest contains seeds, an endless amount of them. And you have seeds for each and every type of plantlife to be found in this world. And do not forget to look beyond the magical. Mundane they may be, wonders can be made from even the simplest of materials.

To help you with your greenhouse, the seeds are fortunately placed within their own individual seed packets and if you have a specific seed you’re looking, said seed packets will front and center whenever you open up the chest."
476,,200,Thief’s Downfall,Wizarding World,Domain,"Do you truly believe simple shops to hold the monopoly when it comes to security? If you want to see the pinnacle of magical security, you would find such things in Gringotts, the only wizarding bank in Great Britain and certainly one of the most secure places in the world. Case in point, the Thief’s Downfall, a special waterfall that washes away almost every form of temporary magical enchantment and concealment.

For you, the Thief’s Downfall makes its home within your Warehouse as a wondrous and beautiful waterfall. One situated entirely above the entrance. With but a thought, you can make water within it flow and let its mystical properties come to light. Against intruders, this waterfall will automatically activate the moment they enter, ensuring that they’ll be mostly unprotected if they’re the wizardly sort. If you need to bring the water’s enchantments outside, simply bring a bucket or some other sort of container and fill it up."
477,,200,Battle Arena,Wizarding World,Domain,"It is often said that there is no better teacher than experience. However, gaining that experience can be a trifling task, especially when you consider that one will often need to risk life and limb in such things. Thankfully, this marvel of magic within your Warehouse can help you get the experience you need. Resembling a rather ornate statue with a large base, simply walk through to said base and you’ll find yourself transported into some sort of arena. In here, you can fight to your heart’s content. Face off against your old foes in any combination or setting you desire. And there is no need to worry about death here. If you die here, you’ll simply be punted out off the arena and back into the real world, your mind filled with newfound experience."
478,,200,Warehouse of Requirement ,Wizarding World,Domain,"Otherwise known as the Come and Go Room by the house-elves of Hogwarts, the Room of Requirement is a very wonderful piece of magic. Its origins are shrouded by mystery and even amongst Hogwarts many secrets, it remains the most puzzling of them all. And it is hard to puzzle out when you consider the Room’s Unplottable nature and its tendency to only appear to people of great need. But do you not have great needs of your own? If so, this is perfect for you.

With this, your Warehouse has been upgraded to possess the same enchantments of the Room of Requirement. At a baseline, your Warehouse will shift and move according to your desires, ensuring that you’ll always have what you want at arm’s reach. Not only that, but you’ll be able to manipulate your Warehouse well enough to truly make it your own. Custom lighting, wings and so very much more."
479,,200,Apparition,Wizarding World,Domain,"Apparition is an advanced art of magic but one that is nonetheless very useful despite how difficult it might be. With it, a wizard can get to practically anywhere, instantly transporting themselves from one place to another. To learn it, one must come to master the three D’s. Destination, Determination, Deliberation! And you have done so indeed, becoming capable of Apparating with the utmost precision and at only a moment’s notice.

Right now, so long as you have a clear image of where you’re going, and nothing is blocking you, you can Apparate anywhere within a few hundred miles or so. And you’ve mastered Apparition to such an extent that you won’t need to worry about making a mistake either. That is a very good thing given how... severe the consequences of a failed Apparition can be."
480,,200,A Private Garden,Disney’s Cinderella,Domain,"A quiet corner of the world where you can unwind and relax, full of greenery and fragrant flowers. A small number of harmless woodland creatures who live here and will be willing to follow your directions. You can summon your charges (if you have them) to it with a wave of your hand, and similarly travel to and from it yourself. It is cut off from the rest of the world, much like a personal dimension."
481,,200,A Pumpkin Carriage ,Disney’s Cinderella,Domain,"This is a lavish carriage that can disguise itself depending on where you are and how you need to hide. If you’re out in the countryside it might choose to become a pumpkin or pumpkin patch. On a city street it might become a mural on a wall, or a statue. Any passengers will be safe inside and can exit the carriage safely even in its disguised mode. It can outrun a horde of guards on horseback and comes with a driver, footman, ample trunk space, and four strong, gorgeous horses to pull it. In future jumps you may choose to have it transform into a more appropriate - but similarly fancy - form, such as a limousine. It smells of pumpkin spice on the inside."
482,,200,Magic Key,Gummi Bears,Domain,This can form a temporary door in mid air that connects to a house or your warehouse (you can change the destination). Basically one “end” of this is fixed to a real door while the other end can be magically created anywhere you can get a visual representation of. This allows you to effectively teleport via a doorway gate. This doesn’t seem to have any range limits so feel free to scry and door-teleport to your destinations across the world with ease.
483,,200,A Forest Where Wildflowers Grow,Disney’s Snow White,Domain,"This may seem like an innocent patch of trees, but for the unprepared it is a nightmare-filled labyrinth. When you need to put some distance between you and your pursuers this forest will spring up, trapping them within while you escape. It will disappear in an hour and leave no permanent damage."
484,,200,Graveyard,Wizard 101,Domain,"A suitably grim locale for Necromantic pursuits, perpetually covered by fog banks in even the sunniest weather. Perfect for emergency exhumation, though the overall yard is somewhat small, you’ll only have about 15 bodies at hand at a time, though the plots seem to refill every new moon somehow. Best not to question it."
485,,200,King of the Castle,Wizard 101,Domain,"Ice, by its nature, doesn’t move very fast. But where Ice is most concentrated is where it may bring all its power to bear. Now, if you are present and working your magic in the same place over and over again, you may consecrate it, make of it a focus to empower all your magic. All magic done within the bounds of this area is magnified threefold. At the start, you may consecrate an area roughly the width of a dueling circle, but with time you may be able to empower an entire manse. After working any magic in this area, however, if you leave your magic will be three times weaker for a week, as your power must drag itself away from the freezing cold of the ‘castle’. If you want to sidestep this, I recommend you find a way to carry your base with you, as the Giants once did."
486,,200,Minor Teleport,Wizard 101,Domain,"You can designate one private home teleport location and one common area teleport location, and may freely teleport between such locations from anywhere in the same dimension. Additionally, you can place one teleport marker where you are and return to it at any time from somewhere else. Placing a new mark overrides the old mark."
487,,200,Wheels,The Owl House,Domain,"Not everyone has a palisman staff to fly around on. Some travel using more mundane methods. This purchase grants you a “mundane” vehicle fueled by the classic Boiling Isles combination of magic and industry. 

For 200cp, this would be a vehicle equivalent to Steve’s motorcycle and sidecar; plenty of seats and speed for a bit of day driving, but not much beyond that."
488,,200,Flying carpet,Disney Princess,Domain,"Capable of seating four individuals and flying at 50 miles an hour, comes with tassels at the corners for steering."
489,,200,Enchanted Carriage,Beauty and the Beast,Domain,"This carriage has been enchanted by a magic spell, allowing it to travel under its own power, without the need for horses.

Your carriage is able to understand your commands, and will follow them to the best of its ability, but will ignore the commands of others unless you specifically tell it otherwise.

Should your carriage be lost or destroyed, a replacement will appear in a location controlled by you after 24 hours."
490,,200,Scriptures of Power,Hellsing,Domain,"The good book has more uses than just bolstering the spirits of the faithful. This sealed tome has holy power in it, the pages within flying out on your command to bind and ward and protect. With seemingly thousands of pages stored, you can place them to create holy wards and boundaries that prevent monsters, demons and sinners from crossing or harming those beyond. A powerful enough being can break through, provided they have the time to stop and destroy the wards. With a bit of practice, further uses can be discovered. Short range teleportation by surrounding yourself in the pages or even temporary weakening of monsters by sealing them in a prison of paper wrapped around their bodies."
491,,200,The Lamplighter’s Bike ,Marry Poppins Returns,Domain,"Although I’m certain you’ve encountered more than your fair share of bicycles in the past, this one is sure to leave an impression. Not only is it finely crafted and guaranteed to last a lifetime without repair, this dark gray bicycle can be reduced to the size and weight of a handkerchief when not in use, allowing it to be unobtrusively stored until it is needed. Of course, you can switch the between the two forms with a simple gesture, and the bike transforms almost instantly, so feel free to utilize your new, size-changing mode of transportation however you’d like!"
492,,200,"Dimensional Scissors, Sword, Chainsaw, or other cutting implement ",Star vs the Forces of Evil,Domain,"In this jump, they let you move between the dimensions of this universe by shearing dimensional holes that connect them. In other jumps, they let you swap dimensions within that jump. No, you can’t move between jumps with these. You can use these to go anywhere within a jump; just be careful of where you go to. (Like, for example, the Warp.) Heckapoo might not remember you getting these, and might be ornery about them if she thinks you haven’t earned them; you may have to spend 16 years 8 minutes to earn her assent to your carrying them."
493,,200,Monster Hunter Gear,Wizards of Waverly Place,Domain,"You are in possession of any item a monster hunter trainee might need. This includes a monster location device that helps detect monsters, and their threat level. A costume to help you look cool while hunting monsters, and containment devices to detain captured monsters. It seems to be missing any weaponry monster hunters regularly used, that may be due to you not being a full fledged monster hunter quite yet."
494,,200,Magic Necklace,Wizards of Waverly Place,Domain,"You are now in possession of a special necklace. This necklace is heart shaped, and it glows red when the wearer is in love with the person who put it on him or her. Great if you want to see your werewolf boyfriend is still in love with his Vampire Ex who happens to be your brother's current girlfriend."
495,,200,Magic Canceling Hat ,Wizards of Waverly Place,Domain,"A goofy looking hat that allows young Wizards to control their magic while their powers settle. It can also be used to suppress the magic of Wizards, and other magical beings, including magic of those from other worlds, in different jumps."
496,,200,Training Wand        ,Wizards of Waverly Place,Domain,"This is a training wand for wizards whose powers are not quite set. It is capable of single spell, however, even non Wizards can use it. The spell is by default, open things (even concepts such as hearts), but if you wish, the wand can come pre-enchanted with any single spell of your choice."
497,,200,Plastic Balls,Wizards of Waverly Place,Domain,"You are in possession of Plastic Balls, their exact number is unclear, but you have enough of them to fill the entirety of WizTech. The Magic in this world reacts uniquely with plastic, in that it is unable to affect it at all, and even allows it to block spells of the most powerful Wizard to ever live. In future jumps, these Plastic Balls can be used to effect Magic in a similar fashion."
498,,200,Click Here! ,WRECK-IT RALPH,Domain,"The internet is a globe-spanning network, so it can take a while to get anywhere if you are hoofing it. Now, you don’t have to. Over short distances, you can sink into the ground and turn into a quick streak of light, allowing you to quickly navigate through structures the size of a skyscraper. For longer-distance travel, if you have a picture of a location or person, or something else connected to them, such as an advertisement for them, you can tap on the object to summon a glowing car to take you to your destination, wherever it may be. There will be some travel time involved, but it will be incredibly fast, even over planetary distances."
499,,200,Fruit and Vegetable Carriage,Shrek,Domain,You have a small palm sized precious metal statue of your favorite fruit or vegetable. When tossed it will transform into an elegant carriage shaped like that fruit or vegetable and it is pulled by tireless living metal horses.
500,,200,Run I Enjoy the Chase,Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,Domain,"After Puss changes for the better Death becomes irritated, claiming that he spent too long playing with his food. While the chase may be fun it is still important to not let your target escape. You will find that any target you pursue will be incapable of escaping you. This includes treasures, individuals, and anything else that can be classified as a target. You will always catch up to them simply bypassing any defenses meant to stop you. This could be metaphorically as you slip by guards or literally walking through barriers. Regardless the only way a target you seek will ever escape is if you willingly allow them to leave."
501,,200,Unlimited Leche ,Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,Domain,"Leche or milk for those that don’t understand Spanish is a wonderful beverage particularly for Puss in Boots. Admittedly though there are some other beverages that shouldn’t be ignored. This item grants you a cellar filled containing cask with an unlimited amount of leche stored within. You may however add additional cask by bringing various liquids/beverages down to the cellar. Doing so will create a new cask with the new liquid. Lastly, the cellar will keep everything stored within in perfect condition if you want to stock up for a party."
502,,200,Sleigh,The Nightmare Before Christmas,Domain,A sleigh that flies of it’s own volition and does so at impossible speeds when delivering presents and breaks the sound barrier under normal conditions. Can carry incredibly heavy loads and can cause it to start snowing over the area it flies.
503,,200,The Who When They Call ‘Who’s There?’,The Nightmare Before Christmas,Domain,Whenever someone asks a question roughly along the lines of ‘Who’s There?’ you have the opportunity to be that someone. The moment it happens you can choose to appear where they suspect someone is and instinctively know a little about the questioner and their current circumstances.
504,,200,Fair Winds and Clear Skies,Moana,Domain,"You can‟t quite control the weather, but whenever you absolutely need the sky to be mostly clear and the winds to be strong but not too strong, you can make a wish for that to happen and, unless some force is actively trying to shape the weather differently, it will be that way. This takes a few hours to work, so best make your wish early."
505,,200,Mobile Bender ,Avatar: The Legend Of Korra,Domain,"You’re skilled at using your bending to get around quickly. Earthbenders can create huge waves of dirt to surf on, firebenders can propel themselves on jets of flame, airbenders can manipulate the atmosphere around them to glide, enhance their jumps and temporarily levitate, and waterbenders can propel themselves across waves and create slides out of ice.

507,,200,Castle Jumper ,Marvel Magic,Domain,"What is the point of living if you don’t do it in style? Certainly, you know the importance of aesthetics even in the face of practicality... but that does not mean that something can’t be both stylish and practical. You are the proud owner of a large european castle. It’s practically straight out of a storybook, having stone walls, great towers -- hell, the thing even has a moat. However, despite its ancient appearance, it is fully updated to the modern times. Possessing everything from standard amenities such as running water and electricity to a state-of-the-art security system and laboratories. The way you live should make a statement, a fact that you seem to understand very well."
508,,200,Cloak of Levitation,A Marvel Cinematic Universe,Domain,"Your very own Cloak of Levitation, a magical relic wielded by Doctor Strange that is able to move and fly on its own power, and also enabling its user to fly, levitate and hover in the air. you may change it’s appearance and personality however you want. It will fit you perfectly, and unlike Strange’s, yours is indestructible."
509,,200,In My Heart,Loki,Domain,"Sometimes, you need to keep things close to your chest. You seem to go one step beyond that, having created something akin to a magical pocket within yourself. While it can only hold things smaller than your torso, it might still be useful to have somewhere to keep things even if your other pockets have been removed, or where it’s much harder for anyone else to take things from."
510,,200,New England Manor House,Heroes Reborn,Domain,"Doesn’t have to be in New England, but this is a manor house in classic New England architectural styles, like something you’d expect to see from a house that dates back to the days of the Salem witch trials. You own it, legally, with all taxes and utilities paid. It also possesses some basic magical wards against unwanted visitors, especially of the more occult varieties, but don’t expect these to do much against any major players, the God of Lies could ignore them almost completely. That’s why it is also highly receptive to your attempts to ward it in any fashion."
511,,200,Puzzle(400),Helltaker,Domain,"A puzzle of your very own! The puzzle is now as hard as Judgement’s - extremely difficult and dangerous, taking up to several hours to solve.

In-Jump, this is an actual location in Hell. Post-Jump, you can tap someone to consciously send them to this puzzle until they solve it. After they do so, they will be unable to be trapped again for a year, so as to forget the puzzle’s solution. Attempts to trap an individual before this year is up will allow them to ‘Skip’ the puzzle. 

This ability is fiat-backed to take at least the purchased possible completion time to succeed, even if the individual trapped is a genius. Until they’ve spent enough time, even Reed Richards, Albert Einstein, and Steven Hawking would have difficulty solving it with their intellectual powers combined - let alone some random person taken from the street.

Multiple people may be sent to the puzzle at the same time. In theory, and based on the personalities and intellect of those sent, the individuals may help each other or work against each other to great or terrible effect.

There is no food or water within this puzzle. An individual who dies within will be on a respawn timer equal to the total amount of time they have spent within the puzzle since being trapped (not since last death). When the target solves the puzzle they’re transported back to the same place they were targeted in.

On purchase of the highest tier, you may have a unique type of object appear in
the same or similar manner to Justice’s chain attacks.

512,,200,Gap Junction,Dr Strange Multiverse of Madness,Domain,The gap junction is effectively one of the most secure vaults in all of Marvel. This junction is a separate dimension sealed away from the rest of reality. The only way to access it is a unique lock created by the user. This version will be attuned to you and function as a warehouse attachment. No one will be capable of breaking into this vault and only those you allow can even find it.
513,,200,Glass Prison,Dr Strange Multiverse of Madness,Domain,"The glass prison is a treasure used by the experts in Kamar-Taj. This prison is capable of holding powerful beings on par with the Scarlet Witch enhanced by the Darkhold. This prison is capable of withstanding powerful attacks causing them to bounce around within the prison. Second, if the prison is attacked the prison will retaliate by launching razor-like spikes capable of piercing virtually any defense. The biggest issue honestly is getting someone inside in the first place."
514,,200,Infernal Staircase,Avengers-Thunderbolts,Domain,"This doorway, in your warehouse or another property of your choice, leads to a staircase which leads to another dimension. This won’t lead to alternate timelines, or parallel Earths, but at the start of each jump you can select a dimension in the setting for it to lead to, allowing you access to that dimension. While you can open the door from both sides, other individuals will not be able to open this door except from the side in your dimension."

You can move asteroids of 10 miles in diameter at speeds of up to thousands of miles per hour. You can control the direction of a swarm of meteors within 100 miles of his person. Through concentration, you could potentially affect a small piece of matter 1000 miles away from him. While standing on Earth, you could affect tectonic plates sufficiently to cause earthquakes and create chasms on the surface thousands of feet deep or wide. If you were to use your powers to their fullest, you could separate Manhattan island levitate it miles into the sky."
516,,200,Flight,Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Domain,"You have the ability to take to the skies. You can fly about as fast as you can run or at supersonic speeds, whichever is greater, tiring yourself out at about the same rate as you would by running."

Though each element has its specialties, all of them provide a variety of ways to increase your speed, agility, and acrobatic prowess, as well as give you unique methods of movement. Whether you're leaping gorges with gusts of flame or wind, gliding across a lake on a slab of ice, or crawling across a ceiling with rock shoes and gloves, where you go few others could hope to follow. You are also able to better use your Bending art on the go, adapting your forms to take advantage of your natural stride.

521,,200,The Gates of Hell,Bayonetta,Domain,"This classy warehouse attachment is... special, in a sense. Along with easy music and a nice 'noir occult' aesthetic design, it holds an obscene variety of alcoholic drinks and mixing ingredients that will never truly run out, all of superb quality that is guaranteed to have excellent flavor. The more special thing, however... is that this bar exists on multiple planes, allowing any portal you create in here to be far more stable while reducing the energy requirements needed. Why would you just make portals to the bar? Well I'm sure you have your reasons…"
522,,200,Environmental Excursion,Bayonetta,Domain,"In order to beat up Angels (or talk to them), you need to see them first. With but a thought you can seamlessly slip into Purgatorio, a parallel world which lets you become invisible and interact with all manners of creatures like angels and demons. However, any item you damage here is damaged in the real world, and you can still be seen on reflective surfaces. Be careful with this... of course, this is only for this world. You must pay 200CP to keep this ability elsewhere."
523,,200,Glacial Aura,Ragna Crimson,Domain,"Hope you don’t enjoy warm climates, because you aren’t going to be able to enjoy them much further. This is the ability to generate ice in large quantities, as well as freeze any targets within the area of effect of the user instantly. Using this magic may lower the temperature of the area as far as -80o C.

Not to be confused with the Silver Aura, as it may even freeze this magic further still."
524,,200,Blood Forest ,Ragna Crimson,Domain,"This power allows one to possess and drain others for energy. By connecting yourself to them via a special blood tentacles that you can summon and replacing one of their limbs with yourself, you can pilot their bodies as if they were puppets, while also gaining the ability to fully conceal yourself inside of them to pass as a regular individual.

By summoning your blood tentacles in large numbers, which can extend for even a few kilometers, you can drain others of their blood and convert it into magical power to enhance your other powers or to replenish your own reserves. The more people and the more magically power they are, the more magical energy you will get from them.

Your final and most potent ability allows you to drain the blood and life from as many people as you can in order to evolve into a more powerful form, even temporarily reverting your aging to reach a prime younger state, where all your powers would be magnified in proportion of all of those you have drained. An old and weaker Seija could use the blood of five hundred thousand humans to elevate themselves to the power of the strongest Seijas. This boost is however temporary and would leave you exhausted for a long period of time, possibly week or even months."
525,,200,Boots of Swiftness,League of Legends,Domain,"These silvery, winged boots offer their wearer incredible speed on foot, boosting their running speed by 50%. Unlike other artifacts, the Boots of Swiftness are not unique and can be purchased multiple times for your companions to wear.

These taverns will always earn you a healthy profit, with your ownership of them being secret. All of the workers at the tavern will pass off any interesting tidbits they may overhear to you. This series of taverns may be left as a warehouse attachment of a single tavern, or may be imported into a new jump where you will always have enough of these taverns to meet the needs of the city’s more illicit population."
527,,200,World Walker,A Throne of Glass,Domain,"You have the skills and the sight of a World Walker, what this allows you to do is naturally see the weak points in the world where natural and temporary Wyrdgates appear, allowing you to travel to other worlds and realities within this multiverse. While natural Wyrdgates are not controllable, from further studying you have gained the knowledge of the Wyrdmarks necessary to artificially open temporary gates where you are able to control the destination (excluding prior jumps until post-spark). This skill also comes with the knowledge necessary in Wyrdmarks to see into other realities in order to choose where to aim your Wyrdgates."
528,,200,Portal Jaunt,Super Dragon Sword,Domain,"Your ability to utilize the rifts in combat is stunning. You are capable of quickly ripping holes into the Rift to teleport short distances - while the Rift is hazardous and the energy within it is corroding and damaging, it is a quick and difficult to track method of transportation. In addition, you are an expert at using these same tears in the Rift to redirect and dodge attacks, letting projectiles sail into a tear you quickly create, or forcing an enemy’s strike to pass you by through sending them into a rift."
529,,200,Photonic Glide,Super Dragon Sword,Domain,"You are capable of gathering Photonic Energy from the Rift beyond the world and use it to “fly” by slowing and directing your fall, a form of gliding which allows updrafts to take you even higher into the air."
530,,200,Safe house,Generic Dungeon Crawler,Domain,"In this Jump there are places, usually the size of an average bedroom, that you will immediately recognize as a safe place to rest. Taking this Perk places similar rooms in future Jumps. Once you close the door behind you, regardless of the methods used to search for you, the safe house and its occupants will never be found - until 8 hours have elapsed, after which time the room loses its protective qualities. There are many such locations in each jump, but each is at least a half-aday's walk apart from each other. "
531,,200,Aquatic,Generic Dungeon Crawler,Domain,"Besides breathing in water, you are much more agile while submerged. Unless angered or starved, aquatic predators will ignore your presence."
532,,200,Castle Jumper ,King Arthur ,Domain,"A castle that you own and follows you from jump to jump. You can select where it appears in every jump, alternatively it can simply attach to your warehouse if you want. You can have it spawn in at anytime if it’s in your warehouse."
533,,200,Storm ,Dracula Untold,Domain,"​A thunderstorm follows you around now. The skies turn cloudy, lightning strikes in multiple places rapidly, and you cut an absolutely terrifying figure walking in it’s centre. While it’s good for denying them visibility, this thunderstorm is of surprisingly little benefit when it comes to doing actual damage to your enemies. You can’t even direct the lighting. Well, unless you’re a Vampire. Or have other powers that would let you do it. Can be switched off."
534,,200,Navigator,Dresden Files,Domain,"Many and varied are the paths through Nevernever. An eclectic, infinitely mutable realm that can change with every step, where one stop might take you from a Desert into a Blizzard. While the curious way time and distance here makes it possible to use it for immensely useful shortcuts across the globe, the dangers on the paths and how complicated they are make it a challenge to actually put such things to use. Except for you, I suppose. Your talent and ability at discovering immensely useful and safe Ways through the Nevernever can only be said to have been matched by the likes of Margaret Le Fay. No matter how far away or how hard to get to a place might be, you can count on always being able to find a Way through the Nevernever to and from it, or through whatever similar dimensions you may encounter in the future. It’s like magic, one could say."
535,,200,Jumper’s Pub,Dresden Files,Domain,"Basically a copy of McAnally’s pub. Arranged and furnished in sets of thirteen - 13 pillars with intricate fairy tale scenes carved in them, 13 tables, 13 stools at the bar, 13 ceiling fans, etc. Comes staffed with a couple of followers. A bartender to serve the customers, and a piano player to provide ambiance as there are no electronics included. Both are men of few words. The bar is continually stocked with food and drink. Simple but high quality and delicious food like steak sandwiches. Home brewed ale good enough that it might just ruin all other beers for you, as well as a private stash of ale that’s even better. Most importantly, this pub is universally recognized and respected as Neutral Territory. So long as you, the owner, don’t violate the neutrality then neither will anyone else short of beings like Outsiders and other such omnicidal eldritch monstrosities. It has a regular clientele of the local supernatural element, or the closest local equivalent, it will occasionally be used as a neutral meeting ground for negotiations. This all continues in future jumps."
536,,200,Family Home,The Dresden Files,Domain,"There's no place quite like it, you know? You've got two options here: You can either go for a small and comfortable home in the suburbs, owned by generations of families for several generations back, or a small mansion of relatively recent manufacture. Well, unless you're White Court, in which case you're obviously getting the big one. While it's definitely nicer and much bigger, the small one is manages to feel cozy without being cramped, and has the kind of Threshold that would give a Faerie Queen pause and make a Foo Dog extremely happy."
537,,200,Svartalf Apartment,The Dresden Files,Domain,"Someone did you a serious favor getting you access to this thing - ordinarily, they can't be bought, only earned. It's in the city you wind up in, in a high-grade apartment complex under the aegis of Svaralfheim, so it's about as safe as anything in this world can be. Aside from being of stunning craftsmanship, everything inside has been hand-made by the Svartalves, and it's designed to be almost completely Hexproof. Unless you've got an unusually powerful Hex, you and any Wizards you're friends with will be able to enjoy all the luxuries the modern world can offer."
538,,200,Giant Tree,Dark Souls 2,Domain,"“The corpse of a long-lost friend, which has now given way to overgrowth and taken the form of a Giant Tree. Returning to nature, returning to whence they came, they still cherish you as their friend. Despite having no true awareness anymore, it is a sympathetic thing. Its seeds carry such sympathy, and the destruction of one releases that essence into the world for a short time. By crushing the seed of this Giant Tree, beasts and monsters with little will of their own will become violently defensive over you, and aggressive to those that would attack you.”"
539,,200,“Covenant of Artorias”,Dark Souls 1,Domain,"This ring symbolizes Knight Artorias's covenant with the beasts of the Abyss. Its wearer, like Artorias himself, can traverse the Abyss. This special version of the signet helps the wearer endure all kinds of forms of passively corrupting darkness."
540,,200,Conclave of Champions,Elden Ring,Domain,"Ah, the clash of sword on shield! The roar of the crowd, the crash of worthy foes bound together in the glory of martial prowess! Do such things interest you? If so, this magnificent colosseum is for you. Here and in subsequent worlds it will be known as a place for the strong to test their might against each other in an informal manner, supplied adequately to interest such champions in coming and staffed by helpful former Redmane knights loyal to their employer-you. Something about the legacy of glory this place celebrates excites warriors into performing at their best, encourages a certain camaraderie between them-it’s no replacement for the loyalty of a once-elite army, but after several bouts the regulars here would likely be amenable to joining forces in common cause even against overwhelming odds. Moreover, some strange quirk of space and time allows fighters from different timelines, adjacent dimensions or similar distances to arrive in the arena (or to depart at their own will) and test their strength against each other should they truly yearn for a challenge. Radahn would certainly approve of this place, if his mind was still his own."
541,,200,Blood Fast ,MtG - Ixalan,Domain,"A true follower of the old ways, you are able to ‘suppress’ consuming urges such as the desire to eat, drink blood, or drink water until a time which it’s most convenient. However while dropping the suppressed compulsion will not immediately kill you, it will catch up with you quickly as it doesn’t remove the necessity to live - just its ability to impede your functioning until it actually is impossible for you to continue at all. Your faith and determination have also taught you “Exultation”, the art of transforming your legs into a shadowy wisp, allowing for you to fly as fast as you can run."
542,,200,Ixalli’s Keeper ,MtG - Ixalan,Domain,"Fostering the growth of the creatures of the land is considered a righteous action in the Sun Empire, and you are among those who can - you have learnt how to use mana drawn from the land to spur on growth in creatures and enhance their physical capabilities to beyond what would be considered their potential. This is moderately effective on sapient beings and domesticatred creatures, but where this shines is in undomesticated “Wild” beasts such as the dinosaurs of the jungles - the same amount of mana causing much greater growth with them."
543,,200,Gingerbread Cabin,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Domain,"Deep through the woods, and wherever you go, you’ll find a bit of unique property that is yours to make use of. It’s a gingerbread house! A bit of witch’s magic is used to ensure that the food is above all edible - repelling pests, maintaining freshness, and purifying the gingerbread and icing of this candy house to be both constantly repairing itself and to be delicious. In addition, you’ll find that the cabin is home to continuously ‘awakening’ gingerbread men. While a mischevious gremlin-like band of creatures, you can rely on these gingerbrutes to go cause havoc wherever you point them."
544,,200,Crystal Slipper,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Domain,"A strange pair of shoes created by a fairy guidemother, wearing these shoes gives you a strange fae speed, capable of outrunning warhorses at gallop and a kick that’d send the same horses flying off their hooves! They’re also rather durable, compared to how you’d expect glass slippers to be. "
545,,200,Generous Soul,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Domain,"Uninhibited growth and boundless flourishing are key traits of the Wilds - traits you know how to encourage in untamed nature. You have minor magics that invigorate the growth of plants and animals - though animals enhanced this way get an appetite to match, often, requiring a great deal of food immediately after proportional to the scale of the growth."
546,,200,Idyllic Grange,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Domain,"Eldraine is notable for its pastoral beauty and fecund land, so it would be a shame if you would leave here without a bit of it to take with you. From here on out, you’ll find in any world you visit, a bit of natural arcadian beauty set aside for you - simple, barely developed, untouched land, ripe for planting and harvesting."
547,,200,3D Motion,MtG - Zendikar,Domain,"Zendikar's landscape is very rarely straightforward to travel through - dense, jungle sheer cliffs; floating rocks; you get the idea. In order to get around, the Zendikari have adapted with the various ropes, hooks and harnesses so that when the road decides that vertical is the only way to get anywhere, they are prepared. You are now skilled in the use of these tools, allowing you to zip through the forests from branch to branch or scale the sheer cliffs and floating expanses of stone that dot the land. In addition, your understanding of the methods behind these contraptions allows you to develop simple tools to navigate new environments with similar success."
548,,200,An-Havva Inn ,MtG - Homelands,Domain,"Between the Border Gates of Aysen and the Dark Barony lies the An-Havva Inn, the finest eating and drinking establishment on the roads. Musical entertainment occurs nightly, while travellers whisper intrigues over candle-lit tables. Anyone is welcome here, as long as they behave themselves and pay in some form of recognizable coinage or barter. Even the Aysen goddess Serra used to visit from time to time, and the inn is located remarkably close to the most likely place for wandering planeswalkers to enter the plane.

With this purchase you’ll be one of the owners of this wonderful place, with an upstairs apartment provided for you to live in. In subsequent jumps, you’ll become the sole owner of the inn, though the establishment continues to run smoothly as a hub of story and song even without any interference. It also tends to find itself located in in-between places and close to borders, both the border gates of nations and of the very plane it is set on."
549,,200,Sengir Bats,MtG - Homelands,Domain,"These winged bloodsuckers have become the seal and symbol of the Dark Barony over time, with many believing them to serve as the Baron’s eyes. In truth, Sengir himself does not control or use them for any purpose. Nevertheless, they unnerve and frighten people.

While you don’t own any bats in particular yourself, great numbers of them will gather around you and your holdings if you wish. These vampiric creatures spread fear and terror as if they were truly extensions of yourself. People will see your face in every one of these bats, and quickly come to believe you are always watching through those beady eyes.

Despite these unnerving qualities, their presence may also be helpful. They feed mostly on insects, and so keep bug populations in check even in swampy locales."
550,,200,Aviary,MtG - Homelands,Domain,"A place of peace and tranquility, the aviary was built as a temple to Serra, a place for her to visit, and a shelter for the birds of Onella. Open to the sky and tended to by the young men and women of Onella, particularly the Serran Initiates. The building is inhabited by many of the common small birds, pigeons and crows of Onella, while mesa falcons and other wild birds from across the homelands will occasionally visit.

The building is beautiful, filled with greenery , trees, and a large central fountain. There are no cages here, and its open-aired construction makes it difficult to even notice you are in a building when you’re inside. You will be put in charge of its operation now, and in the future it will come with you to other jumps along with all its resident birds, and the initiates working to care for them. Aside from providing a place of tranquil beauty for yourself, wild birds in other places will also quickly learn that this is a safe place and come to visit for an occasional bite to eat, to have their wounds tended, or even to build their nests in difficult years."
551,,200,The Depths,MtG - Shandalar,Domain,"Do you remember how unusually rare, old, or otherwise exceptional spells are almost never found for trade anywhere? That’s because most of the magical lore of that calibre is only found in places like this. Formed from the bleak ruins of past civilizations and infused with magical power beyond reckoning, so-called ‘dungeons’ are some of the most dangerous locations on Shandalar. Filled with powerful enemies, each of which is further backed with magic that pervades the entire dungeon, for one to merely get close enough to see the treasure vaults in the distance is already an accomplishment. And those who fail will be lucky to leave with their lives, a heavy tithe of magical lore or power the only thing staving off annihilation. 

With this purchase, a ruined archway will be found in your Warehouse, which will lead to a dungeon not unlike those found on Shandalar. Entirely unpredictable, no two visits to the swirling ruins beyond are ever the same... but likewise, it will never run out of potential treasures."
552,,200,Arcane Bazaar ,MtG - Shandalar,Domain,"Forming a loosely organized collective of artisans, magewrights, scholars and other such adepts of the esoteric arts, Arcane Bazaars are some of the most densely concentrated magical communities on Shandalar - each focused solely on the trade and acquisition of magical knowledge. You gain access to this kind of wondrous marketplace, either by easily finding one in the wilderness of Shandalar should you seek it, or through a newly created portal located in your Warehouse. The bazaar offers a vast array of spells to any magician willing to trade... but their prices are often very steep, especially for more powerful magics, and even these mystical places don’t hold access to every spell developed. Some of the most ancient, rare and powerful spells will need to be acquired elsewhere. Of course, you can also sell your own spells here for a decent bit of coin, since the scholars here are always looking for more arcane lore.

You retain access to the Bazaar through your Warehouse in future jumps, and the scholars living here will continue to develop new spells and effects as you travel to new worlds."
553,,200,Torpor Orb,MtG - New Phyrexia,Domain,"A floating bronze-colored orb inside a gilded, elaborate open sphere of metal, it emits a dampening aura when activated, covering a decently sized (Think a small building) area in a field that slows down the magic of all in its range. Perhaps with some tinkering, you’d be able to make it not affect you and your allies."
554,,200,Soothing Sights And Neon Lights(Mono Mana) ,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Domain,"For thousands of years, magic has been measured in motes of energy, the amount of power or life force that a certain amount of land - originally known as a Land - can produce inside a certain timeframe, be it minutes, hours, or days. If you have none of these, performing magic becomes significantly harder. Regardless, for 50 cp you may start the jump with a connection to one such land, be it a river meandering through a forest until it reaches the seas, or an Saiba experiment on a small pavilion where the waterfall flows upwards. For 200 cp, you may instead start with five such Lands, your choice between five of one, one of five, or any combination thereof. 

Separate from the above offer and its packaged deal, you may also make a one time payment of 100 cp to acquire a bond to a Land capable of providing two kinds of mana. This could range from anywhere between a highly futuristic zen garden and its air of tranquility and yet intelligence, to a downtrodden and crime ridden neighborhood with its reeking of decay and yet opportunity. As a small aside, these locations have a unique benefit to them - if left alone for a few weeks, they can be called upon for a small surge of healing - nothing major, but enough to drive a mild sickness from you or heal over a number of minor cuts. 

In both cases, once the jump ends you may choose between outright gaining the property rights to a similar stretch of land in future jumps, and turning them into a warehouse attachment."
555,,200,Rest Your Weary Bones ,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Domain,"The Saiba will tell you that any pleasure you can find in the real world, they can craft an equal to using their superior technology, if not something even better. Sometimes however, there is little in the way of room for improvement in nature’s designs. It’s not like there are many ways to make hot water better, except to perhaps make it hotter - and if they did that, it'd be too hot. Regardless, you are now the owner of a rather lovely hot spring that sits right between the edge of the Jukai Forests and the Sokenzanshi Mountains. This spring is not only perfectly warm at all times, but is also the focus of a minor amount of natural energy, such that it invigorates to an absurd extent and can outright empower those who soak in it. There is enough energy in it for four people to gain a small amount of power, or one a rather large chunk. Sadly, it takes three months to build up another charge."
556,,200,The Best Dumplings In Towashi,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Domain,"Everybody needs a day off now and again, which is why you now possess a full set of Imperial and Saiba identifications that agree on one absolute truth - you are an absolute nobody, not a fighter, not a scientist, and certainly not a ninja pretending to work at a noodle stand in order to let some of the heat from your last job die down. Oh, and you do in fact own a noodle stand of some kind. Rather hard to complete the ruse without one. When you aren’t present, a young woman whom you may or may not have a massive pile of blackmail on and who really doesn’t want to know about your day job is in charge of the stand, and is entirely ‘willing’ to turn a blind eye to her supposed employee constantly being late for work or not even showing up for weeks on end. Good help is so hard to come by these days. "
557,,200,Secret Places And Things ,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Domain,"People from other world’s don’t usually have a place to stay. Artificers who aren’t Futurists usually don’t have a place to experiment. You’re both. Probably. And as such, you need access to resources, a place to stay, and a few other things that you wouldn’t otherwise have. This place takes the form of a small laboratory - well, small by the standards of the Saiba, which means it’s the size of several warehouses - filled to the brim with implements and tools of your choice. If you’d like it to be a Futurist blacksite, the former hideyhole of a renegade Jukai Biotechnician who wanted to make an electric tree, or just a more ordinary forge for old school weapon crafting, we can make all those things happen. In addition, being in a rather sleazy location, it’s fairly easy to locate someone who can discreetly acquire more resources if you need them. Assuming you have a way to pay. "
558,,200,"Oboro, Palace in the Clouds",MtG - Kamigawa,Domain,"A free-floating palace that during the Kami War was repurposed as a Flagship. It can be used to tap into Blue Mana and it flies around the same speed as a swift steed. It can produce small clouds that are solid enough for entire parties to stand on for a long while and act as a mobile base with relative ease. The Palace in the Clouds can be summoned anywhere there is enough open air to fit it, needing around a square kilometer a few hundred feet tall to be summoned.

The lands of this world are rich in mana, which is the easiest way to cast without any risk to the self in many of the magic styles you can learn in this jump. Bonding with a normal land takes days, but these lands available to you will instantly have a bond and their power can be ‘tapped’ once per hour, which may not seem like much but mana from an entire land is enough to fuel army killing spells at the least. You may ‘tap’ a land you are already bonded with for mana at any time, though the sudden upsurge of mana might intimidate some folks. Each basic land may only be tapped for a single mana, two for the named lands.

To physically access a land you can either access it through a door in the Warehouse or via summoning the land into the world. People will likely notice you summoning large masses of land into the world so be careful with that. Bonds with lands bought here do not break as you continue Jumping, in case of confusion."
559,,200,"Okina, Temple to the Grandfathers",MtG - Kamigawa,Domain,"The largest temple in the Jukai Forest; whose name means ‘Shrine to the Grandfathers’. It is a rich land whose Green Mana could be used in spells. In addition to that, this land possesses the scrolls and teachers of the budoka and kannushi monks, who are willing to take select individuals into their fold to pass the teachings of their ways on.

560,,200,"Shinka, the Bloodsoaked Keep",MtG - Kamigawa,Domain,"A massive Pagoda, a tiered tower, a hermitage where ogres were trained in blood magics and terrible arts such as Oni Summoning. In addition to allowing one to draw upon it’s rich Red Mana, this place allows one to train volunteers into Yamabushi in the classical sense of the word. These folk will develop to be tougher and stronger than many, some may even match Ogre depending on the skill of the teachers in question. Shinka must be summoned on a mountainside.

561,,200,"Shizo, Death's Storehouse ",MtG - Kamigawa,Domain,"This land is steeped in death. Once verdant and filled with flowers, the land has become a monstrous shadow after nearly a thousand samurai were slain upon it. The plentiful blood and harsh rains have made this place into a marsh and the death has made this land rich in black Mana. This place isn’t as useful as the others, featuring only a dark past, however during summoning you can arrange this land however you wish, allowing you to create a protective ring of dark, haunted moor around other lands if you so wished, and when we say haunted we mean it, over eight hundred zombie samurai roam this land and even when utterly destroyed they will appear again in a few hours, though they will never leave the swamp itself.

It can be used to draw upon it’s rich blue Mana, but more importantly the land brings forth a school that scholars you allow entry can learn of your teachable powers. The school carries with it a large number of teachers who can teach your arts in your stead. Must be summoned upon a great river near a waterfall.

In the heart of a small town, populated by a series of non-entities who can maintain the town and fortress but not much else, this land allows one to draw upon White Mana, the fortress itself is immutable, unchanged in spite of any attacks that would try to destroy it.

564,,200,A Small Shrine ,MtG - Kamigawa,Domain,"A shrine is not just a place of worship to the Kami but a location of communion with which those of the material world can connect with the spirit world to greater effect. In this small shrine the Mana is rich in the air and flows easily. If this property, which can be summoned into the world by your will, is settled upon non-Mana rich lands it will allow one to tap the land without endangering the local flows of energy. If placed upon a land rich in Mana then it can double the energy gained per tapping of the land’s formidable Mana. This Shrine also acts as a negotiation ground for spirits and beings of the material world, a fact that most will respect and all can feel."
565,,200,Moth Rider’s Stables ,MtG - Kamigawa,Domain,"This is set of stables that are used to raise and rear the giant moths on which the Daimyo’s army flies, which you can set in any location you wish or access through a door in the warehouse. The stables contain an egg sac and all the instructions on the proper care and feeding of Moths as well as the training techniques used in Kamigawa to make these massive moths worthy of battle. This is enough to start and continue a line of Riding Moths, enough to outfit entire decisions of armies. You'll just need a little time and effort to get them."
566,,200,Velis Vel Grotto ,MtG - Lorwyn,Domain,"Colorless mana
 
The secret spawning ground of the changelings, said to be the origin of Lorwyn's race of chameleon-like shapeshifters. The grotto is a subterranean cavern with walls encrusted with quartz crystals and a floor that is an underground stream. Once a year, sunlight penetrates directly into a hole at the top of the grotto, causing a flood of light to reflect and explode throughout the cavern, its walls glinting and glimmering with the same strange quality as the changeling's mutable skin. During this time changeling behavior changes drastically and they are drawn to Velis Vel, before new changelings spawn from within the caverns."
567,,200,Shrine-Fortress,MtG - Lorwyn,Domain,"Not quite a true monastery, this is more of a shrine and a fortress of sorts. One that served as a lookout in times of war proudly set upon a mountain like great Mount Tanufel amongst outcrops, protrusions of metallic stone, and spires forgotten and unused for generations. 

The structure was built on geometries and sensibilities that would have been impossible to imagine for any architects but those made of living stone and flame. Curved, polished obsidian arches asymmetrically support a convex roof lined with ironwood tiles that resembles the attire or flamekin monks more than anything else, but those that adorn the wall are cut into more regular shapes. The roof in turn supports a spire that resembles nothing more than a rough-hewn stalagmite.

Like a smaller sibling of a proper monastery, it could house a small group of monks to watch the mountainside without a problem. There they could practise their arts, or prepare for a defense against enemies wishing to climb the mountain."
568,,200,Pilgrimage ,MtG - Lorwyn,Domain,"The strong, intense passions of the flamekin drive them to wander the world, leading them to semi-nomadic lifestyles. But it is devotion to the Path of Flame and their almost spiritual connection to the mysterious greater elementals of Lorwyn that truly inspires them to undertake their long pilgrimages all across Lorwyn instead of mere wanderings.

A flamekin pilgrim's path is meant to be a solitary one, a journey that shapes and is in turn shaped by an individual. As travelers and wanderers, the pilgrims touch the lives of many others, but only briefly. As messengers, they bear news to others - the dire and the wonderful, items trivial and profound alike. Even the elves have deemed the pilgrim's people worthy of being couriers, at least during times the flamekin were in their favor. 

You can carry a bit of that trustworthiness with you, making yourself seem like an ideal courier to carry whatever message must be borne. More personally useful might be the ability to open yourself up to the guidance of the elementals, allowing that which guides you to impel you in the right direction. The path shall lead you either to new experiences and self-discovery, or simply towards places you wish to go if you favor more worldly concerns.

They might even guide you with creative impulses in the crafts.

The path presents itself to the pilgrim."
569,,200,Warding ,MtG - Innistrad,Domain,"It’s well and good to drive back evil wherever it may be, but people need to be safe in their homes. Wards are what give us that safety. Symbols of Avacyn's power used to mark areas, and drive away those that would prey on people in their homes. I do not even want to imagine a world where a person could not have their homes and farmlands warded, against werewolves or the other, nastier things lurking out there. I know many will be glad for the ward you make them."
570,,200,Legendary Land ,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Domain,"Certain places in the multiverse contain far more power than others, more significance, more history. Each of these lands generate two motes of mana of their color individually, but not only that they have their own unique features and assets. You may choose one such land for each time you purchase this option.

The first of these places is the land with the highest concentration of White Mana, the city of Karakas. The city of Karkas is a famous city on Dominaria. It is a place of great treasure, adventure but most of all peace. Karakas is not only an architectural and artistic marvel, but fighting serves no purpose within the city. This is a good place to recruit heroes and generate income as wealth and legends flock to this grand city.

The second of these lands, Tolaria, is an island on Dominaria home to the Tolarion Academy, founded by Urza it is primarily aligned with Blue Mana. It draws in many wizards and serves as a place of great learning. In future jumps while you are in charge of the academy it is not just going to be you teaching, as those who come here share their discoveries freely

The third and most infamous of these lands is Urbolg. It is a land of Black Mana, if there was ever a place that was to be described and felt as evil it is here. Villains, witches, cultists, and liches constantly come to this land, fighting for power. Owning this land would be an excellent opportunity to either find minions, test subjects or acceptable targets. Though do bare in mind that it is possible that those who come here may be hard to control.

The fourth is the fortress Hammerheim. Primarily contributing Red Mana, it serves as a valuable strategic chokepoint. While fierce warriors freely come to Hammerheim to test their mettle, the thing that most crosses these lands include art, vast material wealth, songs and all the vast benefits of trade all of which you can benefit from.

The last land is the giant tree of Pendelhaven. A wellspring of Green Mana, Pendelhaven serves as a gathering point for many varied and unique creatures. The creatures and plants can be utilized for a vast supply of unique magical reagents and medicinal materials thanks to the magical imbuement the tree grants.
"
571,,200,Guildhall,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Domain,"With this land you will be an important member of a Ravnican guild. You would be attuned with the Gate and Guildhall of your guild. From these you can generate one colorless mote, and a mote of one of the two colors representing that guild. Each guild is unique and each Guildhall has their own unique facilities which you can use along with scrolls containing all the spells they developed. Post-Jump, instead of the real Guildhall and Gate, you instead take with you a copy. Each Guildhall has all you need to preserve the culture of the Guild and recreate it in future worlds."
572,,200,Wall-Walking,Skulduggery Pleasant,Domain,"Walk up walls, or on ceilings. Also allows the user to magically open locks, and to seal doors by touching them and saying “Withstand”.

Boosted: Air-Walking: Through the power of your True Name, you no longer need physical surfaces to stand on. You can now walk on the air itself, standing on open space with as little thought to the act as a normal person puts into walking on the sidewalk. You can, of course, stand on the air at any angle, affording yourself a tremendous degree of three-dimensional maneuverability. Per the magic’s name, this does require air to stand on; you wouldn’t be able to use this in the vacuum of space, for example, but the thin air of the upper atmosphere should be no problem. Of course, this magic doesn’t grant you the ability to breathe in such an environment for very long. Your ability to magically open locks has been enhanced as well, now encompassing even advanced electronic security like password-protected doors and biometric access locks. It only works on doors though; you can’t use it to hack into a computer.

Boost Requires Second Coming(Skulduggery Pleasant) to Activate"
573,,200,Zero Dark Sleeping Room,Fate/Extella,Domain,"Not quite the Zero Dark prison dimension but it’s at least as comfortable. Somewhere in the virtual world of the Moon Cell is a unassuming cave, very difficult for anyone else to locate. The cave’s entrance and interior grows as big as you need it to be based on your own size and what you store within it, with any reasonable comfort you could desire being found within. Relatively common food, entertainment, fashion, shelter and so on. All mundane supplies but enough to make for comfortable living even for a titan stuck within. While mundane and common is the rule, sometimes strange things tend to appear in this little pocket realm. If Altera can accidentally create a water slide made from breasts, who knows what might pop out of your dreams while here?"
574,,200,Troias Tragōidia,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Domain ,"Drawn by two immortal and divine horses and a third steed that somehow keeps up with it’s
counterparts despite being mortal, this streamlined chariot is a potent weapon of war. Summoned
to your side with just a whistle, the horses can pull the chariot across land, sea or through the sky at
astonishing speeds even amongst demigods. Each of the horses has incredible strength and can
alone kill large monsters with their hooves, the chariot’s charge as a whole only becoming more
powerful as it grows in speed and never slowing from an impact that does not stop it entirely. Control of the chariot itself is effortless and the horses can easily perform ordinarily physically
impossible movements according to your will, so long as you are in contact with the chariot. "
575,,200,Pleasure Quarters,Fate/Legends - Nirvana Yuga,Domain,"A private place to take all your dearest friends away, never to be seen again. A little texture of your
own, wrapped over and around itself to be sealed away from everything else. This warped
dimension is near impossible to pierce into, without the power of a bestial threat at least, yet you
find it easy to watch and influence the outside world from it. You can enter the pleasure quarters
you have from any location, being able to watch for a distance around where you entered from
within and even reach out with magic. Dragging people in is possible even without specific powers
for it and leaving without permission is almost as hard as breaking in in the first place. Those within
this realm find themselves with far reduced resistance to any corrupting abilities you have and that
the core aspects of their beings, things on a conceptual level, are much easier for you to access and
manipulate with any magic or powers that have that potential. The dimension is small, enough to fit
a castle and surrounding town, but can easily be nested inside other similar locations. "
576,,200,Mountain Heaven,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Domain,"Who would ever have expected a hot springs resort to appear so deep in the misty forests? It hardly
seems like a profitable location but any traveler would be glad to happen upon this secluded respite. Moreso once they meet you, the lovely innkeeper and landlord of this small compound. This is a
traditional resort that is summoned at your whim, large and very comfortable. Despite the earlier
age, it remains stocked with high quality supplies and many conveniences of the modern era, not
that anyone notices the anachronisms. There’s enough rooms to host a few dozen guests at a time. The luxurious hot springs are the star attraction, many large natural baths that no one appears to
mind are all mixed bathing. Despite the size and possibility of keeping upwards of fifty people happy at once in their stay, you
find it takes no time or effort at all. While here, you can act as a superb innkeeper, of almost
supernatural skill when it comes to satisfying all customers and their desires. People do tend to
follow your rules here as well, provided they’re mostly reasonable and not too out there for an inn. You might get away with a few bizarre rules passed off as customs that no guest will think twice
about following but don’t try anything harmful. For an additional 100CP, a mysterious tower can be added behind the Inn. This is a battle arena, one
of seemingly endless floors. The higher one goes, the more dangerous the enemies are. Defeat in
this tower does not result in death, the defeated appearing in one of the hot spring baths to heal. Every entrant to the tower must start from the bottom, though clearing ten floors of enemies will let
that entrant start ten floors higher if desired."
577,,200,Killing Fields,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Domain,"A hunting ground most suited for you, perhaps even the place you grew up in. Each world you begin
in, you are able to mark out a territory for yourself within which dealing death becomes all the easier. Around the size of London in the time of the Ripper, you find yourself effortlessly familiar with the
layout and paths of this land, easily tracking or losing trackers even when faced against lifelong
natives. Your abilities to hide and sneak around are noticeably enhanced, as efforts to discover your
identity made from within the territory continually encounter unusual challenges. Damaged or
corrupted evidence, false leads and copycats springing up to protect you. Finally, the weather and
populace trends towards your personal preference in regards to these night time activities, ensuring
you can bring along the dreary mists of London and it’s nightlife to wherever you go, if you want it. No import."
578,,200,Mesektet,Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Domain,"Even for the divine, this is a stylish way to travel across the skies. A great golden boat that can
traverse the lands of Egypt in a few minutes, large enough to comfortably fit a small party or tear
through a sailing ship with just the gold-clad helm. The ship appears at your command, even only in
part should you need a portion or require a shield. The radiance of the Mesektet vessel is visible, a
shining aura that blinds many who look up while leaving your vision cleared of obstructions, but it
can also be turned to terrible devastation. The light produced by the ship can be focused by your
mind at the helm, turning into scorching waves of heat that melt the earth and incinerate ordinary
men. When honed closely, they can be turned into high powered lasers that slice through stone and
steel like they were just empty spaces. The vessel, for all it appears to be a luxury yacht of the
Egyptian pantheon, is more than capable of reducing a city the size of modern Tokyo to ash in just
hours."
579,,200,Mountain of Death,Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Domain,"A great mountain rising up from the flat sands surrounding it. A secret place, despite it’s size, which
is now home to your own version of the Hashashin order. This dark mountain has a secret
organisation of several hundred members, each fanatically loyal to you, and all already trained in the
assassin’s arts to a basic level. They’re far from being equals to a Hashashin leader but each one
could match one of that older order’s rank and file. They could work as a personal weapon of yours, striking at your enemies, or gather resources by selling their services. Whatever the case, you’ll find
that the mountain’s resources and the quantity and quality of your assassins here will improve as
your own assassin skills do. Adherents find themselves drawn to the mountain and those already
studying there are inspired to go ever further in pursuit of the vaunted level of skill their great leader
has reached."
580,,200,Black Church,Fate/Legends - Strange New World,Domain ,"Aren’t you a little young to be a priest? Not like your flock appears to care all that much. In fact, that
youth might only play into it more. You’re the head of a religious congregation of your own, based in
quite a large and beautiful church in the countryside, surrounded by a reasonably sized village or
town. The flock is devout and the majority of the surrounding centre’s populace are adherents, though only a few dozen are so deep as to be fanatics. They can be either a puritan Christian faith, who somehow ignore the most traits of yours that might go against their beliefs, but who are very
easily directed as a weapon against anyone you wish. Almost like they’re looking for heretics and
witches to burn wherever they see. It’s particularly easy to spread this faith to others as well, meaning that armies of hundreds or potentially thousands of the faithful can be raised, should you
take the time to spread your fiery words to other counties and towns as well. But if this option is less interesting, you may also choose for this Christian faith to only be so on the
outer front, with the real truth hiding a eldritch cult that worships the gods from beyond. This true
side to the cult consists only of those few dozen fanatics and bringing more into the fold takes time. However, each one is a practicing magus of some small skill, largely focused on summoning the
minions of the gods you all worship. They are able assistants in rituals and while not offensively
focused themselves, can serve as effective weapons against normal folk. They also see you as
something of a divine prophet, even more easily controlled than the actual puritans above. Either
way, the church also holds significant amounts of valuable relics and art, good for emergency funds
and prettying up the service."
581,,200,El Dorado,Fate/Legends - Strange New World,Domain ,"At last, we find out where the lost city of El Dorado was. In your backyard. At least a good portion of
it. These several massive temples and surrounding buildings are entirely made of gold, filled with
golden treasures and furnished with golden furnishings. Even the water fountains are liquid gold. There are no magical treasures to be found, beyond whatever keeps all this gold in such good
condition and so plentiful, but it makes for quite the perfect roost for any dragon-like being. And if
you’re so crass, there’s a very, very large amount of money to made from selling bits of this stuff off. Not that anyone but you will get the chance, given the hefty supernatural wards that prevent others
from reaching this place or finding it at all without heavy duty magic of their own."
582,,200,Witch Shaft Umbrella,Angel Notes,Domain,"A gigantic prison-castle, made from solid iron and covered from outside to inside in massive chains. The Witch Shaft Umbrella prison is a very special prison, in that it only holds a single prisoner but
that prisoner, so long as they are subdued and cannot fight back, may be imprisoned without regard
to size or power or abilities. They cannot break out, even once they’ve awoken, but it is potentially
possible for others to break in. As the warden of this prison, you’ll be unable to be imprisoned within
and can decide what being is held captive if you can bring a subdued creature to the castle."
583,,200,Flower Power,Fate/Legends - Garden of Avalon,Domain,"Not many can match the grace and beauty that you possess, even if you are a man and your
competitors are the finest maidens in the land. Maybe that beauty comes from your close
connection with flowers? They do happen to sprout around you quite often. In fact, unless you
purposefully prevent it, you will be surrounded by a small field of flowers at all times. This field even
appears to override any environmental or world traits that might normally apply in the area you are
within and will grow larger the more beautiful you yourself are. With practice, you may even be able
to control what flowers are produced, should you be in a mood for particular kinds. Even when not
producing flowers however, you will possess a wonderful fragrant scent about you."
584,,200,Lordship,Fate/Legends - Garden of Avalon,Domain ,"No longer are you among the common knights, wandering in search of a liege to live under. Now
you’re a bit more important. You’re a lord of the land, possessing your own fortress castle and a
large area of land around it, along with the towns and serfs that populate them. You do pay tax to
your lord but have a great deal of wealth and men of your own now. In future worlds, you’ll retain a
similar title and territory, though it may take on different forms depending where you are."
585,,200,Ladies Lake,Fate/Legends - Garden of Avalon,Domain ,"A gorgeous glade of your own, with a small but totally pristine lake. This place is totally free of
corruption and filth, regardless of where you are, and the waters of the lake can hide from detection
anything submerged in them. If you stay in this glade for a time, you will find that heroes and those
destined to become heroes often come to visit you. By accident or with some purpose, it becomes
an excellent way to find those looking for assistance or willing to offer it."
586,,200,Mage’s Workshop ,Lord El-Melloi Case Files,Domain,"This is a warehouse attachment, though it can be imported into
future jumps instead. Either way it is perfect for any aspiring thaumaturgic researcher, a
structure of your design the size of a manor house that’s all set up for magical
experimentation, with an empty surrounding area, and all necessary equipment provided. It’s self-maintaining and has all the relevant utilities. As a bonus, something about it
reduces the severity of any and all laboratory disasters by an order of magnitude, though
resources, samples, and test subjects will have to be procured elsewhere…"
587,,200,Breaking and Entering ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Domain,"A shinigami would be the worst at their job if a simple barrier could keep them out. You can easily sense secret worlds and follow secret paths into them, ones their creator doubtlessly thought proof against lesser creatures. Should someone try to bar any entrance, you are more than capable of straight up breaking in, though whether you will need brute force or more creative thinking will depend on the kind of obstacle you’re up against. This works on mundane barriers as well as supernatural ones.
"
588,,200,Proper Facilities ,Kamen Rider Neo-Heisei Part 2,Domain,"You can’t get things done just by tooling around in a warehouse or out on the streets. You need the right place, and the right space to work and reach for the stars! For most(read: those who aren’t Academics), this manifests as a small research lab with some eager interns...It’s kind of an esoteric place, as the research is sort of renown as a Blue Sky facility. After all, you’re looking into absurd-sounding power sources like Magic and Cosmic Energy. You have a good store of data on its historical relevance and the abstract theories of both, if not any practical usage. Academics, however, have a bit more responsibility in addition to this...but a lot more potential. Academics may find they’re now in charge of or otherwise deeply able to affect the policies of a very well-off academy for talented and unique youngsters, with a good standing that is extremely difficult to tarnish. These students all have something to bring to the table, even if it’s not immediately obvious. Perhaps you can bring out their inner star...or their last hope.
"
589,,200,Bloodchips and Stock ,Kara no Kyokai,Domain,"Shirazumi’s personal drug, his attempt at making others into those like him with a mix of his blood and supernatural compounds, was never going to work. It just became a very nasty poison, giving a long and slow death to those that took too much. You’ve got a supply of this deadly drug, as well as the tools to make your own. Your own private little drug making laboratory, tucked in deep to the hidden alleyways and warehouses, along with quite the supply of materials to use in making illegal substances. The supply restores, enough to potentially cover selling to a large section of Mifune City’s underworld, and you even have a slowly restoring supply of low level supernatural ingredients, often the bodily fluids of Magi or minor supernatural beings. 
"
590,,200,Cloak of Levitation ,DC Occult,Domain,"​An indestructible magical cape that moves according to the wearer’s will. This cape is a masterfully enchanted object that allows the wearer to fly at the speed they can move without the need to expend any of their magical energy, and considerably faster if they pour on the magic."
591,,200,Black Wings ,Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline,Domain,"Did something or someone set you free...or bind you with grief?​ A pair of magical wings can sprout from your form, made of energy and entirely malleable in shape and size. This enables you to fly at your running speed, and merely having them revealed like this greatly increases your own agility. If you’re someone with...well, problems, you may choose to manifest these as wings of Grief, like Homura Akemi herself will eventually end up using.
"
592,,200,HIDDEN GROTTO ,Wolfwalkers,Domain,"A cave in a hidden valley, self-sufficient in food and water. Cave paintings tell the hidden history of the world you’re in, and convey some instructions in the magic or powers of the world - as applicable - and updating in each Jump."
593,,200,Magical Warding ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Domain,"The runes and spells inscribed into the walls and interior of your tomb protect it from physical and magical damage, as well as protecting the inhabitants from magical spells. Each tier of this option grants a greater level of protection. At the first tier of 200TP, the magic will ward away giant catapults and battering rams, along with protecting the tomb from all but the strongest of wizards of this world when they are casting alone. (CG Note: Requires Tomb - Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings first.)
"
594,,200,Magical Warding - Boosted (Mid-Tier),Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Domain,"For 400TP, this magic extends so that not even dragons or giants could dent the walls of the tomb, even after days of pounding. The protections against magic will ensure that even the mightiest of mortal, or many immortal, wizards find no purchase on or within your tomb, though this may change if they can find outside empowerment. (CG Note: Requires base Magical Warding - Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings first.)
"
595,,200,Magical Warding - Boosted (High-Tier),Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Domain,"For 600TP, your tomb could survive a titan flinging a great pyramid into it, explosives that could pulverise entire castles or the blows from the strongest of artefacts, though that last one may batter through after days of effort. The warding runes are such that even Nagash himself with his Black Pyramid would not be able to penetrate the tomb with magic, not without exhausting every shred of power within that fell creation. (CG Note: Requires Magical Warding - Boosted (Mid-Tier) - Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings first.)
"
596,,200,Mobility ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Domain,"Perhaps the biggest weakness of your tomb, which may otherwise serve as an excellent base, is that it is immobile. This gives you a chance to fix that. For 200TP, you may give your tomb a set of legs to walk on. Whether it be a thousand centipede legs, 8 spider legs or two humanoid legs, it will allow your tomb mobility, controlled by yourself from a room within the tomb. (CG Note: Requires Tomb - Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings first.)
"
597,,200,Make It Bigger ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Domain,"The tombs of Nehekhara grew and grew over time, as each King competed to have his resting place be ever grander than his predecessors. It was not until Nagash created his Black Pyramid that the majesty and size of the first great King Settra’s tomb was conquered. Now you have the chance to make something that can be seen from across the desert. Each purchase of this option, up to a max of three, will increase the size of your tomb significantly. Greater size will also influence and expand several options later in this section, so it can be quite costly. For 200TP, your pyramid become several times as wide at the bases and reach heights of up to 400 metres into the air. (CG Note: Requires Tomb - Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings first.)
"
598,,200,Make It Bigger - Boosted (Mid-Tier),Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Domain,"For 400TP, your tomb will become the equal of Settra the Imperishable’s, standing at a colossal 800 or so metres tall and being proportionately wide. (CG Note: Requires base Make It Bigger - Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings first.)
"
599,,200,Make It Bigger - Boosted (High-Tier) ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Domain,"For 600TP, it will stand level with the Black Pyramid itself, at just under two kilometres into the air and wide enough to store a small city within it’s base. (CG Note: Requires Make It Bigger - Boosted (Mid-Tier) - Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings first.)
"
600,,200,Teleportation ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Domain,"You are able to teleport to anywhere within eye range near instantly.
"
601,,200,Mirror World Transfer ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Domain,"You now know how to move into the Imaginary numbers region of a world. This allows you to move into a duplicate of the real world with nothing living there and any damage caused not harming the real world. The size of the area is restricted to the equivalent size of a football field.
"
602,,200,Creep Cave ,Warhammer Fantasy: Amazons,Domain,"A dark, dank place to call home. This small home is found in a dark cave, surrounded by a dark swamp, in a dark part of the jungle. Not many living things come near here and people are definitely made to feel very uncomfortable by the mere presence that suffuses this place. It doesn’t seem to affect you though, allowing you to have an isolated, quiet life. The dark home seems to enhance darker magic that is performed here as well, such as necromancy or blood magic, enabling it to have significantly more power than normal."
603,,200,Karaoke Parlor ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Domain,"A karaoke establishment with a vast range of different songs for customers to try out – any song you have heard before. Each room even has a background screen that can play images to complement your song (even personal scenes that don’t make sense to be there). It is bound to be a hit wherever you set it up, but there is something else to it as well. Each karaoke booth has a machine to give you a score after each song. For normal, non-magical people, the machine works fine, but when magical beings visit, things are much different. No matter how their singing is, as long as no magic was used, the meter will give a very low score. The singers will become increasingly frustrated and determined to get a high score at any cost, even if it means using magic or transforming right there. As soon as magic is detected in the vicinity, an alarm goes off in your private office, and you can use the security cameras to locate your quarry.
"
604,,200,Training Grounds ,Lyrical Nanoha,Domain,"Interesting. It looks like a bunch of spare parts and some blueprints regarding some easy-to-assemble practice Drones and targets for magic, along with a big flat of land to build it on. With a bit of work, you could setup a nifty training ground for magical ability or physical fitness. Maybe even an obstacle course or two without fear of accidentally killing yourself or any trainees you pick up. Good way to sharpen your skills. This can become a Warehouse attachment post-jump, or be dropped in a secluded area in your next jump, being in the same setup as you left it last.
"
605,,200,Jichinsai 「地鎮祭」,Golden Sky Stories,Domain,"The Jichinsai is a human ritual to call the guardian spirit into the area – but the humans never realize that the guardian spirit was probably there all along. As a guardian spirit, you can claim a territory as your own, up to the size of a small village. This is your domain to protect, and once you decide on one, you can’t change it until a substantial amount of time has passed.

Within your domain, your rate of recovery for all matters such as health or magic improves dramatically, and you gain the respect of those who enter the domain. However, that isn’t the point of being a guardian spirit – you defend this area, and as such, it will flourish under your stewardship. For as long as you mark a domain as yours and protect it, all life will grow vibrantly within it.
"
606,,200,A Barrier of Perspective ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Domain,"You have an extensive understanding of the arts required to create Gensokyo in the first place. Gensokyo’s boundary works off of perspective – one could travel between two similar barriers (such as between Gensokyo and the Lunar Capital) without ever leaving Gensokyo, but at the same time if they were to ever try to fly to the edges they’d “see” themselves travelling great distances while not actually moving at all, only discovering how little they moved when they turn around. You could use this easily to craft your own sealed dimensions.
"
607,,200,Making Holes ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Domain,"You can create a hole in any physical barrier, such as walls and even the ground if you wished to travel underground. Holes you make can travel any distance, the only limitation being they must be between two places. They may be any diameter, though ones smaller than you will likely not be very useful. You could also use this to make someone fall into a deep hole if you want to be mean.
"
608,,200,Escape Artist ,DC Occult,Domain,"Either you learned it for putting on shows or out of necessity after being hog-tied for the upteenth time, you're become adept at escaping. Handcuffs, cages, or being blindfolded and chained up in the trunk of a car, you can escape from just about anything. You're not Houdini, but you're not too far behind, either.
"
609,,200,Fit Just Right ,Peter Pan,Domain,"Each Lost Boy gets to the Home Below the Ground through his own personal tree, which has been carefully hollowed out by Peter to fit only you. It is therefore critical that your proportions never change, so you have learned to wiggle your body just right so that you can always slide down the tree without getting stuck. You can now fit through any tight gap easily without getting caught. Your success getting into your tree stems half from your physical efforts, and half from your heartfelt wish that the tree is wide enough to fit you, which is thus made real by Neverland’s magic. Accordingly, the world itself will bend so that the gaps are just wide enough to slip through. However, the difficulty in using this jump increases with the size difference between you and the gap; if an opening is just a little too small for you, that’s easy enough, but good luck trying to enter a mouse hole as Godzilla.
"
610,,200,Private Apartment ,Peter Pan,Domain,"At a place of your choice in Neverland, you now have a small, veiled alcove, no larger than a bird cage, that opens up to your private quarters, with all of the amenities and decorations you need. The furniture is some of the most classic and prestigious of fairy works, and the home has the feeling of a nose turned permanently up. No matter your size, you can shrink down to enter – and so can anyone given a personal invitation by you to visit. Due to its small size, enemies will never notice its presence, allowing you to spy on them if they pass it by. After you finish the jump, it is attached to your warehouse, but you can place it in a new location in another jump if you find a good place.
"
611,,200,Always Another Tunnel ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Domain,"Sometimes you need to make an escape. The heretic proves too strong, or your lead was an ambush. Luckily for you, a Grey Wizard always has a way out. Whenever you find yourself surrounded or pursued by enemies, Ulgu itself guides you along paths that will conceal you from their eyes and allow your flight to proceed relatively unmolested. It is up to you to follow these paths, but now at least you’ll never be caught with your back to a wall.
"
612,,200,Grey Tunnels ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Domain,"This small collection of secret tunnels, inconspicuous alleyways, secret compartments, and trapdoors is yours to place within any city or village you wish to operate in on a mid-to-long-term basis. Hidden from view with simple tricks of light and shadow or enough Ulgu to hide entrances in plain sight, these tunnels would let you cross even a city the size of Altdorf in utmost secrecy. Rooms for hiding all sorts of items (or yourself) are carefully marked with the sword code of the Grey Order to ensure the utmost safety and secrecy while you protect the unsuspecting people from themselves. Relocating your network to another city, town, or village is as simple as wishing it so, and none shall be any the wiser.
"
613,,200,Irene’s Broomstick ,Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds,Domain,"“All right, Irene's Taxi here. That'll be 9,999 Rupees. Nah, just messing with your head. I couldn't take money from you. So buckle up.”

This mundane-looking broomstick has been enchanted to make it rideable through the skies. Just by sitting atop it and pointing it in the way you wish to go, the broomstick will begin to fly in that direction. Although riding it will pose a challenge at first, you will undoubtedly learn how to control the broomstick’s speed and movements more precisely with practice, perhaps helped by a certain witch?

614,,200,Sanctuary ,Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past,Domain,"And this is where the passageway that Zelda told Link about led. A small church to the north of the Royal Castle, tended to by one of the Sages. More importantly, it had enough magical barriers that not even Agahnim’s new army could break through. He had to sneak in through an undefended entrance in order to get in. You might want to be careful to close that behind you by the way. But I digress - when your castle is taken, your home in flames, and as your other safe haven's fall, the barriers on this place will grow ever stronger. When you have nowhere else to go, when all else fails, you can always come here to take sanctuary.
"
615,,200,Apple Orchard ,Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past,Domain,"When all was said and done, two versions of Link chose to leave the land of Hyrule in an attempt to protect the Triforce from any more would be thieves. The other two stayed with Princess Zelda, and of those two only one remained a knight. The other one went back to the life he had before hearing her voice in his head, that of an apple farmer. You now have a small plot of land containing a small home fit for two, and of course a decently sized orchard of apples. Said trees will grow into delicious fruits will the bare minimum of care, and if you take great pains to give them the best you can give, they will occasionally pop out an enchanted apple, capable of healing any injury short of death. If you took ‘The Fruit of One’s Labor’, you can change this from apples to whatever you chose previously.
"
616,,200,Flippers ,Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening,Domain,"Magic flippers that only appear on your feet when you need them to. They allow you to swim better than you normally good and let you fight the current pretty well. You can also hold your breath a lot longer than you normally could.
"
617,,200,Roc's Feather ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages,Domain,"The Roc’s Feather is an interesting little thing. Plucked from some divine bird in ages past, anyone who holds onto it finds themselves with enhanced jumping capabilities. A child who could only jump two or three feet would find themselves doing twice that with ease. If you were to combine it with a Pegasus Seed, you’d find yourself moving vast distances without touching the ground. In addition to the feather itself, you also get a Quicksand Ring, which lessens the effect of forced movement upon you - that is, quicksand, conveyor belts, heavy wind currents... It’s an odd effect, but useful.
"
618,,200,Skeleton Key ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons,Domain,"So many of the Hall of Essences, the dungeons, and the temples of whatnot are designed as puzzles, requiring you to go all over the place and look for a key of some kind in order to progress further. Wouldn’t it be nice if you could just... Skip all that nonsense? Thankfully, you can. This small key, seemingly made out of bone, can open up locks of any kind. Well, not any kind. There is a small catch. While the lock can be a magical lock, it still has to be an actual lock. While that does mean it could undo a thousand year old seal so long as it was tied to a keyhole, it does make it not so useful if you need to swipe a passcard instead.
"
619,,200,Treetop Shrine ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons,Domain,"By now you should know that the Maku Tree represents a truly staggering amount of magical energy, most of it tinted with the colors of nature. With that in mind, it should come as no surprise that a fully grown and a fully empowered Maku Tree is infested with fairies. Specifically, atop its limbs are a number of small caverns made from branches and leaves, and inside each one is a weak fairy. Now, in and of themselves, they aren’t terribly strong. Make no mistake, each one can heal you of the most grievous wounds, but they would only be able and or willing to do so once. However, every now and then one of them might find or make something useful to you - fairies are often pretty important to the hero's journey, you know? But, since future jumps likely won’t have a Maku Tree unless you go out of your way to make one, the Shrine can relocate itself to any heavily wooded forest, jungle, or similar local, often near your starting location.
"
620,,200,Witch’s Broomstick ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons,Domain,"In northern Holodrum there lies a town known as the Sunken City. In that city lives a woman named Syrup and her grand-daughter, Maple. They are witches, and do witchy things like brew potions (expensive but worth it) and ride around on broomsticks. Well, Maple does. Syrup mostly just tends the shop and makes potions from the ingredients that Maple gathers. That aside, you have somehow gotten your hands on a flying broomstick of similar make and model to theirs. Maybe it actually is Maples, and she gave it to you after she upgraded to a vacuum cleaner? Yes, that's a thing."
621,,200,Roc’s Feather ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons,Domain,"The Roc’s Feather is an interesting little thing. Plucked from some divine bird in ages past, anyone who holds onto it finds themselves with enhanced jumping capabilities. A child who could only jump two or three feet would find themselves doing twice that with ease. If you were to combine it with a Pegasus Seed, you’d find yourself moving vast distances without touching the ground. Alongside this feather comes the Roc Ring, which mildly decreases your weight, allowing you to step on less than solid footing without it crumbling beneath you.

Normally you can only use one Ring no matter what. Gear Rings can be used without penalty.
"
622,,200,One On One ,Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess,Domain,"Sometimes you just need to beat down a hero without any of their pesky friends trying to help them. When that happens, you know a special, magical technique that will create an impenetrable wall around you and your opponent, preventing them from escaping and anyone else from trying to help them until one of you is dead. You can add more than just one enemy to the arena if you’d like, but for each ally it encompasses there must also be at least one additional enemy. This technique can also be used to seal doors behind people to similar effect, if you’d prefer something a little more ominous."
623,,200,Recorder ,The Legend of Zelda,Domain,"This magical whistle has a nice sound to it, and it can open certain secret passages in the world as well as harm sound-sensitive enemies, but it’s chief use is that it is capable of allowing you to transport yourself to dungeons you have already defeated."
624,,200,Recorder ,Legend of Zelda: The Adventure of Link,Domain,"This magical whistle has a nice sound to it, and it can open certain secret passages in the world as well as harm sound-sensitive enemies, but it’s chief use is that it is capable of allowing you to transport yourself to places you’ve been before - though where you can set as a warp point depends on if it can be considered a “safe place” such as a forest clearing or an anteroom.
"
625,,200,Pegasus Boots ,Legend of Zelda: Hero of Worlds,Domain,"Increase your speed drastically, but sacrifice your control almost completely for a wild charge."
626,,200,Brush of Truepaint ,The Elder Scrolls,Domain,"One of the incredibly rare Aedric Artifacts, this paintbrush is said to have been fashioned from Dibella's own hair. The brush allows the wielder to enter a painting canvas and create things simply by painting them, even living creatures like trolls."
627,,200,Hearthfire - Alchemy Tower ,The Elder Scrolls,Domain,"For the budding alchemist, there's no place better for practicing their craft. With expertly crafted alchemical tools, and plenty of space to store a large number of both alchemical ingredients and potions, it's the best place to be.

(CG Note: Requires Hearthfire - Basics - The Elder Scrolls first.)"
628,,200,Hearthfire - Enchanting Tower ,The Elder Scrolls,Domain,"The art of enchanting is a delicate thing, so it pays well to have an area where it can be performed safely. For those trained in enchanting, this is the perfect place to practice your craft, with an enchanting table as well as a station where you can create your own magic staves.

(CG Note: Requires Hearthfire - Basics - The Elder Scrolls first.)"
629,,200,Hearthfire - Magical Protection ,The Elder Scrolls,Domain,"Magic is a powerful force in this world, and is great for protecting buildings. Your walls are stronger, and are resistant to magical attacks. There are also multiple magical traps for anyone stupid enough to attack your home. It also helps keep your home at an ideal temperature at any point in the year, just as an added bonus.

(CG Note: Requires Hearthfire - Basics - The Elder Scrolls first.)"
630,,200,Hearthfire - Teleportation Grid ,The Elder Scrolls,Domain,"Aren't you just tired of walking everywhere, and want a more magical solution? In a fair amount of rooms within your home, there's a pad where you can teleport to other pads inside your home. You also now know a special spell, allowing you to teleport yourself back to your home, which you can teach to others.

(CG Note: Requires Hearthfire - Basics - The Elder Scrolls first.)"
631,,200,Fruits Of The Forest ,Genshin Impact,Domain,"There are many different ingredients and materials in this world that you are unlikely to find in any other. With professions such as alchemy relying on these very things, it would be remiss if you didn’t have access to those items later. As and when you wish, you may enter into this moderately sized space filled with lush plant life and creatures in a variety of environments. In many ways this space would appear similar to that of a pocket realm or Domain. Every few days any plants or animals that have been harvested will reappear, though rarer species such as regisvines and the like will take longer. In future worlds, you can add other species to the space by simply bringing them inside."
632,,200,Mountain Of Rock ,Genshin Impact,Domain,"A blacksmith is worthless if they don’t have any ore to work with. Teyvat is home to many kinds of ores. Some ores are mundane, while some are far less so. You have gained access to a space containing a rather large mountain. Dotted around, on, and inside the mountain is a veritable cornucopia of ores waiting to be mined. From common iron and white iron ores, to crystal chunks and jadeite deposits, to even the rare starsilver and electro crystals, they all can be found in varying amounts. Any ore harvested will reappear in a week or so. When you enter new jumps in the future, new mountains will appear. Unique ores can be added to those mountains by simply bringing some raw samples inside the space."
633,,200,Boundary Of Death,Genshin Impact,Domain,"It is rumoured that the directors of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlour have the ability to walk between the realms of life and death. Quite the tall tale, but not as fanciful as one might expect. In fact, they simply know how to arrive in a place between life and death, a place deep in the earth where departed souls with longings still for the living world gather before they move on. You know of the route to this place, which will appear in future jumps too."
634,,200,Steps In The Air,Genshin Impact,Domain,"Some of the beings within this world have the ability to float. Spirits of the elements, abyss mages, and even the Traveler's trusty companion Paimon are able to walk through the air as if it were solid ground. Like these beings, you too have the ability to float. By expending your energy in a minute but steady flow, you can levitate off the ground and move about as fast as if you were on land. Doing this does drain your stamina in the same way walking or running the same distance would, but it will make navigating up rocky mountains and plains much easier."
635,,200,Rod of Discord ,Terraria,Domain,"A rod that can be used to teleport short distances. It will automatically compensate to ensure that you don’t teleport into rock or telefrag yourself. It requires a very small amount of magic to use, but this version does not induce Chaos State when used in rapid succession."
636,,200,Magical Laboratory ,World Seed,Domain,"Now this is a fitting lab for an aspiring scientist, mad or not. It has all the tools and equipment needed to contain and study any kind of magical creature and phenomenon, or to bring arcane secrets of the universe to light. And should you ever not have the right machinery at hand for whatever you want to do, the lab will upgrade itself and produce what you need in an instant. Now, the only thing holding you back will be the limits of your own intelligence. After this jump, it will attach itself to your warehouse, and may appear in any location you desire in other worlds you might visit."
637,,200,Grave Matters ,Konosuba,Domain,"Few enough can afford a proper send-off these days. Graveyards like the one you find next to a property of your choice that you own or connected to your warehouse are just such things, filled with the restless dead and unsent spirits. It’s a large graveyard too, hundreds of graves that will be regularly refilled on a yearly basis, though those interred will be mostly ordinary people or low level adventurers. If you’re wanting the beginnings of an undead army it can help or you could just make yourself feel good by helping these guys on their way to the afterlife."
638,,250,Bat Castle,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Domain,"A vast palace that lies abandoned and empty. Who would leave such a fabulous fortification, so
thoroughly decked in luxury and wealth? The reality is that it is far from abandoned and the locals
are well aware, for it has a supernatural resident. That being yourself. This large Japanese castle is a
place of power for you, enormously raising your statistics while present inside. Youkai of middling
power become powerful enough to contend with Tamamo the Fox. Not that such power is obvious, as your presence is easily concealed while within the castle grounds. Only the sharpest of magical
senses can find your presence while within, even if you stood right in front of an otherwise eagle
eyed hunter. 

The castle can be summoned to your location, in full or miniature form, and so quickly that it can
even defend from attacks. Magical spells find themselves sputtering out harmlessly against the
instantly manifested walls of your castle. With some confidence in you, the castle can also attack on
it’s own, physically animating to crush your enemies. Who knows what form this might take, anything from levitating parts of it’s materials to transforming into some sort of mechanised
humanoid being. For a more reasonable use of the castle while outside of it’s grounds, you can also
temporarily summon the boosting and presence concealing effects to aid you and small groups of
allies near you. By declaring where you are standing as your territory, you can benefit for a few
minutes from those powers and even focus them towards Endurance, Strength, Agility or Mana
specifically to greatly enhance the boost at the cost of the other benefits.

In future worlds, the castle may remain as such or take on a fitting form, such as a known to be
haunted mansion or skyscraper. For the payment of 50CP extra, you can also create a secret room
hidden deep within the castle that can only be described as a NEET’s paradise, a luxurious
bedroom/living room that contains every delight a modern day Japanese nerd might want, even
including limitless electricity and junk food. Somehow, if you have the money, you can also place
orders for more media or collectors items to be delivered. "
639,,300,Endless Tower ,Valkyrie Crusade ,Domain,"A tower that continues seemingly endlessly into the sky. This endless tower contains an equally endless number of floors, upon which one can battle Archwitches. As you defeat these bosses and steadily climb the tower, the Archwitches on each floor will slowly grow in strength. This is a good place to host competitions or hone your skills."
640,,300,Witchgate,Valkyrie Crusade ,Domain,"Upon walking through the stone gate, you will be transported onto a seemingly infinite staircase within an endless blue misty void. Within this mystical realm, while traversing the stairs, you may encounter past enemies whom you may test yourself on. After walking for an hour, you will reach a large platform and find yourself confronted with a ‘boss’; a particularly powerful enemy you have fought in the past. Once defeated, you may continue on your way."
641,,300,Summoning Hall,Valkyrie Crusade ,Domain,"This parthenon look-a-like is used for any and all kinds of summoning magic. Within here, summonings can be carried out in safety without the danger of a harmful backfire. Anything like wild demons that may be summoned by accident will be unable to harm the summoner while within these walls. Summoning magic performed in here will be done better, with better results and with a higher chance at success."
642,,300,Elemental Hall ,Valkyrie Crusade ,Domain,"A large stone hall filled with glowing crystals and overgrown vines. Within this hall is an atmosphere rich in elemental energy. Each day, the type of the energy within will change, cycling through the four elements. Occasionally, the mana may spawn forth an elemental being that can be defeated in order to obtain its core of crystallised elemental mana."
643,,300,The Gates of Somewhere,Cereza and the Stray Demon,Domain,"Many powerful beings in this world have a personal realm bound to themselves, that they can open some sort of portal to at will. Regardless of your power, somehow you’ve become attuned to one such place. It has approximately as much developed, liveable-for-humans space as a forest glade or a very large bar-though beyond that, it is an arbitrary pocket dimension clearly shaped by, or even embodying, supernatural forces. Whether it is an enchanted fairy glade bound to you or a shard rent from Inferno, this pocket dimension greatly bolsters all your supernatural powers from this world. Spells, artifacts or some other great working have been inlaid into its geography, empowering you for great magical workings-whether benign or malicious."
644,,300,Potion Maker’s Trove,Warhammer Fantasy: Dark Elves,Domain,"This structure contains virtually everything a potion maker could want to recreate or innovate on the alchemic concoctions of the Dark Elves meant to empower rituals and individuals, rather than merely bring a venomous death. It may either be a Warehouse attachment, or a hidden chamber for a structure you purchase here or already own. The snarling visages of several elven gods scowl down into an enchanted basin vast enough to be a menacing swimming pool, while all around it shelves of reagents from distant lands provide everything an aspiring sorceress’ heart could ask for. Troll blood, chimera bile, the heart of a Blackspine Mountain Griffon and many more reagents fit for potions of truly great power can all be found somewhere in the shelves lining this pool.

A shadow daemonette who claims to hail from a planet yet to be gladly restocks anything used up for either trifling amounts of currency, or the most meagre of blood sacrifices. Oddly she utterly denies any alliance with Slaanesh, and claims her own benefactor has allowed this arrangement in the hope of currying favour for new allies against the Dark Prince."
645,,300,Broodchamber,Beast: The Primordial,Domain,"Somehow, your Lair produced a new kind of Chamber connected directly to your Heartchamber. In this Chamber, your Horror can produce eggs that will hatch into larval Horrors that share your Family. These eggs aren't necessarily produced like an animal's would be, or even look like eggs. For example, a covetous king Horror may have a vault as his Broodchamber where he produces treasures that contain larval Horrors by searching through his collection until he finds one, even if that particular treasure wasn't there moments before. The Broodchamber naturally produces one a week unless you will it not to, but you can spend Satiety to produce more eggs if need be.

If you're a Hero and lack the Hunting Grounds perk, you get a Chamber connected to your Warehouse containing an egg-laying Horror of a Family of your choice. It will still produce one egg a week, but will not be able to produce more unless you find some way to feed it. Further purchases are possible for both Beasts and Heroes, with further purchases granting new Broodchambers dedicated to other Families connected to either your Lair or Warehouse."
646,,300,Hunting Grounds,Beast: The Primordial,Domain,"The number of Chambers a Beast may claim is usually dependent on the strength of their Lair, but that is no longer true for you. You can claim Chambers without having a cool down period, and your Lair can contain an unlimited number of Chambers. Not only that, but they're harder to break than usual if you don't want them destroyed, and their durability increases not just from the power of your Lair, but how powerful you are in general. This increased durability goes double for your Heartchamber. Someday, your soul may become a world unto itself. Heroes gain a Lair, but unless they take Trait-er, they don’t possess any Lair Traits of their own."
647,,300,Monstrous Migration,Beast: The Primordial,Domain,"Beasts can force open any supernatural gate through an act of will as long as they have some understanding of it and their resolve is strong. Not only are you more skilled at opening such gateways, making it about as difficult as turning a doorknob, but you can even see these gates and keep them open as long as you like. Furthermore, by opening a supernatural gateway, you automatically gain basic knowledge about the rules and inhabitants of that place. Forming Family Ties with a native of that realm will also allow you to survive there if the standard conditions of the place would normally be perilous or inhospitable to you. Gates warded by beings more powerful than you may still prove beyond your capability to open, but even they will offer you less trouble than they normally would."
648,,300,Master of Paths,Beast: The Primordial,Domain,"Primordial Pathways are useful things. They not only allow you to get into your Lair, but they can also be used to go to other places as long as the conditions are right. The problem is they can be difficult to open. This isn't a problem that you suffer from. While opening a Primordial Pathway still requires the location to resonate with your Lair, actually opening it is as simple as jumping into a river and following the current. Since Incarnate Beasts can already do this, if you ever become one, you can instead create hidden portals between two locations that anyone who shares Family Ties with can see and open."
649,,300,Don’t,Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Domain,You have the ability to bring cursed energy into other jumps. Not just that but also the ability to bring in other power systems. The catch is the consequences of these energies. Cursed energy will cause cursed spirits to appear and they will also generally be equal to the power of the setting. Also you can decide if this is a new thing that happens upon your arrival or if it is something that has existed since forever. This will inevitably change the way the plot goes Jumper so be careful. Although the amount of deaths that will more than likely happen will be horrific.
650,,300,Ars Magus: Slepnir,Blazblue,Domain,"Taking the form of a white pair of running shoes, Slepnir allows a user to run so fast, they appear to have eight legs. Using Slepnir, an average user can reach a top speed of around 200 mph. Slepnir also provides immunity to damage from wind resistance and the shock caused by a sudden stop (This does not include the blunt trauma one suffers from hitting a solid object), as well as the ability to turn and brake on a dime - But not the reflexes to do so effectively."
651,,300,Trick Star,The Seven Deadly Sins,Domain,Trick Star allows the user to switch two objects or beings with each other. They must be relatively the same size but this ability makes it nearly impossible to restrain you as you can merely switch out with your opponent or someone nearby.
652,,300,A Hidden Manse ​(Tier 4),Generic Exalted,Domain,"Now we're talking. You get a Manse, the Manse of course being a piece of land that is somehow magical in some fashion or another. They're aspected towards a certain type of Essence, either elemental essence such as Wood, Water, Earth, Fire, or Air or alternatively they're aspected towards the Celestial elements such as the Sun, Moon, Stars, or even Infernal or Abyssal (which are quite rare normally). Aside from being a spot of land that you now own (as long as you can protect it) a Manse also produces a Hearthstone.

Hearthstones, when socketed into certain weapons/armor/amulets, provide both unique magical effects and act as channels of the Manse itself allowing for vastly improved regeneration of Essence. Did I mention you also regenerate Essence faster while in the Manse? Yeah, you do. Anyways there are far too many Manses to actually list here in this document so we'll just go by price. For 300cp you can get a 4dot. You can choose any Manse you want from the Core books or official supplement books for Exalted that you have paid the appropriate cost for. 

Of note is that while you can have more than one Manse only ones you purchase here will follow you between jumps, inserting themselves flawlessly into new worlds (or as an addition to your Warehouse, your choice either or). Additionally you will need at least one open hearthstone socket for every hearthstone you have if you want to make use of them. Manse's can range from the size of a small forest clearing to the size of a reasonably large nobles estate (call it 100 acres), you choose what size yours is, the more expensive the Manse you bought the bigger it can be.

653,,300,Temporal Master,The Elder Scrolls - Online,Domain,"The Psijic, unlike other less esteemed orders like the much reviled Selectives, do not engage in activities that would purposely break the Dragon. They do, occasionally however, bonk him on the head a bit. Magic that manipulates Time himself is not a toy, especially given that Akatosh is already suffering from a severe case of cosmic DID, and thus only the senior-most members of the Psijic Order are taught these ultimate techniques. You've gained the ability to create localized time distortions, such as stretching the dragon to slow the passage of time and anything in it to a crawl within 8 meters, or contract him double the speed of anything within the distortion. Once per day, or automatically if you would receive lethal damage, you may even choose to cause a minor Dragonbreak - more of a Dragon-Dent really - to fracture the timeline and undo up to four seconds.. Also grants you resistance to the confusing and potentially mind-breaking nature of Un-Time events like Dragonbreaks, time crashes, any Back to the Future style paradoxes, accidentally killing your own grandfather, accidentally making Hitler God-King of the New Holy Roman Empire, or similar temporal tomfoolery."
654,,300,Wraith,The Elder Scrolls - Online,Domain,"Though the Void embraces all its children equally, those favored by the Dread Father sometimes manifest supernatural gifts in recognition of their achievements, and now so have you. You're a force as substantial yet ephemeral as a deathly wind, blowing straight from the Void itself. From dusk until sunrise your speed, agility, and reflexes are nearly doubled, and this applies to your mounts as well."
655,,300,Roots Of Cosmic Fantasy(Additional),Fate/Grand Order Part 2,Domain,"Designed by Marisbury, created by the Alien World CHALDEAS, implemented by the Alien God, the Trees of Fantasy are one of the most impactful inventions in modern times, perhaps even the whole of human history. Looking like titanic white trees and seemingly containing a conceptual model of galaxies within, these massive trees have a variety of functions, the least of which is generating significantly more magical energy than even Holy Grails, being only one or two orders of magnitude lesser than the total output of the Sun itself. Those connected to it, or who eat the tree somehow, can tap into this energy generation for truly absurd amounts of magical energy. And while the amount of energy generation is the same regardless of its state, the Tree of Fantasy does have some form of growth, slowly fragmenting the trunk to show the galaxy within, spreading its roots across the Planet it is on, and slowly covering the sky with its branches, and going from roughly being the size of a skyscraper to very quickly growing larger than mountains, and only becoming larger and larger over time.

When fully grown, a Fantasy Tree’s branches will cover the entirety of the Planet it is rooted in, completely blocking cosmic rays and absorbing them for extra energy, as well as preventing anyone from leaving the planet. Thanks to the rules of this World this doesn’t prevent the day/night cycle from existing, even with no sun in the sky, but that may not be the case in future jumps. Additionally, it can serve as an incredibly potent vessel, with a fully grown Fantasy Tree being capable of giving you a Celestial Rank vessel, although a freshly planted one might be a couple Ranks weaker. Additionally, while growing, it can generate about a dozen seeds for itself, flying things tougher than steel that look like a sphere attached to an upside down circular pyramid. These either patrol the surroundings of the Fantasy Tree or hunt down whatever the Tree deems a threat.

And of course, it is capable of simulating a history according to ‘what-if’ parameters and manifesting it into reality as a Lostbelt. The Lostbelt itself will be separated from the rest of reality by the Storm Walls, powerful storms that require not only dimensional travel capabilities but also some way of drilling through them, and which are very lethal for most life to be near. Additionally, the borders of the Lostbelt itself will be determined by how much the Fantasy Tree’s roots have spread, potentially covering an entire Planet. If it reaches such a global scale, it’ll be able to fully replace the timeline, no longer needing the Fantasy Tree to exist. If you would like some control over your Lostbelt, and be capable of carrying one to future jumps, please refer to the Return Of An Abandoned Fantasy section below. And finally, you can buy more at 300cp, 200cp if you have a discount on the item. Oh, as a side note, you can have your Tree of Fantasy take on some other form like a cursed castle with a lot of spiny tendrils, although this won’t change how it functions, just the processes if it’s too different, such as using curses instead of branches and roots or something.

656,,300,Metaverse Navigator,Persona 5 Royal,Domain,"Oh, what do we have here? A mysterious App that appeared on your phone out of nowhere the moment you stepped foot in Tokyo. Coming along with a Smartphone if you don’t have one, this App allows you to access the Metaverse. By entering the keywords regarding a targets name, place of distortion and what the distortion manifests as, you will be able to enter the Palace of said individual should they harbor any twisted desires. For lesser targets, you can also access the Palace of the masses known as Mementos. You get this for free during your stay here but if you want to continue your Metaverse exploring shenanigans you must pay 300 CP.

Don’t worry, the Mementos accessible in future Jumps is NOT ruled over by a mad god."
657,,300,Hellgate,Diablo 3,Domain,You gained the ability to teleport! You can now teleport once per minute to either a location you can sense (either by the Location’s magical property if you know it or because of an individual there that you can sense) and leave a Hellish Rune where you come out of. About 2 Seconds after you appeared the Rune will explode in a pillar of flame burning anything that was there and (should it die) pull it into Hell. A devastating surprise to be sure...
658,,300,Citadel,Final Fantasy XV Royal Edition,Domain,"The Castle of Lucis, currently more like a skyscraper, is the true crown jewel of the kingdom of Lucis, in addition to the large courtyard and being practically a very luxurious fortress, what is expected of a modern royal castle, the Throne room has a majestic and comfortable throne that dramatically enhances your recovery, awareness and planning; a well-stocked training area; a well-kept garden; a number of remarkably fast and safe elevators; other essentials such as kitchens, bathrooms, rooms for everyone, among others; there are several very loyal guards, servants and other staff who live in the various extra rooms; Hall of History, almost a museum that details the history of the castle, its owners and prophecies; there is an energy source that powers the entire Citadel and surroundings and can support another function present in the Citadel, the ability to generate a Wall around the building as strong as the New Wall of Insomnia which can be strengthened or enlarged if it is sustained with a more powerful source; and as the last line of defense is a smaller version of the Old Wall, 3 statues based on the Lucii that awaken when their protection is needed, the statues are over 7 feet tall with the abilities of the Lucii. Certain points like the Hall of History always update in every new Jump."
659,,300,Royal Tomb ,Final Fantasy XV Royal Edition,Domain,"If you want this to be the entrance to your warehouse, you may find it strange, but the pyramids are basically warehouses and they also are tombs, and honestly they are impressive. You have a real tomb with an interesting bonus, once per Jump you can fake your death and here will appear a fake body for your “funeral” that will be indistinguishable from yours, no test, nobody, maybe not even you will recognize this body as fake until it is revealed that you are indeed alive, what you do with it is up to you. You can store items here and these will be treated as Royal Arms preventing unworthy people from stealing and using them."
660,,300,Flying Dutchman,Fate/Legends - Voyage to Valhalla,Domain,"A great ship has risen from the depths of the Sea. At your command is a mighty Galleon, ripped straight out of the Age of discovery. Its three dark masts host crimson sails and its quarterdeck seems more like a pitch-black fortress than a ships hull. It is staffed by a wisp like crew, mercilessly using their cutlasses to cut down invaders of the ship and aiding their captain in whatever way they should.

But the greatest benefit of this Ship is the concept of wandering imbued in it. There is no dock in the whole world that cannot be reached with this ship, even powerful protective barriers bypassed in the effort to go back on land."
661,,300,Vampiric Castle,Fate/Legends - Voyage to Valhalla,Domain,"What a beautiful castle this is, a shining example of nobility for the owner. With vast rooms and luxuries abound, a young lady would want for little. Any enhancements or additions to the Castle are integrated naturally and fluidly, even something as inane as a Pyramid landing on top of it. It comes staffed by young maidens who wouldn’t think much of the owners eccentrics, be it singing or something more bloody.

Indeed it seems this Castle could be used for much more violent means. Once inside it can become a labyrinth, making escaping a challenge even for quick witted individuals, though chance of escape rises the more of their fellow captives they outlive. In particular they may want to escape the dungeons, staffed with torture instruments, rooms to keep ‘pets’ until new meat arrives and a bath filled with fresh blood. A last final room in its deepest depths is a walled of chamber, only a small slit for food at the bottom for those who deserve death for the acts this castle enabled.

For an additional 100 CP in payment it also comes guarded by two strange statue like automatons, rising up against any threat to the castle."
662,,300,Lookout Room,D.Y.N. Freaks,Domain,"A private pocket of your own, one that exists just outside of any other reality. This small personal dimension cannot store anything, things you do not actively interact with in here will just be expelled back out to where they were before entering after a little while. Instead this seemingly endless place allows you to monitor the state of the entire multiverse that you find yourself in. Through little glass boxes, you will be able to look into any existing universe in your current setting, from the whole thing at once down to stuff happening on planets on a personal level. It can’t bypass magical protections against scrying but it does allow you to enter into any of the universes it can see into and come back to this one. You’re able to bookmark certain places to make sure you don’t lose track."
663,,300,Safe Asylum,D.Y.N. Freaks,Domain,"Did Asylum expand or did you start a secret organisation of your very own? You now have a pocket dimension, about as big as the average school campus in Japan, that is only accessible from your warehouse and an in-world location of your choice. Within is a large facility, again about the size of a High School but significantly better secured. Lab facilities, armouries, trained but human guards and educated staff members. It’s even got a small occult research laboratory within it, though it lacks anything like a Grimoire. It’s almost impossible for anything short of a full powered Evil God to get into this pocket dimension and even then, only the strongest could do it without difficulty."
664,,300,Constitution That Accepts Every Desire,Fate/Tale Of The Beasts,Domain,"It seems that just like Kama/Mara, you and the universe are fundamentally linked. You can now replace an area up to the size of a planet, with your own universe. You can control anything that happens in your universe using only a bit of magical energy to do so. Turning off gravity and removing the air from someone’s lungs is child’s play to you.

With enough time and practice, you can expand how big you can bring your own universe into the real one. With enough practice you could reach a point where you could replace the real universe with your own. Though beware, while you are essentially all powerful in your universe, there are people capable of striking your main body even through the universe itself.

You also have a second ability known as the Embrace Of Dreams. With this you are essentially a colony instead of a single organism. You can make copies of yourself at an incredible pace, creating dozens of them in seconds. You control your copies with incredible ease as well, controlling them as one would control a limb. Though in the end these are copies, and the death of your original body would mean the death of your copies as well."
665,,300,Titanic Compact,Scion ,Domain,"Nominally all surviving Godrealms are under constant siege by the Titans and their armies. However, even the barely sapient expansions of pure concept that are the Greater Titans have some conception of who is an ally and who an enemy. Thus, in recognition of your shared kinship you may rest assured that a Greater Titan NOT actively trying to tear down the place.

...alternatively, you could take this opportunity to cultivate a relationship with a certain Titan-and you’re not limited to the most famous ones listed above. For 600 CP some aspect of your Godrealm’s nature is so agreeable to the Greater Titan, it has partially colonised your Godrealm to form a symbiotic relationship of sorts. This is highly unusual but there is at least one precedent: Logos, the Titan of Justice who remained free simply by accepting limitations to her power, disappeared into the background behind the Egyptian, Norse and Greek pantheons. Perhaps Logos has decided your plane is more agreeable to her. Whatever the case, with this choice the Greater Titan permanently commits a portion of its infinite essence to your Godrealm in subservience to your rule, colonising yet existing in harmony with your Godrealm and protecting it with its vast resources and Titanspawn. Depending on its nature, it may sublime into its workings as Logos has chosen to or manifest more directly as a celestial structure-a Godrealm within a Godrealm, so to speak. To say nothing about how it’s cosmic power and mystical secrets could lend you power. Whether the Titan’s own Avatars follow the colony into future jumps largely depends on their individual whims, but should you be able to convince them they are considered something between magical summons and followers-being part of the Titan’s extension into your world.

666,,300,Godrealm,Scion ,Domain,"Asgard. Olympus. Tien, Iteru, Tier na nOg. The origin and formation of the famous Godrealms is mysterious indeed, arising at the same time as the gods’ own ascendancy to power in the Overworld to impose form on its limitless potential. Perhaps you’d like to carry some of that potential with you from this world? The following section will allow you to customise a divine realm of your own, ruled over primarily by yourself and any allies. It is considered your “home turf” for any and all mystical or divine purposes, and supernatural effects that incorporate your Legend are generally felt more strongly here. This section works on Godrealm Points (GP) which you may increase by converting CP to GP at a 1:2 ratio. To represent the increasing power of Legend upon the Overworld, a stipend of GP equal to the “tier” of divinity (or scope as a Titanspawn, should you have the aforementioned perks) you purchased earlier in this jump is provided to you. Thus with Dawn of Demigodhood or Nemean Evolution you would have 300 GP while with Apotheosis or Terror of Typhon you would have 600 GP.

A fair warning: All things being equal, many gods will see a new emergent Godrealm as free real estate. To say nothing of how by default Titans will see it as a new battlefront to assault. While many Godrealms are holding strong thus far, due to the risk and complexity of the ongoing sieges, should you wish you may choose to defer owning a Godrealm until after the jump at which point for obvious reasons you will no longer have to fear rival pantheons or Titans barging in.

Optionally, whether or not you take the previous option any items, companions and followers may appear somewhere in the Godrealm. And in future jumps, inactive companions may live there as well. Should you, or your companions and followers sire Scions of their own they too may come to this Godrealm upon apotheosis through its Axis Mundi and joining its pantheon.

667,,300,Aionic,Scion ,Domain,"Inured to the temporal anomalies inherent to a plane of boundless time, a maelstrom of that same misplaced time surrounds it’s native residents. Sudden bouts of decay or reversal as time flares and flickers ravage any being in their vicinity, unless the Aionic creature suppresses this effect with a single Legend point for a short while. However, gods and those with some other form of eternal youth are at least immune to direct consequences from the warped time-though their clothing and belongings may still be affected if not similarly eternal. As such, Aionic beings are immune to the Stars Purview, which regulates time as well as starlight due to an interlinked understanding of the two from ancient men, when deployed by a lesser divine being. However, not only does the Fire and Magic Purview’s effects pierce their defences but Aionic creatures also find themselves hard-pressed to defend against them."
668,,300,Sanctum,Scion ,Domain,"As a god grows into his power, his Fate and the world’s become irrevocably entwined. At least one facet of this existence is wholly to the god’s benefit: The formation or discovery (the specifics of this are unclear) of a Sanctum-a private pocket realm designed to suit the god’s every whims. While these realms usually appear in the Overworld, they can also manifest in the Underworld or terra incognita if those locations align with their nature. Such locations can be as simple or as ornate as its owner desires, shifting like clay to their whims, and will follow you in future worlds as a little slice of the Overworld (or Underworld, or a well-hidden place out of the way) you may be able to expand further with great efforts of Legend. Such sanctums can be inhabited by supernatural beings devoted to the deity such as tlaloques or nymphs, and while typically the advancement of Legend is required to grow and develop a Sanctum with your investment here you can get a leg up on other newly minted deities.

For free you may have a relatively small sanctum for a God the size of a grand mansion in the mundane world, but for 50 CP you may manually improve the scale and grandeur of your Sanctum. For 150 CP you could instead own a sanctum measured in square miles, with a large manor-sized building as the centrepiece and ample grounds appropriate to your nature. For 250 CP you could own a Sanctum enviable even to other gods: Equal to a fair-sized country in the mortal world with anything from desolate wastelands or small cities throughout it, and a central structure for your private dwelling that itself is equal to a 50-100 CP Sanctum in every way. And for an additional 50 CP you may equip your Sanctum with an Axis Mundi: A place or item that binds the mortal world to your divine sanctum by esoteric means. An example being Kalfu’s dark crossroad, which leads him to any crossroad across the planet fabled for deadly motor accidents-from which you can also use to re-enter your Sanctum.

669,,300,Unlimited Food,Fate/Hollow Ataraxia,Domain,"You can open a portal once a day to the Emiya residence for dinner. Every time you arrive there will be a fresh meal prepared for you, something guaranteed to please you. The food can also be from any universe you’ve visited. Companions, friends, and family are allowed to follow you through the portal. As to whether anyone else is there, that is your option. Each time you pop in it can be to visit the people you left behind on this jump, or to visit an alternate reality of them, or to simply be alone with no one around. Nothing but full bellies and warm memories can be taken outside of this portal and back to your realm of existence."
670,,300,A World of Many Colors,Black★Rock Shooter,Domain,"The Otherworld, the manifestation of thought and emotion whereupon the Otherselves reside inside to shoulder the burden of grief placed upon them. This is a world where this system resides naturally, but you may leave this world someday and with it the world... and the Otherselves with it.

By taking this perk, if you are an Otherself or have Otherself companions, a section of the Otherworld comes with you, in the form of your territories and it will not interfere with any other of the new world’s systems even if its extremely similar to the concept of the Otherworld (IE: The Warp from Warhammer) and thus the existence as an Otherself is safely maintained.

If you pay 300 CP, you may instead bring the system of the Otherworld and Otherselves into the entire universe that you’re going into. Allowing the Otherworld to mix more freely with the new world’s systems, morphing and changing what is or, becoming an entirely different system that everyone can still interact with as you so wish. Primarchs with Otherselves merged together? Sure, why not!

This system is toggleable so you can choose how the interaction works on a general level (does it mix with similar systems or is its own thing, does your companions and yourself just have it or does the entire world have it.) Though you can only toggle it at the start of your jump unless you’ve some way to bypass this restriction and you will be warned when the world’s systems might interfere in ways that will make your jump harder or completely unrecognizable to what it was before."
671,,300,"Cavernous Maw, Pure white Feathers",Final Fantasy XI,Domain,"A Gaping mouth containing a limitless void within, either half buried or floating eerily a few feet above the ground, the Cavernous maws have many strange properties, one property is that they allow those who bear a pure white feather to travel between alternate dimensions. Though it cannot allow you to travel between worlds you can use it to freely travel between alternate dimensions that may exist in your setting."
672,,300,Counter Earth Ring,80s Sword and Sorcery,Domain,"This ring is set with a large, red crystal of unearthly nature. Its true power is only revealed if the wearer is put into great peril. Once per jump if the wearer is about to die, or otherwise reach a ‘bad end’, it will work to transport the wearer to another reality, avoiding that fate and seeming to disappear completely. The reality it transports the wearer to could be canon to the setting if it has alternate realities, an alternate timeline, or something else, but it will tend towards a barbarian filled realm of swords and warriors, and will never be directly fatal to the wearer."
673,,300,Sage Pill Plantation,The God of High School,Domain,"A small plantation of Sage Trees, a few dozen in total, is now in a location of your choice, owned by you. These trees produce their fruit once every few years and the fruit tastes quite horrible. But they’re not eaten for please. Rather, eating a Sage Pill provides a significant increase in the user’s life energy, increasing their overall power for each pill they eat. Eventually, these pills might not provide a noticeable boost but unless you’re punching your way through mountains, they’ll be a handy snack. Normally these would be fatal for humans to eat without some sacred animal tears to go along with it but these trees will produce fruit safe for consumption by any being, not just demons."
674,,300,Godstones(Boost),Gods of Blood and Powder,Domain,"For an extra 300cp you won’t require blood sacrifices anymore to turn people into gods. Each 10 years or each jump, whatever comes first, the stones will amass enough power from the Else itself to elevate 1 person to godhood. You may still make blood sacrifices to get more gods

676,,300,Safehouse,High School DxD,Domain,"Because sometimes, you just need to hide from everyone and everything under the sun. This is a bolthole hidden underground, only accessible by a hatch that only you know the location of, located either away from civilization or in a building very few would think to look. It comes stocked with food, a self-sustaining electricity generator that powers basic utilities, and has several magical wards around it that make it difficult to detect you within. It’s not completely impossible to find, but unless someone is hell-bent on finding you specifically, it’s very unlikely."
677,,300,Ritual Room,High School DxD,Domain,"It’s a little difficult to practice complex magical formulas in public, so you came prepared. This is a room styled to your preferred magic system of choice, and all magic you personally perform within this room will enjoy both greater efficiency in mana and greater power. Also comes with spooky robes and basic ritual equipment and reagents for free."
678,,300,Space Diner,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Domain,"A cozy roadside diner, the sort any space-way traveller is glad to see. A well furnished kitchen and comfortable rooms to stay in, it’ll make either a tidy profit or a nice home to live in. Whatever end of the Galaxy it’s located on, rowdy sorts tend to make their way to it. The damage they cause can be annoying but you’ll always be meeting interesting new people with all kinds of fantastic problems. 

For an additional price, this can be upgraded to a whole space station of your own.  Like the famous one star Green Hell restaurant, this station is a much more involved experience. Your little diner/inn is more like an entire mansion or small village, with extensive facilities for just about any holiday someone could want. The rest of the station is filled with extensive biomes filled with wild ingredients, from dangerous animals to deliciously exotic plants. They might have to hunt them down themselves but any visitor is sure to enjoy eating a meal they had a hand in preparing. The space station will come with a few hundred staff attached already, skilled hospitality workers if you don’t mind that they’re all youkai of one sort or another."
679,,300,Library of Ruina,Library of Ruina V1.0,Domain,"Your own personal copy of the titular Library. This library can exist in its own dimension, but may safely materialise and deploy to an open area. Naturally it is larger on the inside and starts as a single floor, but grows to house several floors for different genres and topics. The size of a floor extends based on the number of books you own. You can freely shape the architecture and move books within with the power of your mind alone. Should you organise battles within the library, employees killed here will revive once the battle is over. A fact they forget every time battle begins. You can temporarily grant perks to hired employees within the library walls. If you have the energy and mental power to do so, you might be able to materialise objects and perhaps people from books contained within the library."
680,,300,The Purple Tear’s Set ,Library of Ruina V1.0,Domain,"Three powerful swords that, when equipped all at once, allows its wielder to automatically assume one of four stances: broad slashes, precise stabs, blunt impacts or outright focusing on defense. While in one of these stances, using the appropriate weapon seems to work better, whether by extending the range and power of attacks or repelling blows with more force. You might have noticed that there are four stances for three weapons, well, the fourth are your fists. Should one attune to all three weapons, a secondary ability is granted: the ability to travel through space and time. Although it may seem like time travel, the user actually transports themselves (and themselves only) to a variation of the world they seek. This ability is always taxing on the body and can only be safely performed once a day. It can also be blocked by those with better control of barriers and pocket dimensions."

Like Sindri you find that you are able to delve into the afterlife, or entrance to the afterlife, of your current setting to bring back someone who has recently passed away (within the past week). This can only be used once per person, per jump."
682,,300,Lunar Whale ,Final Fantasy IV,Domain,"“Birthed from womb of Dragon’s Maw, and borne unto the stars.” The Lunar Whale is a large airship, several times larger than the standard Airship. In addition to having more room, this ship is also capable of limited space flight, and able to be used to reach the moon of any planet you’re currently on, and back again, as needed. Its size makes it no faster than a normal airship, however."
683,,300,Underworld Demesne,Hades,Domain,"For those with more refined tastes, and a budget to match, the House Contractor is happy to offer to create an entire home from the ground up at a place of your choosing somewhere in the Underworld. This palace will be large enough to house both Gods and mortals with enough rooms to keep an entire entourage of each well situated and more than comfortable. There will be no need to worry about staffing such a large property, as many of the Underworld residents would leap at the chance for a change of scenery. You will find skeleton butlers, spiritualmaids,monsterous cooks, and equally unusual servants of all stripes just waiting to serve the whims of you and any guests you may invite onto the property. After your time in this world is through, you may place this property in any location you wish. It can be attached to your Cosmic Warehouse as easily as it can be set down nearby your entry point in any new world you visit."

Due to an accident when you were a teen you gained the ability to move and think at massively hypersonic speeds, on par with a veteran Viltrumite in an atmosphere. You naturally generate an aura that protects you and those around you from the effects of your speed, while also allowing you to interact with objects semi-normally. If you punch a concrete wall at top speed, your hand would be bruised as if you punched a wall while standing still but the wall itself would exploded into shrapnel from the sheer kinetic energy. This general augmentation also comes with stamina needed to run for immense distances, and lengths of time."
686,,300,Darkwing II,Invincible,Domain,"You have the ability to teleport through shadows. Each and every shadow that exists around you can be used as a portal to the Shadowverse, a parallel dimension that now attaches to every universe you visit. The Shadowverse attaches all shadows to each other through it in the universe, allowing you to gain the appearance of teleporting through the shadows as in reality you move to the Shadowverse where distance is meaningless and can pop out through any shadow in existence. The Shadowverse is a featureless black expanse inhabited by invisible Shadow Creatures, strong enough to kill young Viltrumites, and with some time even veteran Viltrumites. Normally they would attack you as well, but thanks to jump fiat they now ignore you."

For 300cp, however, you can purchase a more impressive vehicle. This might be an imperial airship, capable of swiftly moving small amounts of people and cargo to distant parts of the Isles. You could also sacrifice speed for size, netting yourself a magically-fueled mobile home for your family and friends to live out of. Whatever your choice, you can ride in style!"

It’s got a better time-compression rate than the Hyberbolic Time Chamber and is already full of dangers to train against. Thing is, time in here doesn’t count for the Jumpchain Timer, so you can’t go to a universe you want nothing to do with and spend over 63 million years in the Neverzone to train up. You have to spend the ten years dealing with the locals and their antics; you just get the chance to train and do things more quickly off-screen than others assumed you would."

And naturally, you’ll need a place to put your gains- ill-gotten or no- leading to the purchase of this not-so-humble estate. Rolling acres of land enclosed by a wrought iron and stone fence mark the edges of this property, which looms over you like a giant from a story- a massive mansion or castle that is fitted with every modern amenity, including an elevator that leads to a rather spacious and secure basement- which need not suffer from lack of refinement, as much like the home above it can be decorated with all manner of curio, artifact, or expensive furnishings. A massive library can also be found here, containing texts of interest ranging from fiction to non-fiction - many of which are also first editions, making them valuable in their own right. "
690,,300,The Great Tree,Rapunzel’s Tangled Adventure,Domain,"You gain the hollow Great Tree as a property and base of operations. The great tree is sentient and capable of defending itself and its occupants, unless you have powers that will allow you to directly communicate with plants or other sentients then you will not be able to communicate directly but will have a general sense of what it is trying to communicate. You do not gain access to the Great Tree until you either find a way to cleanse it of Zhan Tiri's corrupted magic or your jump ends and it is added to your warehouse."

This magical cloak allows one to hover and float in the air with no effort on their part, even flying at great speeds! Yet this is not all it can do, for the Cloak possesses a will of its own that makes it dedicated to its owner. It will become difficult, if not impossible to blindside the wielder as it will take steps to block attacks and alert its owner of incoming danger. If an enemy is close enough, it may even lash out and strike an opponent for you! Naturally the more you expose it to, the more it will learn and understand things in order to assist you. Does not take up a Companion Slot."
694,,300,Spiritual Chamber,Ghost Rider,Domain ,"This chamber, another attachment to your Warehouse, enhances spiritual rituals greatly; rituals that bind, unbind, summon, or even create spirits are all enhanced greatly here, making them easier and safer to do and improving the results of any experimentation that you do."
695,,300,Teleportation Circle,Ragna Crimson,Domain ,"A large-scale teleportation circle that can be used to move around the globe, even allowing for multiple people and objects to be transported in one go, provided enough magic is fed to it to activate it. Rather than this being a stationary item, you gain the blueprints and resources to deploy one of these per month. Its quality is similar to the ones that Crimson makes."
696,,300,The Gate of Truth ,Generic Alchemist ,Domain ,"An elaborately made stone door that doesn't seem to open to anything. Someone taking hold of the handle of this door will be the power of an alchemist and develop abilities similar to those described in this document. If you actually were to open the door, dozens of spiritual entities would fly free and cause materials to develop alchemical traits and give some measure of alchemical abilities to the people of this world, as if they had grasped the handle of the door themselves. If you do, you’ll get a new one at the start of your next jump."

By making a symbolic act of cutting the wielder's hesitation, this blade temporarily grants its user incredible speed, allowing them to run short distances and attack in the blink of an eye... in addition to surrounding them in swirling cherry petals, which are only there to look cool."
698,,300,Wizard's Lab,The Dresden Files,Domain ,"More of an add-on than your own separate living space, this can either be built into a Residence you own, or add a trapdoor to your Warehouse and store it underneath. It comes equipped with everything you need for magical experiments short of a stuffed crocodile hanging from the ceiling: A built-in summoning circle, shelf after shelf of weird reagents and knick-knacks, a small library of interesting books about magic and the supernatural, and an actual laboratory for making potions and enchanting objects. It's also been heavily reinforced, so any failures or spills will at worst blacken the floors."
699,,300,Valley of the Living Rock,Frozen,Domain ,"A very isolated little valley, not too far from where you start. This is a peaceful, tranquil place that will remain such no matter what happens to the outside world. Even if the entire country has been frozen over, this valley will remain untouched. There are signs of life but it seems whatever used to live here have since left as there’s only a large number of boulders left in the valley, aside from all the plants. It’s warm still and as long as you know how to survive in the wild, you’ll find plenty of edible plants and good shelter here. It’s also very difficult for anyone else to find the valley if not being led there by you."

If you want to entertain fantasies of conquest or overcoming the perils lurking in these lands, you may wish work on not dying in the process. By purchasing this, your body becomes more responsive and dexterous, your survival instincts get refined and your mind can process things just fast enough to keep up now. It feels as if an invisible weight has been lifted, and newfound ease in dodging shows it. Not only will you find it much easier to bob and weave, your skill with the basic yet crucial technique of the dodge roll is considerable. As notable side effects of your heightened coordination and sharpened mind, you can more easily mitigate the damage of great falls as well as cast spells more quickly."

A rolling stone gathers no moss, but such is the peace within that your stone-like form may pick up a bit of greenery if you wait long enough.”"
702,,300,Royal Roads ,Dark Souls 2,Domain ,"“In days long past, a pact was made between man and rat. Men would have the surface, rats would have the land below it. Although broken in some ways by man so deserving of loathing, the rats still claim the land below and know it like the back of their hand. You possess tunnels and burrows connected to whatever properties you own, territories you claim, or safe places mutually agreed upon to be yours for resting in. These remarkable shortcuts make travel between such places remarkably short despite the distances involved. In the case of new locations you claim, such tunnels always seem to have just been there, hidden by bricks or crates or some such obfuscation.”"

It brings relief to ragged bodies and aching bones just by resting near, and the fire’s edge always seems to be a safe place to sleep. Curiously, this flame seems to be a traveling companion of sorts. Whenever you are in need of rest and respite, and no hostile individuals are around, you always seem to be able to find it. There, it will continue to perform as normal, mending your flesh and easing your soul with its warmth.”"
704,,300,“Seed of Eternal Stone Archtree”,Dark Souls 1,Domain ,"A seed, and a promise, planting it will bring into existence a great stone Archtree, which will spawn more as time goes on. Eternal Stone Archtrees are similar to rock in hardness and texture, and have magic resisting properties. Their existence will cause the surrounding environment to become more stone-like over time as well, down to the creatures that inhabit it. The ideal nesting material for drakes and dragons alike due to its sturdy composition. An excellent crafting material for those who know how to make use of it."
705,,300,“Sealed Ruins”,Dark Souls 1,Domain ,"A ruin long since sealed and buried found somewhere within the world. It is heard of in myth, and legend, and contains ancient relics and dangers alike. Exceedingly difficult to locate, some version of these ruins appear in every world you visit and they’ll always contain a miscellaneous assortment of ancient dangers and treasures. Often the case, the lost civilization the ruins belonged too will still be living inside, though what monsters they may be or have become in the meantime vary from world to world. Expect scenic volcanic surroundings, booby traps, monsters that stretch the understanding of the world and horrible vermin due to the ruins often appearing in jungles. Ancient toxins, weapons of incredible design, mystics with forgotten medicinal or martial secrets, or simply relics that could fetch a fortune are often waiting to be plundered though, if you can take them."
706,,300,“Gravelord Sarcophagus”,Dark Souls 1,Domain ,"If you would like undisturbed rest, this makes a lovely bed for the dead. A large stone coffin, upon stepping inside and laying down, the dead in the area will rise from their graves and unify to make sure no harm comes to you as you sleep. At first, they’ll lay asleep like you, corpses and skeletons only getting up if someone intends to disturb your grave to attack graverobbers or move you somewhere else. The entire area’s worth of corpses and skeletons will eventually rise up to collapse on invaders as they continue their attempts to disturb you. Only mostly whole corpses/skeletons will rise. Can also be used to travel between empty grave plots in the area, though the ride feels  something is “assisting” you through the ground."
707,,300,“Painted Home”,Dark Souls 1,Domain ,"Not truly a world of your own, this large painting can sit on a normal sized wall and depicts a cozy cottage and garden surrounded by a wooden fence. If touched, one will find they can penetrate the surface, and will be sucked into the place it depicts. The cottage has the interior of a large house, the front and back yard are of a moderate size, surrounded by a wooden fence that wards visitors away from sheer cliffs that drop into endless gray nothing. This place is temperate, warm, safe and the only way out is walking off the ledge beyond the gate in the back yard. All other ways lead to long, deadly drop that deals with invaders for you."
708,,300,“Lost Grave”,Dark Souls 1,Domain ,"After purchase, a lost grave of a great hero marked with a gigantic gravestone, resisting the wears of time, appears deep within a dark forest somewhere out in the world. While many have never heard tale of them, records of such a hero can be found scattered throughout the world. It is because of this greatness that respect for their final resting place has bloomed, as the wildlife, wandering warriors, soft bandits and old heroes took up to defending it. A covenant has been formed for the defense of the the woods and the monument it contains, with something powerful waiting in the deepest sanctums. There is little honor left here besides the comradery held towards one another and the honor of laying down one’s life for the service of the resting place of an old hero and fallen allies. You’ll find no issue with looting enemy corpses should you find and ally yourself with them, but no tactic or method of combat is too severe for those who wish to push into the inner sanctum and loot the burial grounds of old relics and equipment belonging to the fallen."
709,,300,“The Bells of Awakening”,Dark Souls 1,Domain ,"Upon purchase, you ‘receive’ two large bells. These bells will be dropped off somewhere in the world in separate locations, hidden behind great challenges. You will know the general location of these bells, so seeking them out will not be difficult. Their true worth comes when you finally reach and ring them. When each bell is rang, the tone can be heard all throughout the world and parallel worlds, not through volume but through some sort of resonant nature they have. When both bells are rang, activity and change both good and bad to start sweeping through the world. Ancient sleeping beings will awaken, plans will begin to be enacted, organizations will begin to push their agendas. Whatever the case may be, things will begin to become interesting."
710,,300,Eternal Labyrinth,Bloodborne,Domain ,"“The Chalice Dungeons lying beneath Yharnam, known as the tomb of gods by some, are the root of this calamity that afflicts the city now. While Byrgenwerth and the Healing Church before you have plunged into their depths, the question must be asked. Will you?

Think of this item as opportunity; appearing at first as a series of half-buried altars that you may place as desired. To go with them, a series of chalices required to perform certain rituals. With the chalices places on the altar, and different materials used as sacrifice, you may travel to these ancient dungeons. 

Each Chalice Dungeon sports different features: horribly trapped halls, swamps of fat that have leaked from stacked corpses, especially great numbers of specific enemies like ancient workers or beasts, great and powerful foes that stand over the rest, and treasures yet uncovered. 

Even now however, the ancient Pthumerians monotonously continue to dig out and expand the labyrinth beyond any reasonable dimensions. Perhaps it exists partway into the dream lands? It would certainly explain how disparate lands could be so interconnected.

In each future world, a new altar, and a new chalice will appear. Locate the proper ingredients within that world to offer as sacrifice, and plunge into a new dungeon. Treasures and threats relating to that world, warped by the nature of this one, will be encountered if you dare search for them.”"
711,,300,A Home for Heroes,Elden Ring,Domain ,"If you’re uncomfortable doing business with the ruthless Sir Gideon, why not set up your own fortified yet comfortable hold for wandering heroes beyond the Lands Between? That’s what you’ve opted to do, and it’s been very successful thus far. This refuge is an equal in just about every way to the Roundtable, save that it is you in charge of the peace held over the disparate wanderers, adventurers, craftspeople and assorted travellers who tend to gather here. Somehow this place seems to attract those fated to accomplish great and/or terrible things in the world, it’s homey atmosphere encouraging cooperation and discouraging violence in even the most vile. There is, of course, a blacksmith who seems to be a permanent resident (though on a more voluntary basis than poor Master Hewg if you like), and a network of assassins and informants that bring you knowledge from the wider world. While it doesn’t have its own Two Fingers, there is someone willing and able to perform the duties of a Finger Reader for one reason or another who stands as another permanent resident. As the de facto authority here, you’ll also find it easy to trade information and request favours from those who come here.’ Your assassins, blacksmith and whoever performs the Finger Reader duties will follow you to other worlds. But elsewhere, it will be the equivalent of adventurers in those realities that find themselves drawn to your hold to rest from their adventures, as if by destiny."
712,,300,Jarburg,Elden Ring,Domain ,"Aren’t you a curious sort? At some point you’ve befriended a small village of living jars-which may be Jarburg, or a similar settlement kept secret from the poachers that hunt their kind. Lots and lots of small jars that come up to a man’s waist, and less but still plenty of big jars that tower over humans. The jars consider you their potentate: A sort of de facto king and guardian by virtue of the smoothness and silkiness of your hands. Though not all regard themselves as champions and warriors born, they will loyally fight at your side in your time of need and support you with all they can. In future worlds the village will follow you.

As a result of this twist in your tale, your hands are skilled at shaping the materials needed to make new living jars. And give some rather excellent, comforting pats to them. While this might seem a low standard for a monarch, this also grants you considerable talent in the knowledge of creating and animating more living jars to continue populating your burgeoning kingdom.

For an extra 100 CP, the village comes with a truly magnificent guardian: A Great Jar. Few foes would want to take on a living jar the size of a small building head on. 

This item may be repurchased to have additional villages loyal to you, or to increase the population of your jar village (or the original Jarburg) additively. The extra 100 CP for additional Great Jars is separate from those repurchases.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
713,,300,Swift As The Wind,Elden Ring,Domain ,"Speed and reflexes are as much the provenance of the battle-tested mage who wants to get his incantations out on time, as the warrior striving to roll under her foe’s clumsy swing and cut his throat in one smooth motion. And yours is exceptional, by the standards of your kin. Your body is responsive and agile as an acrobat or professional burglar, your reaction time like that of a wild animal and your wits fast enough to keep up with both. You’ll find your skill with lighter weapons and those that depends on artful manoeuvres over brute force to be significantly greater than it otherwise would too, better able to handle great falls and of course quicker on the draw in a battle of magic. You’re also an expert archer and marksman if you weren’t already-and if you were, feel free to impress your friends by shooting an apple off their head. Blindfolded. But a man like this will mostly like be remembered for agile, last-second dodges around a striking deathbird."
714,,300,Basics ,MtG - Zendikar,Domain ,"These cost 100cp a piece or 300 for 5 can be purchased multiple times and in any
combination. You may select from the below list.
-Forest: lush forested areas vibrant with life produces one green mana
-Island : small islands dotting lakes and oceans produces one blue mana
-Mountain: vast rocky peaks peaks produces one red mana
-Plains: vast open fields illuminated by the sun. that provides one white mana
-Swamp: dank dark places where life meats decay generally swampy unpleasant areas to live produce one black mana.
-Waste: an area drained so dry of mana it has lost all distinguishing features beyond the fine grey dust able to produce a single colourless mana. "
715,,300,Basic Lands ,MtG - Homelands,Domain ,"Though relatively small in size, the Homelands are rich in mana. That fact is a necessity to the very existence of this oasis of life, as it takes a particularly rich concentration of mana to bring life to the land despite the devastation of the Chime. Let alone such a paradise of health and vitality. It would be a shame if you lost access to these powerful mana streams, so you can purchase some of these mana-rich environments to own and take along. Plains, Islands, Swamps, Mountains, and Forests are all available for your enjoyment and use for either 100cp a piece or 300 for a set of five. In a world where the mana is good everywhere, you have ample choice."
716,,300,Basic Land,MtG - New Phyrexia,Domain ,"100CP individual, 300 for 1 of each color

[Any Color] 

Nothing particularly special- your own Phyrexian Plains, Swamp, Forest, Island or Mountain, aspected to the appropiate mana and ready for you to draw power from it."
717,,300,Basic Lands,MtG - Lorwyn,Domain ,"Lorwyn is an idyllic world, so the desire to take some of it with you once your visit concludes is understandable. The forests are calm and tranquil, the fields cool and breezy. Instead of oceans, a network of cold, clean rivers and ponds crisscross the landscape. Even the swamps, as smelly and slimy as they are, are full of life and hold few of the threats many other worlds' swamps do. Lorwyn’s distant mountains ring the plane’s edges. 

You can purchase some of these mana-rich environments to own and take along. Plains, Island (more properly a river or pond here), Swamp, Mountain, and Forest are all available for your enjoyment and use for either 100cp a piece or 300 for a set of five."
718,,300,City of Brass,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Domain ,"A beautiful city made of brass located in a massive desert. Not only is the city in a desert but due to the construction of the city reflecting and catching sunlight, and it’s magical properties it will always feel unbearably hot and painful to be in. This heat however is not capable of causing burns, only pain. Why would you ever want to enter into a city that causes you pain? Because it is a place of potent magic and knowledge. Not only can this land generate a mote of any color. But the knowledge and magical energies found within its walls can vastly accelerate your progress with whatever magic you wish to learn. May I also add that its architecture provides ripe opportunity to study and learn from in order to make artifacts."
719,,300,Tunneling,Skulduggery Pleasant,Domain ,"The ability to pass through solid objects, which open up for you, leaving only cracks behind. You are also resistant to sigils that ordinarily suppress magical powers, making you much harder to contain. .

Boosted: Lord of the Underground: The Capstone Booster has enhanced your magic. Instead of leaving cracks, your magic leaves nothing behind. There is nothing signalling your presence; no noise, no cracks. The ground does not shake at your passing, as though you are simply phasing through it with no displacement of the earth around you. Barring the need to eat, drink, and/or whatever you need to do, you can remain underground indefinitely. There is nothing and no one that can force you to leave the safety of the underground. Also, your resistance to certain sigils has now increased. Where before, you would be weakened in their presence, you are now immune. Before you get too excited though, this immunity applies only to the sigils that Billy-Ray Sanguine is resistant to (i.e. magic suppression sigils).

Boost Requires Second Coming(Skulduggery Pleasant) to Activate"
720,,300,Virtual Environments,Fate/Extra CCC,Domain ,"What does it mean for the Moon Cell to be a digital reality? It’s not a virtual environment in the sense that you’re probably thinking of. It is very much a reality, following its own set of rules which is somewhat different from the reality of the Earth. You could call them Reality Marbles of a sort, although they don’t manifest the inner being of anyone in particular. Even if you’re not normally very good at Code Casts, you’ve learnt the trick to creating and maintaining these digital spaces. Of course, you might be able to learn how to make pockets of reality working off of different rules, but don’t underestimate just how complex the laws of reality can be. It’s recommended you stick to the inner workings you can automatically set up already.

These spaces require energy to not only create, but also to maintain, as you can probably guess, but by simply connecting it to something that you don’t seem to be able to interact with in any other manner, you can make a virtual space the size of a building that is completely defenseless to existential threats, but acceptable for most purposes. Should you have a source of great amounts of energy, you’ll be able to make larger and sturdier spaces, and perhaps if you have a source of energy on the level of the Core of a Planet, or perhaps the Moon Cell itself, you’d be able to construct an entire planet-sized reality following the rules of a digital world, provided enough time and effort to both create the thing and also make it anything other than an empty void.
"
721,,300,Reality Marble,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Domain,"Instead of a trained physical ability or the practiced arts of magecraft, you have something more
unique. The materialisation of your inner world in the form of a Reality Marble, projecting your soul
temporarily onto the outside world. When fully manifested, it drags you and those within a short
distance of you into this projection of your inner world, cut off from the original space you all
resided in. The influence of reality erodes this Reality Marble over time, making it difficult for most
to maintain for more than a few minutes at a time before tiring. 

The effect of your Reality Marble is up to you, as they can vary enormously. Some are simply filled
with incredible heat, burning away the bodies and even spirits of those trapped inside with you over
time. Others are the representation of specific powers, such as a zone that greatly hinders any
magecraft or a place where a legion of your allies waits to help you. Reality Marbles can partially
manifest, an easier to use function that takes far longer to be erased, and usually appears as a
smaller or more limited version of the power available inside the Reality Marble. 

The one you obtain here is a moderately powerful one, akin to Sei Shonagon’s or Amakusa Shiro’s
Reality Marbles. These are worlds that trap the targets inside, subjecting them to constant poison or
spirit eroding conditions. Significantly weaker, more limited versions of famous Reality Marbles like
Unlimited Blade Works or Ioinoi Hetairoi are also possible. It is possible to improve the strength and
ability of the Reality Marble over time, primarily through magical experimentation instead of just
repetitive training."
722,,300,Swordsmith’s Hut,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Domain,"A bounded field manifested by only the greatest smiths in the land. To make a blade, you no longer
need some massive static forge or a complement of sturdy tools. Your workshop remains with you at all times, as much a part of your being as the hands with which you make your art. This magical field
you possess allows you to integrate crafting tools and structures that you possess into a bounded
field, letting you manifest them at will.

This may appear as the structures appearing from nowhere or as overlaying the effects on the
existing environment, turning a natural rock bench into a sturdy anvil or a running stream into a fully
capable quenching bath for hot steel. Your field is already equipped with all the tools expected of a
master swordsmith in this land, as well as potent magical enhancements that improve any crafting
efforts made within the field. Creations will be sturdier, sharper, lighter and more adaptable to their
wielders even without any skill on your part. You may freely combine new structures and tools into
this field, likely mixing them with the existing additions, to continually build on your new ever- present workshop. "
723,,300,Knock ,Cultist Simulator,Domain,"Your affinity to Knock can now be used to temporarily create a magical tunnel that can bypass any lock, door, or barrier. This tunnel operates like an open window through which you can peek into the other side."
724,,300,Tomb ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Domain,"No matter your origin of choice, you awake within a tomb. Buried within it or standing as a silent guardian, it is a tomb connected to you in some way. Perhaps it was built for you or your father. Perhaps you were laid to rest alongside your master in it. Maybe it was built under your own guidance as the chief architect. Or maybe you were installed as a watchful guardian at the gates. But it is an ordinary tomb, nothing special, even for a King. Purchasing this option gives you the chance to not only change that with access to the Tomb Section later on, along with 1000 Tomb Points (TP) to spend there, but also the ability to bring your tomb with you to future worlds.
"
725,,300,Mobility - Boosted,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Domain,"For 500TP, you may instead grant your tomb the power of flight. Such an immense structure moving faster than any horse could sprint is an awe inspiring sight and the tomb may even travel in the void of space, though you’d likely wish to find some way to make it faster if your plans include that sort of thing.(CG Note: Requires base Mobility - Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings first.)
"
726,,300,The Little House ,Peter Pan,Domain,"A magical cottage that Peter built for you. With a top hat for the roof and a shoe as the door knocker, it is rather unusual, but has magical properties. Although it is the size of a small shed, the interior will always have just enough room for however many people enter, though it may be a little tight. Also, despite no fire inside, the house is always comfortably warm and spouts smoke through the chimney, which has a cheery and stubborn personality. Similarly, even when you turn the lights off inside to go to bed in the dark, the exterior of the blinds will shine a light outside to give the impression that the lights are on inside; you can also choose to have it do the opposite, with lights inside and no sign of light from the outside. No matter how much is inside it, the house can be carried by just several strong men working together. Mother Knows Best will allow you to alter and potentially expand the interior as you please. After the jump, the Little House is stored in the warehouse for you to use as you wish. Whenever you sleep, you can subconsciously summon the house to you such that you will awake in bed. Could feasibly be combined with Cinderella.
"
727,,300,Otherworld Opportunist ,Wonderland No More,Domain,"Perhaps you would ordinarily be a mundane person separate from the crazy adventures of Wonderland, not considered a part of the story. But in the real world, things never go so smoothly, and there are many unsavory men who have learned about Wonderland and wish to exploit it. This perk at the very least gives you insights into finding different worlds and passages/methods between in whatever setting you’re in. And even if someone else has primary control or access to said otherworld, you are great at researching and understanding said worlds and travel, such that with enough work, you could feasibly find/make your own backdoors to and from those worlds, and in time even usurp control.
"
728,,300,Looking-Glass Portal ,Wonderland No More,Domain,"A full-length vanity mirror that can nonetheless shrink to fit into bags and pockets easily. It seems to show a hazy reflection, albeit with some errors if you look closely enough. When you rub the mirror, you and all adjacent allies are pulled into the reflection. You will reappear in a location that is relatively close to being a “mirror image” (appearance-wise) of what had been reflected just before you activated the portal. No matter where you use it, even someplace not as nonsensical as Wonderland, there will be a location that qualifies as a mirror image for the teleportation.

While the new location will be a mirrored copy of your previous location, it does not require the presence of people shown in the reflection (aside from those pulled through with you). Also, while the mirrored location will try to match everything shown in the reflection, that is only regarding the image, from the angle shown in the reflection. Examine your new location, and you may find bigger differences, like the clock that only had its back in the reflection now having a strange face on the front. This means that any especially rare or mystical items that were reflected have a fair possibility of being something else entirely if you look closer. After use, the mirror vanishes and will return to you in a week.
"
729,,300,Mystical Library ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Domain,"It would seem Heinz Meissner is not the only wizard to own such a library. Somewhere in the Empire is a building, either owned directly by yourself or held by another in your name. Within this building is hosted a library stocked with all sorts of accessible (if often obscure) texts concerning magical history and theory, as well as more mundane philosophy, theology, and history. Especially prominent are those books detailing the history of magic among the Empire’s human populace before the arrival of Teclis and his traditions. As this library follows you, such publicly accessible works of history, philosophy, and religion from new destinations will find their way into this library as well. These will draw scholars from far and wide, who would happily pay you a small fee to stay overnight in the upstairs rooms or take a small meal while they increase their knowledge. However, there is another library of importance in this building. In the basement, entrance to which can only be granted by a password of your devising, exists a space for you to contain tomes of forbidden lore, lest they fall into the wrong hands. Already, you have acquired dark grimoires detailing the ways and means of the servants of Chaos and the foul undead for such safekeeping. Fortunately, the protective enchantments on the basement prevent such tomes from corrupting those you trust with the knowledge of their existence and location. If knowledge is power, it falls to you to guard it well."
730,,300,ANOMNOMNOMALIES ,Endless Legend,Domain,"Covering Auriga are strange places full of strange things. These can be mushrooms that sing to you and make a delicious bread, giant spines of stone that erupt through the earth and are held in place by a base small enough for a child to wrap their hand around it, red barked trees that are covered in flames yet never burn to down, to a fabled ""tree"" a hundred feet tall, made purely out of wind blown Dust. You have a wonderful habit of finding each and everyone one of them. No matter where you are, there will always be some strange, Endless made wonder for you to explore, examine, and gain from. I happen to LOVE Mosspearl jam myself. You might be more keen on a Escaped Specimen X104 steak, served with ruby cacti fruit wine on a bed of sauteed redsang?

For ANOMNOMNOMALIES and Landscapist, an Anomaly is any thing, place, area, lifeform, that clearly breaks the laws of reality, or are so distinctly unusual they can not be considered natural. The Zone in STALKER is a good example of a non­Endless anomaly. The weirder and more unnatural a place is, the stronger its anomaly nature. One helps you find weird places, things, and items, the other helps you draw power from them.
"
731,,300,Ceremony of Restoration ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages,Domain,"Somewhere up in the mountains near Symmetry City is a man named Patch. He’s an expert in fixing things. He even has a ‘magic ritual’ called the ceremony of restoration where you have to fight off some monsters to fix your broken object. While on a time limit, no less. And as a mining cart bears down on your soon to be even more broken item. Thankfully this version of the ceremony is less ridiculous than Patch’s Crazy Carts, so you shouldn’t have as much trouble with it. Attached to your warehouse is a copy of the ceremony hall, allowing you to invoke the ritual whenever you want. Beat it, and your whatever is fixed. That said, the more complex or powerful an object it is, the more insane the ‘ceremony’ gets. Thankfully your item won’t actually break beyond repair even if you fail, so you can just go again.
"
732,,300,Zora’s Flippers ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages,Domain,"A pair of rather odd boots designed by Zora to mimic their unusual body shapes. When a more normal person wears it, their swimming speed is increased and they somehow magically gain the ability to hold their breath underwater for up to six minutes. Great for underwater explorations, there’s just so much cool stuff down there that people have lost and the Zora don’t seem to care about. Paired with the flippers comes a Swimmers Ring, which increases your speed in the water a second time. You probably won’t win a race with a Zora, but you might come close.
"
733,,300,Twilight Mirror ,Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess,Domain,"A copy of the Twilight Mirror, which was once used to execute and imprison the worst criminals of Hyrule by casting them into the Twilight Realm. Yours is capable of transporting yourself to a similar, Twilight filled world in future Jumps- you might use it as a prison like the ancient Hylians, or maybe you’ll find that it’s already inhabited if you decide to explore..."
734,,300,Blessing of Farore ,Legend of Zelda: Hero of Worlds,Domain,"Increases your courage and willpower, and allows you to use the spell Farore's Wind, creating warp points that you can return to with a second casting."
735,,300,Local Believers ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Domain,"In your hometown, people know that you and your cabal are the people to talk to for a little supernatural help. They may not admit to believing in it in public, and they may not even really believe in magic at all, but they know that people who go to you for help tend to get an extra edge. As such, your magic, whatever the kind, takes no penalties when people from home are watching, and as a bonus they’re much less likely to form an angry mob to burn you at the stake, unless you do something to actually deserve it. Additionally, people will periodically turn up asking for supernatural help that you can - usually easily - provide, and will be more than happy to pay you for your trouble."
736,,300,Hearthfire - Castle Jumper ,The Elder Scrolls,Domain,"Why would you have an ordinary house when you could have a castle instead? Your home is vastly increased in size, along with any additions you've bought. Your [Guest Housing] could now house up to forty people, while a [Vast Library] could contain enough books to put some universities to shame. Your home also has at least four floors now.
(CG Note: Requires Hearthfire - Basics - The Elder Scrolls first.)"
737,,400,Different Dimension Assailant,Duel Monsters – The Shadow Realm,Domain,"Existing between worlds is a hidden space folded in between dimensions, known to many as the Different Dimension. Beyond the reach of magic and sense alike, you have a connection to this void between worlds, letting you briefly enter it to cross great distances in a short amount of time. You start being able to use it to teleport short distances, blinking from one place and crossing a field’s distance in that time, though you will tire quickly if you use it too much in a short amount of time. As you gain more experience, your jumps can be made at greater distances and with more precision - enough so you could cut a ruler’s throat in his bedchambers and appear in the next town over with nobody any wiser."
738,,400,Infernal Workshop,Baldur's Gate 3,Domain,"You get a forge, blacksmith’s tools along with a whole array of tinker’s tools that are in perfectly working order. They are either stationed at your cosmic warehouse or follow you magically throughout your journey. They are fully self-cleaning and self-repairing.

On top of that, you get a steady supply of infernal irons that gets dropped off monthly by flying interdimensional imps. Each of those drop offs are sufficient to fully create a single steel watcher unit from scratch. Also, unlike some items purchased here, you can stockpile this infernal iron shipments. If you want, you could use take the shipment in the form of a soul-coin filled pouch instead. Oh, and don’t worry, only artificial souls have been used in the making of these materials.

The forge itself either follows you magically throughout this jump or is placed in your warehouse."
739,,400,Soul Pit ,MORTAL KOMBAT 9-10,Domain,"A swirling green vortex contained within a well has been added into your Warehouse with the power to trap souls inside of it. Whenever you slay someone you may choose for their soul to go to the vortex instead of wherever they would go normally; from there, you can use them as you see fit. Use their soul to revive them as your slave, eat it for a power boost, torment them... the hellish, ash choked sky is the limit. "
740,,400,Living Towers,MORTAL KOMBAT 9-10,Domain,"The Living Towers are another addition to your Warehouse where you will find three towers. The first changes every hour, the other every day, and the last every week, with each one increasing in length and difficulty. Each floor of the tower will take you to an arena of some sort, where you will face an opponent, possibly with special conditions like the ones described above active. These places and opponents are drawn from both this world and the world’s you’ve visited, but the only thing you can gain from the Living Towers is the reward you get for completing the top floor- a large surplus of golden Koins. In addition, you will learn much quicker in these towers, making training a breeze, and being killed will merely place you back in your Warehouse, unharmed."
741,,400,The Krypt,MORTAL KOMBAT 9-10,Domain,"The Krypt is a strange place; located inside of your Warehouse is the entrance to a graveyard filled with graves and tombstones. When you near one, an image of a certain amount of money appears in your mind; when you have that much money available, you gain the ability to break the grave open, gaining unique rewards such as a new Kostume, an idea for a new and creative way to kill your opponents, exquisite works of art, life-sized statues of people you’ve met, and even special conditions you can invoke in Kombat if both parties agree to it, such as preventing both Kombatants from blocking attacks, making attacks do double damage, or even making the world appear to tilt back and fourth. New areas of the Krypt themed off of the world’s you’ve been to appear as you visit them, ensuring that you’ll always have new items to unlock. "
742,,400,Flashing Speed,MORTAL KOMBAT 9-10,Domain,"Exposure to some of the strange magic found in Outworld has given you an unusual power; namely the ability to move at incredible speeds, to the point where you appear as a blur. Although you can go fast- fast enough to circle around almost any arena to strike your opponent from behind- this is somewhat hard to control, making it hard to attack your enemy while doing so. This is best used to throw your enemies for a loop by passing them by and hitting them hard enough to make them spin, then taking the opportunity to land a few hits on them. Failing that, this ability is great for travelling great distances. "
743,,400,Lesser Realm of the Abyss,Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous,Domain,"A slice of the Abyss, all for yourself. A part of the Abyssal plane generally acknowledged by other powerful demons as belonging to you. It might appear as a city of hellish pleasures, a hive of buzzing insects or some vast temple devoted to your worship. Not the equal of Alushinrya or Baphomet’s labyrinth but a more than acceptable starting place. Contained within is a horde of demons, styled to match the theme of your realm, and more than a match for an entire army of the Crusade. They appear to generally acknowledge you as a worthy lord and that image won’t change unless you prove yourself pathetic. Try not to do too many acts of Good in their sight or lose too often. In other worlds, you’ll be able to access this realm from anywhere with ease but here, you’ll be subject to the same difficulties of opening gates as other demonic realms encounter."
744,,400,Fortress Commander        ,Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous,Domain,"The Crusade is not quite so down on it’s luck as one may have thought. Drezen is not the last of the fortress cities and the Mendevian army is looking larger than ever. The city standing before you is under your command, designed to be a bulwark against the worst the demons could throw. Drezen, the sister city, was only felled by betrayal from within despite the best efforts of the Abyssal horde. This large, multi-layered city is easily locked down by several rings of walls and magical fortifications. Helmed by a small army of veteran crusaders already, it is the perfect place to launch a new crusade from. You’ve all the men, equipment and specialists needed to make a deadly strike into the demon- held lands. And even should the forces of evil turn back on you, their greatest armies would be hard pressed to take the fortress without months or years of siege."
745,,400,Seat at the Table,Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous,Domain,"A secret group who rule behind the shadows, directing the affairs of the world below. That’s the idea, at least. Although made of powerful members of various factions and races, this secretive council isn’t quite in control of everything. Instead, they seek to work together to keep everyone satisfied and nudge respective factions in desired directions. The Mendevian War for instance, has room to benefit the Heavens, the Hells, the Abyss, the Fae and all sorts of others. Not every faction even knows they have a representative here. A seat at this table is a chance to strike deals and politick with many of the most important figures in the world, sometimes even including deities or their second-in-commands.

You’ve, somehow, sneaked your way onto a chair here. Someone just left the portal open in your closet. Your new peers are a little doubtful of what you might offer but seem willing to accept you as an equal, at least in this room. It can be accessed from any closet or wardrobe you find and always has various figures of power from this world. Not every faction is always present, even at important meetings, but you’ll have a chance to convince, bribe, threaten and charm them into helping your goals. Even in future worlds, against what might be logical, the council will persist. None of the important people in other worlds appear to find it strange to meet up like this.

It should go without saying but the council is under a pact of non-aggression. Breaking it will dissolve the ritual room, preventing you or any other from returning in your current world."
746,,400,Power Over My Dominion,Castlevania - Symphony of the Night,Domain,"You’re not some craven coward who submits to others, bending knee and back to something as simple as power are you? No - you are the one who is submitted to, one who rules over the night for as far as the eye can see. And suitably, you possess a very interesting power that serves only to enhance your right to rule. Most vampires use a spark of Chaos as the heart of their castle, binding it to them and them to it in a manner that serves to enhance the best aspects of both. And, as you are bound to the castle, it becomes rather strange for some upstart monster to try and claim dominion over part of your castle. If they’re fool enough to try and do so, then you gain a claim on their soul, able to manipulate them with ease and perhaps even raise them from the dead... or consume their soul for power."
747,,400,Get Up And Go,Castlevania - Symphony of the Night,Domain,"Over the past four years, Richter has had to deal with the fact that a girl half his age was on par with him in terms of power and arguably better when it comes to mobility. To that end he’s put quite a bit of effort into ensuring something so embarrassing doesn’t happen again, and you’ve seen fit to copy as much of his regimen as you could. You can now MOVE with a speed and purpose that puts cheating magic users who can fly to shame, and all through nothing more than the power of your body. Jumping, sliding, kicking, combinations thereof that let you deal more damage or move even faster... No letting little girls outdo you. With these things under your belt you’ll be moving through castlevania fast enough that half the monsters there won’t even notice your passing. The other half will of course be dead."
748,,400,The Infinite Frontier,The Free Universe,Domain,"It’d be rather sad if this variety of worlds to travel to was locked off to you, wouldn’t it? Why not...keep the adventure going? Firstly, you’re able to innovate and access a form of dimensional travel through any means you choose - technological or magical, and secondly...you’ll always be able to find some form of alternate world, dimension, or new place to explore wherever you go, even if the world would lack a pseudo-multiversal nature!"
749,,400,Mines,The Silmarillion,Domain,"You know of a place where the earth has given up its treasures - and have a workforce happy (or at least willing) to excavate it for you. This mine will yield up only so much material at a time, but you can always be sure that there will be new veins to be discovered, if you dig a little deeper.

For 100 CP (free to Noldor or Dwarves), this mine is fruitful, but yields only mundane but practical materials such as iron, copper, coal or good stone. Valuable and useful certainly, especially if one is in the business of smithing or masonry, but hardly a wonder of the world. In future jumps, your mine will remain useful, providing a source of similar practical resources appropriate to the jump in question.

For 200 CP, your mine will additionally yield far rarer treasures; gold and silver in great quantities, as well as fine gems which could be sold for wealth, or made into beautiful things. The quantities of mundane materials are increased as well, such that your mine could equip a decently-sized host as fast as the smiths could work the ore. In future jumps, your mine will yield similarly rare or precious substances specific to the worlds in question.

For 400 CP, your mine is the equal of that found beneath Khazad-dûm, yielding up strange and mystical materials, from veins of precious mithril to ancient meteors bearing the star-iron that forged Anglachel, to perhaps even the strange, unbreakable crystals of which the Silmarils were made. In future jumps, your mine will yield up other rare or supernatural substances, such as unobtainium, warpstone or gromril."
750,,400,Workshop,The Silmarillion,Domain,"What is a craftsman without his tools and a place to work? 

For 100 CP (free to Noldor, Orcs or Dwarves), you have a workshop suited to all crafts you know which are fitting for this jump. It’s nothing supernatural, but it’s a place that a competent craftsman would be proud of.

For 200 CP, your workshop is fine enough that a true master of their craft would be envious of it, and moreover possesses some special, albeit not supernatural, quality which makes it more wondrous still. Perhaps it contains great foundries which allow you to produce great quantities of war materiel rapidly, or nearby groves of trees perfect for all manner of wood-crafting.

For 400 CP, your workshop is magical in its own right, enabling you to create things even greater than you could alone. In such a workshop you might be able to perform metaphysical feats such as capturing light and binding it into gems, or drawing from the deep fires of the earth to empower the creation of, I don’t know, a Ring, perhaps. Whatever the case, this workshop is ideally-suited to all manner of magical crafting."
751,,400,Tree-Herds,The Silmarillion,Domain,"The ents are named ‘shepherds of the trees’, and you more than live up to that name. In a process half-magic, half-gardening, you can shape lands and ecosystems, working wood and water, stick and stone to create new landscapes. Given an empty plain and long enough, you could grow a forest as dense and strong as Fangorn, or enrich the earth to make it as bountiful as the Shire. This expertise extends from growing living things into transforming the landscape; redirecting rivers, moving hills and other such grand projects. Or, if you are roused to anger, the use of the environment in war: Directing rivers to wash away cities, preparing cliffs for rock-falls and similar. If you are an ent, your great strength will be very useful in such grand projects, but even if you are not, you still maintain the skill to direct many people together to accomplish similar results.

More than these mundane aspects, however, you also know the secrets of brewing ent-draughts; concentrating the spiritual power of growing things deep in the earth into blessed waters with potent virtues of growth and flourishing. Brewing such draughts requires that you shape landscapes to purpose, it takes time for the power to gather, and it can only be done in intensely verdant lands. Once the labour is complete, though, there will come forth springs of these potent waters, able to give especial strength, vitality, growth and endurance to those who drink them, and to sustain people even without ordinary food."
752,,400,Ring the Bells        ,Anima Ark Of Sinners,Domain,"The appearance of monsters in this world is heralded by the ringing of bells as well as the appearance of unbreachable barriers until they are defeat. You can now setup arenas by creating barriers over the exits or simply around the area where others can only pass if they defeat you first. Furthermore, you can also hear a bell ringing when enemies appear and when they are finally defeated."
753,,400,Teleportation Room,Castlevania - Aria of Sorrow,Domain,"Backtracking is a pain, isn’t it? Walk a mile to one place, then have to walk two in the opposite direction...thankfully, this makes things a little earlier. As you explore new locations – dungeons, castles, even cites – you’ll come across these strange rooms that activate upon your arrival. Once ‘active’, these rooms can transport you between any two that have been activated, letting you cross vast distances instantly with a mental command. The locals and your enemies don’t notice or acknowledge these rooms, oddly enough. In future jumps, future teleportation rooms will appear in convenient landmarks, though you don’t have direct control over where they will be...you’ll have to find them yourself."
754,,400,Safe Zone,Castlevania - Aria of Sorrow,Domain,"Because sometimes you need a place and a moment to rest. This magical ritual will, with a few minutes of chanting and a considerable amount of stamina, will establish a holy ‘safe zone’ that repels monsters and dark spirits no bigger than a small room. Unholy creatures and wild monsters will turn away from the room or ignore its existence entirely, though if you’ve drawn attention to yourself or an enemy is determined to hunt you, this won’t save you from their wrath. You can establish one ‘safe zone’ at a time, the other dispelling when you make a new one or will it to disappear."
755,,400,Alchemist’s Research Laboratory,Valkyrie Crusade ,Domain,"This building is where the research into ‘rebirth’ takes place. It turns out that awakening isn’t the highest potential one can reach. By using magical catalysts, a rare few Valkyries can be reborn, essentially acting like a second awakening and granting them increased power. This laboratory can be used to research how to rebirth people, though it will take a while per person being researched. About a month each. Even then, the materials required to instigate a rebirth are rare even in the Celestial Realm."
756,,400,Magic School ,Valkyrie Crusade ,Domain,"This academy is only a small private school, open to those willing to pay in order to learn the arcane arts. Those that are enrolled can choose from a range of subjects to learn, from alchemy to elemental magic. Those rare few with an affinity for it can even attempt to learn summoning magic, though they will usually cap out at summoning Normal rarity valkyries, weaker even than Rare valkyries."
757,,400,Worldwide,American Gods,Domain,"An exaggeration, let’s be clear, but eh. The point is, you can teleport. Within the range of your influence, you can reach any place where there’s at least some presence of your domain already in an instant. That is, a cellphone with a data plan would be enough for Internet. Media could do with a single song on that phone, though only when it’s being played, and for Tech Boy only the phone would be needed.

But under these rules, so long as your presence can be said to be there, you can move your actual presence and consciousness before anyone can even blink. The exact details depend a lot on your domains, of course, but yeah."
758,,400,Warp,Castlevania - Order of Ecclesia,Domain,"The most irritating monsters are not the ones that possess a thick hide to shrug off your blows or sharp claws to rend your armor. No, the most irritating monsters are the ones you cannot strike in the first place. Teleportation, the ability to warp space and move from one location to another with but a single step. Imagine how horrifying it must be for the monsters that a hunter such as yourself has mastered the art. Do be aware that this is a fairly magic-intensive technique and that using it endlessly simply isn't viable unless your name is Dracula. However, short hops, perhaps from one end of a room to another? Those you can do to your heart's content. You can also more or less hover in place fairly easily by just teleporting yourself upwards a tiny amount every second. Holding it for long does run into the power issue again though."
759,,400,Valhalla Suite,Percy Jackson,Domain,"You have a room in Valhalla, meaning you are welcome to come and go there as you please. Valhalla has the height of luxury for furnishings and food, and you are welcome to join in on the feasts and war games. More importantly if you die upon the battlefields of Valhalla it is not counted as a death for the purposes of your chain ending and you will be revived in your room within a couple hours. Post jump your room becomes an expansion to your Warehouse, as well as a copy of the Feast Hall and battlefields, the enchantments remain and will function on any who enter, however they cannot fix wounds inflicted outside of the battlefields."
760,,400,A Slice of the Realms,Warhammer 40K: The Warp ,Domain,"You own the duplicate of a small part of a realm within the Warp of a god of your choice. Whether it’s Nurgle’s Garden, Tzeentch’s Library, Khorne’s Throne Room, or Slaanesh’s palace, it will be sure to impress your peers."
761,,400,Crossing the Materium,Warhammer 40K: The Warp ,Domain,"Warp entities often have very notable difficulties crossing into and existing in the Materium. Whether it’s sacrifices, psykers or hosts for their being, a creature of the Empyrean must often expend some of their power even with these measures during their stay in the material realm. Not you, however. For you, crossing into the Materium or other connected dimensions is as easy as walking from one room to another, with no price to pay existing there either. Post-jump, realities with laws hostile to your being will have no effect on you."
762,,400,You Can Fly! ,Disney Lorcana,Domain,"All it takes is faith and trust, and a little pinch of pixie dust. Like Peter Pan, you fly as easily as anything, just think happy thoughts."
763,,400,Hidden Glade,Changeling The Dreaming,Domain,"A place rich in Glamour and untouched by humanity or Banality, you are now in possession of a highly prized location. Perhaps it's a patch of forest ringed with mushrooms, or it's a flower field with the most radiant of colors, though for some maybe a cave covered in crystals and possessing a small waterfall would be most appropriate? Either way, it is easy to absorb the Glamour that permeates this slice of the Dreaming on Earth, and one which many would eagerly fight and kill in order to obtain."
764,,400,Failed Philosopher's Stone,Castlevania - Lament of Innocence,Domain,"The Ebony Stone, the stone of night, this particular alchemical creation is known by many names and is deeply coveted by many individuals. Most of them want it simply as proof of concept, to aid them in moving one step closer to a completed Philosopher's Stone, but it has its own uses, it's own powers. Wherever this stone lies, it is always night for miles and miles around. The sky turns dark, clouds blot out the sun, and an eternal night descends. As you might imagine, creatures of darkness adore this stone both for the darkness it brings and for the fact that the shadows it casts makes them stronger."
765,,400,Terrain seeds,Grimms’ Fairy Tales,Domain,"You get 3 common and mundane objects of your choice. Something like a brush, a mirror and a thimble. Once you throw those objects behind your back they will transform into a large area of a certain terrain of your choice. The brush could turn into a large and dense forest, the mirror into a vast and deep lake and the thimble into a massive mountain for example. Good for significantly slowing down pursuers and magic shows. The terrains can be turned back into the mundane objects at any point you wish."
766,,400,Magic tower,Grimms’ Fairy Tales,Domain,"A great and massive tower contains twelve windows with which one can see anything above or under the earth all over the world. It will even show you things which are hidden in some way, such as magically put into a birds egg"
767,,400,Wishing ring,Grimms’ Fairy Tales,Domain,Transport yourself and others wherever you want instantly. You can also call companions and friends to your side.
768,,400,Swift as the Wind,Princess The Hopeful,Domain,"A caged bird’s music is never quite as sweet. Aria, the Queen of Spades’ Invocation, suffuses your wind magics and similar powers to help you never be caged. All power you have over the wind, you can also use to enhance your innate range of motion magically through the power of the Light. Want to run on steps of air currents then rush across the city heights on a gust of wind? Even if you’re under water, with some creative thinking a big bubble could give you quite a turn of speed-at least before it runs out. Moreover you may also use Light and wind together as a medium through which you can liberate others spiritually, physically and mentally. With a stray gust you could inspire joyous urges to break out of someone’s routine, or restore hope to someone who feels bogged down by their commitments. Or you could quite literally rattle the locks keeping someone behind bars, jiggle free the cuffs keeping someone bound-and though greater security measures will be naturally trickier, with enough Light you might even be able to free a spirit from a summoning circle by huffing and buffing on it even if you’re otherwise not a particularly skilled mage.

Do note this explicitly includes “releasing” an authority figure’s accoutrements to teach them a lesson, like freeing their shoelaces from their shoes or liberating their belt from their pants."
769,,400,Moving Fortress,MTG - Tarkir                                ,Domain,"One of the great fortresses of the Abzan, mounted atop a gigantic cart and with a behemoth to pull it, this would provide a solid bastion to defend any position, or for an army to rally around. Its stones are enchanted so that the tower’s weight is movable, and the cart to not sink into terrain."
770,,400,Dash,MTG - Tarkir                                ,Domain,"You and those you train learn to harness red or black mana to enhance yourselves, enshrouding your bodies in wind and lightning and achieving impossible speeds, perfect for devastating hit-and-run attacks which remove you from all but the quickest retaliation. These boosts only last a short time, but can be decisive. You can teach this method to others."
771,,400,Fully Stocked Potions Lab ,Disney’s American Dragon: Jake Long,Domain,This fully stocked potions lab has all the ingredients you could need or want for your potion creation needs. All ingredients will never go bad. It automatically restocks at the start of each Jump with excess going into your warehouse. It can be imported into future Jumps or be made an extension of your warehouse.
772,,400,Master Forge,Castlevania (Netflix) ,Domain,"This Forgemaster’s workshop is without peer, holding all the engines and ingredients required to create an army of demons with enough time- including a replenishing stock of corpses, both human and animal. While an ordinary person might be able to use these tools for regular forge work, or some alchemy, a Devil Forgemaster will get the most use out of this space, finding their creations empowered beyond the energy they put into their craft. Powerful and intelligent demons such as Blue Fangs, Slogra, or Gaibon can be created here with much less effort than normal. Two powerful demons guard the place, and can come along to guard you as well though they don’t count as companions. Can be added on to another property that you possess or made into a Warehouse attachment, but cannot be purchased by Companions."
773,,400,The House of God,Castlevania (Netflix) ,Domain,"A large cathedral, in your choice of style. Will it be Gothic with gargoyles peering down from the rooftop? A splendidly decorated building with stained glass windows? Perhaps it’s more humble, merely being wood and stone. Whatever it is, the building is sturdy, and the priests are devout... and also armed with some surprising tools. Just as God protects all the faithful, these priests have taken up cross-shaped clubs and knives to ensure the protection of the head of their congregation- that’s you, by the way. They’re few in number but loyal. They have the capability to make holy water, and the building itself is consecrated, protecting it from all but the most powerful of demons and undead. Can be added onto another property that you possess or made into a Warehouse attachment, if you wish, but cannot be purchased by Companions."
774,,400,Lizardry,Amphibia,Domain,"You know the magics taught to the Order that preserves the calamity box. Not only can you teleport yourself and those touching you, but you can also read minds, and summon objects."
775,,400,Forever Home,The Ghost and Molly McGee,Domain,"Welcome to the shelter for your immortal soul, a magnificent building that's tailored to your unique tastes and life experiences. As you continue to grow and evolve, this home will adapt and expand to meet your every need and desire. Whether you seek solace or adventure, comfort or excitement, this sanctuary is your ideal haven - a place where your soul can thrive and flourish in perfect harmony with your evolving self.

For the rich and powerful this could be a castle or mansion, a ghost with their forever home will have it be able to cross over to the other side and take on the aesthetics of the Ghost Realm, or if you were an average Joe. This home would take a suburban house in a lovely neighborhood with a good school down the way."
776,,400,Ripping the Shroud,Vampire: The Masquerade,Domain,"The Giovanni’s great plan is to sacrifice ten million souls to destroy the sudario. You have learned a much smaller but arguably more practical version of this ritual, allowing you to sacrifice fewer ghosts in order to open a gateway to an afterlife or spirit world or even merge them with the real world. As little as a single soul would be enough to fully merge the grounds of a building in the lands of the living with the Underworld. In addition to this special ritual, you have fully mastered all the Paths and Rituals of Clan Giovanni’s signature Necromancy, allowing you to do such things as control ghosts, raise corpses as zombies, or force someone to reveal their darkest secrets."
777,,400,Teleport Orb,Wild Arms 2,Domain,"A teleport orb is a magic tool that transports the user and closeby allies to marked locations, just like teleport gem, but unlike them, the magic in the orb lasts indefinitely. It instantly transports people to the place visualized and works better with places previously visited. But it is not perfect, without a clear visual and confidence in this tool you may be redirected to other populated places by the protections installed into the orb... or they fail and you get sent to the wilderness. Allows up to dozen people to teleport at a time, low chances of redirection. Safety during transport is guaranteed, but only during transport."
778,,400,Caelid Colosseum,Elden Ring - Caelid Wilds,Domain,"A structure meant to showcase the martial prowess of warriors from all across the Lands Between, it hasn't seen much action in millennia. Having been enchanted heavily, it will allow you to summon phantoms of past foes and allies alike, for the sole purpose of doing battle within its sacred halls. Whether you wish to watch them fight amongst themselves or be one of the participants, you shall never again hunger for combat ever again."
779,,400,The Main Room ,I’m The Grim Reaper,Domain,"From time to time God secluded himself behind the Main Door of Heaven and he’s currently absent for thousands of years already and hasn’t spoken with his angels for all of this time. The secrets located behind this door are still a mystery to us, but you received a modified version of this structure. You received a copy of the Main Door and you’re able to summon it anywhere. This door can just be open by you and those that have your permission. On the other side of it, it’s an isolated dimensional space with the size of an average house, being located far away from any other dimensions and planes in the local multiverse and, due to it, it’s virtually impossible to reach this room by even godlike beings without using the door as a gateway. While inside the door, any sign of your presence will be concealed and no one will be able to detect your current location, turning it into a perfect hideout. With the door being the only entrance, it’s immune to any mundane attempt to open it, including raw strength like trying to destroy the door using any attack, requiring a being on par with an R.O.B. to destroy it. Despite this, more esoteric ways are capable of opening it, like using anomalous powerful artifacts especially made to open things like SCP-005 may work if used by powerful people. If someone is inside the dimensional space, the door can’t be unsummoned, so if you want to stay hidden inside it, it’s better to hide the door too. The room retains any modifications done to it and, if somehow destroyed, it’ll be repaired by your Benefactor in the next Jump."
780,,400,Pit of Flames of Hell,I’m The Grim Reaper,Domain,"You receive a pit located in your Warehouse (or in any other of your properties instead if you prefer) containing around thirty cubic meters, or around thirty thousand liters, of a strange red liquid. In truth, this liquid isn’t a liquid, but instead it’s an extremely condensed form of the Flames of Hell to the point it has some characteristic of liquids but it isn’t in reality. Unlike regular fire, the Flames of Hell don’t normally spread and don’t provoke physical burns, although it still causes the sensation of burning on living beings. Once in contact with living beings, the flames will start to corrupt them, tainting their bodies and substituting any kind of magical and/or holy concept for their demonic counterparts (a mage capable of using magical fire would gain the ability to use demonic fire instead, for example). A corrupted being would usually gain demonic features and gain some marks to show their tainted nature. For example, after being corrupted, Satan lost his nature as a Seraphin, with his wings being burned, his limbs becoming blackened, gaining demonic features, like horns and a tail, and becoming a complete demon. Demonic/hellish beings, like demons, are immune to this effect, due to already being corrupted, but the exact details of the corruption varies according to each individual. You can use these flames to corrupt any being in contact with them, but they’re consumed every time they’re used and, as a general rule, any supernatural being will be able to use their power to protect themselves and the stronger they’re, the more flames will be consumed and more time is needed to successfully corrupt them, with someone on par with the First Archangel basically consuming all of the flames at once to be corrupted. It’s up to you to decide if these flames also corrupt the personalities of its targets or not. The Flames of Hell in the pit are refilled yearly and, if destroyed, it’ll reappear in your Warehouse at the start of the next Jump."
781,,400,Onyx Book: Connect Worlds,Jump Force,Domain,"The true power of the Onyx Book, fully realized. With this, you may take distant but not wholly disconnected worlds or planes of existence and forge a bridge between them. You will need to be aware of/able to see both worlds, and they must exist within the same multiverse (local/Jump's Multiverse during the Chain, but can be expanded to encompass every Jumped setting post-Chain), but once you do so the connection will be absolute. At first, this will only exist as a bridge between the worlds allowing transit of persons and material. Over time, you can strengthen this, causing parts of each reality to blend with each other at the point of connection. With enough time and energy, you could wholly merge the worlds together into a single shared realm, blending their unique attributes, though what damage this might cause to each is unknown. This is the very power at the heart of the current crisis, Jumper. Wield it carefully."
782,,400,Wizard's Tower,Guild Wars 2,Domain,"Your little home away from home. You have a keystone that teleports you to and from a small tower in an out-of-the-way location that most people never even heard of. The tower has a small pantry, a library and comfortable rooms. The best place to lie back with a book and relax."
783,,400,Thinking With Portals,Guild Wars 2,Domain,"As a mesmer, you can open and close short-range portals. This perk expands on that, and allows you to open long-range ones, rivaling Asura Gates and Waypoints. The only requirement is that you have a good visualization of wherever it is you're going, such as having visited the place before, or having a picture of it. There is no hard range limit on such portals, but anything further than from one side of Tyria to the other starts to become harder to achieve. The portals last for as long as you focus on them, closing quickly as soon as your attention wavers."
784,,400,Inventory,World of Final Fantasy: Mirage Keeper,Domain,A timeless inventory that can hold a stack of 99 of any item. Living beings cannot be stored directly in it. (Prismariums are fair game as long as they are in the Prism Case. Pokéballs are also fair game.) You must be able to lift an item in order to be able to put it inside your inventory.
785,,400,The Book of Sailing the Sea of Stars,Mummy: The Curse,Domain,"This papyrus scroll contains drawings and mathematics-inspired poetry praising the goddess Nuit. Reading the book under a starry sky allows you and a group with you to teleport, but the teleportation will be delayed until your destination is also under a starlit sky. The scroll’s curse is two-fold: the bearer may become paranoid that everyone else is trying to steal the Book and anyone who lays eyes on it may begin to want to take it while becoming jealous and resentful of the Book’s current owner. You are immune to both, and as long as no one else takes the book, viewers will not become enthralled and attempt to take it from you."
786,,400,Bount Mansion,Bleach,Domain,"For those hunted by both the living and dead, who have endured the ages within a world where time continues marching, a place to call home is more valuable than silver or gold. In your possession for many human generations is an old but very well maintained mansion, spacious enough to fit a large number of your people while granting them space and solitude alike. Hidden within the estate is a vast amount of wealth that allows for continued trade with humans for whatever value or convenience that provides. Additionally, the estate is littered with hidden rooms, tunnels, and passage allowing for covert activities. The whole estate is also warded by various Bount spells and magics to keep it hidden from Soul Society’s wandering eyes."
787,,400,Room of Transformation,Bleach,Domain,"Ordinarily, the process of transforming from a Hollow into an Arrancar is one of extreme risk. The removal of a Hollow’s mask will usually cause their death, but may under rare circumstances allow them to awaken to a minor increase in power and stability of form. The Hogyoku in Aizen’s hands was able to drastically reduce the risks of producing Arrancar, while radically increasing the benefits. In Aizen’s hands, Hollows became far stronger after the transformation, having more of their innate potential unlocked and made available. While you do not have the Hogyoku, you now find yourself in possession of a room with the ability to produce a similar effect. In this room, using a small command device, you may transform Hollows into Arrancar at the same efficiency as the dream stone would, stabilizing their form and unlocking a great deal of strength. This may also be used on other distorted or mutated beings to produce similar results. "
788,,400,Study Rooms,Bleach,Domain,"Hidden beneath Urahara’s Candy Shop is a great, expansive training room appearing like a rocky landscape under an open sky. Despite its inexplicable location at the bottom of a ladder, this place is bizarrely huge, stretching out into every direction. Intense training and hectic battles may be conducted in this place with no concern of collateral damage, and study may be done in peace thanks to its tranquility. You are not simply purchasing just one however; Urahara created multiple chambers like this, hidden so incredibly well that one in Seireitei still goes undetected, and was able to act as a secret safehouse for Ichigo and friends. As a result, by purchasing “Hidden Chamber” there will always somehow be one of these giant rooms in the local area, with you having a vague idea of where they are and how to get in. Once found, the chamber will establish itself, but remain no more easily found than any of Urahara’s would be."
789,,400,White Bone Hell & Blood Pond Hell,Bleach,Domain,"Legendary hotsprings of Tenjiro Kirinji, a member of Squad 0 and protector of the Soul King. The White Bone Hell is a clear spring surrounded by waterfalls; submerging an individual beneath its water will drive out damaged blood, wounds and reiatsu from a person’s body. The Blood Pond Hell is filled with boiling red fluid resembling blood; this spring triggers immediate and extreme replenishment of blood. Both are dangerous, as patients could easily have their body drained by the White Bone Hell or filled to bursting by Blood Pond Hell without someone carefully dipping, removing, and transferring them between the two. Even the most damaged bodies and dire injuries can be treated through proper and repeated use of the two springs though. 

By cutting the price in half, one may instead receive a single hotspring developed by Urahara Kisuke after he observed the works of Tenjiro. This spring’s healing powers are far less potent, but also far less dangerous as a result. Repeated bathing can help heal most minor injuries within a matter of days. Regardless of which hotsprings you purchase, they are bestowed in the form of a property, being placed in a location of your desire by themselves, or inside of a bathhouse. 

Note: You may take all 3 upon purchase."
790,,400,Dangai Born,Bleach,Domain,"There are subjects considered arcane and occult even to the Shinigami, aspects of the world they simply try to live with rather than control. The Dangai, the space between worlds, is one such thing. But not all scientists consider it an unknown place of traversal, like the one who helped create you. Drawing on the very substance of the in-between world, you’ve taken similar traits yourself. Your Reiatsu is undetectable to other spiritual beings, blending in perfectly with the energy of the world around you. Short of seeing it with their own eyes, no one will know when you move to attack.  

But your true power emerges when you enter the precipice world of Dangai yourself, becoming like your natural habitat. You can exert control over this dimension, in accordance with your own power, and the things within it. You’re naturally immune to the Kototsu, the near unstoppable guardian within the tunnels, and can even direct it to attack others. As you grow stronger, manipulating the Koryu will let you greatly slow or accelerate the passage of time within this dimension, potentially allowing for months of research to occur within hours. With practice, creating a new environment tucked away within warped space and time here could make for quite the impenetrable lair. In other worlds, you’ll either be able to gain access to a similar dimension or exert appropriate levels of control over other in between worlds of similar properties. "
791,,400,The Rift(s),Mobius Final Fantasy,Domain,"A battleground where time is meaningless, filled with all sorts of phantasmal beasts and monsters that will truly test your combat abilities. Comes with all of the Rift Regions in Mobius Final Fantasy and updates to include Regions populated by powerful beasts and monsters from Jumps you've visited, so long as they are as strong as or more powerful than the current Rift Extreme Bosses in the game."
792,,400,Battle Tower,Mobius Final Fantasy,Domain,"A Tower filled with all matter of overwhelmingly powerful enemies. The tower itself is never-ending, so you may battle worthy foe's to your heart's content. If you were to ever die or take a fatal blow, you'll find yourself at the bottom of the tower, and beginning your ascent once more would see its many floors repopulated with different enemies."
793,,400,Ring of Braves/Hall(s) of Fame,Mobius Final Fantasy,Domain,"An Island with a giant tower on it. The Island itself acts like the Ring of Braves and the Tower acts like the Hall(s) of Fame. Merely think of the Job you wish to practice with and you'll be teleported to the corresponding floor within the Tower. The Island regularly updates with new monsters and enemies from the Jumps you've visited, and the order in which they appear rotates once a month, so you'll never be stuck fighting the same few enemies again and again and again ad nauseum."
794,,400,Sky Manipulation,Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Domain,"This technique grants her the ability to ""control the sky"". They can turn the sky into a tangible surface and use it to manipulate space, similar to how a lens creates distortion. You can casually use it to levitate and as an alternative to clothing. In battle, you can defend by distorting the shape of your opponent's attacks. While the surfaces you control can't crush her opponents directly, You can break the surface of the sky like a thin layer of ice and hit your target with the impact. This allows your attacks to slip past your opponent's guard and generate massive destruction."
795,,400,Domain Master,Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Domain,"This isn’t simply a you can now use a domain perk. Let’s get that said straight off the bat. No, this perk is well worth the price. Usually for Jujutsu Sorcerers having more than one domain is thought to be impossible because Jujutsu Sorcerers can only have one cursed technique to base it off of due to the limits of the human brain. But not you. You can now create domains both the barrier type and the overlay type for any ability or power you possess with enough training. For example if you had an ability to create ice your domain would be a snowy landscape where ice will stab anybody inside. Better get to work. P.S. You can only have one domain activated at a time."
796,,400,Sorothustran School ,A Mage Of Sorothustra,Domain,"It may surprise some to learn that as individualized as life and education are on Sorothustra some communities still make attempts to teach standardized approaches to Sorothustran sorcery, as well as help develop a uniform understanding of Sorothustran history. You can choose your current relationship with this school, whether you are its young and progressive headmaster, a popular and respected teacher, an up-and-coming pupil, or have some other connection to the place. In future settings you can use this as a place that can teach magic to even mundane people, and something about it allows even mundane people to learn basic, fairly generic magic, though you can develop lesson plans that allow students to become better at magic than they should logically be able to be, though only slightly so in most cases. You also make some profit off of this institution, though how much and what form the profit takes depends on your relationship with the school and the school’s success (it will always be successful enough to stay afloat and to provide you with a small income)."
797,,400,Pocket Dimension Home,A Mage Of Sorothustra,Domain,"Sorothustrans have an unusual way of making homes for themselves. They are fond of selecting a plot of land, making a very minor home, and then, in that home, constructing an elaborate pocket dimension that is as fantastical and whimsical as they want it to be. By purchasing this you gain the ability to far more easily fashion pocket dimensions and can construct them for other people with surpassing ease. You also gain a fiat-backed pocket dimension that you can access at all times and can retreat to at will, as well as will retain any changes or upgrades you make to it even in future jumps."
798,,400,Labyrinth,Seven Deadly Sins,Domain,"It rose up in a place of your choosing, a several mile wide labyrinth with walls that stretch tens of meters into the sky above you. Filled with winding pathways and deadly traps, the centre of the maze consists of a large, open platform that is easily used as a fighting tournament arena. Even if you’re not a Giant or have no abilities to manipulate the earth, this labyrinth heeds your will and commands. This great maze’s walls bend and reconfigure as guided by your will and you may even actively direct the floor and walls to aid you in combat. It’ll take a few minutes but you can even completely redesign the extent of the whole maze. "
799,,400,Holy Maiden,Seven Deadly Sins,Domain,"After the last Maiden was killed by the Red Demon who attacked the Fairy Forest, there was need of a replacement. They found you to be most suitable to take on the Holy Maiden’s role, though whether you carry out your duties is another role. As caretaker of the Fairy Forest, you can communicate with and exert great control over plants of all different kinds as long as you are near them, though your true ability is to create seeds that can be used to form Fairy Forests over time. While it will take years or decades to form the far-as-the-eye-can-see forests like the existing Fairy Forests, even a few days or weeks of care will see one of these seeds cover the area of a whole town with ease. When in one of these forests you are aware of all that the plants within it are and can freely control any of those plants no matter where in the forest you are. "
800,,400,Light Bullet,Dragon Ball Super,Domain,"Can’t beat what you can’t hit and odds are, if you can’t hit something then it’s moving fast enough to hit you like an intergalactic freight space-train. A special form has been unlocked within you, known as Light Bullet. When you switch this form on, you gain speed thousands of times beyond your normal level of speed. However, you are only able to move in straight lines in this form, severely limiting your agility even if you possess almost incomprehensible speed. By pushing your inner Ki to the very limit and rapidly using up your energy, you can instead activate Super Maximum Light Speed Mode. In this form, while wreathed by spiritual fire, you can move at a hundred times the speed you move in Light Bullet mode and have full control over yourself at that speed, letting you move however you wish. Now you can take your time beating down every foe before they even blink. "
801,,400,Time Skip,Dragon Ball Super,Domain,"You have the power to control time itself! At least a little bit. Similar to the assassin Hit, you have the technique learned that allows you to make time skip by a full tenth of a second, during which you can move freely while your opponent is left scrambling to keep up with the sped up time. It may not seem like a lot but a tenth of a second at this speed and skill level can end entire battles instantly. With training, you will be able to greatly improve this technique, learning to skip longer and longer periods of time, to fully freeze time for others or everyone and even to create small personal dimensions to store skipped time in. Perhaps you could find even more ways to manipulate time with practice. The one limitation to this technique is that it can be quite costly to your energy stores to use, especially at first. Perhaps it is most suited to a precise fighter. "
802,,400,Bahamut’s Room,Stranger Of Paradise - Final Fantasy Origins,Domain,A copy of the room where Bahamut sets his trials. Here you can set trials to find people worthy of your attention and all harm done within is guaranteed to be temporary and never lead to actual death and injury. This also grants you the ability to gift boons to people who win your approval which would drastically enhance their strength such that they would fare much better against someone who easily defeated them prior to receiving your blessing. It retains upgrades you make to it.
803,,400,Fiendish Location ,Stranger Of Paradise - Final Fantasy Origins,Domain,"A large area of an environment type of your choice. The monsters are of types of your choice and are completely loyal to you. Similar to the Chaos Shrine item, this place is under a strange effect to make it seem unimportant to others such that you could easily rest here undisturbed."
804,,400,Chaos Shrine,Stranger Of Paradise - Final Fantasy Origins,Domain,You receive a copy of the Chaos Shrine including a throne room for all your Chaos posing needs. This shrine has a strange ability to make itself seem uninimportant even to civilizations that are obsessed with controlling everything.
805,,400,Duelist,The Seven Deadly Sins,Domain,"This power allows the user to lock themself and whoever agrees to a duel with them to a ""Dueling Chamber"", a separate dimension from which only the winner can emerge. Behind each ""duelist"" stands a crystal monument in the shape of what they value most; in the case of Mortlach, it is his nephew, Diodra, per example.The challenge works according to the following rules: The winner is the one who first manages either to put the opponent out of action: either by killing them or by knocking them out. The two ""duelists"" cannot use Magic, and can only fight each other with physical attacks."
806,,400,Hell Gate,The Seven Deadly Sins,Domain,"This power allows the user to form portals for various purposes, such as summoning demons, traveling or communication."
807,,400,Haste,The Seven Deadly Sins,Domain,This power increases the user's speed to the point of being able to deliver such fast blows with a sword that can slice a person to pieces before they realize it.
808,,400,Realized,Shin Megami Tensei V,Domain,"God is everywhere. You know that and you serve his will. You realized the potential you may serve to the Lord and with it came a curious ability. A sort of instant teleportation is yours to do, much like Dazai when he will see his true potential, letting you instantly teleport everywhere you can see."
809,,400,City Frozen in Time,Final Fantasy XVI,Domain,"You receive a City frozen in time much like the one found on the Island of Mysidia. This could serve as great inspiration for developping spells, powers, abilities etc... related to the manipulation of time."
810,,400,Ultimania,Final Fantasy XVI,Domain,You receive the Ultimania. It is a training simulator that allows you to relive past battles and offers various challenges to test your skills and abilities thus allowing you to further refine them. There is no risk of injury or permanent death using it and if you do die while in the simulator you will simply be ejected outside it.
811,,400,The Earth Forge,The Elder Scrolls - Online,Domain,"Or rather a replica of it, attached to your warehouse or slotting into the world in the location of your choosing at the start of each jump. The Earth Forge is as much a fortress as it is a workshop, hidden far away prying eyes and located deep underground, its entrance guarded by a small fort carved out in ancient times. The Forge itself is located deep underground, only accessible by following a tunnel that can easily be used as a chokepoint to bottleneck an invading army or fortified into a near-impenetrable hall of traps and sealed dwemer-metal blast doors. It's real value however, is the smithy itself. Using flame salts (which never seem to run low), raw magma (which never seems to burn or cause heatstroke unless you physically leap into it) and a massive blast furnace (which never breaks or needs refueling) in addition to its magical nature and tools surpassing what even the Grand-Masters of Tamriel could hope to lay their hands on, the Earth Forge is quite possibly one of, if not the, greatest smith's workshops on Nirn, equaled perhaps only by the yet-undiscovered Aetherium Forge and the factories of Sotha Sil the Clockwork King. Comes with a small retinue of NPC guards to... well... guard it."
812,,400,Hermitage,The Elder Scrolls - Online,Domain,"You have your very own tower! Lower-case ""t"", not capital ""T"". Giving you a real fully functional [Tower] would be very bad for the stability of any universe you wind up in after this jump. No, what you have here is a spiraling bastion six stories high, brimming with everything a master mage such as yourself needs, from an empty library to hold all the books you steal discover, to fully stocked enchanting and alchemy labs, a formal dining hall for entertaining fellow scholars, an atronach forge, and even a few obscure reagents like animus stones, jars of aetherial dust, several purified sigil stones, and a single energetic animo core carefully contained in a hermetically sealed brass display case. All the mundane furniture has been created by master Hlaalu artisans imported directly from Narsis, while the high-quality magical equipment comes straight from the personally selected collection of Relicmaster Glenadir. Comes with an ominous basement full of creepy whispering, as every good wizard's tower ought to have. Can be built in either in the style of Sotha Sil's Clockwork City (think something like the Fyr Manor mod) or from solid crystal (aka Pocket Guide 1 style)."
813,,400,Shalidor's Backdoor,The Elder Scrolls - Online,Domain,"You've got a new attachment for your warehouse! It's... a hole. A big white hole. Floating in your wall. You now have a gateway to Eyevea, the island hideaway of Archmage Shalidor, and the ultimate refuge and training ground for mages across Tamriel. Granted, you'll be waiting a few months for The Vestige to come and reclaim it from Sheogorath the Laughing God, but once it's freed, you and your companions will be able to move back and forth through this portal freely, though for obvious reasons you can't leave the island and go to the mainland. Eyevea itself is a breathtaking island paradise, outfitted with the best magical equipment and reagents on Nirn, and the brightest young minds the Guild has to offer. There's no better place to train up your magical skills, debate your theories, or just relax with other scholars and share tales of your adventures."
814,,400,Private Sanctum,The Elder Scrolls - Online,Domain,"The Night Mother has chosen you as the instrument of her will across worlds, and thus has granted you your own miniature Sanctuary that follows you between jumps. A Dark Brotherhood sanctuary is one part monastery and two parts bunker - hidden underground or cut into the side of cliffs, guarded by skeletal warriors created from the bones of slain Brothers and Sisters, and most importantly, sealed behind the Black Door. Each Black Door is an unbreakable slab of solid ebony nearly half a foot thick bearing the iconography of the Night Mother. It will only open for those who answer its morbid riddle. By default, your door's riddle is ""What is the color of night?"" with the answer being: ""Sanguine, my brother."" though you can customize it to your liking. As for the actual particulars your newly minted cave dwelling, it features an impressive natural waterfall, a tavern room, a small library holding a book of prospective contracts which automatically updates as new Prayers are heard, a luxurious master bedroom, a beautiful (and completely poisonous) underground garden, a shrine to the Dread Father, and a small kitchenette. Being a hired killer doesn’t mean you don’t deserve to be comfy on your days off after all."
815,,400,Labyrinth,Greek Myth,Domain,"Much like the mighty minotaur you have your own highly complex lair. The structure is maze like and so cleverly constructed even a genius like Daedalus would have trouble escaping it. You of course are an exception and have a perfect mental map of the Labyrinth and can tell where you are within it at all times and detect the location of others within it. Furthermore the labyrinth has been designed to emphasize your natural traits and abilities. Monsters relying on ambush would find it dimly lit and full of places they could spring from, those more suited to direct combat would have large arenas leaving little space for a hero to sneak around in. Any man lost within this maze would take days to find their way out barring outside help but very few could survive that long with a monster hunting them through it."
816,,400,Independent Manifestation,Fate/Grand Order Part 2,Domain,"One of the most dangerous aspects of Beasts is that until truly defeated, there is no escape from them. The reason for this is Independent Manifestation, a Skill that even Beast Candidates can obtain. There are many benefits to this Skill; firstly, it confirms your own existence. You won’t need a source of magical energy to remain manifested if you are the kind of being that would need such existential support, like a Servant. It also grants you immunity to instant-death effects and attacks utilizing control over time. Such resistance includes being unaffected by somebody messing with your past, for example.

Secondly, just like the name implies, it allows for your manifestation without requiring great amounts of magical energy or a Master to summon you. The way this looks is that you fade into blue energy in a similar manner to Servant summoning or unsummoning, and lasts for about a second. This self-manifestation has a very impressive range, letting you spontaneously travel anywhere on the Planet you wish to go, even to alternate timelines or into magically protected spaces. That said, if you do not know the location of a destination you have in mind, you will need some kind of sympathetic connection to your target, such as perhaps a small object you used to own. Purchasing this perk also allows you to purchase the Evil of Humanity Modifier, as shown above. Or maybe you intend to use this Skill without becoming a Beast?"
817,,400,The Vortex World,Shin Megami Tensei 3: Nocturne,Domain,"A perfect copy of the Vortex World as it was when you started this Jump. It is now a part of your warehouse that you can access at any time, and you can do with it what you please. It is full of all of the Demons and other creatures that originally resided there, but none of the Humans still exist. You may contract Demons from this world.

Note: Kagustuchi can either be a perfect copy that simply lacks the power to create a new world, or it can simply be a light in the middle of the world."
818,,400,The Labyrinth of Amala,Shin Megami Tensei 3: Nocturne,Domain,"Your very own version of the Labyrinth of Amala, as if you never touched it. With this, all of the riches and challenges that exist there are still there for you to claim. This becomes a part of your warehouse, and you can reset it at any point in time."
819,,400,Dungeon Maker ,Shin Megami Tensei 3: Nocturne,Domain,"As a Leader of a Reason, or in defence of yourself, you will need to make defensive measures. With this, you now are unparalleled in making dull, expansive, frustrating, time consuming, and tedious dungeons that will tempt even the most patent of people into just giving up. You also now instinctively know how to use various enchantments and other supernatural methods in these."
820,,400,Amala User,Shin Megami Tensei 3: Nocturne,Domain,"You now have access to the Amala Terminals and can use them to travel within the Amala Network. This is normally instantaneous, but interference can cause you to need to fight your way through. As a note, without special circumstances, you can only use this method to travel to terminals you have already accessed. You also gain the ability to summon a Terminal once a day that will serve as an access point. This will work in other Jumps as well, but you will have to set up your own network once you're there. The Terminals that you set up will only ever be able to be used by you and those you allow to use it. If a method of transferring from place to place already exists in the world you are in, you may choose to tap into that or to ignore it entirely."
821,,400,Metaverse Vehicle,Persona 5 Royal,Domain,"It may not be the best idea to travel Mementos on foot. Aside from how long it would take, you may need to run away from the Reaper quickly. This should help with that. This is a Land Vehicle of your choice. It can be a small Van the shape of the Mona Car, or one similar to Jose’s little cart. It also comes with the ability to shapeshift into a Helicopter. You can summon it whenever you want and after this Jump, even use it in reality."
822,,400,My Palace,Persona 5 Royal,Domain,"This is not a Palace like the ones the distorted individuals of this World have. This is your own little corner of the Cognitive realm, designed to look like a mixture between a Club and a Museum. In it you can view Movies of your past adventures, display Cognitive Trophies or copies of whatever you have encountered (ranging from enemies to allies or locations), relax while playing Tycoon with your friends, listen to music and so on."
823,,400,Demonic Pit,Diablo 3,Domain,"A place to call home... or maybe not, depending on your taste. This piece of the Burning Hells is now owned by you, without question. It is hidden at the Outer Circles and is guarded by a small Legion of Demons ranging from weak to terrifyingly strong that may squabble and fight with each other but will always be alert for potential intruders. The Legion consists of Imps, Hellish Soldiers, Hellish Commanders, 6 Punishers (2 of every kind), 30 Impalers, 15 Fallen Shamans, at least 100 Hell Hounds, two Mallet Lords and one unnamed and extremely powerful Demon. You can pull these Demons out one at a time (at most 3 can be outside of a Hell-Dimension at the same time, the Mallet Lord and the powerful Demon cannot be pulled out, all of this can be overcome with by growing in power, especially of the demonic kind) to fight or help you where you are at the moment. You can also put the soul of anyone you or your forces killed or any soul you may consume, gain or whatever you used to acquire it in any way shape or form, to be doomed here to be twisted into a Demon that serves you. The strength of the Demon depends on the strength of the Being, ranging from weak Imps all the way up to a Punisher. Should you yourself die, you can choose to be reformed here in your throne in the middle of it, consuming some of your forces like a black hole to reform your body faster. This can only happen once per decade and of course when enough demonic flesh to reform your body is here. The amount of flesh needed is relative to your overall power, not just your body and mass.

The Demons and this Structure will follow you to Future Worlds and will always remain a threat to the Human Equivalent there, like here in Sanctuary. You can also choose that this gets connected to the local equivalent of Hell or becomes a Pocket Dimension, in which case it loses the ability to attract and possibly recruit other Demons, but is safer from intruders.

After this Jump you can use this pit to form any Demon that serves you into another sort of Demon. It will not get stronger or weaker or get another personality through this, but with this you get more variety in your demonic army, should you desire different shapes."
824,,400,Diamond Gate,Diablo 3,Domain,"With this you can choose to become a Gate Guardian Angel in your role too in addition to whatever Heaven or the Angiris gave you in the first place.

This shining gate will be your bulwark against anything invading that you want (you can import this into any one structure you normally reside in in case of wars. You must decide at the beginning of each Jump which Structure you own should have this). As long as these Gates stand nothing can invade what they are attached to. It doesn’t matter if your opponents can teleport, rip apart reality or can do something even more esoteric. If these gates are standing and closed nothing can come in unless you allow it. The gates may be extremely durable and are basically immune against anything Humanity could ever come up with but they are not indestructible. The light they emit will weaken lesser Demons but a Demonlord or higher could completely ignore it. The light also reveals all that try to hide from battle, so no one will be unnoticeable or invisible.

The Gates also will spawn Angels (which will scale to any Setting they are inside atm) in order to defend it without any end to them (if a Battle is at hand). They cannot leave the perimeter of it (which is still an entire Battlefield-size) but they will protect you and the Gates with their very existence. They will return to the Light of this Heavenly Gate if no threats to it are left anymore. Should you fall during your Holy Duty, the Gates will use its powers to resurrect you once out of the Holy Light of Anu it is made out of. This can only occur once per decade."
825,,400,‘Eternal’ Kingdom ,Diablo 3,Domain,"A Kingdom fit for a Ruler like you! This Kingdom can truly be called ‘eternal’ as it is full with loyal subjects who loyally follow you and see you as their only true ruler. They will be so loyal in fact, that they will follow you into death and beyond. Literally. Should you die the entire kingdom will also die rather quickly. But should you come back, they will also come back the same way. Should you for example..come back as a skeleton, all subjects will come back as a skeleton. Another interesting effect is that all subjects, even children, can defend themselves quite well. They will protect their home and kingdom with their very lives. And probably come back later as a skeleton anyway to continue their eternal duty happily. Also anyone who dies here, no matter if friend or foe, will come back as a loyal skeleton-citizen.

In order for this to work the throne will bring your Skeleton back to live once per decade."
826,,400,Five Bells Toll        ,GrimGrimoire,Domain,"This inescapable cycle... can you truly harness something of its nature? It seems so. Within the space of a year you may once invoke an interruption in the river of events, one spanning five days past. You shall live through those spans of days five times, and at the end of it, may take the form of events you most treasure as ‘truth.’ 

Also note that while few things travel from one interaction to the next, knowledge does. Not merely that in your head; any receptacle of knowledge you have claimed will remain claimed. If it’s a common work, then you merely have another copy. But if it’s rare or unique... this does not change that fact, merely changes in whose hands it rests."
827,,400,Messenger,Final Fantasy XV Royal Edition,Domain,"You are one of the messengers of the gods or somehow have the same ability, when you step out of people's point of view, you can circumvent time-space to instantly travel (teleport) to any place or person with any object you can carry, you can also take other people with you but it will be very exhausting and it will get worse as the number of people “on board”, your misdirection ability is exceptional just by talking about or pointing for something everyone will focus on it and in most cases you don't need to do anything. You can teleport with other people watching, but that takes the fun out of it."
828,,400,Idyllic Home,Journey To The West,Domain,"Sun Wukong was born in the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit, an earthly paradise of a mountain found somewhere in the Eastern Sea. Now, you find yourself owning a similar mountain, somewhere else. It might even be on land if you wish. This mountain is lush and full of beautiful plants, most of which bear delicious fruit. You could live entirely on the fruits and berries you may find by scavenging around, and strangely, the flora of this mountain is incredibly resilient, nothing short of the entire mountain being burned down even making a dent in how lush and filled with fruit this mountain is. On top of that, this mountain is inhabited by 72 species of intelligent and talking animals, each with a (weak) demon king of their own. From monkeys, lions, bulls, panthers, and lots of other animals that are probably supposed to be from wildly different climates and biomes. Another interesting feature is a picturesque waterfall, hiding a surprisingly furnished cave able to house tens of thousands of individuals comfortably, that also has an indoor river of its own somehow. You could live a life of leisure even without wrangling all the animals on the mountain into a beat nation."
829,,400,Tower of Babel,Generic Angels and Demons,Domain,"The fortress that one day was supposed to be one of humankind’s greatest creations and would be able to reach the Heavens, but that ended up failing and eventually was destroyed due to the divine forces that decided to punish the humans due to their arrogance. While the original tower doesn’t exist anymore (or it hasn't even been built yet depending on when you arrived here), you receive your own version of the Tower of Babel, one that was actually finished. You gain the ownership of a colossal fortress in the form of a giant tower way taller than any other ancient or modern human building, protected by walls around a quarter of its size. This legendary fortress is extremely durable despite being made of mundane materials, being impervious to any natural disasters and capable of withstanding the explosion of a point-blank nuclear bomb. The tower and its walls also have an additional protection in the form of mystical runes that increases its durability against demonic and angelic forces, as well as allowing them to repair themselves over time. In addition to being a fortress, the tower is also akin to a self-sufficient vertical city of massive proportions, capable of comfortably housing even a billion of people at once and having all the structures and buildings needed for a city to work, with some examples being hospitals, greenhouses, schools and even places for entertainment, like theaters. Lastly, the tower will appear in a place of your choice, in this world and any future one you visit."
830,,400,Fjord Drakkar,Fate/Legends - Voyage to Valhalla,Domain,"What greater Vessel could a Viking wish for, than one belonging to the All Father himself? This naval Vessel is an underworld ship, once used by Odin to ferry the corpse of his blood descendant through the fjords. It is capable of traversing between the realms of the living and the dead, being capable of acting self-destructive to take the prey on top of the ship along with oneself to death. But even beyond that it is a fine ship, with sails of light, rows of shields on its flanks that can serve as magical energy thrusters and the mast itself as a pike when the ship itself does not need to be used. It is fast, mobile, powerful and stealthy all in one."
831,,400,Workshop,Fate/Legends - Voyage to Valhalla,Domain,"Any creator needs a place to work, to truly let their creativity flow. Fortunately for you there is this workshop. This places only purpose is to support you in your craft, whatever shape it may take. An alchemist may find potent replenishing supplies of resources he needs, while a musician receives the greatest of instruments. Notes by peers in your chosen craft, be it other artists or alchemists perhaps, can also be found here.

This workshop furthermore boosts one’s own creativity and motivation, allowing them to truly hone in and do in one afternoon what they could otherwise needed weeks for.

As a last benefit this workshop is foolproof against infiltration and assassination attempts. Anyone planting a bomb here will simply be unable to activate it and that is if they find it. You need time to work after all."
832,,400,Swan Mystic Code,Fate/Legends - Voyage to Valhalla,Domain,"To dance among the skies of the battlefield, wings may not always be needed. You are in possession of a special kind of Mystic Code, crafted by Odin for his Valkyries. In a beautiful pure white, these garments allow one to fly at high speeds and have remarkable mobility and agility. However the true benefit goes much deeper than mere flight. Enchanted by the Greatest of the Norse Gods, it protects the wearers mind and soul. Any hostile magecraft fails to influence the wearers mind are repelled, in addition to less powerful physical attacks being repelled. As a last benefit your body does not change or grow fat no matter the calories you consume while wearing it. Do be careful not to misplace it while bathing or the like."
833,,400,Dragonsreach,The Elder Scrolls: Dovah,Domain,"Crafted in the ornate wooden style of the great Nord longhouses of ancient days, this palace was built in order to house the captured dragon Numinex. It holds all of the amenities you’d expect from a palace, from the main hall to numerous guest rooms, an extensive kitchen and larder, even an area made exclusively for the court mage. Despite its construction, Dragonsreach is extremely resistant to fire, as well as magic in general."
834,,400,Jumper Academy,Mushoku Tensei ~ Jobless Reincarnation ~,Domain,"The Academy is for learning and what would be the point of it if it can’t do that. This gives you a academy merged with your warehouse where you can deploy it to any location that you want. The building is made of resistant materials that can resist Emperor-Rank Magic or Physical attacks along with it being inscribed with Magic-Circles that emit Healing Magic at Saint-Rank that is capable of healing most injuries aside from lost-limbs. The academy is staffed by really human looking automatons that can teach students of martial arts and magic that you know and have access to even general knowledge like math to physics grated that if you have that knowledge. The students that learn and attend here can reach Saint-Rank of either Warrior or Magician at minimum within five years of attending and PhD for certain subjects should you have access to it. The deployed Academy has multiple magic-circles inscribed that it can resist a siege from God-Rank Magic-Spells or Physical Attacks, and the academy is emitting a Saint-Rank Healing-Spells that heals anyone inside. Post-Jump it would leave a copy in the previous worlds that you deployed it so that it won’t magically disappear when time flows normal after you attain your spark."
835,,400,Armored Sky Fortress,Mushoku Tensei ~ Jobless Reincarnation ~,Domain,This is a flying island with a large and extremely lavish castle that replicates the sky castle of Perugius. The sky castle is large enough to house a thousand people comfortably with a lot of space to spare for other facilities and it even has its own function to produce and generate its own water and electricity if you need it along with the function that automatically cleans itself. The sky castle is also made from a physically and magically resistant material making it incredibly durable that it can resist a God-Class Magic Spell with little damage. Any damage it sustains that didn’t destroy it would slowly be repaired in hours along with any changes and modifications that you made would be remembered.
836,,400,Estate,Elder Scrolls Online – The Vestige,Domain,"Maybe you don’t want to spend all your time fighting, killing and generally risking your life. Maybe you just want to stand back and relax while the innumerable other Vestige solve the problems for you. Then, this is what you need. This building is both a house and a monetary investment. Maybe it's surrounded by fertile farmland or has a shop connected to it? Whatever it is, it offers luxurious accommodations, alongside a Follower workforce that will generate the same amount of money Gold For Days gives you each month. It also contains all the workstations you would need to practice your crafts, whatever those might be. To top it all, it’s surprisingly well protected, both against mundane and arcane intrusion or attacks."
837,,400,Mundus’ Stone,Elder Scrolls Online – The Vestige,Domain,"These pillars of stone with engraving of the various constellations of Mundus have a great power: by touching them, you gain the blessing of that particular constellation. It’s nothing overwhelming, but it’s useful. Now you possess something quite unique: a personalized Mundus’ Stone. Once per day you can change the constellation engraved on it and get a completely different bonus. In future Jumps, you’ll be able to incorporate different constellations with unique bonuses on it."
838,,400,Wayshrine,Elder Scrolls Online – The Vestige,Domain,"One of the special shrines that let Vestiges like you to rebuild their bodies. You now have a personal one, that you can place anywhere you want. On top of giving you a way to return to the land of the living without help, it also lets you teleport to it at will, even when you’re ‘dead’. As a bonus, I’ll give you the knowledge of how to build similar shrines. They will not have the ability to help you return, but they will act as teleportation beacons in places where normally there wouldn’t be any."
839,,400,Thousand-Mile Flight: Mastema,Akame ga Kill!,Domain,"This Teigu takes the form of a pair of floating discs that sprout feathery wings which give the user the ability to fly for a limited amount of time, capable of flying with high maneuverability and at high speeds to the point that the user will be able to easily catch up to an Air Manta, as well as giving them the ability to hover. To attack, the Teigu also enables its user to shoot its feathers or launch one of the wings toward enemies, both easily capable of piercing through flesh, but, due to its attack method, Mastema is only effective when attacking at a long distance and is at a disadvantage in close range, however, to counteract this weakness at close range, there is its trump card, God's Wings, which alter the wings to be formed out of an ethereal substances rather than its usual feathers, giving them the ability to reflect an opponent's attacks and to act as a protective shield. It’s unknown the exact limits of this ability, as attacks powerful enough probably can’t be reflected by it. Lastly, it’s also possible to use a single disc and wing at once instead of necessarily needing to use both, as shown by the governor of Joyou."
840,,400,Green Thumb,Marvel: Age of Krakoa,Domain,"You possess the powers of Florakinesis, the ability to control and manipulate plants, fungi, and related organisms. This includes inducing growth or altering their forms and properties to say, turn the grass beneath someone's feet into super strong tendrils to grapple them with or a sunflower into a fanged maw, or crafting weapons out of still-living hardwood. This is a pretty free-form power, the more you practice the more applications you’ll find. Additionally, you receive sensory feedback based on what the plants and fungi perceive. While not sentient as we recognize it plants and fungi can pick up a surprising amount of information and exchange it across a symbiotic network of roots and mycelium that might as well be a nervous system and all of that is available to you... Which also allows communication with sentient plants that lack the power of conventional communication. Your range starts out relatively small, line of sight tops, but could eventually cap out large enough for you to synchronize with every bit of flora on a large jungle-island nation. A purchase of this power discounts an appropriate purchase of Non-Living Form."
841,,400,Speedster,Marvel: Age of Krakoa,Domain,"You’re fast, Jumper. Very fast. With this perk you can manipulate your momentum or personal time flow or something along those lines, allowing you to casually cruise along at supersonic speeds. Naturally, you have the enhanced perception, reaction time, stamina, metabolic efficiency, and durability—especially concerning tendons and ligaments—for those to work properly. With time and effort, you might be able develop all sorts of cool tricks involving your speed or the effects that cause it. Eventually, you might even be able to run at relativistic speeds."
842,,400,Force of Nature,Marvel: Age of Krakoa,Domain,"There are two versions of this power. Either you have control over all aspects of the weather, the power to fly by hoisting yourself aloft with the wind, and the ability to generate blasts of lightning from your hands, or else you would gain control over the elements of the earth, including magma, as well as plants and fungi. In either case, you have a connection to the biosphere that lets you sense the flow of life energy through a planet and anything on it within your area of control. You start with an area of effect roughly the size of a city block and can train it up to a large metropolitan area. This can be purchased twice to gain both versions of the power, but each counts as a separate power for the purposes of discounts.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
843,,400,Peach Garden,Chinese Mythology,Domain,"This, my friend, is no ordinary peach orchid. This is a replica of the peach garden owned by the Queen Mother of the West, holding its own peaches of immortality. Unlike hers, your peaches ripen far faster, taking only a few months to bud and ripen, and holding its fruit all year round. Eating a peach from this garden grants agelessness and physical immortality, allowing one to live indefinite lives, and stopping them from dying to mundane means. This garden is housed in your Warehouse, and is restored in a month should it somehow be damaged or destroyed."
844,,400,Somersault Cloud,Chinese Mythology,Domain,"This little cloud functions as a platform you can use. With a single leap, it can transport you ten thousand miles in moments. This cloud can be instantly called to you upon invocation, and can be called on to transport those other than yourself."
845,,400,Piece of Hell,Chinese Mythology,Domain,"Many monsters and demons live in Diyu, often in service to the Yama kings present. This plot of land is your own little slice of hell, with a cozy residence and an environment hostile to unwelcome visitors. You can choose from which court of hell this plot comes from, such as the Mountain of Flames or the Hill of Ice. Has a mansion in the middle and the environment within will not harm you. Exists as a Warehouse attachment and will restore itself a month after damage or destruction."
846,,400,Peach Blossom Spring,Chinese Mythology,Domain,"This sanctuary is obscured by a forest of peach trees, with a stream leading through the forest. Past this forest is a grotto with residences and living amenities, where one can live in relative comfort. This place is perpetually hidden from prying eyes, and cannot be reached nor detected through mundane means unless you allow it. This sanctuary will always be within reach for you, and in future jumps will follow you in close proximity."
847,,400,Judgement Hall ,Hazbin Hotel,Domain,Heaven is not just for good times. On occasion judgement needs to be passed and this is the ideal stage for such acts. Any judicial decision made in this court will be considered absolute by any authority and even the losers will have to accept the decisions. Warning: this does not guarantee that they will go peacefully but any authority figure and individual will consider what happened in this Hall fair and just.
848,,400,Gifted to be here,Hazbin Hotel,Domain,"The Pearly Gates aren’t for the Sinners to cross even those as strong as the First of the Fallen himself- now you are able to imbue the borders of your lands or those of your faction with a uncrossable property allowing you to bar access to any who don’t meet the standards you set.

That isn’t to say that it’s impossible to break in against your will however it would require incredible effort even for someone like Lucifer to cross without your consent and you will instantly know when the barrier is broken."
849,,400,Lots of Rules,Hazbin Hotel,Domain,"Heaven has a great many rules and it would be easy to consider most of them absolute- and now so can you.

You are able to set rules for your territory and followers with a punishment of your choosing- this punishment will be carried out automatically provided the majority of those it applies to consider it fair.

The effects of your rules can be blunted somewhat if the victim is powerful enough or receives some form of special exemption- for example Lucifer violating a rule whose punishment was death might instead be banished (assuming of course you aren’t already much stronger than what this Jump offers.)"
850,,400,Laboratory,Devil May Cry,Domain,"The polar opposite of the Lodge, this underground facility focuses on the more science-y and “logical” side of the demonic equation. Containment rooms, beakers, growing vats, demon tissue samples... If it sounds like something you’d find in a shady secret lab, you’re certain to find it here."
851,,400,Magical Lodge,Devil May Cry,Domain,"A place for the more intellectually-minded among us. This private library contains more instructional manuscripts, legends about demons, and reagents than you can shake a stick at. It’s pretty reasonably secluded, to the point where most normal folks won’t be able to find it, but from time to time, you might get a couple visitors looking to exchange knowledge."
852,,400,The Power To Move Worlds         ,The Destiny Universe,Domain,"When he arrived in the Sol System, the first thing the Witness did after clearing out any potential threats to his plans was use an arcane skill to completely remove a great many of Sol’s planets from the system. This power, moving worlds, completely engulfed these worlds in Darkness so potent that even upon returning, their worlds were still suffering the after-effects of this submersion, such as Mars being covered in Darkness ‘scars’ that were revealed to be localized distortions in spacetime that rolled back the clock anywhere from years to centuries. The Witness used this ability to scour these worlds for their secrets from a position of safety - now this power is yours. Scaling to your own power, you can move anything from localized areas to entire celestial objects to even several at a time, effectively rendering them completely impenetrable by any you would not allow inside. What you choose to do with these newfound territories is up to you, perhaps you could seek out secrets as the Witness did, use them as areas of solitude and recovery, or instead turn them into impregnable fortresses should they ever be brought back into reality. Bear in mind that when the Witness left our reality for that of the inside of the Traveler, many of his stolen worlds and territories began to return, and Savathun upon acquiring the Light was even able to steal them for herself and return them of her own will, so moving worlds is not completely fool-proof. However, Savathun was noted to use what is theorized to be a Hive Magic equivalent to his same ability to move the Traveler into her Throne World, so perhaps with enough raw power, and a Throne World of your own, you could do the same?"
853,,400,Darkness Zone ,The Destiny Universe,Domain,"One of the most feared things among the Guardians of the City - Darkness Zones. The exact nature of these enigmatic areas are unknown, as is the mechanics of how it works and why it prevents Guardians from resurrecting on their own. While some theorize that it’s because Ghosts revive Guardians by searching adjacent timelines and finding one in which their Guardian is still alive, thus meaning that Darkness Zones are areas that are so lethal their Guardian does not survive in any reality, others believe that it is simply an area that is so deeply corrupted by the Darkness that the Light cannot penetrate it, thus requiring these areas to be assaulted by full fireteams who can contribute their light to their comrade’s Ghosts and assist in their resurrection. Whatever the case may be, the ability to create these darkness zones is now yours - your strength in the Darkness is so great that you can create these zones on your own, and through your own will and power, greatly hinder groups of Guardians’ ability to resurrect, and outright remove the lone wolf fools that attack you without help. After this jump, this ability will extend to all types of resurrection - any who step into your Darkness Zone will be rendered mortal."
854,,400,The Lost World,Epic of Leviathan,Domain,"Admit it everyone dreams of having an army of dinosaurs at least once. Well this isn’t necessarily an army, but it is a supply of dinosaurs. This is a large continent filled with many dinosaurs and other extinct animals. This will include different variants and unique creatures from each universe. For example there will be species from Jurassic Park, the Savage Land (Marvel), and supernatural animals (Marvel, DC, DxD, etc...). You may buy this multiple times to increase the size of the area. The size would go something like a normal continent, Pangea, Earth, Neptune, Jupiter, and so on. As the size increases you will also gain larger and larger animals including some super sized versions of other creatures."
855,,400,Beyond This Petty Illusion ,Kult: Divinity Lost,Domain,"The institutions and religious trappings pervading human society are more than smoke and mirrors-they are the substance of the Archons themselves spun into abstract mechanisms of control and restraint. Having internalised this principle, when you accrue political and social standing in an establishment the authority you exert feeds back a measure of supernatural power that empowers your own efforts. Spells last longer and hit harder, supernaturally gifted strength strikes harder and rituals of all kinds are easier and quicker to pull off as long as you perform them somewhere where you regularly exert temporal authority of some kind. While the effects are fairly low key, even a mortal with a middle manager position might be able to curse his hated boss or freely fly about his office."
856,,400,The Flame of Liberty ,Scion ,Domain,"Gods are not the only expression of Legend in the Overworld. Where archetypal feats of ancient craftsmanship resonate with symbolic importance in both the realm of the gods and the imaginations of mankind, certain sites can become a mystical portal of sorts into the true, Platonic ideal of that site or monument-called Touchstones. You now own a marvellous statue comparable to the Statue of Liberty itself or the historical Colossus of Rhodes, which grants access to the Touchstone that is the archetypal Colossus itself. Standing tall on a circular seal of gold surrounded by water, its visage is beautiful. Depending on the viewer it can wear a heroic man’s strong features or a patrician woman’s, but it is always the archetypal symbol of freedom. A passageway at the hem of the statue’s robes leads to what is also it’s exit, and it’s greatest treasure: The golden bonfire of its torch, whipping wildly in the winds. Fate has mandated that those who come to see the glory of freedom must experience it, and not only do the flames not burn flesh before releasing you back to the real world but with an effort of will one who can wield the Fire, Guardian, Justice or Sun Purviews can fully replenish their reserves of Legend. More than anything, the Colossus stands for the celebration of freedom as an ideal itself, radiating optimising and noble courage to all who bask in its glory. Even the grimmest heart can be moved by its stately warmth."
857,,400,Infinity Mirror,Fate/Faerie Britain,Domain,"A Mystic Code created by High Queen Morgan, this mirror allows you to travel to any location you have previously been to in each jump in exchange for a pittance of mana."
858,,400,Around Caliburn,Fate/Faerie Britain,Domain,"Through the use of this energy-intensive technique, similar to but distinct in function from a Reality Marble, you can manifest your mental world upon the physical world. Now, this can’t accomplish what a true Reality Marble can—you can’t alter the rules of the world, nor accomplish the near-impossible feats attributed to users of Reality Marbles that bring them so close to being True Magic—but depending on what bits of your mentality or memories you manifest, you can produce a wide variety of effects, which become stronger based on how central that part of your mind is to your life, personality, and the very concept of “you”.

That said, you have also been given a gift; if you are an Avalon le Fae, this is your very birthright, but otherwise it is a unique glimpse into Paradise shown only to you. It is a look into Avalon itself, that ever-distant utopia. The mere memory of this place has power, and if you were to draw upon this memory for Around Caliburn, it would allow you to accomplish the impossible and manifest an Anti- Purge Defense—a truly ultimate protection that no degree of power can overcome and no concept can pierce. This memory will provide this Anti-Purge Defense to your allies, purify them of ailments and corruption, and provide a surging boost to their power.

However, this image of Avalon is meant as a gift to be shared, not jealously hoarded. Although the technique will otherwise last for as long as you supply it magical energy, if you allow the Anti-Purge Defense to also protect you, then the duration is sharply reduced; the defense will fade from each person affected as soon as it blocks a single attack on them.

Be warned; this is fueled by your own power, rather than being brought into existence by means of a true artifact of Avalon such as the legendary sheath of Excalibur, and as such it may be possible to remove this “absolute” defense, even if it can’t actually be pierced or bypassed."
859,,400,Fae Domain,Fate/Faerie Britain,Domain,"Fae Domains are by no means unique to the Wing Clan, but there’s no denying that Gloucester is the most prominent example of a Fae Domain in modern Faerie Britain. A Fae Domain is a powerful mystery comparable to a Reality Marble that shapes the world in accordance to the beliefs and mindset of a particularly powerful faerie. For instance, because Murian never leaves Gloucester, everyone in the city loses “the power gained from growth” and are reverted to the proverbial “level one”, although they aren’t truly reduced to the power of infants. Another example is the Fae Domain of Lord Foul Weather, who could use the skill to bolster defenses by creating and reinforcing buildings, and is capable of creating an entire cathedral in a single night.

You are free to design the capabilities of your own Fae Domain so long as it is not significantly stronger than the examples provided, and have the power to turn it on and off as you like. Do be warned that sufficiently knowledgeable and/or powerful magical enemies could destroy your Fae Domain from the outside, forcing you to laboriously re-establish it. Your Fae Domain starts off only covering the area of a large mansion if you’re a normal fairy, but as time passes it will increase in size."
860,,400,Roundtable Hold ,Elden Ring - Altus Plateau,Domain,"A grand manor, it was once a gathering place of champions, who would receive the wisdom of the Two Fingers. And it can be so once more, should you extend your invitation to them. You, as well as those who accept your invitation, will be capable of transporting themselves to this hold in an instant, regardless of distance or circumstance. With it possessing a well stocked library and larder, armory, smithy, and plenty of rooms, none can deny that this is anything but a home for champions."
861,,400,Done Before Bedtime        ,South Park: The Stick of Truth,Domain,"Canonically the New Kid manages to go from a fresh face to King all in the span of three days. You’ll find yourself a little extra time every day, just enough to get any of those outstanding side quests finished, even if it takes a trek to the other side of town to do so."
862,,400,Portal to the Alternate Dimension,Generic TCG Anime,Domain,"This magical device gives you access to the Other Side!...Or more precisely, it connects the Real World and the Duel World and allows for going from one to another. The portal can be opened on any flat surface and be anywhere from fist-sized to seven feet high, decided when you cast it on a given surface. Furthermore, it’s a one-way portal each time - from whichever world you’re in to the other one - and lasts until you close it. So go ahead, hop over and visit your monster friends...just remember, that Duel World? It’s a real f***ing mess, because they always are."
863,,400,The Argo,A Wild Last Boss Appeared!,Domain,"A large and ornate flying ship capable of housing a few hundred troops quite comfortably has attached you in a very special way. At any moment, it can be summoned by you and it will appear whenever you command it, unless some truly powerful force can stop you from using the skill to call it.

It is capable of moving across the world in just a few hours, as well as flying at heights of tens of thousands of meters without danger for its occupants. Besides that, it has not much on the offensive department. It can be controlled mentally, as well as piloted as if it was a regular ship, and if destroyed, it can be resummoned just by expanding some of your SP."
864,,400,Void Key,Cradle V1,Domain,"You gain a magical space closet, about 7 feet by 3 feet. This can be used to store anything you need. No weight limit just needs to be able to stuff inside the door."
865,,400,Empty Darkness,Egyptian Mythology,Domain,"It is one of the great nightmares of Egyptians to have their soul wander lost in the darkness forever, never to find Heaven or even Duat, and so I give you nothing. A lot of it. An entire realm of darkness and silence, stretching forever. On purchasing this item, you may decide if it is a void with only empty air, or whether this is a barren flat desert plain that extends into infinity, without even an odd rock to break its monotony.

Beings and souls sent into this empty darkness cannot escape unless pulled out from outside; barring you, of course, who have free leave to enter and exit at your pleasure."
866,,400,Solar Barque,Egyptian Mythology,Domain,"While merely an imitation of Ra’s magnificent vessel, this shallow-drafted boat is richly decorated with the gold signs of the sun. It charts its own course according to your will, able to fly through the sky and travel along waterways, the wind, or beams of sun or moonlight into other realms (Duat and Aaru, heavens, underworlds, other planes of existence etc.). In times of need, the Solar Barque may ignite a small sun of its own above its deck, casting fiery light about it, like a much larger Solar Disc (see Solar/Lunar Disc item) that can light up the land at night or push back the shadows of Duat for hours at a time.

In defiance of logic it may be used to give heliocentric settings the middle finger for a short while, ‘carrying’ the true sun across the sky to seemingly change the time of day. Abberating the natural order costs dearly of your personal heka. Changes made to the sun’s natural cycle will ‘reset’ back to the usual pattern within five days at most, and usually less."
867,,400,Bamf,Marvel Zombies,Domain,"Not the acronym. It’s the sound commonly associated with Nightcrawler when he teleports. You can guess where we’re going with this. You can teleport too, through the same method of very briefly (so fast that you won’t be aware of it) entering the brimstone dimension before reappearing. You can teleport great distances if you’re really pushing it, but then again, pushing it means that you’ll be exhausted and won’t be able to do it again soon. Stick to two or three miles at most if you want to do it sustainably. Which you will, as you can rapidly teleport immediately after materializing once again. You can bring passengers or things along with you, provided they’re human-sized or smaller."
868,,400,Magicite Bloom,Final Fantasy XII,Domain,"You expend a fraction of your magick reserve and a cloud of dust shoots into the air around you. The more magick you expend the larger the cloud. Once the cloud hits the ground, magicite will grow and begin sucking up ambient arcane energies. Maximum range of twenty meters."
869,,400,Creeping Jagd ,Final Fantasy XII,Domain,"You can plant one seed of corruption per world. This creates a Jagd that grows at a rate of 50 meters per day in all directions. We’ve measured a completed Jagd, and it stopped growing once it hit the size of small city. Either way, once the process is complete the seed then becomes the epicenter, where magick of any kind fails entirely.

The magick disabling effect decreases in strength the further it gets from the epicenter. Also, flora and fauna closer to the epicenter are slowly mutated into monstrous and barbaric forms. Sapient life can resist this to some degree, but prolonged exposure will drive them insane."
870,,400,Clan Primer ,Final Fantasy XII,Domain,"You can mark an area up to the size of a small house, and designate that as under protection by the “Clan Primer”. The Primer prevents external individuals from entering without permission and prevents fighting from occurring inside the area.

It is possible to shoot into the area however, so it is best to put up some sturdy barricades. You may designate an area each time you enter the world, but once it is set it may not be changed until you leave."
871,,400,Labyrinth Entrance,Percy Jackson and the Olympians,Domain,"It seems that you have quite the find, here. You appear to have a strange door in your Warehouse that opens into a long hallway. What you’ll find after walking down said hallway, however, is that you’ve somehow ended up in the Labyrinth itself and your entrance has disappeared (although it will reveal itself if prompted to). Both a place of untold danger and treasure, it is certainly quite the convenience in both adventuring and transportation needs, as its strange ability to warp both space and time makes long distance travel a cinch. Post jump the Labyrinth will manifest itself in future worlds, complete with new thematic monsters and treasures if the setting should apply."
872,,400,Camp Jump-Blood ,Percy Jackson and the Olympians,Domain,"The world is a cold and unforgiving place for those born to the gods. Many an inexperienced hero has become a monster’s lunch due to lack of safe haven. This won’t be something you’ll have to deal with for a while, thanks to this. Either based off of the style of Camp Jupiter or Camp Half-Blood, this summer camp that you own affords all the facilities you’d need for an aspiring adventurer to be while also affording protections with a border that repels evil forces and an illusion that wards away mortals from the boundaries. In addition, if any gods exist in future settings that  you visit, you’ll find new cabins and barracks being made for them as their children find their way to your camp, growing progressively larger in time."
873,,400,Odd Recreation,Black★Rock Shooter,Domain,"When I thought the wardrobe was weird in the Otherworld, this takes the cake however. It’s... well, it seems a part of the real world has just sort of appeared within the Otherworld, whether that’s a perfectly recreated house that your real self lives in, or a park that they frequent or even the entire school they go too it looks decidedly unchanged and eerily empty despite the miasmic and twisting nature of the Otherworld.

Indeed, this ‘piece’ inside your Territory or attached to your Warehouse is immune to any attempts to reality warp it or anyone inside it (save for your own reality warping if you have any), it could sit within the heart of one of the Chaos Gods domains and be completely and utterly unaffected by the corruption surrounding it, even if they directly tried to affect it, such changes would just slide off it, including anyone who was inside or around it would be immune to any attempts to twist or corrupt them, it's not indestructible however merely resistant to damage, though it restores itself quickly enough that only a continuous onslaught would be able to keep it down and if they don’t do it constantly, it will swiftly return to a pristine state.

Unlike other buildings/places here, post-jump, this either stays as an attachment to your warehouse or it can be placed only in dimensions and universes not bound by physical laws, acting as a spot that seems to meld the material’s laws and this new plane’s ones. Of course, if you have some way to subvert this, go right ahead."
874,,400,House of Donn,Irish Mythology,Domain,"There is a cave on a windswept rock, near where a ship of the early Milesians went down, the House of Donn, the Dark One, and one of many lords of the dead. You now possess this cave, and may visit the ghosts of anyone who died since the last time the cave emptied, which it does once a year."
875,,400,Manannan’s Chariot ,Irish Mythology,Domain,"From time to time the great sea-god Manannan Mac Lir would lend out his chariot, which could race over water as easily as land and cross the world in less than a day. Now it’s yours."
876,,400,Lia Fáil ,Irish Mythology,Domain,"One of the Four Treasures the Tuatha de Danann brought over from their four shining cities. The stone gives a mighty roar when the true king of Eireann (or its owner, the Jumper) stands upon it. In future Jumps, this is inserted into the mythology and pop culture of your starting locale, so if standing on the stone doesn’t automatically make you king, it makes you a strong contender in many eyes."
877,,400,Seven Days A Skeptic,Slay the Princess,Domain,"Despite what you may believe, constantly questioning everything I say will not help us slay the Princess. It only makes our job harder. But if that's what you want...fine. As a result of you inherently doubting everything around you, you have started to notice...’flaws’ - little cracks in the perceived consistency of reality. Sometimes small and subtle, like a disappearing object or an odd trait of someone or something you're very certain wasn't there before, other times they're large, like how someone's personality may completely change out of the blue, or how people don't tend to question the circumstances in you being somewhere and apparently knowing about everyone even if it's their first time meeting you. Or maybe even how you consistently claim that a certain Princess you are meant to be slaying keeps ‘changing forms’ despite your trusty Narrator insisting that no, she has not and you are just being either paranoid or making stuff up - or even that said Narrator is lying to you, for what reason I cannot fathom.

Either way, let's say that you have this ability and that, in the event that you ever manage to force someone into believing your utterly delirious claims, reality will be forced to ‘rectify’ the ‘flaw’ - usually by resetting events to a more desirable state that in no way shape or form will assist us in saving the world. 

(SDAS works when reality has been altered and you continuously poke and prod at the affected reality until it gives way and changes to what you understand reality to be. This works via The Long Quiet's passive ability to alter reality through perception and will work even beyond the Construct. You can attempt to use it to warp reality if you want as well, but barring getting large swathes of people to believe in what you're peddling, it will almost always amount to minor effects.)"
878,,400,Weather Witch,Final Fantasy XI,Domain,"Weather can bring salvation or doom to an army, help or harm. One of the core abilities of a scholar is the ability to alter the weather in their local area, turning a blizzard to a heatwave for a short period of time. This ability comes easier to you and now instead of causing the area around just your party to change you can instead control it with much more finesse, cause one person to experience a blizzard and another a sandstorm or bring early rains to a town in drought such is your control.

879,,400,Wall Walking,Final Fantasy XI,Domain,"Normally a skill shown only by those who have pushed their azure blood too far you have gained the ability to walk on walls, or rooves, or pretty much anywhere that gravity normally would not allow. This basically allows you to choose which way is down for you personally and act as if that way really was the floor, you could walk around on the roof as if the room were upside down if you wish then drop to the floor just by changing your mind. Note however that this does not allow you to fly, it also will not save you from broken bones if you decide to drop from high enough up to be dangerous to your health."
880,,400,A Time For Peace,Dies Irae,Domain,"To hold that one moment in stasis for eternity, to live those peaceful days over and over without interruption. It’s a dream like goal that should be unachievable to any but the luckiest of those who desire it. Yet it seems you are able to force life to stay the way you want it, so long as you don’t take actions to break this freeze. Whatever your life is like at the moment, whether it be a peaceful and friendly day-to-day school life or the never ending blood and dust of war, you are able to make your life stay in that tone and style. The former example being frozen would ensure you continue to have peaceful, worry free days of little exertion whilst the latter would ensure there is never a day you are outside of a warzone with someone acceptable to fight. If you purposefully take actions that break this tone or try to take advantage of the tone, it will break this effect and you will not be able to refreeze your life’s state until you had settled back to its original form. "
881,,400,Sonnenkind,Dies Irae,Domain,"You were a very special child, one with a very unique sort of heritage. The lineage of the Sonnenkind flows through to you, making you a sibling of either Rea Himuro or Kasumi Ayase. You developed mentally at an unnaturally fast pace, enough that you knew several languages by the time you were only three years old. You continue to learn several times faster than most of your peers but that is hardly the true benefit of your nature. Being as special as you are, even compared to your sibling and cousin, you have a unique interaction with supernatural locations and realms. When you are in a location or separate realm/dimension that you are in full ownership or possession of, you are able to make yourself a part of that location. This allows you to be aware of and constantly perceive all locations within that space and also to control all parts of that location or realm without minds of their own as if they were part of your body. You can also be allowed to do this by the actual owner of the area you are in if you are not the full controller, though they can take this control away at any time. Do note that as part of the Sonnenkind lineage, you may be dragged quite deeply into the plots that are about to occur."
882,,400,Café Chainsaw,Chainsaw Man,Domain,"Your very own Café, this modest establishment hosts a variety of locally favorite snacks and drinks and is staffed by three delightfully attractive humans of your rough design. The Café is extremely difficult to find and enter without your permission (could use a whitelist or blacklist) but those you want to meet there are drawn to it and are more likely to listen to you within its walls. The menu always contains at least one food and drink option that each customer will find refreshing and satisfying, regardless of who and what they are. There’s a backroom which you can live in with enough room for a few others and some more illicit action. Post-Jump this will become a warehouse attachment that can be magically visited by people from previous Jumps you didn’t take along with you. They won’t be able to exit its walls or help you with anything beyond what a normal human could do and you can’t gain any power from them otherwise, but talking and touching are within limits."
883,,400,Hellsent,Chainsaw Man,Domain,"For the duration of the Jump, dying in Hell sends you to Earth and dying on Earth sends you to Hell (if you’re a Devil). This functions as a one-up, so any other Chain Failure condition will revert and send you away as well. For 400cp you can keep it in future Jumps. In Jumps where Hell or Earth don’t exist, a setting-appropriate Hell and its inhabitants are generated (that can’t affect the main setting in a noticeable way without your intervention) and Earth is just the main dimension the story takes place in."
884,,400,Faded Legacy,Fate/Stay Night,Domain,"countless generations and many old heirlooms and portraits still line the walls of each room. While the house is quite obviously one of great wealth, its halls and rooms always give off a vibe of having been abandoned for a very long time, even when properly cared for. Such an old house is filled with many secret passages, escape routes and safe rooms known only to you, some of which can only be found or opened with magic. Beneath the house, to which many of these secret paths leave, are vast catacombs. Originally just the family tombs, they have long since been expanded to cover great distances in all directions from under the house, with tunnels having opens as far as ten kilometres away. Handy, for keeping things secret or making an escape."
885,,400,Misty Castle,Fate/Stay Night,Domain,"Somewhere, in a remote and isolated location, lies a small castle that seems to be constantly enshrouded in mist, along with its surroundings. This 3 story palace has dozens of rooms for almost any purpose one could desire and the most lavish and luxurious interior along with a large and well cared for garden in the centre of its layout, open to the sky. This fantastic residence comes with ten or so robotic Homunculi who are incapable of true free will but will carry out any functions expected of a cleaner, cook, guard or general servant when within the bounds of the castle and its surrounding lands. Speaking of which, the lands around this castle are also owned by you. They extend for at least a dozen kilometres in every direction around the castle but will never be anything but empty terrain such as forests or plains."
886,,400,Church on the Hill,Fate/Stay Night,Domain,"In the nearest town or city to your starting location, there is a small but well-built church under your ownership. It can be of whatever faith you desire it to be and, barring exceptional circumstances, will have at least a fair sized following of that faith inserted in the surrounding area. The church also has living quarters and a few spare rooms behind the main areas, along with a stairway leading down into the basement. This basement is very special. It holds the motionless but still living bodies of several dozen children on stone slabs, each surrounded by magical runes. Each one of these bodies is a constant supply of prana to the one connected to the rituals, namely you. The main effect is that you add the speed of replenishment they have to your own but in an emergency you can also draw more magical energy from those on the slabs, though too much can kill them. The children are just the initial victims and they can be replaced with different or even better sacrifices, though note that anyone greater then a normal human will need additional bindings to keep them on the slabs. "
887,,400,Womb of All Evils,Fate/Stay Night,Domain,"You discovered an immense cavern years ago, which you laid claim to upon realising the unnaturally powerful aura that was embedded into the very ground. Hidden underground near your starting location or on a property you own, this huge cave amplifies the power of any 'Evil' magic four times over when the caster is inside, including rituals for dark purposes or spells to summon evil beings. The enhancement is quite clear cut and intending to use evil for good will not take effect, only evil magic used for evil purposes will be enhanced. The cavern emits a terrible aura even beyond the cave itself but at that distance it only serves to ward away anyone not specifically travelling to the cavern."
888,,400,Emiya Inheritance,Fate/Stay Night,Domain,"Not exactly the same home that Emiya Shirou inherited but one very close in make and layout. This walled estate includes a traditional Japanese home with plenty of space and spare rooms, along with several attached buildings. One of these external buildings is a basic Magical Workshop with a magical circle laid into the floor but no notable tools of any sort. The home has an extensive and fully stocked kitchen that always seems to make the skills of any who cook there much greater than normal, as if some sort of spirit was guiding their actions and choices as they prepared meals. Finally, the home is surrounded in a nearly impossible to detect Boundary Field that alerts the owner of the home to any uninvited intruders. "
889,,400,Magical Manor,Fate/Stay Night,Domain,"An expected part of your inheritance, the old family home. This is a two story redbrick home with lavish inner furnishings, all in a German style. The house seems to clean and take care of itself, even if a whole room is trashed beyond repair, it will be in pristine condition by morning. As comfortable as the house it is, its real draw is actually the basement hidden beneath the home. Completely undetectable without significant supernatural powers or actually blowing open the ground, this basement holds an extensive magical workshop. Filled with common and rare magical reagents and ingredients, both of which replenish over time. Numerous magical tools for crafting, enchantment and a variety of other disciplines can also be found here, as well as a fair sized but empty room for summoning. Magic cast here is undetectable to those outside the basement, though the basement itself is not indestructible in any way. If you blow the place up, people will notice. "
890,,400,Mountain Temple,Fate/Stay Night,Domain,"You have come into the ownership of a good sized temple and the tiny mountain it resides on, which has one long, winding staircase leading to the temple with a large torii gate at the top. While there is little else but the shrine there, the shrine itself is spacious and well maintained by a few dozen monks who reside there at your leisure. These monks care for the temple and the surrounding land, as well as carry out religious services, either in the name of a religion of your choice or something they picked otherwise. Both the monks and the temple itself exude a peaceful aura that will greatly assist any sort of mental recovery or rehabilitation and the men here are worldly enough to offer sound advice on many paths of life. Not all that is special about this temple is known to those who live here however. Surrounding the mountain are incredibly powerful wards, enough to stop all but the strongest of Servants from getting in by any route other than the staircase, which itself is narrow and easily defendable. "
891,,400,Vault of the Jumper ,RWBY,Domain,"These Vaults beneath the Academies are an interesting thing. Hiding away relics of incredible power, Ozma created something pretty incredible, by means that aren’t known so far. If you want you can get a Vault of your own. This Vault will lead into an extradimensional space, which interior can be designed by your to resemble any wished landscape, whether that is a desert or a flower field doesn’t matter. It can activate to any specific power you wish for, ONLY opening and closing for someone who has the needed power. You can link it to the Warehouse but also put them somewhere on future Worlds. This also comes with a set of instructions on how to make more by Ozma himself."
892,,400,Dream Catcher Set,RWBY,Domain,"There is somewhere out there a certain Huntress named Shion Zaiden who uses this in combination with their Semblance to take care of a particular prey. Nightmares. They could use some help there and with this you can do just that. This set consists of many useful tools for dream like adventures. For starters a gigantic dreamcatcher uses purple dust in its strings and can function like a Butterfly net to catch Nightmares. In fact it has another special property that Shion would need to use their Semblance for. You can use it to send someone else into a sleeping persons dream. Their body will remain in reality but their ‘heart’ will be in the sleeping persons dream. Everyone entering a dream by you will get a set of coins to create useful effects like a telephone for communication, a marker door, a decoy, a map showing where the dreamer has been up to that point or get sent back to the real world. However they run on your Aura and when someone is out of these coins they can no longer utilize such beneficial effects. In fact you MUST have one Coin remaining to get out or you will be stuck in the persons dream forever. Injuries or death inside of the dream will also mirror the body in the real world. The size of your Aura also affects how many people you can send into a dream, defaulting at four. Furthermore you have a set of replenishable voodoo dolls which will serve as a lifeline when the lucid dreamers are in the sleeper's dreams. Lastly you have a special hourglass which can keep track of your Aura depletion or recovery and equipment which can turn a Nightmare back into a dormant state as well as catch them.

Requires Aura to Purchase"
893,,400,A Domain of One’s Own,Cult of the Lamb,Domain,"If one wishes to see heaven, one must only look around them. This is more true now for yourself than most, as you have been granted a domain to your liking, similar in scope to those governed by the Bishops. A pocket dimension accessible to yourself and those you grant entry, this space encompasses several miles worth of land that is receptive to your will, allowing you to mold it to best suit your needs. Should you desire a floral paradise or an idyllic beach, a dark and brimstone-wrought cavern or a field of fertile farmland, all you must do is will the land to the shape you wish and it will slowly shift to accommodate. In this space alone, you are unto a Bishop in your own right."
894,,400,Dark God’s Church,Cult of the Lamb,Domain,"A church much like that employed by The Lamb. Freely customizable in appearance, and able to comfortably hold up to 50 people. Spells cast here by you will be amplified significantly in effectiveness, and the church itself serves as an excellent conduit for communion with the greater powers of any setting that you may visit. Additionally, the church contains subtle mind-altering enchantments that will cause people who enter to view you and any god you might be devoted to more favorably. This enchantment compounds over time and repeat visits, but will begin to wear off should the person be away for long periods of time."
895,,400,Your Own Hotel!,Hazbin Hotel/Helluva Boss Pilot,Domain,"This could be for Redemption or Damnation, I don’t give a fuck. But either way, this massive hotel will hold all your companions and you often get visits from friends out of past jumps, who will stay for a while but not forever. It also retains any modifications you do to it, so go ahead make your dream hotel as pimped out as you want."
896,,400,The Garden of Blood: Castle of Murderers,Avesta of Black and White,Domain,"A sealed dimension, roughly of the size of a small city, complete with its own castle and flower gardens. It is a space that it’s sealed out of the current reality, similar to the base of the Lumberjacks. Similar to theirs, it will only connect to reality under specific events. For the Man- Eating demons, moments of great despair are their calling, but you may instead decide to set another condition for the lowering of the bridge. Additionally, you, and you alone, are able to return to this dimension on your own whenever you wish."
897,,400,The Manor,Bibliomania,Domain,"The manor is effectively a sub dimension which will initially have just an entrance room with an exit door and a door that leads further in. Not this is not a necessarily pleasant place as for every person that enters the manor will find themselves starting in a room further away from the entrance with each new person being further and further with no limit to the amount of people that can be let in. Now what makes this special is that it is something like a prison where anyone will find that they can’t leave as the closer they get to the exit the more severe the consequences as they get closer with it being exponentially more severe each room closer. While its possible for people to go to others rooms its more damaging, mentally, physically and spiritually the further from their room and the closer to the exit they are, unless they have permission by you to wander. You can let people exit if you want, but they only enter if you allow them. Every person's rooms will change depending on the desires to allow them to experience what they want though all these desires are slightly twisted in a way to give them what they want but punish them for crueler and crueler desires. It's subtle but it could eventually make even the Joker want to repent. If someone wants to be better then the room can guide them to be a better person as well. The manor is time dilated at a rate of 24 hours per hour so a day in there is only an hour in the real world. Nobody imprisoned here can truely die but experience horrible things especially when trying to leave as they will suffer the Rot and if they collapse, they effectively die but will be fully restored to how they were before they died, Rot free back in their room. The Manor has a loyal guardian that looks like Serpent but loyal to you and keeps track over the people stored. This Manor also has the effect of making store beings easy pray to yourself effectively reducing their effectiveness and defending themselves against you 90% less effective than it would be. To put people in the manor you have to get close to them and hold onto them for 5 seconds while willing them to be put in the manor and after 5 seconds a book will appear and suck them in, though it can only suck in beings that are willing or less that 10 times stronger than you over all."
898,,400,A Door        ,Bibliomania,Domain,"This is a special item being that it will look almost identical to the door you will see in Serpents book, however this has nothing to do directly with Serpent or the Rooms. This door can be called on at any time and as long as it's closed you can connect to any location you know of allowing you to open the door and walk through as long as it's within the same universe. That alone wouldn't be worth 400 CP for this jump and instead this door has a very special effect being that you can summon it in any situation even powerful illusory worlds and as such since the illusions are false worlds, the door will instantly shatter all but divine illusions of immense might and even then they would be weakened to the point that if you were mildly competent you could be the final push to break them. Hell the door passively protects you from such illusions so even without summoning it weak illusions simply don’t stick to you and strong ones can auto summon the door if you aren’t aware."
899,,400,Library of Ancients,Bibliomania,Domain,"This is a massive multi story library contained in a sub dimension connected to your Warehouse, though you can open a door to this sub dimension anywhere if you want to bring others in without bringing them into your warehouse. This library will contain multiple copies of every non-sentient or divine book to ever exist, all organized and stored within these walls. It is maintained by librarian automatons and has multiple desks, chairs, computers and side rooms to study any of the books contained. It will update any time a new book is made and will have both physical copies and digital available. While everything is organized by world, subject and then alphabetical you can ask any of the librarians to bring you copies of any books you would like to study and they will retrieve them if they are available which will only take 5 seconds of them being out of direct sight. This library has high quality aesthetics and is designed similar to a fantasy world's aristocratic manor. The library also has a few effects, first time in the library is dilated at a rate of 10 hours in the library is 1 hour outside of it. Second the library reduces needs of those that are within the library at the same rate of time dilation. 3rd the library has an effect of boosting motivation to study those within so that someone who wouldn’t like to even look at a book would almost gladly study a hard subject they don’t like, it even makes the act of studying slightly enjoyable, like reading a good book. Studying is also 3 times more effective within the library."
900,,400,Juju High,Jujutsu Kaisen,Domain,"You’re now the owner and headmaster of Japan’s third high school dedicated to educating the next generation of jujutsu sorcerers. To call it a school at all might be stretching the definition of the word, though: given the paucity of sorcerers, you’d be lucky to have ten students total across all three years. Despite this, such a position is still a rather prestigious one within jujutsu society, as it tends to also serve as a headquarters for any graduates, and the facilities are nothing to scoff at.

The ‘school’ is surprisingly vast in scope, its campus almost a small village for the number of buildings it contains. With classrooms, dormitories, sports grounds, medical facilities, warehouses for storing cursed tools, and more, it’s stocked with everything a budding jujutsu sorcerer could need, and that’s before taking into account the vast wilderness surrounding it that also falls under the school’s land. It’s located near enough to a major city for it to be easily accessible, yet far enough away that it’s incredibly hard to stumble upon by accident, and that’s before taking into account the invisible barrier surrounding it that protects it from detection.

To start with, you’ll have a good ten or so students here, with a broad scope in their abilities: some would barely even be grade 3, while one or two would already be talented enough to have reached grade 1, or be close to doing so. The faculty are a similar mix – most of them are just assistant supervisors, with little ability in jujutsu beyond deploying barriers, but there are a couple of experienced sorcerers who mentor the pupils here. While there aren’t any anomalies on the level of Yuta Okkotsu or Satoru Gojo here yet, perhaps the education you provide could produce one in time. 

This school may instead focus on other supernatural power systems in future worlds."
901,,400,Fight Club,Jujutsu Kaisen,Domain,"You happen to be the owner of an abandoned parking lot, located on the outskirts of a major city. While the outside is rather unassuming, enough that most would pass by it without giving it a second glance, it’s what’s on the inside that’s of actual interest: an fight club, where the participants include not only regular humans, but sorcerers as well. Given that non-sorcerers gather to watch such fights, this flies in the face of jujutsu society’s rules... but also happens to be incredibly profitable. You could get quite rich off of this place, something made easier by the fact that the authorities, both mundane and supernatural, seem quite content to ignore it.

You’re free to set the rules of this place, and all who visit or fight here will obey unless they’re already antagonistic to you for whatever reason. A small amount of staff exist to run the club on your behalf, handling everything from security to management, though they probably won’t be much help when fighting back against any serious threat. Your venue attracts supernatural combatants at a rather frequent rate, be they sorcerers in this world or something else in another, and while they won’t be the world’s most powerful, they could still have their uses, and probably won’t be too hard to recruit to your causes."
902,,400,Fleshcraft Workshop,Jujutsu Kaisen,Domain,"A place that may be considered rather distasteful to some, this nondescript building, unlikely to attract anyone’s attention, contains a workshop dedicated to crafting cursed tools. It has all the tools and equipment one might expect to find in a craftsman’s workshop, capable of working anything from metal to wood to bone to create items of any sort, along with a good supply of the materials needed.

But the real draw can be found in the basement freezer: the corpses of sorcerers with various cursed techniques, all with their brains fully preserved. Given that the one known creator of cursed tools made frequent use of such materials, it’s likely these will prove highly useful to your craft, as well as for any research pursuits you might have. Interestingly enough, there are also several bodies of cursed spirits lying around too, including one of special grade levels of power. Considering that cursed spirits generally turn to dust when killed, this is a very valuable find indeed. Any used materials will restock at the end of each Jump."
903,,400,Chocobo Ranch ,Final Fantasy VII,Domain,"A Chocobo is a large yellow bird mostly incapable of flight that can comfortably let an adult human ride on their back, having once been a reliable beast of burden that was used for transportation before being outpaced by technology. Despite this, Chocobo still have a place in both affordable journeying across dangerous or treacherous terrain, as well as the famous races that take place in the Gold Saucer. This is a ranch that has about a dozen Chocobo in them, all of which are fully tamed and obedient as well as having a landspeed matching the average speed of a car. 

However, this isn't the end of it. Chocobo have an...interesting genetic lineage in that especially fit or capable Chocobos have a fair chance of their children being born with a different-colored plumage. This also marks the Chocobo as able to cross a new environment on its lonesome. A Blue Chocobo can cross rivers and lakes, a Green Chocobo can climb mountains as easily as flat ground, a Black Chocobo can cross both, and the especially rare Gold Chocobo can move just about anywhere on foot. You can potentially breed these Chocobo into existence through some trial and error, matching up Chocobo with each other to see what result is gained, and you receive everything needed to both care for the avians and everything needed for the breeding process. 

In future worlds, it may be possible to create new breeds of Chocobo able to cross exotic new environments safely, or perhaps even fly. Any Chocobos lost, stolen, or slain are replaced by identical ones the following week. This includes any new ones that are bred."
904,,400,Font of Rejuvenation,Legends of Runeterra,Domain,"This rock, practically a small island, floats in the air, releasing from inside several waterfalls. It grasped a fragment of a Celestial descending on the surface of Runeterra and now contains part of their healing power. The effect of the water is not actually that powerful, requiring prolonged exposure to heal more grievous injuries. However, the advantage is that there is no actual limit on how many people it can heal at a time. The waterfalls spew rejuvenating water in a steady and continuous manner, so if you managed to contain them somehow, you could heal an entire army."
905,,400,Chamber of Renewal ,Legends of Runeterra,Domain,"This is something that has been kept hidden since the fall of Shurima. In this chamber you’ll find several sarcophagi ready to be used. Each one can host one creature, even of great size, and in a matter of a couple hours, completely heal any wound on their bodies, no matter how lethal. However, this is just the least of the Chamber’s power, for prolonged stay inside the chamber will, eventually, remove any kind of madness, corruption and other mental affliction that the patient could possess. In the remote possibility that the Chamber cannot heal the person inside the sarcophagus, the magic will put them in a suspended state that, while not healing the condition they suffer, it will be enough to give you time to find another solution."
906,,400,Research Facility,Legends of Runeterra,Domain,"Technology is amazing, but someone has to think it, then test it, and only then it can be implemented. You now possess a dedicated research facility ready to grant a space for thinkering, testing, materials for both of those activities, and excellent security. At your choice, this place can be filled with researchers from Piltover (or Zaun, depending what kind of expertise you need) or you can use your own followers to help in the research. Local researchers become followers at the end of the Jump."
907,,400,Blood Chambers,Legends of Runeterra,Domain,"Blood magic has seen a resurgence in Runeterra of late. Before, it was only an art known by the ancient Darkin and only one living practitioner of this brand of magic existed... who was not trapped in a weapon, of course. But not Noxus is showing interest in the practice, and these blood chambers are meant to help in the use of the magic and to focus its power. Nothing that will really help you outside the chambers, they don’t make you more powerful, but it will greatly increase the rate you improve your mastery over it, on top of a generous amount of blood ready available. Considering that Vladimir managed to become immortal..."
908,,400,Gate Network,Legends of Runeterra,Domain,"This is a copy of the same gate network that lets the yordle appear in basically any corner of Runeterra. How is this so cheap? Well... you have to learn how to use it on your own. It will be easier if you have some knowledge of gate magic, but even then, you’ll need to manually connect each portal to the point you want to reach. Still, it’s pretty handy for traveling large distances in no time."
909,,400,Planet Artoria,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Domain,"You’ve struck gold now! While prospecting out in the deep regions of space, you found a miracle reserve, a gas giant planet with a massive core of pure Artorium. There’s surprisingly solid ground down there, for a gas giant, so you managed to slam down a few handy space elevators and get the mining operation going. There’s enough Artorium here to power a civilisation for centuries and make you an extremely wealthy Servant if you don’t wanna hoard it all to yourself. That’s not even getting into how much magical energy can probably be extracted from the shining gold orb at the core of the planet."
910,,400,Reality’s Edge,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Domain,"A particularly grand performance of magecraft, which you seem to be one of the lucky few to have manifested. You are able to externalise your inner world in the form of a Reality Marble, a powerful magical construct that overwrites the laws of the world for a time with something that represents your inner self. These can range from the simple, draining away all mana or ether in the atmosphere, to the complex, a detailed system of understanding and recreating anything that fits the concept of ‘sword’. Your Reality Marble could be compared in power to Demi Fett, the dark bounty hunter who can reproduce magical swords at will, among many other things. They take a bit of energy to use but there’s little real ‘pressure’ these days to stop you keeping them up for days on end. 

And much like Demi Fett, your Reality Marble is able to be channeled through the concept of ‘gun’. Whatever ability you have chosen, you are able to transmit it or use it in concert with firearms of any kind. A sword maker could project swords from within anything he shoots, a mana drainer might suck away the energy of anyone they shoot. Someone who summoned an army of heroes might find them all outfitted with military firearms and a man made of demonic beasts could instead be made of the animated guns of hell itself. "
911,,400,Auction House,Final Fantasy VI,Domain,"What better place to fence stolen goods than an auction house? Oh, excuse me, recovered artifacts. This auction house prefers to situate itself in the wealthier parts of an already wealthy town. It might be a little inconvenient for you to get to at times, but it feels that the scarcity of its presence will only make you appreciate it more. The auctioneer will never reveal just where he gets all the rare artifacts and odd trinkets that appear on his auction block. However, he will be more than happy to slip anything you give him into the docket and let you keep the proceeds. Minus a small cut for the house. You’ll discover the auction house following you between worlds after your time here, although it doesn’t deign to be added to any of your current properties or Warehouse. Easy access will ruin the mystique it’s been carefully cultivating."
912,,400,Colosseum,Final Fantasy VI,Domain,"This grand battle arena would not look out of place sitting in the middle of Rome itself. Marble coats almost every surface and the stadium is large enough to easily hold ten thousand. The basement floors contain cages of all shapes and descriptions that hold shadowy creatures that growl, snarl, and lunge at anyone stupid enough to get nearby. These indistinct monsters are shades capable of assuming a wide variety of forms based on the desires of the Arena Master who oversees this place. While not under your direct control, the Arena Master will honor you like a VIP guest and always allow you to interrupt any scheduled bout should you choose to compete yourself. Like any other who wishes to dare the Colosseum, you will be required to offer up an item as your side of the wager. In return, the Arena Master will create a suitable challenge and reward based on what you offer up. Hand in a trifle and the Colosseum will offer a similar trifle along with a laughable battle. Hold out a rare artifact instead and you will find something equally powerful hidden behind a truly powerful foe. Please note, the Colosseum is able to offer items and produce monsters from other worlds based on your wager, but exactly what you will receive isn’t set in stone. Wagering the same item repeatedly will result in random, if similar in scale, items. Just beware. Offer an item so powerful that the Arena Master could not possibly cover the bet and you will discover a truly impossible foe, even for one such as you, facing you down. Losing in the Colosseum will never result in your death. Only the loss of the item you bet."
913,,400,The Realm Between Realms,God Of War (2018),Domain,"All Dwarves have the ability to step into the “Realm between Realms'', a space where you appear invisible to any that would see you. Even gods like Baldur and Thor cannot see you like this, though Dragons can see you in this state and if you attack someoneyou will exit this state. You have the odd ability to teleport yourself to certain designated locations that you have set beforehand with the only limit appearing to be that they are in the same realm as you. Though should you be near a portal to another realm this is less of an issue, being able to appear at the other side of the portal should not be anything stopping you. On top of that you can quite literally step between realms. Allowing you to travel from Midgard to Alfheim with a single step without the use of the Bifrost, with the only downside being that you can’t step into Realms that are “locked” from you such as Asgard or Jotunheim. This cannot be used to return to previous jumps until you have reached the end of your Chain."
914,,400,A Slice Of Hell ,Thailand Mythology and Folklore,Domain,"An unfortunate fact of the world is that most people end up going to one of the Hells of this world after they die, of course only after they stop lingering in the mortal world in quite a few cases. They reincarnate there as some kind of wretched creature appropriate to their sins in their mortal life, and suffer in there for quite a while before their sinful karma is finally fully purified and they reincarnate in the mortal world again. There are some demons that manage the Hells and the sinners there, but they’re really there just to record and catalog anything, and make sure that none of the sinners that are on the more powerful end of things escape to the mortal world to cause havoc and suffering. From within the Hells, the sentences of sinners can vary from several hundred years to tens of thousands, with larger sentences occurring in deeper Hells. However, all of the Hells have progressively slower time flow than the mortal world, with even the most superficial one only passing one day every 9 million years in the mortal world, seemingly massively inflating the sentences of sinners.

Now, you’ve somehow come to own a chunk of Hell. It’s about 700 km wide, but it’s mostly a fiery wasteland filled with horrible creatures. You do get a delegation of demons to keep things mostly in order and to prevent anything particularly abominable to getting out, though. Additionally, by default it’s assumed you get a chunk of Sanjiva, the least Hell, where 9 million years pass in the mortal world for every day within the Hell. However, you can freely choose to get a part of some of the other hells, for larger time differences. As a short list, the options would be that for one day in the Hell, 36 million years, 145 million years, 576 million years, 2,304 million years, or 9,236 million years pass in the mortal world. As a bonus, in future jumps you’ll be able to ‘turn off’ this time difference, so to speak, should you not want to deal with it.

In this world, you’ll have to answer to the kings of the Hells for how to manage this, but in future worlds you’re free to do with it as you please. You’ll be able to simply insert the Hell into the world in general, letting those who sin drop here after death, or simply leave the Hell isolated and throw particularly unpleasant people you meet into reincarnating as one of the wretched creatures here. Perhaps you’d even use the horrible creatures in it as a sort of unholy army. You could attempt to terraform it, but any changes will be lost after a few days. It’s nothing like the mortal world, it’s a Hell for a reason, you know."
915,,400,Valkyrie's Academy,DxD Universe,Domain,"The academy that trains young girls into incredible war weapons in now yours, the staff and students will be loyal to you but are fairly weak, being better teachers than fighter's and the students tend to be around high-class, though sometimes some of them can reach ultimate class."
916,,400,Tower of Naraka,Asura’s Wrath,Domain,"After suffering a fatal blow, your soul will appear in the white void between life and reincarnation. This is Naraka, realm of infinite towers. To leave it, you must ascend the tower, and no amount of flight or power allows you to cheat the distance­ the journey back to the living world is as long as it needs to be to attain the necessary enlightenment.

It will take you anywhere from 12,000 years to 1 year to climb back out to your lifeless body (which has regenerated and been rendered indestructible in the meantime). Mortals might build a shrine around your fossilized form­ Mantra directed to you helps you ascend faster.

If you're still in Naraka and not in your body when the current jump concludes, the Jumpchain ends. Falling off the tower, failing to ascend by jump­end, you reaching fail condition, or ten years passing also ends the chain.

Alternatively, instead of outright killing an opponent, you may send their soul to Naraka and require them to climb out."
917,,400,Stride the Impure World,Asura’s Wrath,Domain,"With an hour’s concentration, you may convert a ten­meter wide plot of the world into a sanctified land, or terrain of righteous desolation.

Impure land looks hostile, leaking red miasma and showing thin veins of hot magma. From this incensed territory, you may summon a number of Gohma with a combined impurity level of 10,000 or less.

Pure land meanwhile looks pristine and idyllic, free of contaminants and sacrilege. If you have two or more pure regions on the same planet, you may teleport between them with thirty seconds of concentration. You may only have three such pure spaces at a time.

In both cases, these regions last for 3­-7 days.

Impurity Level: 10,000"
918,,400,"Haunted Manor, Priceless Land",Witch on the Holy Night,Domain,"Leylines, the veins of the planet, are highly coveted by mages due to being immense sources of magical energy. You happen to not only have a firm claim on one such area, but own an elegant European-style mansion straight out of a fairy tale in it. It’s more than simply luxurious and classy in ways that would make aristocrats green with envy, it’s also so loaded with magical assets and defences it would be suicide for most mages to pursue you into it. Not to mention the massive library full of information about magecraft of your choice, including both theory and spells. While traps on the level of floating mists that can banish people into mirror worlds abound for those unauthorised by you to visit, the forest outside’s good health can enhance your ritual magic too. Furthermore, as long as you’re inside the manor, your body will be healed as if receiving the minimal medical treatment needed to keep a young human alive and comfortable."
919,,400,Branch of the Holy Church ,Witch on the Holy Night,Domain,"Somewhere in town is another parish, every bit the equal of the one mediating magus conflicts but with much less traffic. To most outsiders it seems just like any church, perhaps with an ineffable extra bit of tranquillity. Magically sensitive individuals may notice that service is empowered by magecr-sorry, Sacraments and that the priests have a very particular set of skills. Skills that make them a shining beacon of light against the darkness of the occult. Most have relatively modest and utilitarian abilities that let them do things like sense malign intent and grant medical treatment thought impossible by the modern era, but at least one is a one-man army capable of laying low the greatest magi alive. Oh, and somehow you’re the rightful owner of the church, and they’re paying you rent. Your tenants are fond of you, and don’t mind doing a side gig or two."
920,,400,"Evil Academy, But Not Evil ",HighSchool DxD,Domain,"You are now the registered owner and possibly headmaster of a high school or similar learning institution of your choosing. You can freely designate what it teaches, what the gender ratio or enrollment criteria of students are, or if it’s private or public. It can even teach skills or abilities you are capable of passing down or be completely ordinary if you prefer that. It will usually run itself in your absence, as the teaching staff is both competent and not terribly demanding. Each jump you make in the future comes with a new teaching staff and semester of students, but the former will retain whatever teaching abilities the last bunch had or needed."
921,,400,Abyss Illusion,HighSchool DxD,Domain,"This fancy room was built to be a lot ‘laxer’ when it comes to rules, even of what can and what can’t usually happen. The original intention was to let Angels and such beings have intercourse without the fear of becoming Fallen, even allowing them to mingle with Devils. Don’t worry, all the issues involved with those fun times and the needed materials will be automatically solved. Except the awkwardness when you have to explain how exactly a perfect propensity between Devil and Angel came to be, or how a Dragon managed to knock up an inanimate object."
922,,400,Bloody Friday,HighSchool DxD,Domain,"Do you want to feel rich? Need some imposing residence that inspires awe and jealousy? A place so extravagant that represents ‘decadence’ itself? Well, say no more, because I have exactly what you wanted. Big enough to make a dragon uncomfortable, lavishly decorated to make the richest of devils green with envy, and so on. However, the biggest perk of this castle is its ability to pop out wherever you need it without anyone questioning its existence, and the staff that maintains it. Said staff is composed entirely of Maids. Very loyal, very hot, very thirsty maids, who are all completely innocent in the ways of romance. Their race and attitudes are up to you, as well as the general architectural style of the mansion. contract with in order to get one of your own."
923,,400,A Familiar Truth,HighSchool DxD,Domain,"Familiars are important to everyone here that isn’t a fucking noob. Magicians have them, Devils have them, and so and so. I have no idea if you will be able to get a decent familiar, however, as they are very tied to the talents and disposition of the master. Despite all your power and versatility, you might only get an owl or something, or perhaps one of your useless companions could get a dragon. To at the very least ensure that you aren’t lacking in options, I’ll give you this immense forest. It’s inhabited by all kinds of magical creatures that you might be able to make a contract with in order to get one of your own. "
924,,400,Mountain Retreat,HighSchool DxD,Domain,"Here’s a nearby mountainside resort, Jumper. Feel free to stay and relax here for a few days, or the rest of your life, even! This is a comfortable retreat out in the wilderness with a fully stocked hotel and several outdoor camping spots. It even comes with an onsen. Funny enough, when you train or exercise here, you’ll find your gains from such will increase to at least twice their normal rate - three times if you really push yourself. And it has an onsen. Because of course it does. It can comfortably keep all your companions fed and relaxed, and inactive ones can hang out here. Post-jump, this can turn into a Warehouse attachment or be dropped somewhere safe in a world you’re in."
925,,400,The Hallows ,The Voynich Hotel,Domain,"A second hotel has been added to Blefuscu, much to the surprise of the locals who doubted their small island had enough tourists for another to spring up. It is fated to be slightly less popular than the Voynich Hotel due to its macabre sense of style and a subtle air of creepiness. Both pervade the one hundred and thirty rooms spread across five floors. And the less said about the state of the basement the better. For all that, it will generate a small but steady income if the ghastly servants are left to their own devices. Ghastly being the key word here. For The Hallows hides a secret that few would suspect. It attracts the spirits of the dead and allows them to interact with the living once again. Most of them are quite willing to work at the hotel simply to enjoy being able to feel alive again. You might get a few troublemakers wandering in every now and then, but you doubtless have ways of dealing with them. As well as more interesting ways to make use of a steady stream of spectral entities."
926,,400,Crossroads ,The Voynich Hotel,Domain,"The place where paths meet have always held great intrigue and importance to myths of all cultures. They are places where one can bargain with devils, meet one’s destiny by sheer chance, and sometimes meet the truest friends one will ever know. Of course, the trick is finding a crossroads that is more than a simple meeting of paths and learning to tell the difference. Not all crossroads are truly mystical. But this one is. In each world from now forever onwards you will find this waypoint, sometimes more than once but never when you are trying to find it. It is a place of meetings where the boundary between native realms grows thin. You will meet strange entities that offer you services and deals that can be innocently straightforward or deviously convoluted in their terms. But you will always find what they offer intriguing and useful. If you can pay the price they are asking. Don’t worry, they won’t ask for anything as serious as your soul. Not usually."
927,,400,Ferry of Charon ,God of War,Domain,"A masterfully crafted vessel, fitting for the one who ferries the dead to their final resting place. Made in the image of a greek trireme, it requires no crew to take you to whatever destination you desire, even the various afterlives you may encounter on your journeys with little difficulty. Strangely, its speed will scale with yours, ensuring that it will always be faster than you, though you can enjoy a leisurely pace if that is your desire. Death will always come, no matter how far one runs from it."
928,,400,Boots of Hermes ,God of War,Domain,"Hermes is well known for his speed, as befits the messenger of the gods, and these boots only reinforce that reputation. While wearing these greaves adorned with golden wings, you will see a massive increase in your speed, allowing a regular mortal to outpace even the swiftest of arrows, to say nothing if they were worn by a god. Additionally, it will allow you to run up walls and ceilings without fear of falling off, regardless of what kind of surface they are."
929,,400,Door Lord,Adventure Time,Domain,By throwing a key you may create a portal (that appears as a normal door) through which you (and others) can travel to any location in the same dimension. Comes with a hat with a little door on it.
930,,400,Far Traveller,Final Fantasy III,Domain,"You have been taught by Doga and Unei the methods to travel to other worlds. You have increased luck in finding portals to other dimensions, are capable of performing complex rituals to send yourself to other worlds, and can enter the world of dreams when you sleep in order to communicate with others."
931,,400,Labyrinth seed ,Xena - Hercules,Domain,"Once each jump, a dull gray stone the size of a watermelon is available for your use. Plant it somewhere, and as it sinks into the ground it will form a twisting, 3-dimensional maze of fiendish complexity and indeterminate dimensions. It will confuse common magical and technological attempts to map or navigate it, and only specialized equipment, unique magics, or creatures comfortable with non-euclidean space will be able to traverse it. Even then, the structure of the labyrinth will change slowly over time, responding to attempts to decipher it, though this will happen much faster if more destructive methods are employed.

Why build such a place? Perhaps you wish to house a monster, some cheese, or whatever. Simply chain the item of interest to the seed when you plant it and the labyrinth will adapt itself to become a prison capable of restraining even a mighty mythological beast for a long, long time. The seed can just as easily form a vault, to keep something safe until the designated hero/chosen one/protagonist comes along."
932,,400,Personal Underworld         ,Hades,Domain,"It is hard to resist the allure of a place so resistant to escape and incursion as the Underworld. Daedalus truly crafted his most cunning creation when he designed and built the dungeon encompassing the five realms of Hades. While the House Contractor is no Daedalus, he has been performing his duties long enough that it is safe to say he is no slack hand at the reins. For this princely investment, he will design an imitation of the five realms of the Underworld specifically for your enjoyment. You can do what you wish with it. House souls of the dead (though harvesting and transporting them is up to you to arrange), live in its every shifting chambers, or simply run around in it destroying things. Whatever takes your fancy. However, you are not buying a completely unoccupied labyrinth. Your coinage also includes a vast array of the most violent spirits from the Underworld to act as your guardians to keep intruders out and prisoners in. don’t worry about running out of guards just because you decided to roam around the halls practicing. Those destroyed by your hand will always recuperate in short order. And for those looking to make a little profit along the way, the House Contractor has assured there will always be something shiny waiting for those who test the defenses."
933,,400,Castle Pandaemonium,Final Fantasy II,Domain,"The capital of Hell, risen from the depths is yours to command. Virtually unassailable, the halls are stalked by dozens of evil creatures that are under your command. It has little offensive ability, but it is nearly impossible for one to not only enter, but to make it to you."
934,,400,Dreadnought,Final Fantasy II,Domain,"An enormous Airship with several levels, the Dreadnought is a mechanical marvel to behold. Heavily armored and has enough firepower to reduce several towns to rubble before its engine overheats. Has enough room for you and up to a hundred others."
935,,400,Vimana,Fate/Strange Fake,Domain,"The flying fortress of the Indian gods, and also the flying throne of the ancient King of Uruk. Taking the shape of a large golden platform with an alien and futuristic look, this Noble Phantasm can be called at will by its true user, which is now you. Controlled merely by your thoughts as long as you are seated on it, it surpasses in mobility and speed most modern vehicles, all while providing a comfortable and safe experience to its user regardless of the speed or maneuvers attempted with it. In terms of weaponry, it could easily decimate buildings on its own, albeit resupplying its weaponry will require a great level of magical energy."
936,,400,Meat Factory,Fate/Strange Fake,Domain,"Why focus on a simple Workshop, when you could have a collection of many of them? Concealed in an industrial complex, a large collection of multiple workshops have been connected to build a truly monstrous complex. And you, as the true master of the greater workshop, have complete control over all of its defense mechanisms, as well as the contents of the multiple legacies researching in it.

If you ever choose so, you may activate its most terrifying feature: the complex will start to turn into an Otherworld, designed not to prevent others from entering, but to digest anyone that tries to escape, except for you, its true master. Even a powerful Heroic Spirit would have some trouble while fighting in it, and that’s only if you are consciously trying to aid them to prevent them from being sucked in by this Workshop. But it is still entirely possible that they can demolish it before this alone gets to make significant damage to them. However, for most human magi it is a death sentence.

Finally, there is a special artifact located in this factory. Stolen from another family of magi, it is an apparatus that allows to transform humans, or their fresh corpses into magic crystals that contain that person’s worth of magical energy. A regular human won’t give much, but it seems that someone has dedicated a lot of time on this process, for a large pile of magic crystals already exists in one of the rooms of this factory. Enough to sustain a Great Hero Servant going all out for the duration of the entire war, if you have a way to channel all of them."
937,,400,Airship,Final Fantasy I,Domain,"How are Monks associated with Airships? Don’t think too much about it. Said to have been built by a legendary Lufenian that went by the name of Cid, this is an airship that is able to sail across the world within minutes while also being able to house a few dozen people comfortably. The ship is remarkably easy to fly and land, so much so that a pack of adventurers untrained in its use could do so easily. It can only land effectively on flat terrain without risking the ship itself, however, and lacks any weapons on board. The good news is most monsters in this world can’t fly high enough to reach it, but keep this in mind in later worlds."
938,,400,Cave of Wonder,Disney’s Aladdin,Domain,"Your very own Tiger-headed cave of wonders! It has great and powerful treasures, magical and mundane. While this one doesn’t have anything as unique and all-powerful as a Djinni Lamp, it still has untold wealth, into the hundreds of thousands of gold coins, jewels and precious stones, precious fabrics and tapestries, all in all enough wealth to outmatch most national treasuries.

In future jumps it fills up with similar treasures, magical and supernatural items of relatively equal value from thelocal setting. There will never be anything that's absolutely unique or as powerful as a Hand of Midas or a Lamp, but expect it to have some of the most powerful weapons and most priceless items that can be had even somewhat commonly. And of course,an obscene fortune in more mundane wealth."
939,,400,An Unsinkable Ship ,The Little Mermaid,Domain,"A grand sailing ship fit for a king, equipped with armaments typical for the time period. It will retain upgrades if you care to make them. Guaranteed to not sink even if Poseidon himself was pulling it downwards! Comes fully staffed with loyal sailors and all the supplies you need for a year-long voyage. And to restock you just need to pull into a port somewhere and your crew will take care of it. The sailors do not count as companions and, while not completely bound to the ship, aren't inclined to leave it for anything other than a trip to the tavern."
940,,400,Arcane Academy ,Elden Ring - Liurnia of the Lakes,Domain,"It appears as though Raya Lucaria is not the only institution in which one can learn the usage of magic. This massive structure is more akin to a small mountain, and filled with everything to help you when it comes to teaching others. Large classrooms, a vast library, and many side rooms to sequester away in for study and experimentation. Those who learn within these halls will find that the lessons stick more, even the more mundane lessons they would undoubtedly be forced to endure."
941,,400,NFF Services        ,Fate/Legends - Baba Yaga,Domain,"Nine Fox Foundation has become an infamous name on the market, reeking in profits and fulfilling its missions par excellence. While you are not taking over the already present equivalent, you can now have a Company that more than rivals NFF in size and profit. Within your reach is your own private military company and weapons manufacturer. Though that by itself does not need to be the full extend of its reach, a casino resort already having become an additional subsidiary and who knows where else they could expand if you are willing to guide it. But even without your overview this company will bring in some nice profits. But of course that isn’t the end of it and I do not even refer to the elite squad of mercenaries under your employment.

The armory you now have access to is vast, from guns and rifles for any environment, to various kinds of explosives, all controllable and further enhanceable with your own magical energy. Even means of transportation like a chopper and motorcycle can be found here.

But the greatest creation of NFF is without a doubt the NF-79 Tactical Suppresion Vehicle, the best weapon ever made by Tamamo Heavy Industries. The tank like vehicle sports vast amounts of armor and ammunition, bringing down massive barrages of missiles at your command. You can summon it to your location with something as simple as throwing a smoke grenade. But the weapon has one other purpose. It can serve as a shrine, be it to yourself or another cult, applicable for anything that requires such."
942,,400,Holy Ground,Fate/Legends - Baba Yaga,Domain,"A shepherd is nothing without his sheep but where should his flock go? Where else but here in this religious congregation of your very own. Large and beautiful, this church is by default at the heart of a large enough village or town and almost automatically lures in various passerbys curious to see what is going on inside. Just to begin with it already comes with several hundred faithful believers hanging to your every word and praying dutifully. Your own conversational skills and charisma are enhanced notably inside of these grounds. Not only that but it seems these halls truly are blessed, divine techniques having a noticeable boost inside of this territory. Its basement even works well to hide any that need sanctuary and have a good supply of Prana. Unlike a certain Japanese Priest these Prana reserves are entirely unrelated to orphans."
943,,400,Sumerki Kremlin,Fate/Legends - Baba Yaga,Domain,"Fortresses of all types are scattered all around Russia. Meant to be a place of safety and comfort for those with the blood of the Tsars. One of these great Fortresses is now your own. Extremely strong, it can endure the greatest of blizzards with ease, house all your allies and companions in luxury and can prevail even against bombardments. However while it is a place of leisure for your allies, your enemies will not be received as warmly, anyone you won’t allow entry being attacked by the Fortress itself. Optionally you can manifest this Fortress like a Reality Marble, summoning it to your location but as a result needing to supply it with magical energy to not have it fade away again."
944,,400,The City-Seed ,Godbound,Domain,"Forged by a peaceful Made God as shelter for its nomadic people, this simple seed has been purged of the mental corruption that once tainted it. When the city-seed is planted in a location, buildings and infrastructure of the user's choosing gradually grow up around it, forming out of the bedrock of the surrounding area. One day's growth provides housing, commercial space, defensive walls, sewer, water, and paved roads for up to five hundred residents, conjuring up deep springs of fresh water where needed.

The seed can create military fortifications if desired, and the character and particulars of the architecture is at the user's discretion. For every day the seed remains planted in an area, facilities form for an additional five hundred residents-and what forms is easily moulded to suit the builders’ purposes. Furthermore as its rightful owner, you can perceive clearly any specific location built by the seed and speak as to be heard there-or indeed, anywhere in the city if you wish. The wonders of a lost civilisation are yours to release back into the world, and in each world you will be provided with a new seed."
945,,400,The Seal of Ten Thousand Suns ,Godbound,Domain,"The origins of this heavy black ring are lost to history, but the glimmer of lights within the band mark it out as an obviously magical artifact. The user may use the artifact to instantly create a Night Road opening where they stand, even in the heart of a populous human community. The road leads to a realm or Heavenly shard known to them or studied in the appropriate ancient records, and can even be used as a way to walk the multiverse of any setting with such a thing. The road does not manifest with any seal in place, and the destination may well be invaded by unfriendly entities if such beings are present in the cosmology. The Seal can create, unlock, and seal Night Road breaches, but it cannot completely destroy them. Be wary of the implications this has for future worlds. The Night Road offers access to many normally inaccessible planes of existence, being a kind of shortcut through the gulf of nonexistence, but if not managed well you may unleash new Uncreated in the image of the worlds you visit’s life."
946,,400,Jumpergard Castle,Wizarding World,Domain,"The Dark Wizard Gellert Grindelwald once built a magnificent and grand castle by the name of Nurmengard. And said castle served as both his home, his base of operations, and a prison for those he declared his foes. It was a dark and grim place, a prison of pain and anguish much like Azkaban itself. And so, by taking cues from Nurmengard and Azkaban both, you have built and devised your very own prison of torment and suffering.

But beyond serving as a prison, your castle is a place of darkness, its very aura a dark and dreary thing. Such darkness has made it the ideal breeding ground for the likes of dark beings everywhere. More importantly, it is the perfect home for dementors. Even now, with its empty cells, dementors sprout out like fungi, a new one coming into existence every two weeks or so. With the more poor souls imprisoned within, that rate of birth shall only grow ever higher. In time, a horde of dementors shall be at your command for all your dark desires."
947,,400,Jumper’s Hollow,Wizarding World,Domain,"Exploring the worlds means leaving behind the comforts of home and all the luxuries and amenities that go along with it. If one plans on being an explorer, that means quite a bit of preparation, enough that the time spent preparing might seem just as daunting as the exploration itself. At least, that’s how the process goes for Muggles. The magical folk have a few tricks up their sleeves. 

Whether it be a tent, a bag, a suitcase, or even something as small as a purse, you now have something that’s been heavily enchanted with a powerful and massive Undetectable Extension Charm. In fact, the charm is so extensive that the space within is enough to encompass quite a few square kilometers worth of land.

For any wildlife enthusiasts, this place will be the perfect home to keep them safe. After all, it isn’t just the Extension Charm that’s been cast onto this place. To make it a better home for the many beasts that you might bring inside, the place has been made... mutable. In simpler terms, it means that you can make this place look like any other natural locale you might find in the world.

Already, there is a small yet homely cottage set up for you that serves as your entrance to this lively vivarium of yours. Beyond this home, you can set up the rest of this place so that it has the looks and features you desire. From hillside plains to a polar tundra, this place can have it all. If you want to change it up, all you need to do is wave your wand and think of what you want it to be. If you want a jungle right next to a desert, go for it! It’s your home after all.

Finally, you’ll notice this place growing bigger and bigger over the years. Ten or so years could easily see another few kilometers worth of land being available to you. Quite useful if you have plans for any creatures like dragons or graphorns."
948,,400,Department of Mysteries ,Wizarding World,Domain,"Within the Ministry of Magic, there is a department meant to study and uncover the secret of the universe and of magic itself. In here, Unspeakables study the secrets of death, of time, of thought, of space, of prophecy, and of love. Do you want to try your hand at that? If so, this extension of your Warehouse is the perfect thing for you. First things first, this place is not a true copy of the Department of Mysteries you can find in this world. Rather, you can think of it as an incomplete version of the original. And yet, despite that, you will find plenty of uses for everything within its walls. In fact, it is best that you view this wing of your as multiple items in one.

To start things off, you have the Space Chamber, a section of the Department wherein you can find replicas of planets floating all around. Be careful, you and the others might end floating yourselves given how strange the gravity there seems to be. Following that is the Hall of Prophecy, a vast and dark chamber holding every prophecy by the Ministry of Magic. But don’t act too fast. While you may be safe from the security measures in place, the same cannot be said for others who will quickly find themselves inflicted with madness should they even attempt to remove a prophecy that isn’t theirs.

Moving onwards, there is the Love Room where you shall find a never-ending fountain of Amortentia, the strongest love potion known to wizardkind. With this, you could create powerful infatuations and obsessions in the minds of others. On the other hand, within the Brain Room, you can find tanks of aggressive brains with tendril-like nerves swimming in an eerie green solution. But perhaps the two most important chambers are that of Death and Time. Within the Chamber of Death, there is an archway known only as the Veil. It is said that this archway is a gateway to the afterlife and from it, one can hear voices of the dead, whispers of they loved. Should someone ever pass through the Veil, they will pass on, their body never appearing out the other side.

And in the Room of Time, there is a crystalline bell jar the height of a man and thrice the width. Enchanted with a strange form of magic, whatever’s inside shall be trapped in a time loop of sorts, quickly going through their entire lifespan over and over and over again. With all of this, perhaps you will be the one who shall unravel the secrets of the world and achieve the dreams of scholars everywhere."
949,,400,Jumper’s Alley,Wizarding World,Domain,"If you’ve been around the block a few times, you would have surely heard of Diagon Alley, perhaps the true center of Wizarding London. If not, do not fret. All you have to know is that Diagon Alley is the focal point of the wizards and witches of London. No matter their origin, no matter their status, sooner or later, they will find their way to Diagon Alley. From the lowliest child to the most elite of adults, Diagon Alley is open to all.

So why not have a place just like that? Entirely yours, Jumper’s Alley is the place to be. Situated within the populous city of your choice, this center of commerce is filled to the brim with shops and stores of every kind. In here, you can find and buy so much, from the common but ever so useful brooms and cauldrons to rare artifacts and creations like Vanishing Cabinets or the Hand of Glory.

And as you hop from world to world, the market shall follow you along, appearing in one of the more high-profile cities or locales. With every new world Jumper’s Alley finds itself in, the alley shall only grow larger and larger as more and more shops brought into its fold. Even now, you can already spot a few stores selling items from your previous Jumps. How much more can it grow as you travel more and more?"
950,,400,Ancient Castle,Elden Ring - Limgrave,Domain,"You have been named as the castellan of an ancient fortress within these lands. It's filled with all the amenities you'd expect from a structure like this, from armories to kitchens to living quarters to so much more. Your personal bedchambers are the absolute peak of luxury, fit for a lord. It will come with its own staff and guards, each one swearing their eternal loyalty to you, while the demographics of who make up their roles up to you to decide."
951,,400,Legacy of the Storm Lords,Elden Ring - Limgrave,Domain,"You command the winds as though you were one of the ancient masters of Stormveil, before the Elden Lord Godfrey managed to conquer it. Whether it be surrounding yourself in a protective whirlwind, extending the range and power of your attacks by coating them in miniature cyclones, or enhancing your mobility, there is a lot you can accomplish with this."
952,,400,The Wishing Tree,Disney’s Cinderella,Domain,"In a place of your choice, away from prying eyes, there lies the grave of someone you loved dearly. On this grave you planted a simple hazel tree. You visited the grave everyday, crying and praying and sitting in silence, remembering the person who slumbers beneath the soil. The tree grew large, watered by your tears and strengthened by your prayers, until it eventually became so powerful that it was no longer an ordinary tree. Now it is a Wishing Tree. Now it can produce items of varied quality when you need them. Like Cinderella you could ask it for a dress and shoes so you can go to the ball, and it will throw them down to you. But you must continue to water it, and what you water it with will determine the power of the item’s it can produce. Watering it with your tears allows it to produce mundane items. Watering it for several months with, say, dragon’s blood could allow it to produce a sword imbued with the fire of said dragon. Watering it with sacred or magical water could allow it to produce a healing potion that could revive the dead. Remember, the less you ask for the more it can give."
953,,400,Elephant Graveyard,The Lion King,Domain,"While not the prettiest piece of land, this graveyard makes for a great lair to hide away from. Various elephant skeletons dot the land, with some holding passages down into secret caverns. This, coupled with the aura of fear and hopelessness that scares away any who come investigating, makes it invaluable for any villain. Comes with NPCs of whatever species you wish."
954,,400,Pride Rock,The Lion King,Domain,"A perfect replica of the famous Pride Rock, which will now follow you to future worlds. Those who own Pride Rock, own the land within 100 miles of the mountain. Those who live in that area will respect your rule, as long as you prove to be a fair ruler. What constitutes a “fair ruler” differs depending on location, so take that into account."
955,,400,Rafiki’s Tree,The Lion King,Domain,"You gain your own version of Rafiki’s Tree. While not much to look at, the inside of the trunk is hollow and spacious, allowing you plenty of room to perform your rituals and paint on the walls. While meditating inside the tree, you may experience visions of the past, present and future. Those with training in Shamanism will be able to discern them easier than those without."
956,,400,Oasis,The Lion King,Domain,"You now find yourself in the possession of a large and beautiful oasis, situated around a large lake with a waterfall. Rainforest grows around the Oasis, lush and full of food, both vertebrate and invertebrate. You will find that while in this Oasis, you are very unlikely to be found by those who wish you harm."
957,,400,A Mine Of Jewels,Disney’s Snow White,Domain,"The earth is filled with wonders. Unfortunately when you take them they don’t really grow back. This mine is the exception. It's full of all sorts of materials - jewels, metals, minerals - and after a week it refills. After this jump, the mine will produce any mineable products from that setting (Dust from RWBY, for example) and will retain these additions permanently."
958,,400,Storm Mill,Wizard 101,Domain,"A full-scale mechanical mill building used for channeling incredible amounts of Storm power for various purposes, like charging/creating Lumina crystals, empowering extremely energy-intensive magitech artifacts, or calling forth powerful entities of Storm beyond simple wizard spells into the attached dueling platform. The mill works by siphoning phenomenal energy from storm systems, like actual rain and lightning storms. Fortunately, the Mill is designed such that storms constantly build themselves around it, ensuring a source of nearly infinite energy."
959,,400,Mount(400),Wizard 101,Domain,"No wizard wants to be caught dead simply walking everywhere, do they? Well now you have a mount! Thanks to the power of magic, the mounts on offer all offer a guaranteed forty percent increase in your base movement speed, no matter how fast you already are. For an extra 200 points, you may have a full stable of every mount from the game."
960,,400,Ashen Mist Heart ,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Domain,"A manifestation of the Age of Fog, that which predated the advent of Fire and all the disparity that came with it. In that ancient age, there was simply existence and non-existence, where dragons reigned supreme. Utilizing this creation of draconic magic, you can delve into the dreams and memories of others, even those long since deceased."
961,,400,Kingdom,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Domain,"In the times to come, there will be numerous kingdoms that sprout up all over the world, from Astora to Oolacile to Londor. Just as a Lord will have their subjects, so too should they possess a kingdom to lord over. You now own your very own kingdom, one entirely of your own design. From the landscape and environment, to the layout of cities and how they are managed, even the demographics and races within, all of it is under your control, the inhabitants viewing you as their one true monarch. Though it won’t start off as powerful as the other options found here, there is something to be said about the creative freedom being offered."
962,,400,Dark House,Hellsing,Domain,"Science is not an art to be performed without the right implements. Great progress takes the proper investments in your work, which you’ve been lucky enough to receive. A large, many floored laboratory is at your disposal now. Tucked away in a hidden part of the world, few would ever dare approach and none can hear the screams from within. Filled with a wide variety of medical and scientific tools and facilities, it’s all one needs to start making progress on the mysteries of vampires and immortality. Especially given the ready supply of bodies to work on. Some of them are capable medical assistants, most of them are captured subjects kept bound in the many cells beneath the building with regular new arrivals. But there’s not much of a difference between the two groups, if you get desperate. If you can get ahold of some unnatural materials, you’ll be all set."
963,,400,Home is Where the Heart Is ,Marry Poppins Returns,Domain,"Everyone seems to neglect what happens at home these days. It’s bustle, bustle, bustle - never a moment to be spent enjoying the warm of the hearth. But you - well, if the home was a temple, then you would be it’s high priest. In addition to gaining all the knowledge and skills necessary to becoming an exceptional home-maker and caretaker, you also seem to wield a curious sway over most domestic residences, employing wondrous magical abilities when it comes to maintaining and revitalizing home and hearth. Do be wary, however - your new found magical powers only encompass the protection of a home; overstep such limits, and you’ll have to count on something else to back yourself up. The form your magic takes, however, is up to you - so please, fanwank responsibly."
964,,400,Magic Carpet         ,Wizards of Waverly Place,Domain,"An enchanted carpet that is used by Wizards of this world, serving as a form of transportation. The carpet is of Ottoman design, and can fly at speeds of 200 mph."
965,,400,Hidden Bonus Level ,WRECK-IT RALPH,Domain,"This item takes the form of a sticker with a pair of crossed lollipops on it. When stuck onto a solid wall, it will cause the wall to become permeable, allowing entrance to a hidden area based on the location around the wall that the entrance is on. Sticking it on the side of a cabin in the woods will give access to a forest-themed level, sticking it onto the wall of a alley might create a level based on the interior of the wall’s building or a level based on city rooftops. This level will be empty, but can be remodeled by hand, and similar remodels will persist into new versions of the hidden level. Only you can remove the sticker once placed, but anyone can enter, either on purpose or on accident."
966,,400,Elemental Manipulation ,Darkwing Duck,Domain,"Grants a small level of control over an element of your choice, training may be able to expand your control or power. Such things like plants, water, or electricity."
967,,400,Colorful Columbian Casita,Encanto,Domain,"This colorful sprawling multi level home was formed from and is absolutely saturated with magic and can house a large multigenerational family with little issue. The magic of this house grants it a regenerative ability that maintains it, prevents wear and tear, and helps to repair any damage it receives. This home contains a golden door, behind which is a personalized dimension that acts as a bedroom, getaway, and amplifier / work area for any powers or magical gifts you may have. It also contains a permanent and lockable entrance and exit that is maintained separate from your normal key door or portal.

The internal layout of the house is up to you to decide when this is purchased and needs to be of similar size to the Madrigal's Casa Madrigal. You can merge any other “houses” you own with this house to expand and enhance it.

Boosted: You now have a second permanent door outside of your bedroom that leads into the entrance of your warehouse in your Casita, as such your warehouse is now considered to be part of your Casita and vice-versa. This means that any inhabiting spirit can control, manipulate, and monitor your warehouse in its entirety in the same way it can its main building.

Additionally if desired, any owned properties can now be imported and integrated behind their own magical doors in the house itself in their own isolated pocket dimensions, these doors can be located on a separate floor of the building that houses just them or if you desire the property doors can be kept out of the main house entirely behind their own door in their own separate hub dimension whose design is up to you.

Boost Requires Candle to Purchase"
968,,400,Hidden Valley,Encanto,Domain,"This magical hidden valley is surrounded by high mountains that seal it off from the surrounding world and prevent people from entering or leaving. The weather is always idyllic when not being magically manipulated and hides itself and anything within from all forms of divination, scrying, and extra-normal searching that is not your own.

Boosted: You can place any and all properties you own within this valley and it will grow in size to accommodate and can form a branch valley connected to this main central hub valley as desired to separate your properties as you wish when merging them into it.

Boost Requires Candle to Purchase"
969,,400,Pocket Dimensions,Encanto,Domain,"You have the ability to create and anchor dimensional pockets that are initially empty realms, but if they are keyed to a being they will take on an interior design that reflects them and creates a comfortable sanctuary. You can tie the pocket dimensions' physical opening to a specific location and designate how their entrance door looks, by default this is a shimmering golden door, and if keyed to a being they will display a depiction of the person surrounded by notable images related to them."
970,,400,Cave of Wonders ,Twisted,Domain,"Your very own Cave of Wonders to store your treasure, complete with traps and a hidden entrance to keep out intruders. This incredibly well protected hideout seems to have a life of its own with its traps when people arrive with malicious intent, and will do a great job protecting your belongings, as well as being pretty well-stocked for a cave. After this jump, it can follow you into future settings in hidden but easily accessible locations or become a warehouse attachment."
971,,400,Witch’s Workstation,Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs,Domain,"This room, which may be added to a property you own, or attached to your Warehouse by a special gateway, is a great place for a witch to perform their magic. Beyond just having a spooky atmosphere, the room offers various useful tools.

First, it comes with a collection of spellbooks, potion recipes, and poisons recipes on par with what the Evil Queen would normally have access to. If you aren’t a witch, not to worry; your books will automatically update to include instructions for adapting these spells and brews to other systems of magic at your disposal as you gain access to them.

The room also comes with various potion making implements, such as bottles, vials, beakers, and a cauldron. On top of that, it has a replenishing supply of some of the more esoteric or rare potion ingredients found in this world, such as An Old Hag’s Cackle and A Scream of Fright.

In each future jump, you may choose to move this space to your Warehouse (if not already there), or to an appropriate property you possess. Post-chain, you will be able to do this once every ten years. Should the room be destroyed, a replacement will appear in the same location after 24 hours. If it was placed out in the world, and that location is no longer viable, it will instead become attached to your Warehouse. If a book or potion-making implement is lost or destroyed, a replacement will appear in the room after 24 hours (if the room has also been destroyed and has not yet been replaced, this effect will be delayed to the same time as the room replacement)."
972,,400,Island Prison,Moana,Domain,"You gain a small rocky island from which no being that is imprisoned upon it by you can escape under their own power. It will follow you from jump to jump and you will always know where it is. It can hold one prisoner in each setting and those prisoners don‟t come with it. Normal mortals might be able to es- cape, but the more powerful the prisoner, the harder it will be for them to do so. You have to actually seal them inside the cave on the island yourself."
973,,400,Cave of Answers,Moana,Domain,"This is a large cave with a waterfall at one end and a large platform with a maori wooden drum on it. If you go into the Cave of Answers and bang the drum within, the history of the world you are in will play out across the face of the waterfall. As history is vast, having a specific question about the past will cause the cave to focus on that period. For some reason, it particularly likes showing things in song format. If you have the Canoes, they can be stored in the cave, where they will never decay."
974,,400,Pool of Souls,Disney’s Hercules,Domain,"Ah, now this is special. This is a copy of Hades’ own Pool of Souls down in the underworld, with the same advantages, if not greater ones. While empty when you get it, it has a direct connection to the other pool, meaning it starts filling up with souls immediately afterwards. Let’s say one in three of every soul that gets ‘liberated’ after you get it ends up here. However, curiously enough, even though it only has one in three of the souls, it always have any souls you’re looking for, for whatever purposes. Even if they died a long time ago.

Which is probably for the best, because simply by pulling out a soul from this pool and connecting it to their body, you can bring a person back to life. All injuries are healed too, though there is no age reversal. This only works once, though, and once every jump in future worlds. Also in future worlds, it fills up with the souls of a third all people who die after your arrival, and places the souls at your disposal to do whatever you want. If you want, you can instead set it to specific limits, such as ‘evil’ people, or ‘good’ or whatever.

The narrower the limitation the more the percentage of souls belonging to it that the pool picks up. Seeking specific souls isn’t affected by this, however. You can find any soul who is dead in that world, barring resurrections/reincarnations."
975,,400,An Island,Disney’s Hercules,Domain,"Your very own isolated retreat! This is a small island, somewhere off an unimportant coast, far from prying eyes. It’s your own private piece of land, to do with as you please. Does have certain nice advantages, though. Firstly, you can control the weather on and immediately around this island perfectly, with nothing more than your will.

Secondly, it’s an inherently magical place, meaning it takes any and all magic really well, all spells being twice as effective as they would normally be. This means secrecy spells, wards, defenses, etcetera. Finally, the most special thing about this place is that it can be set to a particular ‘purpose’, likely ranging around your own abilities. If you’re a teacher, you can command the island to adapt to a teaching environment, and get perhaps the best such environment possible. It gives you target ranges, obstacle courses, and just about everything else you need to teach and train people anything you want. Beyond mundane utilities, it also boosts the learning speed massively, letting you impart months and years worth of knowledge and skills in mere days.

Adapted to other purposes, it adapts equally well. It can be an administrative center where efficiency would be without comparison, a peerless cultural paradise or even a vacation retreat providing literally unbelievable relaxation to its inhabitants. You can set and change this ‘purpose’ at will."
976,,400,Greek Kingdom,Disney’s Hercules,Domain,"Or maybe you want to set little considerations aside and play in the big leagues after all. This is a proper Greek City-State, and a rich and powerful one second only to the likes of Thebes herself. It has a population somewhere between one and two hundred thousand, a proportionately sized army and navy, bustling markets and alliances with fellow states. It sits on at least one important trade route and likely on a nexus of multiple ones. The people here recognize you as the ruler, be it as a royal or an elected one.

In future jumps you can choose having access to this city in a pocket dimension attached to your warehouse or having it inserted into the setting, where it would be unobtrusive but just in position to reach for glory. Just to clarify, this means the city itself, and enough farmland or alternatives to support the population."
977,,400,Hakuna Matata,Disney Villains Victorious,Domain,"A wonderful phrase. It means no worries, and in this case it’s cause you have a small but comfortable natural oasis! This little sanctuary is far from the eyes of predators both four legged and two-legged...it would require you leaving or someone actively hunting you down without rest to track you here, and you’ll rarely have a reason to leave due to the sanctuary being a natural paradise for food, and drink."
978,,400,Magical Portals,Marvel Britain,Domain,"Like Tink you possess the ability to generate magical portals at will, not casting magic, but a special instinctive mystical power. You are able to generate circular portals at will varying in size from big enough to let a single person walk through to big enough for entire large chambers of people, they allow those who pass through them to teleport to individuals or new locations. You are dependent on your visualization to determine where you want to go to, or who you want to go to, as long as you have seen a picture, video, painting, or similar you are limited only by distance. You are able to teleport anywhere on or near a world, able to reach the Moon if you were on the Earth. Where these portals get interesting are that this teleportation can allow you to reach nearby spiritual or magical dimensions and realms. If you were reaching out in Britain you would make it to the Otherworld, if on Mt. Olympus you would reach the realm of the Greek Gods, if you used this power in the Dresden Files you would reach the Never Never, and similar locations in future worlds."
979,,400,Magic Carpet,Marvel Britain,Domain,"A magical carpet that can fly up to several times the speed of sound, and protect its rider from feeling that speed. It is beautiful purple fabric with ornate bronze designs all over it and bronze tassel-work around the edges. This carpet is rectangular about 9’ x 12’ and can support any amount of weight as long as it doesn’t extend over the edge of the fabric. While flying on the carpet you are magically connected to it and will not fall off without desiring to."
980,,400,Gravito Rock Zone,Black Clover,Domain,"The Grand Magic Zone west of the Clover Kingdom, the entire zone is covered with an ever present mist making it incredibly difficult to navigate. Large concentrations of mana keep nearby rocks afloat with ease, the largest rock is home to a dungeon made up of a network of tunnels, stairs and chambers you have now come into possession of such a zone hidden from everyone. The dungeon itself can also function as a home and base just as it did to the Eye Of The Midnight Sun."
981,,400,Underwater Temple,Black Clover,Domain,"The underwater grant magic zone east of the Clover KIngdom. Surrounded from all sides by extremely strong currents and a magical water barrier this temple is almost impregnable, almost however, every full moon the currents surrounding the barrier weaken just barely. Now this temple and it’s buildings are made of a limestone structure however, seeing as you are paying CP for this the temple and everything inside the magical barrier are all up to you, you can even decide if there are any inhabitants."
982,,400,Byrgenwerth College,Bloodborne: Covenants,Domain,"There are few places to advance one's education then at college, and you just so happen to own perhaps the best one in all of Yharnam. This institution was originally dedicated towards history and archeology, though over time it turned its focus towards understanding the arcane and eldritch. It houses an observatory to gaze into the stars above, as well as a well stocked library containing all manner of reliably sourced knowledge from this time, from science to history to even agriculture. Additionally, it comes with a surrounding forest and lake, one that reflects the light of the moon suspiciously well."
983,,400,The Art of Quickening,Bloodborne: Covenants,Domain,"A forgotten Hunter art that, like many things, was first employed by the First Hunter, Gehrman. With this, you are capable of dashing around as a cloud of mist, untouchable when activated. To make the most of this, your speed and reflexes have seen improvement, allowing you to quickly strike out at your target or, if needed, dodge out of the way once more."
984,,400,Sanctum Sanctorum,Marvel Magic,Domain,"Well now, isn’t this interesting? You’ve come into ownership of a quaint little townhouse. People whisper when they walk by it due to the legends surrounding it -- legends that are mostly true, mind you. No one’s quite sure who built it, or who rebuilt it half a dozen times, but most rumors agree on a number of its inhabitants. From beatniks and street mystics a secret satanic clubhouse to the home of a witch hunter who tortured immigrants in its basement, the house has served as home for any number of oddballs and madmen. Before there was anything built here there was a mass grave for inmates who died while incarcerated and before that shamans used to come here for vision quests. See, the thing that’s special about this house is that it’s built atop a nexus of leylines, the magical dragon lines of the earth’s life that crisscross the planet. This house and the leyline intersection it’s built upon are twins to another found in upstate New York -- the home of one Doctor Stephen Strange, M.D.

Though on the outside it appears as an average sized and seemingly ordinary older townhouse, it is far larger on the inside and filled with a number of strange things. Most notably a large number of doors that lead to other dimensions, from a closet that leads to a void to a bathroom that opens into hell – and don't even get me started on what's in the fridge. Other oddities include living furniture, a small dojo, a library that always seems to be as large as is needed, and plenty of space for storing mystical knick knacks. The house also houses some wards that provide modest defense and alert you to intruders."
985,,400,The World Bridge,Dial,Domain,"The World Bridge stands as an awe-inspiring artifact of extraordinary power, granting you the ability to traverse the vast tapestry of existence itself. As the wielder of this remarkable item, you possess the rare talent to forge connections between worlds, dimensions, and even entire universes. With each step upon the Bridge, you harness the forces that bind reality, allowing you to navigate effortlessly between realms and embark on thrilling adventures across the cosmos. With the World Bridge at your command, you are not limited to a fixed set of destinations. Instead, you have the unparalleled ability to install and control bridges that span across different territories, establishing gateways between previously inaccessible realms. As you expand your dominion, the World Bridge faithfully extends its reach, adapting to your ambitions and opening new gateways to uncharted domains, each with its own wonders, challenges, and mysteries waiting to be unraveled.

But the true might of the World Bridge lies in the unwavering control it grants you over its immense power. You alone possess the authority to regulate its usage, ensuring that only you and those you trust can traverse its ethereal pathways. This protective measure ensures that the Bridge remains impervious to the machinations of adversaries who may seek to exploit its capabilities for nefarious purposes. Your dominion over the World Bridge safeguards the delicate balance between worlds, preserving the sanctity of each realm while granting you the freedom to explore and shape the multiverse according to your will. With the World Bridge in your possession, you become a celestial architect, weaving connections between the threads of existence, and embarking on a journey that transcends the boundaries of time, space, and reality itself. Prepare to embark on grand adventures, discovering realms beyond imagination and unraveling the secrets that lie hidden within the cosmic tapestry. The World Bridge is your gateway to the infinite expanse of the multiverse, and the destinies of countless worlds await your command."
986,,400,Embodiment of Change ,Dial,Domain,"With the Embodiment of Change perk, you become the embodiment of the desert and all its transformative powers. The winds, sands, and creatures within the arid landscape bend to your will. You gain unparalleled control over the shifting dunes, commanding the ever-changing nature of the desert to your advantage. You possess the ability to induce profound transformations. The desert becomes your canvas, and you can mold it to your desires, altering its shape, temperature, and even creating mirages or sandstorms at will. The forces of nature become your allies, allowing you to command the winds and sands to manipulate your surroundings and affect the lives of those within.

Furthermore, your presence inspires adaptation and innovation. Both animals and humans are influenced by your dominion, evolving and developing new abilities to survive the harsh desert environment. You instigate change, pushing the boundaries of possibility and forcing others to adapt to the ever-shifting sands. As the Embodiment of Change, you hold the power to reshape landscapes, dictate the course of nature, and inspire evolution. Command the desert’s transformative might and become the catalyst for change in the world around you."
987,,400,Rainbow Bridge,Marvel Cinematic Universe - Volume 3,Domain,"Asgard, they say, is not a place at all but where the Asgardian people stand. And they must be standing pretty firmly behind you because this seemingly primitive fleet of wooden ships and viking shields is arguably the best interstellar warp travel system in the universe. By gathering the shields and focusing, you can use them to generate a rainbow-like energy that can transport individuals, objects or even armies millions of lightyears across the universe or even realms of existence in seconds. The ships offer leisurely transportation for particularly long journeys-say, across a sizeable proportion of the universe-and are both durable enough to survive space travel as well as somehow providing life sustenance for those aboard them despite being exposed to the vacuum of space. To cap it all the rainbow bridge can function like a tractor beam, dragging away things or knocking them out of reach with motive force greater than entire stellar fleets-and when focused on a specific target, and can potentially destroy a planet or realm of existence with enough focus. A mortal would probably lack Heimdall’s ability to target the Bifrost across vast spans of space and time, at least without advanced technology or truly stupendous enhancements-but even for a mortal, this humble assemblage provides both ultimate logistics support and inexhaustible superweapon-level attacks in one package."
988,,400,Mystic Dojo,Marvel Cinematic Universe - Volume 2,Domain,"For the Masters of the Mystic Arts, the grounds of Kamar-Taj is their sanctuary, their fortress, and their school all in one. It is a place where they can open their mind, and truly ascend to new heights in awareness as they explore Creation itself. Alas... even they knew not to focus everything in one place, and it is with that in mind that I offer you this. Whether you wish to place this in a mountain range so that it is hidden away from the eyes of most, or have it as a Warehouse attachment, this ancient site contains everything one needs to build an order. Rooms for monks to stay in, a great library to fill with many books, a courtyard to practice, an armory for magical items you may possess, and even a storage unit that supplies as much mundane food, water, and tea to sate those who follow the Mystic Arts. Even better, those who practice here will find their minds opening more quickly than usual, having an accelerated effect that will leave training of the body and mystical practices half again as effective. ...oh, and there’s a wifi router installed."
989,,400,Prison of Hell,Marvel Cinematic Universe - Volume 2,Domain,"There is a place beyond this world. A place without light, or warmth, or hope. It is a place that feeds upon any living thing that approaches it, that even a mighty Spirit of Vengeance would never wish to roam that eternal darkness. Yet, now you have found yourself with a piece of it, for power has its price. When enemies have been slain personally by you with fiery or infernal might, you may choose to have some part of them sucked into this place to be tormented and left in pain. It is this pain that will fuel you, granting a very small amount of energy to fuel those powers. While you can never remove anyone from this place, it is always hungry for more... and the greater the pain, the more it shall help you. After all, if there’s no pain then there’s no gain."
990,,400,Slice of Heaven ,Marvel Cinematic Universe - Volume 2,Domain,"There are places that no mortal city can possibly compare to, in both beauty and importance. After all, what is a city of man compared to a City of Paradise? While Heaven is far more grand than Earth, that doesn’t mean the two have to be split apart in its entirety. Purchasing this option allows you to place the entrance to this location either in a remote mountain range as a property, or in the Warehouse as an attachment... and to make a long story short, it grants a section of the city of K’un L’un for your disposal. Fountains with water as clear as crystal, unnaturally beautiful flowers with nectar more nutritious and tasty than regular food... and a monastery which hastens the progress and gains from training one’s body and Chi abilities, or spiritual abilities as well. There’s even multiple rooms and storage rooms so you can create a whole Order if you wish it."
991,,400,Demonic Door        ,Ghost Rider,Domain,"By exerting a large amount of energy you’re capable of moving between dimensions; when doing so, your arrival will be heralded by stormy weather. You’re also capable of teleporting large distances; however doing so drains you slightly, and while it is instantaneous spamming it multiple times will drain you quickly. You can’t take people or other things with you, only what’s immediately on your person."
992,,400,Cave of Shao the Undying,Marvel Primal,Domain,"A cave with an endlessly respawning dragon, giving the opportunity for the worthy to earn the Fist of Iron perk."
993,,400,Stormcaller,Marvel Primal,Domain,"The second magic, Arcanum Eco, takes energy from the natural forces and elements to shape the same. You can command fire, divert rushing rivers, summon or scatter storms and call down the lightning. Your skills in elemental magic are peerless in scope and reach, speed and versatility. Men have been worshiped as gods with far less cause."
994,,400,Lighthouse ,X-Men the Claremont Years,Domain,"You gain a copy of the Braddock Lighthouse. While the original is a part of an omniversal network intended to collect energy on a scale to maintain an omniversal kingdom of magic and fantasy, as well as summon the Phoenix Force, yours is unconnected to this network. On the bright side if the network is destroyed by an angry elemental this won’t destroy your lighthouse, and Otherworld is not harvesting the energy from it, on the down side it merely absorbs the energy of the exotic particles formed by a single weak spot in reality providing a nice little source of magical power for you or any who needs it. With proper know how you could probably convert this magical power into electricity as well.

And the weak spot in reality will come with the lighthouse. In this and future jumps it is a magnet for interdimensional anomalies, entities and objects from other realities falling into place through the hole in existence which feeds its power. In this jump this will mostly be entities from other timelines and Earths, but in future jumps might include other forms of alternate dimensions. And while most of these holes are canonically in Britain - only the island having a sufficient concentration to draw power from - your lighthouse can be anywhere you choose, not even on Earth. I hear the Blue Area of the Moon is nice this decade."
995,,400,Cloak of Levitation,Ultimate Marvel,Domain,"A cloak that allows its wearer to fly at subsonic speeds for indeterminate lengths of time and responds to the user’s thoughts. It can be used as a ""third set of hands"" to attack a foe when the user’s body has been incapacitated. The Cloak of Levitation is nearly indestructible and fairly powerful. The cloak is capable of independent action."
996,,400,Darkforce Conduit ,Ultimate Marvel,Domain,"You have a connection to the semi-mystical dimension of pure darkness known as the Darkforce. You can generate a portal to this dimension in a cloak you wear, allowing you to drag objects and organisms into your dimension where they can be drained of light and released back stunned or teleport yourself across vast distances. You could also generate this power as blasts or shapes if you wish."
997,,400,Shadow Realm,Thor: Love and Thunder,Domain,"This is your villainous lair. The Shadow Realm. This is not the Shadow Realm that Gorr now calls home, but an entirely different planet hidden away in the deep reaches of space. It is inhabited by hordes of Shadow Monsters, which are all subservient to you and will respawn in a week if killed. By entering a shadow, you may travel through to any other place in the universe where darkness exists. In addition to this, you can automatically teleport here when you please, and you are twice as powerful as normal when in your realm."
998,,400,Aegir ,Thor: Love and Thunder,Domain,"A boat named after the Norse god of the seas. This one’s even better than the original. This viking skiff is capable of utilizing the bifrost to fly, sans goats or axe. The ship itself is incredibly sturdy and can take hits from the gods without a scratch. It can carry around fifty people on its deck, and has a cabin. You can somehow breathe and survive in deep space without dying. It’s also quite seaworthy."
999,,400,Swamp Asgard,Pet Avengers,Domain,"This region, roughly the expected territorial range of a member of your Species for this jump outside of migration, is yours. All other animals within this area recognize you as its lord and ruler, who should be respected and deferred to within it. Only the particularly foolish or boorish will not do so. In addition animals native to this region develop human-like intelligence and societal complexity. They may even spontaneously start using each other to help in farming."
1000,,400,Astral Ship,Pet Avengers,Domain,"The Flock, Lockheed’s species of telepathic dragons, travel through space in ships that sail not in physical space or hyperspace but the astral plane. Now you have a ship, large enough for your Species, belonging to that race, and with a crew of such creatures loyal to you. They retain their short attention spans, and general somewhat ineptitude, but they are loyal and will man the ship through the astral plane or into physical reality for you if requested. In other jumps this ship is capable of traversing other psychic and immaterial dimensions, protected from the basic environmental hazards of such travel."
1001,,400,Weather Manipulation,Marvel Midnight Suns,Domain,You are a God or Goddess of the weather in a similar mutation to Ororo Munroe. Just like Storm you have a form of atmokinesis that affects the weather. While you can create any weather condition like rain or cyclones you have such precision with your power that you can sense atmospheric changes and summon impossible events like acid rain.
1002,,400,Forgotten Tomb,Moon Knight,Domain,"This Tomb is a nigh perfect replica of the one Alexander the Great was buried in. For you it is as easy to enter as a Museum down the street but for anyone else? It will be impossible to find, as is anything or anyone inside. Aside from that, you may let there be the Corpse of one person that has died in the past of your current Jump lie in this Tomb. With them will be one Item that was important to them, be it a Weapon or something different. Now whatever could you use this for?"
1003,,400,Pub at the End of the Universe,Marvel: What If...?,Domain,"There’s no finer place to grab a drink with some friends. This lovely establishment sits on the cusp of reality, surrounded by a hungry void of destruction. Despite that, you’ll find a cozy interior, fabulous food, and mastercrafted refreshments inside. You and anyone you designate receives the incantation to summon the pub’s entrance. They may visit this pub at any time, whether everyone resides in a single timeline or are scattered across the multiverse. When your visit is done, each customer can exit the pub and return to their local dimension. Catch up with your friends over a pint, no matter how far away they choose to hang their hat."
1004,,400,Orbital Island ,Heroes Reborn,Domain,"This small hunk of stone, about the size of a large room, orbits around the Earth. It provides a breathable atmosphere around its surface, though getting to and from the island to the Earth will be on you. The island possesses wards against technological and sorcerous discovery, making both less reliable than they should be, and these wards extend to you when you are acting from it. Meanwhile it seems to work to enhance your own divinatory magic, as well as any sensors or special senses you possess. There is even a tree growing on it whose fruit serves as excellent divinatory foci."
1005,,400,Wundagore Mountain         ,Dr Strange Multiverse of Madness,Domain,"Mount Wundagore, is an ancestral mountain surrounded by dark magic and witchcraft. Atop of this mountain is the stronghold known as Darkhold Castle. Within the castle are the original carvings of the Darkhold made by Chthon and the demonic army he left behind. This castle acts as a nexus enhancing rituals and other magics cast within. You will initially receive four Demonic Warriors, but you may create more within the castle."
1006,,400,Kamar-Taj,Dr Strange Multiverse of Madness,Domain,Kamar-Taj is one of the main strongholds possessed by the sorcerers and their forces. This sanctum will come fully staffed with a few hundred students of the mystical arts and a few dozen masters in charge of teaching them. This area is capable of using the magic of its inhabitants to defend the area. It was capable of stopping the Scarlet Witch using her full power for a few minutes. This is much more impressive than it sounds. Secondly it will prevent any inhabitants from being influenced by beings outside. For example Wanda used a mental attack on one of the students to break the defenses. This would stop that from happening as she would be unable to breach the defenses.
1007,,400,Dreamwalking,Dr Strange Multiverse of Madness,Domain,"Dreamwalking is a spell contained with the Darkhold. It allows the user to travel to another universe by possessing your counterpart there. This however can have cataclysmic effects since it tears the boundaries between the universes apart. This perk grants you two options. First, you can possess your counterpart and there will be no damage to the boundaries of the universe. Alternatively you could instead create an avatar in a different universe. Your main body will remain, but you will gain a new body activity linked to you in the other universe. To clarify both options do not cause any damage, though you may disable this protection and intentionally cause incursions. Lastly you receive both options by purchasing this. You only need to buy this once."
1008,,400,Transport Discs,Avengers Vs X-Men,Domain,"Nowhere is ever very far from you, including nowhere itself. You have the ability to create special Stepping Discs, which can take you and others on those discs across space and time, travelling between galaxies, dimensions or even to the future or past in an instant. It is difficult to control time travel exactly however and without much practice, your abilities will often be inaccurate. Your discs can be made quite massive if need be and used as a form of defense, teleporting away attacks that hit them if you prepare in time. You must have some visualization of where you want to go, even if only having seen it in a picture or video."
1009,,400,Asgardian Chariot,Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Domain,"A resplendent Asgardian chariot, pulled by two mighty Asgardian goats. Capable of flying through space at high speeds. The goats, while intelligent enough to follow commands, do not count as Companions. They do respawn, however."
1010,,400,Family Lands,Fate/Zero,Domain,"Your family staked a claim on an immense stretch of land long ago and they’ve retained it ever since, with the title now falling into your hands. Large enough to fit all of Tokyo within its borders, these lands are largely uninhabited by any other human, though it is likely brimming with flora and fauna in excellent condition. Located in any reasonable location of your choice and in any terrain or climate you desire, these lands are legally yours no matter what government or organisation you are dealing with. Furthermore, there are certain amounts of protections to be found here. A number of magical wards have been set up to alert you to the presence of any intruders upon your lands and a few hundred combat familiars of varying types also patrol the lands and will attack any unauthorised entrants.This can be imported into. "
1011,,400,Abandoned Island,Fate/Zero,Domain,"Far out at sea, at least a few hours boat ride from the nearest known landmass, is an island not on any maps or records. This island was perhaps the site of some terrible event that caused it to be erased from all official records. Big enough for a small jungle and village of around 300 small families to be on it, only animals and yourself live on it now. Unless your actions cause it, no one will discover this island or be able to find you on it. Lastly, a lone mansion rests at the heart of the island, equipped with a fairly complete Magi Workshop personalised for whatever art you choose to specialise in. This can be imported into. "
1012,,400,My Home is my Castle,Fate/Zero,Domain,"Every wizard has their towers. And a tower is nothing without proper fortifications. When it comes to shields, wards, forts, walls or any other sort of purely defensive magic, you’re the best around. Your spells are stronger, cheaper, faster to cast and best of all, they stick around quite a lot longer than they normally would. But stationary fortifications are where you truly come into your own. As long as the spells do not move from their position, such as by being cast on a person or item, but instead on a castle or home, all the previous effects will be far greater in nature. Simple shield spells will deflect high powered rifles with ease, you’ll be able to cast tens where you could only cast a half dozen, incantations would take a fraction of the time and your work would almost last till it was destroyed in combat, at the very least surviving dozens of times longer than normal."
1013,,400,The Second Academy City ,Toaruverse,Domain,"If you can’t find the ideal city for you then build one that fits your image. For all intents and purposes you receive an identical copy of the Academy City and the city itself is an autonomous city where you have the highest level of authority and every one acknowledges you as the General Superintendent. Unlike the original one its security and defense are airtight that it would need even the most skilled infiltrator to go through the front gates and follow the procedures to enter along with a surveillance system that leaves no blindspot. It has a population of three million at minimum with eighty percent are students and seven level five Espers at your call though the population and Espers would stay behind when you leave unless you take them with you but you gain new ones every jump. The city follows you in every jump and inserts itself naturally near your starting location along its technology, always thirty years more advanced than even the most advanced technology or country of the world. Pick a country other than Japan for your city to be built on."
1014,,400,Forest God,Ragna Crimson,Domain,"The power to become the apex predator, taking traits of animals into yourself, such as camouflage or large dented mouths, as well as manipulating plant life, turning trees into magical monsters capable of using their roots as powerful and fast tentacles capable of easily crushing humans, as well as quickly moving around. These trees count as creatures of magic, and thus they will be damaged by the silver aura, although they aren’t harmed by the sun. And obviously, these trees are under your control and you can telepathically order them, even delegating the command for them to others. At the base level, this would only allow control of a few dozens of trees.

At the level of a Seija, the user would be able to dominate and move an entire forest, even partly fusing with it to create trees several dozen meters in diameter and tens of meters in height."
1015,,400,Lord of the Labyrinth,Ragna Crimson,Domain,"By spending your magical energy, you may create underground labyrinthian complexes of rock and stone. For a regular Seija, these may eventually extend to be of the size of a country and kilometers deep. You may also fill these Labyrinths with traps of all kinds.

The user is aware of what is happening in one of their labyrinths as long as they are attuned to it, as well as being able to track those inside of it. You gain an ability for multitasking similar to the Warmaster magic."
1016,,400,Mercurial Scimitar ,League of Legends,Domain,"This wicked scimitar is made of a curious, flowing metal that swirls around within the blade. Once every few minutes, the wielder of the scimitar can invoke its power, allowing them to slip any bonds, shrug off any effects that slow or incapacitate them, and granting them a burst of speed with which to destroy any foes who think they've caught the wielder off-guard."
1017,,400,Airship,Arcane,Domain,"Now this is how to travel in style! One of the latest vessels out of the sky-docks of Piltover, and it can all be yours for the low, low price of... Huh, you seem to have a deed already. Well, let me walk you through all the features you can expect from your new airship! Held aloft by a gasbag shielded with hextech from any explosive mishaps, this baby can travel at a staggering forty miles an hour (more with a good headwind). The gondola has space for as much cargo as a caravel, as well as luxurious living quarters for you and up to eight companions (or more if you’re willing to bunk together. The hull is armoured well enough to resist small-arms fire with ease, and if you want you could probably mount some weapons on the sides. 

Oh, and in case you don’t know how to pilot, there’s a manual on the bridge which you can pick up to learn all you need in a day or two!"
1018,,400,Meld with the Earth,Super Dragon Sword,Domain,"You may expend a significant portion of mana to become part of the local terrain. You get a benefit based on the local terrain, gaining a bonus to one of your statistics based on its entry in the Terrain section of the Notes."
1019,,400,Wizard’s Domain,Ben 10,Domain,"Having seen the writing on the wall or having stolen from someone who did, you have managed to isolate a small pocket of Ledgerdomain and constructed a defensible lair within it. This is a comfortable mansion with plenty of amenities, books on simple and advanced spells from this world, and conveniently generates any spell components you happen to need for your many spells and rituals. In addition, being in an isolated dimension made of magic greatly empowers your own spellcasting and makes it both easier to cast and just a bit more powerful. You may enter and leave this little pocket plane simply by thinking about it, a portal entering or leaving it appearing nearby."
1020,,400,Save scumming,Generic Dungeon Crawler,Domain,"Once per jump you may turn back time, anywhere up to a maximum of 24 hours, returning you to whatever location and condition you were in at that moment. This ability will activate automatically to save you upon dying, but Jump-chan has set a condition, when this ability is triggered, consciously or by your death, you will lose all memories and records of the intervening period. You will only know that the ability was activated, and the time in the 'future' that you did so. "
1021,,400,Mountaintop Monastery,Dracula Untold,Domain,"A distant, little-known monastery of your very own. While NPC cleaners and staff take care of it for you, the monks who used to live here found it too boring and left. 

It’s absolutely remote and hard to reach, but it has its own advantages. Firstly, while here you find yourself is absolute peace of mind, no matter what surprises or shocks may spring up. All your troubles fall off outside it’s walls, and your mind enjoys utter serenity and calmness.

Furthermore, any form of learning you may be engaging in that requires a calm mind and quiet contemplation over things is boosted massively, proceeding about four times as fast as it normally would. Your mind is clear, open and ready, and you work proportionately better all around."
1022,,400,Castle Dracula,Dracula Untold,Domain,"Your very own castle! This is a huge castle in the European style, with mighty bulwarks, tall and thick walls and a host of other fortifications. It’s protected exquisitely well, and really, really durable. The inside has huge, luxurious rooms, banquet halls, and everything a medieval prince may need or want. It generates NPC servants to fulfil whatever roles need to be filled, though you can dismiss them if you have your own. The best thing about this castle is that not only is it protected, it also adapts and grows according to whatever settings you take it to, always remaining just as hard to penetrate or destroy, if not harder. That is, it never adapts downwards, always growing greater. Of course, it retains any upgrades you make to it."
1023,,400,Creepy Mountain,Dracula Untold,Domain,"You’re the proud master of a cave home on a really, really creepy mountain. It’s a good place if you want to be left alone, as only the most daring will be willing to climb it. At which point they should encounter real horror. Because see, the thing about this place is that while you’re in it, all your powers are enhanced to a massive degree. Your strength, speed, magical powers… all are increased by over an order of magnitude, while you remain on this mountain."
1024,,400,Workshop and Library,Dresden Files,Domain,"Much like Batman, Wizards are all about the Prep time. With sufficient time, knowledge and resources, Wizards can do just about anything. And while this item isn’t an unlimited quantity of all of those, it comes close. First of all, you receive a full copy of the White Council Archives and Library, including several personal Journals, spellbooks and knowledge stores of some of the greatest, most powerful Wizards there have ever been. While this might not have the exact steps used by Merlin to create Demonreach, it has a fair few of them. But more than that, it has vast details of just about any kind of magic you can think of. Warding, Evocation, tracking… to the entire collection of the Word, Mouth and Heart of Kemmler, books like Die Lied der Erlking, and so much more that most wizards would kill to have. More than just that, you also get a Workshop to match. In terms of apparatus, reagents, setups and all the rest, if this magical workshop isn’t the best in the world, it has to be among the top five. It’s a rare potion or item that you can’t at least make a shoddy version of from what’s here. That’s just in terms of generic items, mind you. This place doesn’t have any ‘specific’ reagents like stones from various corners of Chicago for you to make Little Chicago, but it has just about everything else you need."
1025,,400,Warded Home ,Dresden Files,Domain,"You are the proud owner of a magnificent new address of your own! Either a gigantic mansion in the countryside or an unbelievable penthouse apartment in the city, this is a place with every comfort known to man, and several that aren’t. But more than just the obscene luxury of this place, what truly makes it valuable is the sheer quantity of magic put into it. To begin with, a deal with the Svartalves means that this is full of technology that has absolutely no problem with magic of any kind. Seriously, the Senior Council could drain themselves dry casting Hexus around here and none of the devices would even notice. But beyond that, anchored onto a Carpenter-grade threshold are wards that would make the White Council’s HQ at Edinburgh seem lacking. Seriously, this place is protected."
1026,,400,Walls Containing Madness,Dark Souls 2,Domain,"“This appears as a small castle with architecture of your choosing. The entirety of this structure’s rooms and corridors appears dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge. Scientific work stations with various tools and instruments appear in most rooms, chains from which to hang cages and other things hang from the ceiling, and the basement contains all manner of chests and cells where the scavenged and unwilling are stored. Samples from captured and dissected creatures, among other beings, will be stocked within the basement, and replicated into the future for as many experiments as required. You must of course secure such valuable organs and parts yourself the first time, however.”"
1027,,400,In One’s Likeness,Dark Souls 2,Domain,"“In one’s likeness being forged and placed as ornamentation, a sense of belonging is also established. Could it be a home that you desire, or simply territory? A statue, a painting, or some other great work of art depicting you as you’d like to be depicted is bestowed upon you. Your choice entirely what that work is, but be sure it’s quite impressive. When placed however, it acts as a conduit, allowing your dark powers to creep into the surrounding environment whether it be a sturdy fort or a dense forest. As that darkness spreads, it twists it into one where you belong, imparting upon it traits reflective of your own, along those reflective of the darkness that makes up your being.”"
1028,,400,Crest of a Fearful Lord ,Dark Souls 2,Domain,"“A curious object, it appears as a simple, metal badge in the shape of a crest of your chosen design, or bearing the design of your chosen crest on its face. When attached to a door, your crest is transferred to the door, and no force in the lands would be able to break their way past by normal brute force and mundane measures. The only ways in after you’ve applied your crest are by some specified key or means that exist within the world, the key or means being of your choosing. You receive another crest once per month, each having the full ability to reject invaders.”"
1029,,400,Den of the Beast,Dark Souls 2,Domain,"“A strange location variable in structure, appearance and location. Whatever your natural assets as a beast may be, this place will accommodate for them, and will be surrounded by friendly forces that inhibit any trying to invade it. If you have great claws and the ability to climb, it may include numerous trees. If your form is especially adept at digging, the ground may be composed of sand. If you have wings and need room to stretch, it might even be placed atop of a large hill or mountain peak. Whatever the case may be, you can somewhat order the beasts, monsters or otherwise surrounding your den like a boss with its subordinates. I guess you could even call your domain the Boss’s Chamber.”"
1030,,400,Red Wedding Bell ,Dark Souls 2,Domain,"“A great bell hosted within a great bell tower that is now your property and yours alone. You may choose to place this tower at a location of your choice once per Jump, or attach it to another of your properties as an extension of them. It’s important to clarify that this may be part of another structure, as the bell has strange properties when rang. Angry spirits or invaders from other worlds will appear all around the property to protect the area from those who hold hostile intent towards you, it or those inside. When the invaders and those carrying malicious intent are dealt with, so too will the phantoms return to their rest, or their own worlds.”"
1031,,400,Victor’s Stone,Dark Souls 2,Domain,"“A bizarre monolith framed by gnarled wood. The language engraved upon its surface has no record wherever you might look, lost to time. What possible purpose does it serve? For those who desire greater obstacles to overcome, with conversely greater rewards in the process, this stone may be fed souls and objects of great worth or power. This process of feeding the stone, can also be seen as feeding the world. The stone disperses what was given to it, causing the world around it to become stronger, scaling up conversely to your offerings. In the process, materials become sturdier, enemies become stronger, souls become more potent and more. The results of such foolishness are unpredictable, and yet if one craves unpredictability and challenge, then drop to your knees and pray to this enigmatic boon.”"
1032,,400,Distant Kingdom,Dark Souls 2,Domain,"“Looking for the Iron Kingdom? Simply head to Harvest Valley, ascend Earthen Peak, and then take the elevator at the top up, bam, there you are. Doesn’t make sense? Well space works strangely in these lands, and fortunately for you it works in your favor. You have the bizarre power to bend space on a large scale. Corridors that don’t make sense with their width and length for the structure, towers that don’t appear unless looked upon from certain angles or distances, and paths that make a journey far shorter than they appear become possible. This power is somewhat difficult in usage. You will not be able to bend space at a whim to distort a battlefield, but when leveraged over time you’re capable of grand and bizarre feats that can work in your kingdom’s favor like those outlined above.”"
1033,,400,Speakeasy,Fantastic Beasts & Where to Find Them,Domain,"A poster that when put on a wall and told a password (or when approached by people fitting a dresscode) of your choice grants access to a speakeasy owned by you and staffed by House Elves with strong New York accents. Attracts friendly if unsavoury types, makes a good profit and has an endless amount of booze."
1034,,400,Apparition Ace,Fantastic Beasts & Where to Find Them,Domain,"You can apparate extremely quickly and efficiently allowing you to flit from one place to another as easy as breathing. As one of the world’s foremost apparators you can also apparate far further than normal wizards are able, capable of crossing countries, seas and even continents with barely more effort than usual."
1035,,400,Conqueror's Galleon ,MtG - Ixalan,Domain,"This is too big to be called a ship. It’s more like a fortress with a sail on it. This Galleon may not be able to ride the Great Rivers easily, but on the open ocean, it is a force to be reckoned with - it has more guns along a single broadside than the majority of the Coalition’s has on two of their normal ships, and the raw hull integrity to match, using necrotic deadwood in its construction that matches stone in its density and durability. This ship and the crew and supplies needed to make it run are yours to command. "
1036,,400,Conqueror's Foothold ,MtG - Ixalan,Domain,"A stonework fortress off the coast of Ixalan, this settlement is barricaded and set up on a trade route back to Torrezon - you could make a fortune taxing the route, and if you were in need of any of the goods being funnelled back, your status as the commander and governor could easily let you get away with a bit of civil forfeiture. In addition, the land of this foothold is charged with a useful amount of magical energy, allowing it to be tapped into by a clever mage. "
1037,,400,Lost Vale,MtG - Ixalan,Domain,"Deep in Ixalan, there are places that have been untouched by thinking minds. This is one of them, this valley is pristine in its natural beauty and filled with both flora and fauna that are good for sustenance, as well as a clean wellspring of water. This uniquely isolated natural land is difficult to find both by mundane and magical means, the mists of the vale scattering and diffusing magical scrying. Finally, the primal and untouched nature of this land allows you to tap mana comparable to at a sizable amount of land, as if you had an entire duchy’s worth of land to access in terms of mana production."
1038,,400,Wind Strider ,MtG - Ixalan,Domain,"Currents are currents, sea or sky. you're able to whip up the wind to carry you through the sky, and sending out buffeting gales and walls of winds."
1039,,400,Monument ,MtG - Amonkhet,Domain,A temple dedicated to you with an ambient and appropriate but minor magical effect that also makes spells of one of the five colors of magic cheaper to perform.
1040,,400,Planar Bridge ,MtG - Amonkhet,Domain,"A copy of the very same device that Nicol Bolas requires for his scheme, this object allows for the transportation of nonliving matter throughout the local multiverse. May result in some odd consequences for the local mystical environment."
1041,,400,Dwarven Mine,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Domain,"Dwarves value a good, thick vein of rich minerals - and they’d certainly give a low whistle of appreciation to come across this cavern that follows you from world to world, rich with rubies and already prepared with a number of forges and facilities to work the metal and gems you find in this cave! The mine itself goes on for miles, and possesses both precious metals and base metals useful for smithing."
1042,,400,Witch’s Cottage,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Domain,"Witches require...odd materials for their potion work. Festering Newt, bubbling cauldrons, all manner of herbs, poultices...well, this cottage has what you need. The only ingredients for the spellcraft necessary for “Witch’s Vengeance” you would need to hunt down are the ones that require two legged materials - fresh children’s bones is a popular one, for some reason..."
1043,,400,Hushbringer,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Domain,"Those who make it a point to wander the woods best respect their manners and be sure to say please - otherwise fae folk like you may simply teach them silence the hard way. You are capable of spreading a field of ‘silence’ around you, quieting the light of the soul, of magic, and even simple sound. While magic and abilities far, far beyond your reach may break the silence, even against worthy foes you can expect for their incantations simply to vanish into a loud silence."
1044,,400,Tournament Grounds,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Domain,"The Burning Yard of Embereth this is not, but only by lacking an Irencrag. This field is equipped with all manner of tents, facilities, stables, armories and is large enough to not only train more than a hundred knights, but also allow them to hold ritualistic combat sports to prove their prowess and training, and is now your property, following from world to world alongside you. "
1045,,400,Mystic Sanctuary,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Domain,"Loremages and wizards in Eldraine find that the waters of the Loch and its isles give an odd sense of focus - a lake with the same focus-intensifying properties now awaits you in every world from here on, providing a place of calm and magical power, allowing you to easily research new spells or recuperate your magical abilities."
1046,,400,Lavaclaw Reaches,MtG - Zendikar,Domain,"A desolate location, where a volcano leveled by the Roil continues to bubble up to the surface, leaving pools of lava boiling up from the ground, toxic fumes, and inhospitable heat. It is, however, quite rich in resources if you can brave the land, and by infusing a Red and a Black mana you can call up a magma elemental. Infusing further Red mana into the elemental will increase its body temperature - hot as lava as a starting point and escalating from there, though it will cool rapidly, with the mana used to heat it expended at an astonishing rate. Still, a large enough infusion could set the air itself alight. Surprisingly vain for the embodiment of what many consider a hellscape, the elemental considers fire and lava the height of beauty and will do all in its power to spread them. 

Produces 1 red or black mana."
1047,,400,Stirring Wildwood,MtG - Zendikar,Domain,"A particularly scenic forest on the edge of some grasslands, abundant with flowering trees, herbivorous wildlife and plenty of food. Still, like everything else upon the plane, even this idyllic place can defend itself - by infusing it with two Green and two White mana, you can call upon the trees themselves, forming into a towering elemental that could pluck birds from the sky. Though it is both slow and fragile for something of its size, it is nonetheless a good ally. Along with this, unlike the other elementals found here it is happier to commune with life, making for a lifelong friend should you wish to pursue such friendship. 

Produces 1 white or green mana."
1048,,400,Creeping Tar Pit,MtG - Zendikar,Domain,"A rather unpleasant bog, made worse by the deep pits of cloying tar which are near impossible to differentiate from the ever-present black mud. What does live here is either an insect seemingly placed on this world purely to irritate travelers, or a dangerously well-adapted predator of some sort. Those bonded to this land may expend one Blue and one Black mana to call up an elemental as hungry and unforgiving as the land. This tar elemental is summoned into being below the ground, where it will slowly transform its surroundings to tar before lurching upwards from beneath the earth to engulf its unfortunate prey, or if given enough time sink the foundations of structures. The elemental itself is hungry, cunning and selfish, though if you do manage to gain its allegiance through years of steady companionship or frequent feeding, it may turn that cunning to further your goals considerably. 

Produces one blue or black mana"
1049,,400,Raging Ravine,MtG - Zendikar,Domain,"A deep, rocky ravine filled with loose stone and sparse vegetation. The cliffside seems almost alive, the heat haze giving the illusion of the rocks breathing in the midday sun. Infusing two Red and two Green mana will cause the land itself to shake very briefly, then the loose rocks that the adorn the cliff will begin their descent; tumbling and falling and taking the form of a great crashing beast before it is sent to you, no matter where you might summon it from. This landslide elemental retains its nature, picking up stone and debris as it charges ever-foreword, growing larger and more formidable as time goes on. Much like a landslide, however, once it halts it is over; the elemental must remain moving to sustain itself, and anything that manages to stop its charge will disperse it. The elemental found here is particularly bestial, like a slightly mad hound, and surprisingly playful - at least that’s the feel you get from the bond. 

Produces one red or green mana."
1050,,400,Celestial Colonnade,MtG - Zendikar,Domain,"A truly splendid sight, whether the result of nature or a long-gone civilization, these sandstone pillars run along the sides of a beautiful river of clear water. On infusing the stones with two Blue and two White mana, the pillars will disassemble into stone blocks and then reconfigure into a building-sized golem of stone that floats over the ground, acting as a sentry. The golem can be deployed at the discretion of the one connected to the land to defend any location autonomously, until it is either destroyed or they banish it back to its origin. The elemental itself is rather aloof, so it may require a strong hand to guide. 

Produces one blue or white mana"
1051,,400,Shifting Trees,MtG - Zendikar,Domain,"All places on Zendikar are prone to change, but this place is particularly treacherous; more bog than forest in many ways. It is seemingly unable to remain in one place for long enough to cross it from one side to the other and back without getting lost, and is filled with bugs twice the size of men and ravenous for flesh. Others can, and will, get lost in this place, though you will find yourself able to navigate it with the only as much difficulty as any other part of Zendikar: perfect if you wish to get lost and not have others find you. 

Produces one Black or Green mana."
1052,,400,Temple To A Lost Age,MtG - Zendikar,Domain,"An old merfolk temple to the gods Kosi, Ema and Ula, representing the land, sea and sky. While the true forms of the Eldrazi are known to all in recent days, their legend was once distorted almost beyond recognition, only glimmers of truth remaining. This seems to have bled through to the temple, and false worship runs deep. Should you gather the faithful here to tell tales of gods, spirits and greater beings under the pink coral wings of Ema, your words shall be taken as truth and over time you may distort the legends of a people, changing the idols in the minds of the masses. 

Produces one White or Black mana."
1053,,400,A Mobile Encampment,MtG - Zendikar,Domain,"A rather strange place in many ways, this cluster of military tents. The small tent town that makes up this land will help form a close knit group of its inhabitants, and allow them to be trained as a cohesive military unit in a third of the time you would expect. 

Will provide one Red or White mana so long as the camp is erected, regardless of location."
1054,,400,Waterfront School,MtG - Zendikar,Domain,"A large but comfortable stone auditorium, attached to a library on a lakeshore. A place of learning of a rather unusual sort, inflaming both the mind and passions of those willing to learn. The library, which begins empty-shelved, will replace any scroll or books placed on its shelves with a copy if removed, so that all may learn if and when they wish to. The auditorium, too, is special: any speaker using it will find that they are able to convey their passionate understanding of a subject to those in the audience, and ignite the desire to learn of it in the minds of any that feel they could become disciples to the subject. 

Produces one Red or Blue mana."
1055,,400,Bountiful Forest,MtG - Zendikar,Domain,"A stretch of forest along a great river that is abundant even by the standards of the great forests of Bala-ged. Dotted with waterfalls, there is a tranquility to this place found in few other places; creatures found here are more intelligent than their fellows, and this trait seems to spread to new inhabitants, as introduced species will find themselves growing calmer and of greater intellect. Introducing new species to this place will not cause lasting harm to the forest, as the inhabitants are quick to adapt to newcomers. Creatures tamed here make ideal companions, still wild in instinct but wise enough to work with man easily. 

Produces one Blue or Green mana."
1056,,400,The Walking Wastes,MtG - Zendikar,Domain,"A stretch of land, dead in all senses of the word - nothing but dust and no new growth even appearing as a possibility. But this vast stretch of dust holds a secret: the land still lives, even if it has forgotten what it was, remembering only the visage of its end. Upon infusingthe land with eight motes of mana, it will rise as a 30-foot likeness of that which gorged upon it, formed of the dust. It will drain the life from all that it touches, gorging upon life like the false god it imitates.

Produces one Colourless mana."
1057,,400,A Direction Without A Name ,MtG - Zendikar,Domain,"A quirk of both your alien magic and mindset has given you insight into the how the eldrazi move themselves. With this knowledge you may move in the yet unnamed direction that infiltrators and other similar drones utilize to bypass walls, people and even, to some extent, distance. More than once have the allies cornered the monsters...only to be routed as the creature’s twist, bend and suddenly emerge from this nameless direction in their midst. "
1058,,400,Dwarven Sea Clan  ,MtG - Homelands,Domain,"This ship was built during the time when the dwarves were at their height, a floating relic from before they lost the castle that would become Castle Sengir. Made of the strongest wooden beams and the best forged metal, it is a massive marvel of a ship, designed to protect the smaller trading ships from the dangerous creatures found in the sea. The ship is crewed by a dwarven clan, a tight-knit family that has crewed this same ship for hundreds of years. As traders, explorers, and eternal wanderers, these sea dwarves have an unmatched knowledge of the wonders of astronomy, the sea, and the world they live in. 

The clan will sail wherever you direct them now, loyally following whatever course you set from them. Optionally, you could also take a place as captain and head of the ship and clan, or just remain a passenger aboard. Either way, these dwarves are wanderers by heart and blood, so the opportunity to sail other worlds will interest them greatly."
1059,,400,Magical Laboratory ,MtG - Homelands,Domain,"Set in a great wizard’s tower of granite is this laboratory and workshop. Filled with ancient tomes on spell construction, a multitude of tools for the creation of clockwork artifice, and even some artifacts made to monitor the mana streams available to the world. With the resources found here, you could learn much of the multiverse and the nature of magic. As a workshop it is only equaled by the First Master’s own. While as a library it may not be as large as the collection of the wizards’ school itself, the ancient books here hold insight and magic they could only dream of, penned by authors across the multiverse.

As a special consideration, the laboratory also comes with a variety of safety enchantments to keep you (and others let in here) safe, should anything go wrong while you are designing and testing a new spell or studying something hazardous like a frozen fire elemental."
1060,,400,GUILDMAGE’S FORUM ,MtG - Ravnica,Domain,"A small collection of pillars, and much smaller than the rest of the guildhalls,
this seems unimpressive at first glance. However, it is truly neutral ground, and will always be recognised as such, no matter where you go. If there are ever discussions or negotiations to be made important figures will naturally gravitate towards this place. However, beware: if any act is made to betray this neutrality, it’s effects could be lost forever."
1061,,400,Myr Factory,MtG - New Phyrexia,Domain,"[Colorless]

This land, centered around a gigantic turbine built into a massive mycosynth mushroom,seems to be able to slowly but endlessly produce mindless Myr servitors, drawing on the colorless mana of the terrain around it. Should you wish to draw on this mana yourself, it will stop the production temporarily, but left to its own devices it will simply create more Myr to maintain itself. These Myr lack the mana-filtering abilities of their more developed brethren, though they make up for that by being effortless to produce, and perhaps even that drawback may be fixed, in time."
1062,,400,A ruined land,MtG - New Phyrexia,Domain,"[Colorless?]

The ruins of what must have been an important landmark before the Phyrexian invasion, located in a hidden spot in a location of your choosing. It’s definitely seen much better days, and though you can barely recognize what it was once supposed to be, the feeling of mana in the air hangs heavy over your head, devoid of color. Strangely enough, it seems to react to things that would affect Artifacts, perhaps hinting at its true nature. Maybe in the future you’ll be able to restore it to its former glory?"
1063,,400,Cathedral of the Flagellants,MtG - New Phyrexia,Domain,"[White]

This large building, decorated with the Phyrexian symbol flapping in the air in bright, white banners, has an architecture that is a mix between gothic and New Phyrexia’s own style, and is surrounded by a field of razorgrass that seems to only part for the believers of your faith. Inside is a rather opulent church, the sacred texts etched into its walls in Phyrexian scrypt speaking of your own tenets rather than those of Elesh Norn, and the atmosphere seems to almost supernaturally strip away the reservations of those who make it inside, opening their minds and making them more sugestionable and easy for you- or those who speak for you-to manipulate."
1064,,400,Undersea Laboratory,MtG - New Phyrexia,Domain,"[Blue]

Under the tainted Quicksilver Sea, the Progress Engine’s butcher-scientists labor to create horrible monsters. You have been given- or simply “acquired” one of these laboratories, the tools of a proper researcher of New Phyrexia neatly labeled and stored, and a self-cleaning operation room in its middle. Should you find yourself performing strange experiments on volatile energies, you will learn that the walls of the rooms are surprisingly durable, and very good at isolating dangerous magical radiations. There’s even a convenient trapdoor to dump your failed creations into the ocean, like a proper evil scientist."
1065,,400,Burning Heart,MtG - New Phyrexia,Domain,"[Red]

The depths of the Furnace Layer have become something with an unnatural life, and this underground rusty metallic forge seems to have undergone a similar transformation, its flaming mouth hungering for metals. Capable of performing most menial blacksmithing operations by itself, it nonetheless requires- and desires- a true craftsman's touch, someone to feed it good quality, pure metals, and shape them into something great. Regularly feeding it with refined materials will cause it to grow healthy, and occasionally veins of ore will seem to grow out of its walls, pushed through the earth of nearby terrain into its core, melted into resources for you to use."
1066,,400,Tangled Treeline,MtG - New Phyrexia,Domain,"[Green]

Twisted metal trees grow tall enough that they seem to scrape against the skies, rotting biological matter mixed with scraps of metal forming a neck-deep pit of something akin to
quicksand, and smelling of decay. Any lifeforms that live here have adapted to live on the treetops, the leaf covering dense enough to block most of the sunlight. If you happen to have the “Creeping Corrosion” perk, this land is specially receptive to that ability, bending to its masters will."
1067,,400,Mycosynth Mire,MtG - New Phyrexia,Domain,"[Black]

A black, underground glowing swamp, with metallic fungal “trees” growing all over the place. The necrogen gas pours from the chimneys, able to turn the unwary living into nim from prolonged exposure, though by their placement, it wouldn’t be terribly hard to harness the gas and store it for your own nefarious purposes. Should you have some of the Glistening OIl with you, you’ll find it sinks deep into the bog, causing the Mycosynth fungus to blossom, releasing spores that will not leave the area, but will turn the wildlife in it into the typical Mirran metallic/biological mix."
1068,,400,Mycosynth Wellspring,MtG - New Phyrexia,Domain,"A strange fungal organism, Mycosynth was originally born from the corruption of the Glistening Oil in the depths of the plane, its spores spreading through the air, turning flesh to metal and artifacts to life, being the cause of the metallic growths on the living races of Mirrodin. Now, you have come into possession of a special strain of these spores- and, if you wish, a small room in your Warehouse with a wellspring of them- ones that needs not the corrupting oil to survive, while still keeping their transfiguring properties. With this and some time, you could turn other worlds into metallic paradises like Mirrodin once was… and leave them ripe for corruption from within."
1069,,400,Creeping Corrosion,MtG - New Phyrexia,Domain,"Though no particular effort of yours, you’ve found that life around you seems to grow according to your desires, as if nature itself seemed to agree with you on the path its evolution should take. Should you nudge it along with a small expenditure of mana, you may corrupt the physical form of living things around you to fit those ideals- whether it be a savage survival of the fittest, parasites draining the energy out of your enemie’s artifacts, or simply plants growing over everything, leeching the nutrients of the earth to continue their development. This process, however, isn’t instant- and bigger changes to the ecosystem will require you to spend more and more mana."
1070,,400,Go-Shintai Of Jumps ,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Domain,"Ah, here we are, a Shrine of your very own. A location that is so steeped in your magical energy that it almost begins to perpetuate its own miracles, a place entirely of your own design. It might be little more than a wooden box painted red and placed upon the very tip of the tallest mountain, or it could be a house that floats upside down in the center of a lake - in the air or possibly below the water. This place will always generate an acceptable budget of faith and other resources that you may demand as part of your worship, and will always be tended to by at least one mortal servant. It’s not quite a religion in its own right, though with careful tending you could perhaps convince a nearby village to devote all their faith to you and the blessings you could bring. A village might even be part of your shrine - or rather, your shrine might resemble a village - though you would have to fill it with worshippers manually. Of course, perhaps it might be worth doing just that?"
1071,,400,A Sunny Forest Glade,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Domain,"Another fragment of the Jukai forests, this time a large stone amphitheater that has been broken in half by a river and is partway through the process of being reclaimed by the forests. The ruins are an ideal place to meditate and commune with nature, being calm in spirit and untouched by the march of technology. In the center of the river sits a powerful but long forgotten Kami, one that has served as a teacher to the Order’s students for generations. It is not a school precisely, but in exchange for a modicum of service and offerings the Kami will train all who stand upon the banks of its river the arts it has gathered over the years. Some swordplay, the odd Ninja technique, but mostly martial arts and bojutsu. And of course, how to commune with nature and empower yourself through it - everything a budding monk or druid could need, though it does insist on all education taking a year and a day, regardless of how quickly you do or do not learn. Once that time is up, you will need another teacher."
1072,,400,Personal Laboratory,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Domain,"Moving up in the world are we? Due to some combination of funding from the Empire, the support of rich businessmen, and the respect of no small number of scientists, you have managed to graduate from a mere assistant to the greatest minds of the age to being able to stand under your own might and ingenuity. You now possess a location of your own that is fully stocked with dozens of tools and resources, and even fully staffed by like minded individuals who are willing to push the boundaries of science with you. It might be one of the many compounds within Otawara’s sea of clouds, it might be a smaller but no less well supplied institution maintained by the Empire. It might even be a Reckoner sweatshop, where you would probably be expected to rip apart everything they provide you with to create bigger and badder machines for them to use. For the time being, this is a privilege, and you will need to at least pretend to work on the tasks assigned to you - or outsource them to a reasonably competent minion - but once the jump ends this place becomes yours in its entirety. "
1073,,400,Talismans Of Wind,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Domain,"The Soratami naturally possess the ability to fly, something that has given them power and kept their cities safe from outsiders for as long as Kamigawa has existed. It has also given them a slight sense of superiority, that they are “above” the ground bound races such as the humans and their Empire - none flaunt the rules of what should not exist as much as the Futurists do, after all. You now possess a set of talismans that were made in the image of the power that lets the Moonfolk fly - and by a set, I mean literally hundreds. Each talisman, when granted to an individual, would allow them to fly for as long as they held it. But, because that is not so useful to someone who can already fly, these talismans can also be used in concert with each other, with dozens of them at once being enough to let you rip houses out of the ground and throw them at your foes, or to make something exceptionally heavy nearly weightless so that you might make off with it. Alternatively, you could use them to hold up a portion of Otawara if you wanted to make your own personal island."
1074,,400,A Shrine To Your Glory ,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Domain,"The greatest asset a Kami can possibly have is a shrine, a personal sanctum that serves as their throne here in the mortal world. Having one built is an immense undertaking, but a worthy one. Simply put, merely having a domain of some kind amplifies your godly abilities, raising the quality of faith your mortals will generate and automating the process of blessing them while also costing you less. The more shrines you have, the more this increases. Even a small model of your shrine would count for this, though obviously not as much. The simple act of having somewhere for the mortals to focus upon you is one with magnificent effects."
1075,,400,Taisha of the Outsider,MtG - Kamigawa,Domain,"Prayer and worship grant power to the Kami and now you have a Shrine which speaks of your virtues and holds prayer. This Great Shrine is a property which you can summon into the world unobtrusively. It will gather people who are like minded to you and slowly develop a pseudo-religion if you don’t have one of your own already in place, if you do they will practice that instead of making their own, this has several benefits. Firstly, the prayer of those who follow your way, you need not be a god, will embolden your form, allowing you to survive on the prayer alone and granting you virtual agelessness as long as the prayers keep coming from at least one like-minded person. Secondly, prayer can be stored away to be tapped into as a potent reserve in the cases of Divine magics and supernatural abilities."
1076,,400,Faerie Rings ,MtG - Lorwyn,Domain,"Throughout the world you’ll find small rings of speckled white mushrooms growing just a few moments of fast-paced flight away from wherever you start looking. Along the western fringe of a village, at the foot of the mountain you’re about the climb, in a clearing by the grove you’re visiting. The kithking called these faerie rings, and believed faeries create the fungal circles when no one is looking. The faeries themselves also call them faerie rings, but not for the same reason as the kithkin.

The faeries call such growths by that name because they use them to travel to and from the glen that hid the being that was, to them god, master, queen, and mother, all in the same package, travelling across the world in the blink of an eye. You however, are a bit special, in that you won’t need to call on the Queen Mother to use these faerie rings for travel. 

Simply concentrating at the center of one of these rings is enough to let you disappear in mere moments, to reappear at another ring of mushrooms with wing abuzz and scintillating powder swirling around you. You could easily cross half of Lorwyn and back again in hardly any time at all by way of these faerie rings, even if you had to carry a victim along."
1077,,400,Murmuring Grove,MtG - Lorwyn,Domain,"Treefolk are sometimes said to value the life of a tree more than that of skinfolk, which may have something to do with the fact that almost any tree could awaken as a new treefolk if it was ready to go through the Rising. Accordingly, they protect their groves fiercely. A duty that now falls to you as well, as you have gained ownership of a small grove of the Rising, a protected birthplace of treefolk filled with trees of your choice, whether they be one particular species of tree or a collection of all Lorwyn’s species like a parliament of trees.

Trees planted here grow at an astounding rate, to the point that poplar saplings might shoot up to grow nine feet tall in less than a handful of days, and they seem to Rise more often than the trees in other groves do, even if left unattended. But it is the older trees who truly give this grove a special character, for the trees here speak and remember much. They might not be treefolk, having not undergone the rising themselves, but are still aware enough to speak amongst themselves and share their wisdom. Treefolk and druids can empathically understand them as though they were speaking, and if people of other tribes stay perfectly still, they may be able to hear the trees gossiping among one another as well."
1078,,400,Royal Redoubt ,MtG - Lorwyn,Domain,"Deep below the surface of Lorwyn, hidden behind cramped tunnels lay the redoubts of the merrow, the final resorts in case of catastrophe. One of these is now yours, located in a mammoth underwater cavern some two hundred feet high from rocky floor to ceiling. In the center of the cavern is a fortress built in traditional merrow style, one that highlights just how much the merrow had compromised in the structure of their crannochs to accommodate landwalkers. There was no wood used in the construction of this redoubt, only stone, bone, and gleaming shapewater walls that glistened like crystal to form spires, gates, and columns.  

At the center of the shapewater structure lays a palace-in-exile fit for the leader of any merrow school, the most impressive of the shapewater structures making up your new, personal underwater fortress."
1079,,400,Wingbow ,MtG - Lorwyn,Domain,"A rare kithkin invention that gives a skilled user the power of flight, a wingbow looks like nothing more than an ordinary shortbow at first glance. Albeit an elegantly carved one. 

When you require the utmost haste in your travel though, a flick of the wrist would be enough to reveal it's true utility as a flying machine. The grip will twist the bow around a quarter-turn, locking into place with a click, and then a pair of batlike wings will slip from the elegantly carved and cunningly constructed weapon. Speaking the name of your destination to the bow will then cause a gust of wind to materialize from nowhere, filling the bow-wings to launch you and whatever cargo you carry into the sky and towards your goal.

It comes with a complementary pair of silver goggles to pull over your eyes once you've taken to the air. Something to protect your eyes from the piercing winds."
1080,,400,(Not So) Great Aurora ,MtG - Lorwyn,Domain,"Under the far-reaching glow of the Great Aurora, the Lorwyn its inhabitants know and have dwelled in all their life changes into Shadowmoor. Yet generally, they remember nothing of Lorwyn; to them, Shadowmoor is all there is, all that's ever been. Along with the drastic change of the world, the memories of the world’s inhabitants are rewritten to comply. While you might not be able to effect such massive transformations yourself, you do carry a sliver of this potential. When you make a lasting change through supernatural means, you may allow it to ripple through the world in a sudden, smaller aurora. Sixty heartbeats in which your transformation washes over the world, before it settles down in the blink of an eye. The result is a new world, one where your change was how things always were. At least to most people. You may exclude those you choose from the effects of this aurora, just as the faeries do not change in the Great Aurora. And people more powerful than you or your spell will also be able to shrug off the aurora to remember what truly happened, though they gain no additional ability to reverse the change itself."
1081,,400,Decadent Mansion,MtG - Innistrad,Domain,"One of the great manor houses owned by the elders of vampire nobility, decorated to the peak standards of their culture. It possesses the unique property that any depravity that takes place inside will go un-investigated, just long enough to hide the bodies. Appears in a remote region close to wherever you start in future jumps.

Lands are locations with which you have formed mana bonds. Lands purchased here will follow you as extensions to your warehouse or alternately appearing in at the closest relevant location.

1088,,400,Gromwood ,Skulduggery Pleasant,Domain,"This house on a hill, large enough to be considered a manor, has come into your pictures on its walls and no small amount of unused sports equipment, the house’s true appeal is what lies underneath it. Through a secret passageway, you may access an extensive labyrinth hidden below the property. This labyrinth, called the Caves of the Void, is home to a variety of monsters capable of smelling magic, which they use to hunt intruders. You, of course, won’t be hunted by these beasts (unless you want to be, for whatever reason). Within this maze are veins of a special black crystal, which has been a key component used to create weapons like the Scepter of the Ancients, capable of killing gods. And in the deepest part of the caves is the Source Fountain, a pool that turns whatever you place within it magical. The house is completely paid off, and has free running water, electricity, AC, and secure internet."
1089,,400,Dimensional Shunting ,Skulduggery Pleasant,Domain,"You possess the rather unique ability to move between universes through your magical power. This discipline can be used to either push a target between worlds or to move yourself as needed, though physical contact is required to move a person. You can also perform an echoing shunt, forcing a target you have touched to cyclically shunt, causing them to automatically and repeatedly bounce between their home universe and a different one (chosen at the time of casting) for an extended period of time, though this effect will eventually wear off once the energy you put into it runs out. Though this power generally doesn’t come with protections against, say, shunting into a universe where the atmosphere is toxic, yours does, allowing you to get a feel for the world you’re shunting into before you actually make the switch. You cannot use Dimensional Shunting to visit other Jumps until you obtain your Spark.

Boosted:  Mass Shunting: The power of your shunting has been enhanced in a number of ways thanks to your immense talent. First of all, rather than being limited to shunting yourself and those you are in direct contact with, you can move everyone and everything within a targeted radius around yourself. This can be used to move a large number of people, or you could choose to target the entire space and bring the surrounding environment with you as well. The size of your transfer radius can be increased indefinitely, with exponentially increasing demands on your reserves the larger it gets, but a space with a radius of fifteen meters has the same demands as what touch-based shunting required before. Additionally, worlds you visit remain marked within your mind, allowing you to target places within those worlds and summon targets you are familiar with from other worlds with ease. Individual people and objects you have shunted are similarly marked, allowing you to remotely shunt people you have already shunted in the past, either summoning them to your world or banishing them to another with a mere effort of will.

Boost Requires Second Coming(Skulduggery Pleasant) to Activate"
1090,,400,Teleportation,Skulduggery Pleasant,Domain,"Exactly what it sounds like. Your starting range and carrying capacity is limited to a few miles and only a single person. With practice and training though, your range can grow to the global scale, while you can teleport entire rooms full of people with minimal effort. People tend to not like teleporters though. Something about being able to show up anywhere at any time without warning seems to put people on edge. Oh, and there may or may not be a secret cult that’s been systematically hunting Teleporters down with the intent of wiping out all but one of them, so you’ve got that to look forward to.

Boosted: Astral Projection: Your prowess within your discipline is so great that you have gone beyond the limits of casting your physical form across the world, allowing you to teleport using only your mind. This enables you to project your consciousness into a new location in the same way that you might teleport your entire body, transferring your mind and senses to faraway places without moving your body, completely invisible and undetectable to mundane senses. Your body will be vulnerable while you do so, unless it has automated defenses or other occupants that could take over until you return. Normal protections against teleportation cannot block your projection ability. Aside from being able to teleport your mind without moving your body (and vice versa), you can target parts of an object for teleportation rather than only moving the whole target, allowing you to rip it to pieces if you so choose.

1091,,400,Patch of Element ,Sinbad Legend of the Seven Seas,Domain,"The world bows to your power, well a little of it anyway. You now have a little area that you own where you are the undisputed ruler(unless the person disputing that is far, far stronger than you). This could be a patch of ocean, a glacial mountain, a firey volcano, or even a perpetual thunderstorm. The form that this area takes is catered to your form and to your abilities."
1092,,400,Military Facility ,Magi: The Adventure of Sinbad,Domain,"You’ve happened to find yourself the owner of an abandoned military facility, hidden away in an out-of-the-way location, such that it’d be unlikely for anybody to find it except if they were deliberately searching for it. Despite seeming to have been unused for years, it’s still in perfect repair except for the ivy and foliage covering its outside. In all, it’s incredibly defensible, both in terms of its sturdy walls that can hold up to all but the strongest of magics and its advantageous terrain, and its interior is filled with enough supplies to equip a small army and food enough to last that army through a several month-long siege.

But the facility isn’t the main attraction – no, it’s what’s hidden in the basement. Deep underground is an expansive laboratory dedicated to magical research, especially of the more morally-dubious variety. All kinds of tools, instruments for the study of magic, and samples from exotic flora and fauna can be found down here, but the real prize are the strange-looking tanks that line the walls in pairs, filled with a murky fluid. These tanks are capable of combining people with the supernatural creatures of this world and others simply by putting a person in one tank and the desired creature (or merely a sample of one) in the other. The results of this process will be rather unpredictable unless you already have knowledge on this dark science (such as from the ‘Dungeon Master’ perk), but you can improve over time through experimentation."
1093,,400,Gunud ,Magi: Alma Torran,Domain,"It can be said that there were two major developments that shaped how Alma Torran is today. The first was the introduction of magic to the humans, turning the world’s weakest species into one of the strongest. The second was Elder David’s invention of the Gunuds, which definitively placed Magicians atop the world’s hierarchy and paved the way for the Orthodox’s world domination.

For whatever reasons you may have, you have now come into possession of your own Gunud. Taking the form of a rather plainly-decorated stone tower in the shape of an obelisk, this tower serves the same purpose as all of its kin – namely, emitting waves of mind-breaking magic that steal the intelligence of all but the most powerful of species and bind them to the will of the tower’s controller.

However, this particular Gunud has a number of benefits over a usual variant. Firstly, while a normal version would affect all non-humans indiscriminately, this one can be made to selectively affect or exclude certain species from its magic depending on the criteria you set. Secondly, your Gunud doesn’t require draining brainwashed children of their Magoi until they die to function, instead being fitted with an engine that allows it to power itself. Of course, if you’re the type that prefers to unnecessarily sacrifice children, you’re free to continue using them as a power source if you wish.

Since Gunuds tend to be very high-value targets for certain pesky rebels, your particular tower comes with a small contingent of Magicians and mindless non- humans to protect it from. Though they won’t be able to fend off any truly strong assailants, they’ll go a long way to ensuring its safety from more general threats."
1094,,400,Dragon Mountain ,Magi: Alma Torran,Domain,"Castles and fortresses are nice and all, but there’s one fairly big problem with them – they’re not exactly very mobile. This wouldn’t usually be much of an issue, but if you’re part of a globe-spanning resistance movement, it would be rather inconvenient if your headquarters were limited to one place. Thanks to the designs of Ugo, though, the Resistance were able to get their hands on a moving fortress, and now, so have you.

This fortress is a mountain-sized magical tool, taking the form of a giant metal dragon with a citadel built upon its back. Capable of both walking and flying with equal ease, it can cross any terrain with ease, and inside it has the facilities to support a small town’s worth of inhabitants. Should you feel the need or become stationary or a bit more inconspicuous, you can have it burrow under the ground to leave only the fortress on its back visible.

Aside from being able to fire destructive beams of light from its mouth, this metal dragon doesn’t have much in the way of weaponry, though its defences more than make up for this, being sturdy enough to shrug off all but the strongest magics thrown at it. Oh, and you needn’t worry about fuelling the thing with Magoi, either – unlike the original, this version is more than capable of continually powering itself in all but the most energy-intensive of circumstances."
1095,,400,Kushinada’s Nail,BlazBlue: Phase Zero,Domain,"Shūichirō Ayatsuki’s masterpiece. His Lynchpin, meant to slam the lid on the Cauldrons and shut magic down. The one he needed to kill his daughter to activate. As you might imagine, that didn’t go well. The nail, taking the form of an exceedingly large nail crossed with a drill - as in, an eighteen wheeler large - is situated in a Cauldron underneath the Magic City of Ishana. Unfortunately, activating it still comes with a cost. You need to feed it a soul with powers relating to life. The daughter, Celica, is supposed to have been capable of powering it for five years. Once activated, it cannot be turned off until it runs out of power, but it will completely shut down any and all magic in the world. That said, it ALSO need to be nailed into a spot with weak dimensional walls to work at all."
1096,,400,Personal District,Fate/Extella,Domain,"A division of your own, created with priority by the Moon Cell as part of the new world. A slice of land the size of a small city, brought up from the virtual space around you. It’s a mix of various times and places, chosen by you. You might combine an Irish town from the time of the Ulster Cycle with a Roman imperial city, with an ancient Chinese temple at the centre. While you can’t pick more than three or four, you’ll find your city populated with people from the times and places you’ve chosen, albeit most aren’t too far beyond ordinary humans or magi. The city will automatically spawn defences if threatened, from ranged artillery to large numbers of attack programs, and those that live in your new city also aid in it’s defence. You’re considered the faction leader of your homeland, which is likely to result in Nero and Tamamo seeking you out to ally or serve under them in the initial battles here."
1097,,400,Jumper Labyrinth,Fate/Extra CCC,Domain,"How unpleasant, to use people’s hearts as part of a dungeon, and to require challengers to understand the guardians to merely continue. You are now the owner of a small dungeon, of the same kind as the Sakura Labyrinth. Looking like a digital platform for the most part, you may freely choose the overall aesthetic of it, whether buildings floating on a sea of clouds, an underwater cavern full of floating crystals, surrounded by countless massive skeletons of unknown creatures, as long the dungeon is recognizably digital in nature you’re completely free to decide the themes of the parts of it you do get to decorate. The dungeon has three floors, each barring the way to the next with a “Star” rank defensive wall. Who is the Sentinel? Why you, of course. Those trying to reach the bottom of the dungeon will need to understand who you are, your Secret Gardens in other words, to be able to progress. You’ll find that each floor has a weaker copy of you, that cannot be taken out of the Labyrinth or made inaccessible from their own floor, that presents whatever their Secret Garden is in a somewhat obvious manner. Can’t have an impossible dungeon, you know? Also, it’ll retain any expansions you make to it, should you want more Sentinels."
1098,,400,Level Up,Fate/Extra CCC,Domain,"Not everyone is content with the level of power their Servants begin with. Some skilled wizards have developed methods of illegally enhancing a Servant’s matrix, to give them greater power. It requires a lot of power, and some time, but eventually any Servant may be high rank. What you have access to now is a certain church, of christian design, that comes built in with a program that lets you do this. It has an intuitive interface and explanations on how to obtain more resources to imbue into your Servant, but during this jump you’ll have to obtain more Experience from defeating enemy programs that you can channel into a Servant’s matrix. In future worlds, the program will tell you how to collect the needed resources in the jump, likely by killing some form of creature, and will also let you modify any kind of being that is receptive to spiritual modification. It’ll take some time to empower your Servant, taking more and more resources the more powerful they are, but perhaps one day your Servant will reach the vaunted rank of EX in all stats, and attain the peak of power that a Servant container can have."
1099,,400,Home of Luxury,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Domain ,"A vast arena, much like the grand Colosseum of Rome, is now yours to own. This massive arena is
made with all the finery that ancient Rome could offer and is deeply connected to your very soul. You have the ability to summon the arena to or around yourself with a thought, spending a small
amount of magical energy to call it and maintain it, though even a basic spellcaster could hold it for
hours. With your connection to the arena, you can freely customise it’s appearance and facilities
between summons, turning it from a battle arena into a theatre stage complete with art workshops
and kitchens or even into a massive, magical water park. When summoned, it replaces whatever
environment it was summoned over for the period of time it is maintained, including altering
conditions and magical rules to fit the ordinary setting of Rome that this arena calls home. Handy for
preventing enemies gaining bonuses while on their home turf. The arena slowly but steadily raises
your physical and magical abilities to a cap of around five times your normal levels should you be
fighting an opponent here and wait an hour, whereas your opponents will feel their capabilities drop
to half the strength in that time. It’s difficult to escape, similar to a Reality Marble, but possible for
those with exceptional power, magical skill or unique abilities. "
1100,,400,Crossing Arcadia,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Domain ,"Who can defeat what they can’t even see, let alone hit? Calling you fast is like saying Troy was a bit
of a stalemate. You have a simple absurd capacity for moving fast and agilely. It’s pretty much
instant movement to almost any point you can see, with such speed that even a bolt of lightning will
struggle to catch up to you. It’s not just how fast you run either, as every move you make on a
smaller scale is just as fast, making actually fighting you almost impossible as you dodge and strike
with speed unbelievable outside the realm of the divine. You’ve got the reactions to move at this
speed like you were just moving as an ordinary person, plus you and the stuff you’re using won’t see
any harm from moving and impacting when you’re going this fast, and what’s better, you don’t slow
down unless you’d be brought to a complete standstill. Whatever obstacle that might just slow you,
like deep water, easily breakable walls, weaker warriors, in a charge now won’t lower your speed at
all to run right through. You’re like a bloody tornado on the battlefield. "
1101,,400,Little World Maker,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Domain ,"There’s a reason many witches come to be quite sedentary with their lives, especially as they
become older and more skilled. It’s the same reason few dare to approach the fortress you may call
home, your enormous talent for creating magical territories. You’ve got extreme, almost unheard of, ability to create Bounded Fields, areas filled with magical energy that can apply a variety of magical
spells to those within, and similar magical constructs, as well as the knowledge to apply a huge
variety of effects. Fields to alert you of intruders and provide information on them, to greatly buff
your powers while decreasing those of your enemies, that automatically attack intruders with preset
spells and more. Your fields are significantly stronger than normal for the energy that you put in and
much larger in scale as well, such that any decent witch could cover a small town in a single field
without an issue and a great one could surround a sizeable island in many at once. You find it easy to
enchant your fields with spells or magic that you know and can effortlessly link your fields to aspects
of the environment they are on or around, such as to leylines to power them independently from
you or even to people to create mobile fields. Should you have the time and resources, you can
make a home base that is almost impenetrable to any hero. Eventually, with enough skill in other
fields of magic, it may even be possible for you to turn the Bounded Field magic into something
approaching the rather more impressive Reality Marbles. "
1102,,400,The Argo,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Domain ,"The great golden ship that led the Argonauts on their legendary journey. More than merely a sailing
ship of supernatural make, speed and agility, the Argo is layered with many divine protections that
grant it a range of powers. The ship moves with the force to cut through other ships with ease, can
control strong winds to move itself as it likes and even attack others near it, command the waves
near the ship along with the lesser creatures that swim in the seas and call them to aid the ship and
it’s crew. The weather on a larger scale acts in ways favourable to the ship master, aiding them when near the ship and striking down at foes, damaging or delaying pursuers. The ship has a crew, one of
seemingly inhuman make, as they never need sustenance and can expertly pilot and defend the ship. They appear to be automatons of some kind, though are unresponsive to anything but the captain’s
orders. You may import a vehicle you already own into this option. "
1103,,400,The Isle of Jumper,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Domain,"Just a little hut isn’t enough for the legendary wizards and witches of this time. Like Circe herself, you’ve got a sizeable island in the seas surrounding Greece to call your own. Large enough to able support a castle-sized residence and a small village as well, with decently sized forests surrounding each, the island is surrounded at varying distances by many powerful wards that turn away the curious and slow, attack and sometimes destroy invaders. The waters and shores are treacherous and filled with loyal beasts and monsters, though the island itself further in is quite idyllic. The village is populated by two hundred or so decent but simple folk that look to you as their lord and don’t ask many questions. Able specimens, particularly as they quickly replenish lost numbers without much issue. Your own home is at one of the higher points of the isle, overlooking a tall cliff, and is quite the extravagant affair. A luxurious mansion with an even more expensive and certainly more advanced magical workshop within, the sort of thing even some of the greatest magi in history would be ecstatic to have access to. It does have a lot of materials focused on human experimentation though. I guess Magi never change."
1104,,400,Amazon Born        ,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Domain,"These are wild times, even with many civilisations rising to their peak. There are still countless unexplored and lost places in the world, such as the hidden amazon cities. You call one of these places home, an isolated wilderness retreat for the people that birthed and/or raised you. It may even be one of those amazon cities, like the one led by the legendary Hippolyta, in some strange twist of fate should you be male. Your birth in these lands has led to somewhat increased physical attributes, though you lack anything truly special. While you are not the leader of this tiny kingdom, you are a greatly favoured child of it, an apparent relative of the leader, and the numerous heroic figures that also call this place home are glad to aid, train and support you. While their resources are not great, they have significant military power, and finding the city is almost impossible. Even the aid of powerful magic or advanced technology may still take years of searching. In future worlds, you may find yourself in a similar situation, having been raised or born in some lost kingdom. "
1105,,400,Labyrinth,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Domain,"Every man’s home is his castle and every monster has their lair but only a few can bring it anywhere. You’re one of those few, able to call a ‘labyrinth’ into being in the world around you, trapping you
and your foes in a maze designed from a place you call home, though you can change which place
you call on. In effect, you drag yourself and any nearby foes into a pocket dimension that cannot be
escaped unless they find the hidden exit, which may not be impossible but may be extremely hard, or manage to kill you, as you cannot leave without letting the enemy leave with you. There is no
escape outside of these two points and you’ll find yourself greatly boosted in strength, speed, endurance and tracking capabilities while in this dimension pocket. Whatever form the maze takes
on, it’ll still possess any unique attributes of the home of yours it was based on and you’ll find it easy
to navigate the maze yourself, as if you’d wandered it for years. "
1106,,400,Heavens Hole,Fate/Legends - Nirvana Yuga,Domain ,"Your body has become a sacred temple, a place at which to worship the infinite depravities of
mankind. A heavenly hole has appeared in some fashion on your form, a black hole that exerts
immense force when opened on any you wish to drag inside of your being, this force growing as your
power does. Within Heavens’ Hole awaits a paradise, a universe within yourself that exists to follow
your every whim. You could construct a paradise of every delight imaginable for your favoured to
live forever in. Organise an endless orgy for the demons you drag in that breeds a near limitless army
to unleash outside of your body. Even simply drown those within the inner universe in endless waves
of pleasure and happiness, forming into an annihilating force that bypasses mere physical protection, absorbing those that falter into your being to replenish your health and increase your power. With
the degree of control you have over this existence, a texture within you on the scale of a solar
system, it is near impossible for any that cannot resist being dragged into you to survive. Your power
greatly surpasses that of a Saver when focused inwardly here, even if you hold very little personal
strength in the outside world. Only powerful abilities to traverse space and dimensions or soul
protections could allow escape or survival once trapped within."
1107,,400,Shukuchi,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Domain,"Walking and breathing is something that all humans can do but few ever master. Uniting your
movement with each breath you take is an agonising training process but one with incredible results
for the physical form. Your movement capabilities are incredible, bursts of speed that let you
instantly move across small clearings or rooms through your breath-based hyper acceleration. This
can be focused into partial movements, such as sword swings to accelerate them far beyond any
speed a bullet could reach, or to make improbable movements from any situation, such as high
jumps by the instantaneous movements of just your toes. The logical side effect is that your strikes
hit with far greater power, allowing your speed-adjusted body to strike with incredible force even if
you happened to be some small waif of a girl. Easily weaving this into your combat style, you are
able to propel yourself at far greater speed than normal in movement and attack, unleashing violent
flurries or dozens of precise strikes in a moment. 

Mastery is far from the end however, as with training you may even bring this simple practice of
breathing and walking to the point of leaping across space, turning instant movement into
teleportation and crossing dimensional boundaries. A simple martial technique. "
1108,,400,Godspeed,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Domain ,"Life is full of wonders and those that lag behind on the path are going to find life waits for no one. To
make the most of this beautiful land, one has to have the speed of the gods in body and mind. How
else can you appreciate it all? The gods may debate your speed being equal to theirs but it is true
that something has infused your being with the essence of speed. Both body and mind hold
awesome mobility. From the north of the British Isles to the most southern point, it’d only take you
an hour to race across at a sprint, a speed shared by your movements in combat. The dozens of
slashes each second are more than most opponents can come close to following, much less block!
The longer you remain in active battle, the faster your body will move. You’ll have made noticeable
increases in speed compared to your base level every few minutes, with no apparent limit as long as
there is no lull in the fight of more than a minute or two. 

Mentally, the story is much the same. Information is easily taken in and memorised at supernatural
speeds for humans, creating a situation where you can learn the basics of most tasks in a few
minutes and become a master in months of skills that take mundane men years to reach the same
level of competency. No doubt you already have considerable skill in several medieval talents, such
as sword fighting and horse riding and apparently even the arts of love making. Like your physical
body, your learning speed will increase the longer you remain in continuous practice and study. The
growth is slower than the physical kind but in return the lull is any break from your training for more
than five minutes at a time."
1109,,400,Maanna,Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Domain,"A proper vessel of war, not just a tool for pleasure. While smaller than Mesektet, only able to fit a
few people on at once and not even as large as a sailing ship, it is far faster. Maanna can cross much
of the world in minutes with it’s ordinary traversal or simply teleport around the planet in seconds of
warping. The ship also has a special connection to a single planet in the current solar system, able to
open a portal across space to the orbit of that world. Maanna supplies a bubble that supports life
around the vessel, negating worries over breathable air and pressure or temperature. Directed
attacks can pierce this however.

The ship is powered by the magical energy supplied by it’s owner, as well as being able to convert
any positive feelings of people onboard towards that magical energy. Supplying magic to the ship
allows it to change shape, growing in size to become a proper vessel supporting many people, or
even radically altering to become strange things like a modern motorbike or jet-ski. It appears to the
user at a moment’s notice, even in part as will be useful later.

The bow of the ship is a powerful ranged weapon, capable of accelerating things placed in it to
enormous speeds. It, like many components of the ship, can be detached and summoned
immediately, acting more like a massive bow and arrow set for you. Charging magical energy into
the bow will unleash it in a incredibly fast and powerful blast. More uniquely, the bow is capable of
converting objects you possess some form of ownership or right of management over into a
‘conceptual bullet’. This converts the mystery, power and significance of what the converted object
represents into energy for your magical arrows. The planet which the ship can open portals to can be
converted to such ammunition in moments, firing as an impressively powerful attack which even
other Divine Spirits would flee in terror from, though it would not destroy a planet by far. Strangely, things ‘converted’ in this way reappear unharmed afterwards, but unable to be converted again for a
short time."
1110,,400,Temple Complex,Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Domain,"A vast complex built of at least twenty different temples meshed into a single, monstrous whole. This ‘temple’ is more like a small city formed entirely of temples. Enormous structures, devoted to
the gods of your religions, and even a massive pyramid at the very centre of the small city. This
entire complex has been dedicated in name and magic to you, it being a mighty fortress as well as a
place of divine connection to the gods of your faith. City destroying attacks are effortlessly reflected
by the walls of the complex and powerful anti-magic wards nullify almost any magic attempting to
affect the city or those within.

The city itself grants you the power to receive and give out a wide variety of blessings and curses to
yourself as well as allies or enemies that come within the city’s limits. The most basic is that you
cannot die nor can any being closely connected to you on a spiritual or magical level so long as the
temple complex is in place. Beyond this, the blessings and curses depend on what gods have temples
in the complex, each granting a blessing or curse befitting their natures. A god of poison may allow
you to quickly kill most weaker warriors that enter your complex and give a significant penalty to any
stronger beings for example. Finally, the complex has access to a powerful magical beam attack that
shoots out from the peak of the main pyramid. Even at a base level, this beam can annihilate
modern day Tokyo and can grow even stronger should magical power from the rest of the base, or
from the owner, be directed towards this beam weapon. You may import an existing building or
fortress into this.

This complex can be gained in this form or alternatively sealed into the form of a reality marble-like
projection. If this choice is made, the benefits and blessings are only active when the reality marble
is actively maintained, constantly costing noticeable amounts of magical energy to do so. Your
immortality protection won’t work if the temple is not currently projected. However, you can deploy
it within seconds to any location, even laying it over the top of existing places or dragging others into
the pocket dimension for a short time. Imports into the complex work as normal."
1111,,400,Temple of Solomon,Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Domain,"A place that has long been abandoned or, at least, a replica of the one currently in use. The Temple
of Solomon is perhaps the grandest magical workshop ever to be created, one so great that it does
not even exist in the mundane world. Sealed away in imaginary number space, it is only accessible to
others through highly complex and difficult magical workings, though you can enter your hidden
base with nothing but a thought provided you are not blocked by some means. The temple itself is
quite large, with the small dimension covering several city blocks of area and the building being the
size of a large mansion. Within is almost every one of Solomon’s personal notes and research on
magecraft and magic, along with a great deal of lore from other famous magicians of his time and
from later on as well. The small dimension has been connected to a replica of Solomon’s created
magical circuits which empower the framework the workshop sits on, serving to provide a immense
magical fuel source for any project you might wish to run within this space as you can freely draw on
the amount of energy the King of Magic had while alive when you are in here. Finally, death in this
realm is not permanent and it is far easier to bring back those who die when it is within this place. For your purposes, this means that dying in this temple will not count as an end to your chain. You
may import an existing structure into this role."
1112,,400,Hanging Gardens of Babylon,Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy,Domain,"A floating fortress the likes of which has never been seen in the world and will never be seen again. The size of a city, built to the very peak of magnificence and luxury, the Hanging Gardens are
undeniable the jewel of any empire. Covered in gardens with plants, both mundane and magical, from across the world, the fortress is a beautiful sight as much as it is a weapon of war. Nigh
impenetrable even should the attackers be able to fly up to the city in the first place, the fortress is
equipped with an army of many tens of thousands of automated golems and homunculi that
manage the defenses, along with a wide range of powerful lasers that can burn through almost any
attacker. 

The pilot and ruler of the Hanging Gardens are one and the same, as you may control the direction
of the fortress from the throne. The structure acts as a perfect territory for you as it’s ruler, massively boosting your magical power so that even a novice mage could cast spells with power
equal to the greatest magicians of the old world. While in the structure, you will also find that all
statistics and abilities you possess receive a small but noticeable boost, that your inherent mystery is
significantly increased and that any attack against you becomes noticeably weaker. You may import
an existing building into this role."
1113,,400,Misty Island,Fate/Legends - Vive la France,Domain,"Like the famed count of Montecristo, you’ve had an eventful life. A life that has led you to fortune, power and some amount of fame. Whether a similar story as the count himself or through more
rightful means, you’ve come into the possession of a small island like Montecristo, with a decently
sized manor home, grounds and dock present. The title of Baron comes with the island, a Baron of
France, as well as quite the significant fortune. You’d be known as a fairly wealthy noble even in
France’s noble heyday, though far from the richest. You’ve not unknown to the French social scene, believed to be a powerful but mysterious man with whom currying favour with could return great
rewards. But the secrets hidden within your island, in tombs and lost caves, are perhaps much more
valuable. The island holds fourteen treasures spread throughout, together creating a magical field
that massively enhances the potency of any powers that are based on or drawn on grudges and
hatred, increasing many times over. Even powers merely linked to darkness or negative emotions
find significant growth, if lesser so. With time and study, one could perhaps even learn to focus
these relics and create a unique magical circuit/crest combination, one which can create lesser
versions of the King of the Cavern in your subjects. Perhaps you could even create a stronger version
or enhance an existing one, if you found a source of hate or grudges of enough magnitude. In future
jumps, you’ll be able to inherit or quickly gain a similar title and fortune, though the land will come
with you as it is here now."
1114,,400,Progressive Estate,Fate/Legends - Strange New World,Domain,"No man of science is complete without his laboratory of choice and neither can a proper magus be found without a workshop to house his life’s work. It’s much more rare that both are found in the same place however. This rather luxurious, lush and expansive estate you now own, with a few hundred acres of land and very sizeable manor house, is really just the window dressing. Attached to that fancy house up there is a combined laboratory/mansion the size of the very mansion it is attached to. Filled with technology and academic research at the very cutting edge of the 20th century, and somehow a few steps further in some cases, on three different fields of technology as well as a wide range of magecraft tools, research and notes on three magical topics of choice that would be well regarded even in the upper echelon’s of the Mages’ Association. While each side is already quite impressive, it is the small library regarding the efforts of the previous owner of the home to find applications towards mixing each side that is the hidden gold here. Notes on how to truly bring out the potential of technology with magecraft and vice versa are here. As well as all this, the entire estate, manor and laboratory are surrounded with multiple layers of defense and obfuscation of both technological and magical means. A small army could not break in, even if they could find the place. 

You may import a property into this."
1115,,400,Heart of the Sun,Fate/Legends - Strange New World,Domain,"A grand Meso-American temple, like one of the ancient Aztec or Mayan pieces. Mounted on top is a
near 4 meter wide stone monument, carved in the likeness of the sun itself. The monument, and the
temple itself, is a artefact dedicated to the gods, a tool meant to empower them. You can summon
this temple to you in mere moment, materialising behind you when you have need of it. When
summoned and near you, it will unlock a significant portion of any divine powers you might have but
be unable to access, at least a third of your overall power, and massively enhance any divine abilities
that are not locked away from you, magnifying them 6 fold from their normal level. The downside is
that the temple’s summoning unleashes the solar winds associated with this monument, causing
destruction over a wide area around the temple, as if a powerful hurricane had appeared. Fitting for
a wrathful god but dangerous to one with kinder intentions."
1116,,400,Lover’s Chariot        ,Fate/Legends - Land of Shadows,Domain,"The chariot of the fearsome Queen Medb herself or at least a fanciful imitation of it. This large and luxurious chariot is a sight to see from the outside but entering the curtain covered doorway towards the interior reveals a home far too enormous to possibly fit within the chariot. A home fit for a Queen even. The chariot is pulled by two magical bulls, each capable of flight and of running at speeds great enough to reduce most foes that get in the way of their charge to a red mushy splat on the ground. It is near impossible for any male, or female if that be your preferred gender, to dodge or block the chariot’s charge as well and the chariot portrays even more power than normal when used as a weapon against a poor male, or female as before. While this makes for a useful tool for mowing down lines of the enemy, if used on a single target, it can forcefully bring them inside the home of the chariot, revealing it’s true nature as a Reality Marble. Yours, in fact, as you gain quite the boost in power while within this area with another person and find that your skills and abilities related to certain bedroom activities are magnified many times over in potency. No man brought in here can leave until you die, destroying the Reality Marble, or you allow them to leave after satisfying you, though a voluntary release is also possible. No doubt many wish they could get a voluntary release whenever they want too. "
1117,,400,The Clocktower ,Lord El-Melloi Case Files,Domain,"Yes, the whole thing. It is hidden and protected by a large number
of powerful bounded fields, equipped with dozens of laboratories, classrooms, and
libraries. It will insert itself into new worlds. The residents have no particular loyalty to you, but they’ll never become openly hostile unless you do first, and they’ll forget it after
that jump. For 1000 CP instead, the magi are replaced by loyal followers each jump."
1118,,400,Spiritual Tomb of Albion ,Lord El-Melloi Case Files,Domain,"Beneath the Clocktower is the mystical labyrinth
created when the dragon Albion attempted to depart for the Reverse Side of the
World after waiting too long, only to end up fused to the earth around him and be
trapped in a pseudo-undead state. It is a place of enormous danger, but also
enormous opportunity. By paying 400 CP after purchasing The Clocktower, you
may bring the Spiritual Tomb with you as well. The mages within are as loyal or
disloyal as those you bought from the Clocktower. While no human has yet
managed it, it is possible to enter the Reverse Side of the World by traveling far
enough down this labyrinth. If you do so in future worlds, you will find some realm
of layer of existence where local myths and legends reside - or whatever
equivalent exists.  

Requires Clock Tower"
1119,,400,Frangiclave ,Cultist Simulator,Domain,"The master key of the world, and the most powerful tool of the Principle of Knock. The Frangiclave is a key that doesn’t so much open locks, but rather utterly destroys them."
1120,,400,Sailor​ ​Teleport/Planet​ ​Attack​ ​,Sailor Moon,Domain,"The Sailor Soldiers had to teleport across the planets at a moment’s notice or scout around a world. A spaceship was too cumbersome to use. Having at least five people all hold hands in a ring, you may teleport and/or fly together as far as the span of the Solar System. As you fly, you are protected by a glowing shield that can take powerful hits. You may use this as a magical ramming attack, if you wish. This teleportation can only carry people, and when scouting it moves around a continent in less than a day.
"
1121,,400,Highway To Hell ,DC Occult,Domain,"​There exists magical pathways between most mystical dimensions. Heaven, Hell, Faerie, Gemworld, and pretty much every afterlife or magical nook and cranny you care to name. With proper knowledge of these pathways, one can easily slip into them, allowing easy access to both them and what amounts to teleportation around earth, as well. And you are one of the few people with knowledge of pretty much all of them.

After this jump, you will retain the ability to travel between nearby magical dimensions and enough knowledge to not easily get lost while doing so. This won’t let you travel to Earth Aleph while in Worm, but slipping into the Nevernever while in the Dresden Files is simple and easy. You also can’t access magical dimensions outside of your current jump until your chain is finished. In jumps that don’t have alternate magical dimensions this simply acts as a form of magical fast travel system instead.
"
1122,,400,Wizard’s Tower ,Stardew Valley,Domain,"Despite the name, this “tower” resembles a workshop more than anything else. Constructed of sturdy stone, this outbuilding has two rooms, one larger and one smaller. The smaller room comes lined with shelves set into the walls, though they are empty, and a few plain looking chairs. The larger room is equipped with everything a budding wizard might need. A massive cauldron that sits over a fire that never seems to need feeding, an alchemy set of glass instruments and containers, and an assortment of impossible sounding ingredients. (Seriously, where do you even get hen’s teeth from?)
"
1123,,400,Oblivion Bar ,DC Occult,Domain,"​A magical bar that resides within its own pocket dimension. The main room is a somewhat large bar that you get to decide the actual appearance of. Want an Old West saloon? Knock yourself out. A nightclub complete with annoying techno music? I really don’t think the magical crowd will be into that, but sure. It also has several other rooms connected to the main one as well that you are welcome to decide the purpose of.

How the bar is accessed is largely up to you. Could be a password that, when spoken, connects any door to the dimension or it could simply require customers to provide their own method of interdimensional transport. It also magically restocks itself each night, and repairs itself if damaged at the same time. Infinite booze should be reason enough to buy this, right?
"
1124,,400,Mage Tower​ ,A Practical Guide to Evil,Domain,"An immense tower imbued with such heavy spellwork and defenses that even a fortress would grow jealous, this serves as the perfect home for a mage. So perfect in fact, that they’ve been outlawed simply due to how many mages have attempted to springboard their rebellions from them. You may choose where your Tower is placed at the start of each jump, and may add this to another property you own, if you wish.
"
1125,,400,Strange Apartment ,Madoka Magica: Wraith Timeline,Domain,"You have an address to a specific room in an otherwise normal apartment building. Within this place is a white void with several ticking clocks floating around the air, along with enough furniture to live comfortably. The memories of the owner (yourself) and those who enter this apartment will play back like ongoing movies around them, though they won’t focus on a particular event unless you or they start thinking about it. This apartment complex seems to escape magical detection, letting you rest in it without fear of attacks unless someone already knows where to find it. Post-jump, you may put this room in a similar building nearby or make it a Warehouse attachment.
"
1126,,400,Sea Of Trees ​,Yuki Yuna is a Hero,Domain,"This is...a strange power. You are able to recreate Shinju’s Sama Barrier in an instant, an immense, colorful landscape of giant trees and nature, under a vast twinkling sky. This barrier assimilates all living things inside it, ensuring no one is harmed out of collateral damage, as well as most small buildings. Castles, electrical buildings, and high-rise structures are not included in this assimilation. This landscape can be dismissed at any time, and typically it takes much power to uphold it. People will not remember the barrier, however any part of the barrier that is damaged will reflect a similar disaster onto the area the trees blanket, like a car accident killing several if a significant portion of the trees are destroyed. Unlike with Shinju-Sama, who could project the barrier onto a land the size of the Japanese region of Shikoku, you will only be able to project this barrier onto the size of a neighborhood at first. The size of your barrier will grow with time spent training, however."
1127,,400,Hero Castle ​,Yuki Yuna is a Hero,Domain,"This is...a big castle. It’s huge. And the people inside it will be more than happy to wait on you hand and foot! It’s a luxurious castle, its insides and outsides tailored to any aesthetic that pleases you. It’s got no offensive capabilities. Why would they need to fight in this peaceful era, when conventional weapons are useless against the Vertex? 

But it’s defenses are quite spiffy. It could weather attacks from multiple Vertexes at once. In fact, it could probably withstand a nuclear bomb and even prevent the radiation from seeping in. Very little things in this world could destroy it. It even has a blessing on it from Shinju-Sama that it can be protected from moderate divine attacks. And it seems receptive to any improvement projects you make with it. It’s also super luxurious.
"
1128,,400,Sun Machine ,Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings,Domain,"Similar to the Mirage Machine, this room sized mechanism allows the lord of the tomb to manipulate the surrounding sands and the temperatures of the surrounding area, focusing the wrath of the desert. Sandstorms can be whipped up around the tomb in perpetuity, at great enough speeds to cut flesh in a few seconds of exposure. In places where sand is lacking, this machine will simply control the wind itself to accomplish the same effect. The temperature may be set to anywhere between the hottest possible within the desert midday to the coldest found at the midnight of the desert, both dangerous to even experienced desert livers. (CG Note: Requires Tomb - Warhammer Fantasy: Tomb Kings first.)
"
1129,,400,Flash Air ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Domain,"Flash Air is a displacement Magecraft that substitutes one thing for another. It can be used to change the makeup of a building displacing doors and windows to different locations. By displacing a portion of space it can also create portals that lead from one spot to another, this can be used to shift projectiles to a different trajectory or to cause an opponent's attacks to hit themselves for example."
1130,,400,Apneic Beauty: 301 Second Ice Shrine of Eternity ,Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA,Domain,"You have come into the ownership of a card containing a high ranked barrier Noble phantasm. By letting the card sink into the ground it will generate a large dome of ice that will completely seal the area inside it. The ice is capable of taking the strikes of an A rank noble phantasm without even chipping. The price for sealing off the area is that the oxygen within will gradually deplete until after three hundred and one seconds it cannot sustain human life, potentially killing the user if they do not cancel it before then or have some means of surviving."
1131,,400,Ruler of the Castle ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Domain,"Once you claim a territory (you are limited to the approximate area of a large castle) as your domain, you gain a degree of control over the very reality of your home, and can impose your rules on those who enter. For instance, you could insist that all “guests” wear attire appropriate for a ball and lose all fighting/transformation abilities, and anyone who entered your territory would have to obey the rules. You can also selectively control who is affected by the rules, such that your own servants do not suffer from the same restrictions; on the contrary, you can make it so that you and your minions’ powers are enhanced as long as you fight within the palace. Even so, individuals with strong willpower can refuse to play by your rules and free themselves from your restrictions. With sufficient magic, particularly through holy or divine magic, it is possible to completely shatter your absolute command over your kingdom. Once your spell over the territory has been broken, you will have to wait a while before you can build up enough energy to try to reclaim it. Also, you can only claim a single area as your domain at a time.
"
1132,,400,Mirror Prison ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Domain,"A strange, otherworldly prison that you can attach to any building in your possession (but it cannot be used inside your Warehouse). On the outside, the prison looks like a globe of interlinked, icy mirrors. Inside, victims are placed in the individual mirror cells. While you can travel through the mirrors at will, for others they will be hard as steel, resisting physical and magical force. However, intense power (such as with the combined efforts of a half-dozen individuals) can overload and shatter the prison. Plus, while the prison blocks people from exiting via teleportation, it has no such restriction on people entering.
"
1133,,400,Guardian of the Earth ,Golden Sky Stories,Domain,"As the name suggests, you are the guardian of a very specific domain – but this part you already knew. Embracing your role as a guardian, your abilities have improved to reflect your resolve. So long as you remain within the general vicinity of your domain, you can freely adopt the body of any animal within and utilize them as both a mouthpiece and a means of observation.

That being said, as a guardian spirit, your body and spirit are more attuned to the domain than others. When the domain thrives, so will you, and vice versa. As a consequence of this, you’ll age slower than the mortals around you.
"
1134,,400,Suzunaan ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Domain,"You have a kasha-hon, a kind of traditional Japanese library, containing a wide variety of mostly-mundane books. On its own it will turn a mild profit, sufficient to live off and have minor hobbies on your own, but in addition it contains the materials for a traditional Japanese woodblock printing press. Books, scrolls and the like copied with the press will retain all the supernatural abilities of the original copy, enabling you to mass-produce enchanted papercrafts, though depending on the size of the book you are unlikely to be able to produce more than a few hundred every day of work, and producing the woodblocks to print will take some time on its own.
"
1135,,400,Fae Farm ,Neverland: The RPG,Domain,"A copy of one of the many farmlands found in Elphame, complete with enchanted crops and livestock. Your farm includes but is not limited to: cabbage (which either turns you into a donkey or turns you back to normal), hungry grass (cursed wheat that triggers mad, endless hunger if one walks through before it’s cut), witch herbs (only grown in the dark for dark mystic powers), fairy cattle, and the Arkan Sonney (a nigh-uncatchable white pig that brings good luck to whoever manages to catch it).
"
1136,,400,Sheep’s Shop ,Wonderland No More,Domain,"You now own a copy of the Sheep’s shop found at Riverside. Despite appearing to be a small shack on the outside, it is actually quite large inside, with full shelves lining every wall from top to bottom. No matter how far you look up or down or left or right, you will find more shelves and goods. Essentially, the shop automatically fills with any common items that could be sold in whatever world you’re in (for instance, any standard equipment/gear available in Wonderland will be present); whenever you enter a new world, all previous goods remain (but aren’t necessarily replaced if they aren’t common in the new world anymore) and are supplemented with new items to fit with the new world. In addition, whenever a potential customer enters the store and has a conscious or unconscious desire for a certain sort of good that wouldn’t normally be there (such as a magical item), said item(s) have a 1-in-3 chance of becoming part of the shop’s inventory.

So essentially, the shop has nearly everything you could want...if you can find it. And that’s not always easy, as the items are all randomly placed amongst the shelves (and shuffled whenever anyone enters or leaves the shop), and all tracking powers and the like are disabled in the shop. In addition, none of the items on the shelves are actually real – not yet, at least. As long as they remain unbought on the shelves, they remain only half-real. They only become real and usable once bought, and even the owner of the shop must pay for purchases for the items to function.

Items removed from shelves and the store without payment will quickly vanish and reappear back on the shelf. And keep in mind that the rarer or more powerful the item, the higher the price; magical items, for instance, often have exorbitant prices that will always tax your resources heavily regardless of your wealth.
"
1137,,400,Living Flower Maze ,Wonderland No More,Domain,"A copy of the gardens around the Looking-Glass House, complete with an array of Living Flowers; said flowers can’t or won’t move about, and they tend to have their nose up toward lesser beings (which is pretty much everyone else). New flowers planted into the garden will eventually mature into equivalent Living Flowers, but they share the other flowers’ haughtiness and won’t leave the garden. The maze comes with magic enchantments that intermittently activate to make travelers lose their bearings and change their direction – and said effects are timed to activate when the victims are least prepared to notice. The maze is accessible from your Warehouse (and you can choose to leave a separate exit/entrance to your Warehouse in the garden if you want), and you can also import it to a place of your choice in each jump."
1138,,400,Shrine of A Lice’s Crown ,Wonderland No More,Domain,"A replica of the shrine that lice made for the “Crown of A Lice”, which they veneered as a holy relic for their kind. It consists of a cave with a moldy cushion atop an old pillar at the end of the cavern. The shrine is missing its crown (see separate Crown of Alice purchase), but the shrine nonetheless enhances the physical strength/defense and magical/spiritual power of all insects within the cave. In addition, the shrine contains four undead louse warriors, one louse priest, and one louse champion warrior. These human-sized lice fight relentlessly to protect the shrine and its belongings from all intruders, though they will stand back if you tell them that certain people are exempted. If you place an item on the pillar’s cushion, they will guard the item until you remove it. Other arthropods that enter the cave will feel a compulsion (which they can resist if strong enough) that this is a holy place they should protect as long as they are inside the cave.
"
1139,,400,Dungeon Maker ,Danmachi,Domain,"Diving into a dungeon has merits on its own but sometimes it’s nice to build your own dungeon. This gives you the necessary skill, ability and powers to create a self-sustaining and ever-expanding artificial dungeon that if given time to grow it would arrival the dungeon of Orario. As its maker you have a complete authority to manipulate and control everything inside your dungeon allowing you to designate what monsters it can spawn and items the monster drops."
1140,,400,The Family Farm ,Warhammer Fantasy: Halflings,Domain,"Farmlands are the staple to The Moot and to halfling ways of life. Entire bloodlines are dedicated to caring for and working the land belonging to their forebears, ensuring that in return the land cares for them with its bounty. A lesson that has been drilled into you in turn, even as your old man left the farm to you in his will.

All four-hundred-and-forty-four acres of your family farmland has been left to you. Every single inch of it has been well-maintained over the years, the soil almost preternaturally easy to till and plow by the efforts of you and your farmhands. Some traces of the Wind of Life have permanently seeped into the land as well; Not only does its bounty grow half-again as large as it would have normally, but the land seems to resist the taint of dark magic such as the necromantic energies of Sylvania, or the twisted touches of Chaos.

Additionally, there is a small-but-comfortable farmhouse on the property, along with a couple sheds full of farming equipment and a barn for any working beasts you may need.
"
1141,,400,The Family Ranch ,Warhammer Fantasy: Halflings,Domain,"A rancher or shepherd is nothing without their animals, for they would have no milk, wool, or meats to sell, or beasts to tame and sell such as ponies. And sheep or cows do not have a guardian without the herdsman, and would fall quickly to predation by both beast and hunter until the herd was gone. Such is the relationship just formed between both sides that even in Tall One lands, a ranch and its animals will be passed down through generations. 

You have one such inherited plot of grazing land: Approximately four-hundred-forty-four acres of grasslands and fields, with numerous large stables and barns for the storage of both equipment and animals. The grasses and other plant life that grow in your fields seem to be somewhat imbued by the winds of Ghyran, as well: The fields will never be over-grazed, growing back thick and bountiful for every patch your animals may feast on. As well, the magic of these fields bolsters your herds: Few to no instances of plague or sickness will strike them, you will receive much higher quality of milk or wool (or whatever they may produce instead), and in general they will seem hardier and more vital than other members of their species.

As well, it should be noted that you have a small-but-comfortable ranch house on the property. Comfortable for a halfling-sized family, at least.
"
1142,,400,CHICKEN-LEGGED HUT ,Warhammer Fantasy: Kislev,Domain,"A small, crooked (but nicely furnished on the inside) hut standing on chicken legs of bronze and surrounded by a fence built of the bones of humans and beastmen. The skulls perched atop the fence glow with an eerie light in the dark and produce an aura of all-pervasive terror in those that look upon it. The hut follows your will as if it were an extension of your own body but can also work autonomously to run around stomping on your enemies with it’s huge and immensely heavy bronze chicken feet. It is also extremely resistant to attack due to many powerful magical wards.
"
1143,,400,Shield of the Old Ones ,Warhammer Fantasy: Lizardmen,Domain,"All Slann Mage-Priests have powerful defensive magic to ward against all but the truest arrow and spell alike, your wisdom runs deeper however and, just as the Old Ones once laid out, you are able to form a geomantic web of carefully placed buildings and sites which, when under your control, can produce a similar but far greater barrier around them such as that which held the demonic legions of Chaos at bay in millennia past.
"
1144,,400,Mobile Study ,Warhammer Fantasy: High Elves,Domain,"Any sage worth his salt oftentimes has need of a spot for quiet contemplation, and these moments might be all the more important on campaign, or when trudging through a distant jungle in search of ancient wisdom. For such purposes there is this collapsible “tent” leading to a pocket room that contains an abridged collection of the entire library of the White Tower of Hoeth. Most of the knowledge, less than a hundredth of the size.
"
1145,,400,Elven Embassy ,Warhammer Fantasy: High Elves,Domain,"To any diplomat, such a building is both home-away-from-home and, more importantly, a foothold. With this purchase you receive a small staff of Followers to direct, and at your will they will magically teleport this building of Asur construction within or just outside any city of your choice. The building is fiat-backed ‘safe,’ for all parties within the walls, and similarly cannot be utilized for violence in any way. Not storing weapons for violence, smuggling, etc.
"
1146,,400,Portable Portal Space ,Generic Minecraft,Domain,"Wait, how did you get this? Well, regardless, you’ve somehow managed to get a portal...without a portal frame. This portaless portal takes the form of a square panel of purple magic that can transport things to a set dimension where you’ve scouted the location for the other side. You can produce as many of these as you wish.
"
1147,,400,A Test of Wisdom ,Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,Domain,"The Sheikah Shrines are carefully crafted tests of both wit and might, two things that are never a bad idea to hone. The Shrine has been adjusted to continually re-arrange itself using the stock parts and shrine Guardians the Sheikah used, continually evolving in response to your approaches in clearing it to further give you a challenge each time. Allowing your mind or your reflexes to dull is never an option - this will make sure you can stave that off.
"
1148,,400,Four Sword Shrine ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventure,Domain,"The shrine of the Four Swords is a place made by the sealing arts of the ancient Hylian lines of the maidens, and the equal of the magical sages depending upon what era of history you are in. It has the strength to be used for imprisoning evil beings such as archdemons, and ancient evils. Along with a small cavern for storing holy artifacts with magic that will keep items from rusting and being reduced by the ravages of time. Now, you own such a place that comes in the form of a small stone disk with a sword planted within in the form of an ancient talisman the size of your fist. Place it on the ground at a location of your choice and in twenty four hours a new shrine will grow in that location. You will receive a new talisman at the start of every jump, but their numbers will never exceed four."
1149,,400,Fairy of the Forest ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventure,Domain,"While Fairies have a prefered habitat, very few of them would ever be bold enough to claim it as their territory. They would probably like to, but Hylia has created guardian deities aplenty and there’s rarely territory that can actually be called unclaimed. That’s not to say they don’t have any, just that the weaker ones wouldn’t dare. But, you aren’t exactly weak anymore now are you? When inside a territory that you control, you become instinctively aware of the state of it, it’s health, it’s inhabitants, even intruders with ill intentions. By spending a rather large chunk of mana - even the Princess would stagger at this cost - you can... renovate your lands. Plants will grow healthier with the extra magic in them, and the forest will twist itself into a wooden labyrinth to hide your court. Of course, this only applies so long as you are inside your territory, so it rather immobilizes you to use it most effectively.
"
1150,,400,Farore’s Wind ,Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,Domain,"A spell handed down by the goddess, this power allows you to create “warp” points in nearby safe places, allowing you to return to points you’ve already passed in case of emergency.
"
1151,,400,The Black Tower ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages,Domain,"Originally called Ambi’s Tower, it gained it’s more fearsome name when Veran froze time and forced the townspeople to work on it day and day. I would say night, but that never came. Regardless, this tower is not actually finished yet. Instead, the tower amplifies any ‘evil’ abilities you might have. The power of darkness and shadows and hatred and so forth, not just powers you use for evil. As you force people to work on it, the amount it amplifies will increase. Not by how tall it is or anything like that, but by how much the workers have suffered during the process. It’s location is actually somewhat irrelevant on account of you being able to put it anywhere you want. But, once the first brick is laid, you aren’t going to be able to move the tower until you rebuild it next jump. Thankfully the power boost doesn’t reset the way the structure itself does.
"
1152,,400,Temple and Sanctuary ,Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks,Domain,"In each of the four Realms of New Hyrule lies an ancient temple, built to power the Spirit Tracks and watched over by one of the Lokomo. The Ocean Realm has two, but the fifth temple doesn’t generate power. As I was saying, these temples absorb energy from the land, from what little prayer is still directed to the old gods of Hyrule and the Spirits of Good, and from the simple goodwill of those living nearby. This energy would normally power the Spirit Tracks, but in the absence of that, it instead channels that energy directly into you. Well, not you specifically. A temple isn’t a very good house, so you’ve also been provided with a small refuge from the prying eyes of the world, a Sanctuary of sorts. The energy is channeled there, in part to maintain its defenses, both physical and mystical. So long as you’re inside the Sanctuary, you have more or less complete control over the energy flowing from the Temple.
"
1153,,400,Space Time Gates ,Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks,Domain,"Okay, finally, something useful for an engineer! These archways dot the landscape of New Hyrule, and allow for transportation between them. Shortcuts, as it were. Each gate is one of a pair, and large enough to drive your train through. Simply pull the whistle as you near the gate, and it will spin to life, depositing you elsewhere in New Hyrule. ...Or, that’s how they ought to work, paired up and only in one direction. Luckily for you, your gates are being given a small upgrade, allowing any gate to warp you to any other gate. Keep in mind though, these gates have a Force Gem atop them, and you’ll need to strike them with a bomb from your canon to add them to the network. In future jumps, these gates will semi-randomly place themselves in useful locations, and can optionally be shrunk down to human scale - though, if you do so, they won’t be usable for your train.
"
1154,,400,Deku Treehouse ,Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker,Domain,"I have no idea how you even found one of these, but you have a mid-sized Deku Sapling that’s grown in such a way as to be a treehouse. Just, treehouse. I don’t even. Anyways, it’s a living wellspring of magical power, and will probably create its own version of the Korok at some point in the future, so try to take good care of it. If you took ‘The Great Deku Jumper’ perk, then you may jumpstart your growth and immediately gain the benefits of the perk.
"
1155,,400,Fairy Fountains ,Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker,Domain,"A set of six natural springs with their entrances hidden underneath some amazingly large seashells. Each fountain contains a Great Fairy, along with a small number of regular fairies. Visiting these fountains will find yourself receiving a blessing from each of them. One will double your magic, three will allow you to hold more items, one will give you a fairy in a bottle as a 1up, and the last one will give you a magic weapon of some kind, or perhaps merely upgrade one you already have. Each fountain must first be found in order to use, and in true Hylian fashion are guarded by a small puzzle of some kind. Thankfully, I shall give you the maps you need to find them, which should simplify things immensely.
"
1156,,400,Fairy’s Fountain ,Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess,Domain,"A healing spring where fairies gather to frolic and play. Diminutive, helpful creatures, fairies will restore the life energy of anyone that seeks their help, and will even allow themselves to be captured by you for later ‘use’- disappearing once they’ve rendered their aid and reappearing back at the fountain, where the waters will restore their magical power. The most notable thing about a fairy’s healing ability is that they can restore others after they are dealt normally mortal wounds, which they will do automatically if someone who has ‘captured’ them is wounded. In addition, a Great Fairy lives here- and can be called upon to grant some of her tears, so long as you don’t already have some. Can be made into a Warehouse attachment, but not when purchased by a companion."
1157,,400,Sanctum ,World of Darkness: Sorcerer,Domain,"Not as useful to Sorcerers as true mages, but in this apartment sized space, your magical abilities, from this world or others, will never go awry, instead merely failing to produce any effect at all when misused. This Sanctum can take any form, from an alchemist laboratory, to a dojo, to a temple, to a small house."
1158,,400,Mazed Band ,The Elder Scrolls,Domain,"Created by an apprentice of Sotha Sil, this enchanted ring is incredibly powerful and useful to anyone. Though it has had some of its uses taken away, it will allow the wearer to teleport themselves as well as whoever they are touching to anywhere they desire, so long as it's within the plane of existence they currently reside in. It can bypass most magic barriers, though there might be a reason for them to be placed where they are, so exercise caution."
1159,,400,Boots of Springheel Jak ,The Elder Scrolls,Domain,"To an ordinary onlooker, these would just be a fine pair of leather boots. To the wearer? These will allow you to leap up to twenty feet in the air, and make you immune to fall damage. Additionally, it increases your skill in acrobatics in order to make the most of these abilities."
1160,,400,Hearthfire - Pocket Realm ,The Elder Scrolls,Domain,"Ah, but who said anything about your home being on Nirn? With this, your home will inhabit its own miniature Realm of Oblivion or Aetherius, which you can design to your specifications. You can also create Gates in the world that go directly to this realm. The realm's size is just large enough to house your property, with a mile radius between it and the edge of the realm.

(CG Note: Requires Hearthfire - Basics - The Elder Scrolls first.)"
1161,,400,"Just You, Me, and Them ",Deathloop,Domain,"Whether magically or technologically, you have the ability to lockdown a district or smaller area in order to trap a particular target. The lockdown is temporal, meaning time outside of the lockdown is stopped. The target is unable to escape unless they perform a certain task in order to lift the lock, whether that means destroying a pillar of magic or downloading unlock codes from a tower. While inside the lockdown, you and your allies gain a boost to your physical parameters such as reaction speed, movement speed, accuracy, strength, etc."
1162,,400,Mikage Furnace,Genshin Impact,Domain,"While not irreplaceable, the Mikage furnace is nonetheless an extremely valuable asset for Inazuma. This is a device that acts as a furnace, using the power of a fallen god as its fuel source. Its use of this power makes it capable of smelting together some truly impressive materials, including those taken from the remains of gods. This furnace was the source of Inazuma's world famous Jade Steel. You have acquired a replica of this house sized device for your own personal use."
1163,,400,Sacred Sakura Sapling,Genshin Impact,Domain,"Born from the body of a close friend of the Electro Archon, the Sacred Sakura tree is a holy site for those of Inazuma. The trunk of the tree stretches high into the sky and assumes the shape of a fox, and the leaves that drop from the canopy have a certain electrical energy, but it is the roots that are the real prize. The roots of this tree purges evil and corruption from the land by absorbing it into themselves. Unfortunately they cannot purify this taint themselves, and so this must be done by others in a purification ritual. While you do not have the original tree, you do have an offshoot sapling that could soon grow to similar heights."
1164,,400,Training Domain,Genshin Impact,Domain,"Created by Kamuna Onmyoudou long ago using the combined arts of the Adepti and Tengu, this was a manmade Domain designed specifically for training skilled samurai before it fell into disuse. The insides consist of a series of connected rooms whose placement can be rearranged at any point. Each room will spawn several mirror monsters, false monsters in the image of real ones, that the trainee will have to fight. Once the maze of rooms has been navigated, and boss monster defeated, the trainee will have completed the course. Somehow the entrance of this Domain has fallen into your hands. Luckily no-one would notice even if it were to go missing."
1165,,400,World Of The Mind,Genshin Impact,Domain,"While the Geo Archon taught the adepti in the method of creating pocket dimension, the Electro Archon was taught by her foxy companion in the method of placing her consciousness into an object, creating a world inside her mind that acts a bit like a reflection of her consciousness. But just as she was taught in this art, so too were you. Within this world, you are capable of dictating who can enter. Similarly, as this is the world of your mind, you can establish certain ‘rules’ such as forbidding the use of magic by others. These rules can only be contested by others within the world if their own will exceeds yours. If you really wish, you can choose to forsake your mortal body altogether, placing your mind permanently inside that of an object to escape the weathering of time. This technique does not include the recreation of the body, so such a move would for all intents and purposes be permanent."
1166,,400,A Hope Of The Past ,Genshin Impact,Domain,"You have managed to gain the favour of Istaroth, Shade of the Primordial One and god of time. They have seen fit to bestow you with a boon. Once per jump, you are able to send a single item back in time. It will retroactively appear in the past, potentially centuries ago. Those of that time will view it as always having been there and, in effect, for the present it always was. This power does have its limits, namely that you can't send anything too massive back. A particularly large tree would be about the most you could send. But with this power you have the potential to plant the seeds of hope in the most dire of times. A sword that slays demons, a tree that purifies evil, a tome containing powerful magics; choose how you wish to change the past with care."
1167,,400,Serenitea Pot ,Genshin Impact,Domain,"While the materials required to construct a pocket realm are rare and expensive in the current Teyvat, you don't have to worry about all that. You have already been given a perfectly serviceable one by the skilled Madam Ping. It may not be testing the very limits of this ability, but this pocket realm still contains a rather massive space within. Easily enough for a town or two to fit in. Both the inside and outside of this pocket realm are up to you to decide, though unlike the former, the latter is far less malleable once set. Importantly, this specific teapot comes with its own Teapot spirit to help with the running of things. Once in a while, a travelling teapot merchant will pop in to sell their wares, usually in the form of some kind of blueprints you can use for your realm."
1168,,400,Chamber Atop The Clouds ,Genshin Impact,Domain,"This work of art is something you might expect to see in the realm of an adepti, certainly not in the real world. Almost as if it wishes to meet Celestia among the clouds, this great structure hovers far above the ground. The original Jade Chamber was an iconic sight in Liyue, built over decades by the hard work of Ningguang. As such, one can imagine the staggering cost it took to build. Arrays below and around the base of this structure allows it to travel through the air at quite a respectable pace. This particular structure comes with a Guizhong Ballista, a weapon originally devised by the God of Dust but capable of great destruction when wielded with the right knowledge and power."
1169,,400,Teleportation Waypoints ,Genshin Impact,Domain,"To the denizens of Teyvat, the teleportation waypoints are a series of mysterious ‘gimmicks’, their purpose unclear. But to those in the know, they are a valuable array. A strange network of devices scattered around the world, allowing one to teleport between activated waypoints. These appear to be linked in some way to using the leylines of the land, though the exact mechanics are not fully understood. A network will appear in future worlds, allowing instant travel for those that know how to use them. Naturally they have to be activated to be used first. Along with this, you will gain several portable waypoints, which allow for temporary use of the network wherever you place them."
1170,,400,Beldian Castle ,Konosuba,Domain,"A lonely old castle that is more than it appears to be at first. Your new fortress is set at the top of a small mountain, extremely well defended and working well as a starting point for an army’s attack or defense. The inside of the fortress is filled to the brim with traps, guards, weapons and enchantments to both protect you from any invaders and prepare you better to go out on the attack. The castle is also impressively sturdy against attacks, even the walls are magically enchanted, so that constant daily bombardments won’t even scratch its walls. We’ll even throw in sound proofing for every room as an added bonus."
1171,,500,Time Pool,The Owl House V1,Domain,"According to the book ""History's Top 10 Plot Holes"", time pools are mythical puddles acting as windows which can be used to travel through different moments of time. The location they appear in seems to be random, and it is unclear how long they stay in one spot. They never appear in the same spot twice. Luckly you don't need to worry about how unlikely it's to find one of those, you shall receive the power to summon one of those once per jump (or once every 10 years). This Time Pool will allow you to select any starting point in jumpchains, including this one. So here, you can start at the time where titans weren't almost extinct, or the time where Philip was still unaware of the Demon Realm. In other jumps, the same applies, so you could go to a Gravity Falls jumpchain and start when Stanford was still building the portal."
1172,,500,Disaster Plants ,Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Domain,"This technique allows the user to form and control a variety of cursed flora. Its capabilities are normally initiated telepathically, activating the technique next to the user or near a target, but can also be deployed from the user's body. The plants created by this technique can vary in size, shape and physiology. Anything from simple flowers to giant wooden roots is possible to be formed. The flora of the technique is however still made from cursed energy, meaning that curse-like plants can be created quickly and deactivated instantly. The technique also grants the ability to absorb the life energy of real plants into a flower offering and convert it into cursed energy for the user. This ability can give a giant boost of cursed energy. And at your will you can cause a rose to bloom on your body and release all that cursed energy in one blast. Also you can create flowers that are cursed to take away an opponent's will to fight giving the opportunity to attack or escape."
1173,,500,Magic Research Tower,The Seven Deadly Sins,Domain,You are now the proud owner of a Tower meant to research all kinds of insane magical items or abilities or creatures. With a load of tools and notes you could create nearly anything. You have a load of magical resources such as monster parts or odd magic items to use in your experiments. This thing is always top of the line with the top tier of resources possible inside of it. It is bigger on the inside than the outside. It may look like a tall tower but it has enough room to rival a mansion.
1174,,500,Baste Prison,The Seven Deadly Sins,Domain,You have a bulbous mushroom looking prison that is the greatest in the world. You see once you get anything inside of this prison it will never be able to leave. No matter how powerful it is. Even if they/it were somehow able to get out of its cell then they would be met with stone guardians far stronger than them. These guardians are nigh invincible and are capable of battling even gods. They will then force them back into their cell and seal them away once more. This only activates if someone is inside the prison. You may enter and leave as you wish and the guardians will not be capable of leaving the prison grounds.
1175,,500,Istar ,The Seven Deadly Sins,Domain,"This is the sacred land of the druids. Within are various things. First are two goddess caretakers who take care of the land and train new druids. Second is the main part of this land, the Cave of Training. It is a cave that you will only be given a wooden stick to go through. Inside you will feel no hunger and when you enter you will be faced with an opponent stronger than you. They will be strong and fast and they will be beyond you. When you die in this cave you will appear outside lying on the ground. All growth inside the cave is sped up by 1.5 times."
1176,,500,Avallo,The Seven Deadly Sins,Domain,The Avallo is a traveling bar that walks on eight huge legs like a spider. It is quite large and its building is also booby trapped. If you wish it can instantly activate any booby traps around the person whom you wish to be removed from your tavern. It has a large stock of alcohol and it has a mysterious chef that makes delicious food that nobody has actually ever seen cooking. It has a control room in the basement which you can use to move the entirety of the tavern. It will take in a large amount of money and will do so in nearly any populated place that you go to.
1177,,500,Boar Hat Tavern,The Seven Deadly Sins,Domain,The Boar Hat Tavern is a traveling tavern that has three floors and its one staff. It has a huge amount of liquor in stock and will always have the best of the best alcohol in the land. From the liquor of Bernia ale to delicious food such as the Boar Hat Meat Pie special. It will always have enough money to pay your workers and a bit of profit. It is always stocked with alcohol and ingredients from all over the world. It travels through the fact that it rests atop of a giant green pig that will dig itself a hole and rest in the ground when you land in the place you want to be. This pig is seemingly invincible and can actually eat large magical attacks and spit them back out at your opponent.
1178,,500,Abscess ,Shin Megami Tensei V,Domain,"Abscesses are distorted things. A Coalescing of spiritual power that empowers Demons and seems to make analysing surroundings around the Abscess more difficult. You get one of these to summon wherever you wish, any allies you wish getting a power boost as long as they are surrounding the Abscess, while not losing their mind or going berserk in the process."
1179,,500,Shade Lord,Diablo 3,Domain,"So you learned a thing or three from Mephisto? Very well. You can now teleport short distances, leaving a Shade behind where you stood before. This Shade will deal damage and has any aura-like abilities you have so you can concentrate to make it use them one by one. You can teleport within your line of sight with this, but you cannot teleport (through this) when the Shade is active. Here is the true catch: You can when you teleport set a timer (up to 10 seconds) on the Shade. Once the timer runs out you get teleported back no matter what happened to you. Frozen solid? Bound by inescapable chains? Teleported across dimensions? As long as the Shade was up you get teleported to where it was. If you pay 100cp more you can now swap places with the Shade for even more trickery and confusion."
1180,,500,Dimensional Formation: Shambhala ,Akame ga Kill!,Domain,"One of the team of engineers hired by the First Emperor to create the Teigu managed to obtain and learn techniques to manipulate and control space from the mystics of a now-lost nation, with such an art being mainly to create this support-type Teigu, Shambhala, that takes the form of a hand-sized pendant. Shambhala grants its user the ability to manipulate space, allowing them to teleport people and objects over large distances as long as they had been to that location, or at least a few meters close to it, before.

Unfortunately, teleporting requires a lot of energy, so most users will be unable to teleport immediately after using the ability only once, requiring a period of rest before it can be used again. However, someone with very good reserves of energy will be able to teleport objects and themself in rapid succession as long as they still have enough energy. It can also be used to mark locations, allowing the user to open portals between marks remotely, but it’s probably more energy draining than the regular teleportation. Lastly, consuming even more energy than before, its trump card is the ability to open door-sized portals to a weird alternate space that no one is able to come back to without having access to their own spatial manipulation, with this space being located ... somewhere."
1181,,500,Yggdrasill Mímameiðr,Germanic/Norse Mythology,Domain,"A world tree all your own. This is a metaphysical-ish literal-ish tree whose roots and branches will expand into other realms on their own and to any world you travel to yourself. You can freely travel along the tree's paths to get to any other realm it is connected to. This tree will not let you travel to previous jumps until you gain a spark. You can put the tree wherever you like in each setting or keep it within your warehouse. No one can travel by way of your tree without your permission and restriction upon the paths and who can travel which ones are easy. Your tree has no limits to the number of worlds it can bridge and it can be used to bridge vast distances within a world by its roots dipping in and out of the dimensional soil so to speak. People who know what the plant is can attack it and try to break the connection of your tree to that dimension but this is incredibly difficult and would take capabilities on par with a mid level deity. The tree itself can supply you with an infinite amount of living wood to shape as needed. Its wood contains powerful protective and restorative energies and is capable of growing any plant or seed brought near. The tree acts as its own demi-sub-plane that grows larger as it grows and expands into other realms. Initially not being much more expansive than a two storey house, this subspace within and about the tree can grow infinity and could easily be the size of an average city within a few thousand years. You may look out to all its branches and roots in different realms from this subspace. As long as you are in contact with any part of the tree you are in contact with this subspace and receive its protections and blessings; this tree will survive unharmed by even the entire collapse or intentional destruction of the omniverse, time, space, space-time, fundamental forces, dimension and so forth. If such destruction of the universe or world you are on is imminent or actually occurs, you will be pulled safely and lovingly into your trees subspace, only having to wait out the birth of a new universe/ multiverse/ omniverse which the tree will guarantee happens. You may bring others to your tree's subspace and afford them these same protections as long as there will be room for them, the tree is able to support any and all life within its subspace unaging, even desperate organisms that require radically different diets and environments will be sustained hardier. ​This is an item capstone booster."
1182,,500,Cryokinesis,Marvel Zombies,Domain,"Where the Human Torch is hot, you’re opposite. You’re cold, with a power that allows you to make and control ice and snow. Though your powers mostly revolve around creating and controlling glacial mass, it wouldn’t be accurate to say that it’s the full extent of it. You do it by lowering the ambient temperature of water molecules, or at least, something along those lines. You can flash-freeze things, and make all sorts of unnaturally durable constructs out of the materials you work with. This can be pretty much anything. Walls, slides, and almost any simple object you need can be made at a moment’s notice, and you might even make moving constructs like clones in time. You’re aware of these like you would be of a body part, without the pain if they’re broken. Your body falls under your power’s purview, as you can turn yourself into living ice whenever you want or need to and reform when damaged."
1183,,500,Stepping ,Marvel Zombies,Domain,"A step up from teleportation. You create “stepping discs.” That’s just a really fancy term for portals. While Magik has a connection to the demonic dimension of Limbo, that’s optional to you. You can choose whether or not you enter through that place or not, though you hold no special power over it. You can go much further than somebody with Nightcrawler’s powerset, crossing countries and continents instead of short hops of a mile or two. With some work, you can even make these portals connect planets and other celestial bodies. The real kicker’s that these things can be used for time travel as well. It’s wildly inaccurate compared to moving through space, but it’s doable. You might be off by weeks if you’re aiming for a specific date, and it only gets harder to pinpoint times from there."
1184,,500,Silver Streak,Marvel Zombies,Domain,"You can move really, really fast. You have super speed. If we’re quantifying it, you’d be initially capable of running at velocities around Mach 5, and there’s plenty of room to grow. With time and effort, you could double your maximum speed and more. Besides the obvious benefits of such celerity, you can also run on water, up vertical surfaces, and even on air for brief periods of time. Your physiology has adjusted to account for constant, high-speed movement, meaning that you’ve also got the reflexes you need, thoughts accelerated to match your movements, immunity to friction, stronger joints and tendons, a reduced need for oxygen, etc. With some work, you can also learn how to vibrate your molecular structure, allowing you to blow apart most objects you come into contact with. I should warn you - this specific power can cause much, much more problems than most in a zombie apocalypse. Try to use it wisely."
1185,,500,A Hero's Journey,Slay the Princess,Domain,"Regardless of what happens or where we find ourselves, just know that you will always find a path back. Perhaps even to this moment, where you're on a path in the woods staring down the end of all things. But hypothetically speaking, in the event that you find yourself somehow torn across worlds to an alien world or some other time and space, then even if you die (which you most likely will) then you will probably be brought back to restart your journey at the beginning - or at least, moments before your untimely demise arrives.

Now there are probably limits for how many times this can go on for. I say ‘probably’ because even I'm not sure since this is entirely hypothetical and is just me spitballing about the existence of other worlds beyond this one. You could perhaps loop endlessly, constantly cycling between different instances of the same world over and over as you die and repeat. Or maybe it's just arbitrary and eventually culminates in a final crucial moment of do-or-die completionism."
1186,,500,Glacier of War,80s Sword and Sorcery,Illusion,"This is a massive glacier with a castle situated upon a peak at the center. In the castle is a throne which can be used to animate the glacier to the will of the one sitting within it. This animation is fueled by the pilot’s magical power, the more magic they have the longer they can control it and the faster it can move. Alternatively the glacier can simply be expanded, though that will take greater amounts of power than moving it, and the larger it is the more power it will take to move. The High Magic (Transmutation) perk can be used when sitting in the glacier’s throne to reshape the glacier, causing spikes of ice to form to your will, or clearing passages, allowing you more precise control of its shape, or to even generate massive, outcroppings of stone to strike at enemy fortifications like weapons, and will also make moving or expanding the glacier much easier."
1187,,500,Jumper Headquarters ,Black Clover,Domain,"Like the Magic Knight Squads have their own headquarters now so do you, the design of this headquarters is up to you from the material of the floors to the exterior appearance are all subject ot your tastes similar to the Underwater Temple, however the size of your headquarter is indeed limited to equal the size of the Black Bulls headquarters. For an extra 100 CP the size can be doubled allowing you extra room and space for you and anyone else you share the base with. As a last gift the base of your can now shift similar to what Henry is able to with his magic, the exact means is up to you and don’t worry about breaking anything while the base shifts and rooms change you find nothing in them actually breaks."
1188,,500,Flight,Avatar: The Legend Of Korra,Domain,"Normally only achievable by releasing ones earthly tethers, you can achieve the power of flight through sheer willpower alone. You can freely levitate at will and fly at subsonic speeds, you’re highly agile while in the air but strong winds will be able to pull you down or knock you off balance. This technique is so rare that only a single airbender is know to have unlocked it.

1189,,500,Star Power ,Marvel Cinematic Universe - Volume 3,Domain,"You are a special snowflake with absolutely no variants in any timeline or alternate reality. The extradimensional energies coursing through you grant great potential in magic, letting you pick it up quickly, but more importantly they let you open up massive star-shaped portals between universes, timelines, assorted realms of existence and dimensions, or points of space in the same universe. This power also lets you channel your energy into star-shaped cosmic blows that can knock around even apocalyptically powerful witches and sturdy enough to walk off a heavy metal container flung at you because why the hell not. Furthermore these powers are tied to your very existence and can’t be conventionally extracted by the usual mystical methods of this reality."
1190,,500,Dwarven Forge ,Marvel Cinematic Universe - Volume 2,Domain,"There is a place called Nidavellir. A place that has contained a dying neutron star, it was known for creating some of the most powerful weapons to exist in all of the Nine Realms. Forges were heated eternally from the heat of this star, strong enough to kill even the greatest of Asgardians were it not for one of the weapons forged in this very place. The mythical Uru springs from this place, metal that is used in the weapons of the gods. Such a place would cause untold prosperity or ruin depending on who held this place. Mayhaps the dwarves who controlled such a place realized the dangers of only having one, so there is a second structure that has been hidden away in the event Nidavellir was attacked. Maybe call it Myrkheim? Regardless, the heart of a dying star is yours to use in these mythical forges. Great works shall be created in these halls. Terrible, but great. Just don’t get in the way of the focusing lens. It could kill you."
1191,,500,Mental Asylum,Moon Knight,Domain,"Oh no this is not a Mental Asylum. This is a MENTAL Asylum. The mind is a damaged place and while this may take the form of any ordinary Asylum, which you and loyal NPC like nurses and followers will always staff effectively, it can be healed here. Directly. There is a door here that, if you enter while thinking of someone inside the Asylum, you can enter their very mind. It will be a world in line with what they think and hold rooms filled with their past and experiences. With some gentle prying you could possibly help them overcome major traumas... or find perhaps other issues for such a way into someone’s mind."
1192,,500,Griffin Sky,A Certain Magical Index,Domain,"One of Great Britain’s many unmanned mobile fortresses. This particular model resembles a B-2 Spirit, and is red with silver plating. Though it cannot fly nearly as high as an airplane, and is either rather stupid or rather unresponsive (depending on whether it’s on autopilot or someone’s flying it). Despite that, it can damage or destroy the highly enchanted Windsor Castle or a nuclear bomb shelter, and has an automatic mode that adjusts the amount of power to the target it’s attacking. Its main method of attack is that of creating a 20m long lance of its shadow that floats just above the ground and flying it into enemies. Watch out though. If the shadow is taken down and the magical connection is not severed, the fortress will go down as well."
1193,,500,"""Dreg Heap""",Dark Souls 3,Domain,"As the Age of Fire closes and the lands of ancient lords converge, the Dreg Heap at world’s end grows ever onwards. With the oldest lands and cities at the bottom, and the newest at the top, the Dreg Heap is a collection of all that came before it- from the times of Lothric, to Drangleic, all the way back to the time of Lordran and the Ringed City. Picture a pyramid; thinnest at the top, widening steadily until it reaches the base. Now bury that pyramid beneath the earth so that only the tip remains. This is the new Dreg Heap that you have discovered; a subterranean pocket where past, present, and even the future overlap and coalesce, with only the “tip” of the heap peaking out into the normal world. Despite being located beneath the earth the Dreg Heap has a sky; another trick or illusion of time and space as these lands from different times and places converge into one area. This heap is not a physical location in the sense that it can be burrowed into; it may appear as one due to the surface entrance, but the transitory nature of the Dreg Heap makes for a chaotic and unreliable space for anything other than exploration. Exploring this Dreg Heap is dangerous, but potentially highly rewarding. Pristine relics, artifacts from the near future, and other rarities can be found, along with a mountain of dangers from the inhabitants of the Dreg Heap, many of whom have been driven to madness or desperation due to the chaotic nature of their home. Creatures and threats long thought dead or disappeared can also appear in the Dreg Heap, so be warned. Note that the Dreg Heap changes to suit each world, and that in this world it will appear similar to the actual Dreg Heap at world’s end."
1194,,500,"""Deep Cathedral"" ",Dark Souls 3,Domain,"You will find, at the bottom of a deep, dark hole, an abandoned cathedral. This cathedral belongs to you, though it’s definitely seen better days. The large structure is almost entirely made of stone, and has a rather dilapidated form of a standard church's interior lit by perpetual candle light. The structure centers on a massive central room surrounded various smaller halls, passageways, stairways and side rooms tucked off to the sides on various levels, some being quite tricky to find or reach unless you know where to look. The bottom floor of the cathedral and ground outside are covered in a couple feet of standing, stagnant water. This water is the conduit of the Deep Cathedral's power, which mimics the properties of the Deep. In a broad area around the hole the Deep Cathedral is located, the heaviest dregs of the soul will begin to drip away. These dregs will be pulled towards the hole the cathedral is located, allowed to sink into the water and slowly transform it into dark, vile sludge. Touching the transformed waters of the Cathedral will spread a dark corruption similar to the Deep which breeds depravity through one's soul, and increase their affinity to darkness. Those with prolonged exposure over long duration may see themselves transformed into something less than human, or perhaps ""more"".  You will find a similar pit and cathedral with these properties in each Jump, usually near your starting location or hidden just outside of a populated area."
1195,,500,"""Seedbed of Chaos""",Dark Souls 3,Domain,"Though the demons may be on the edge of extinction, this ""seedbed"" has the power to bring them back from the brink. The Seedbed of Chaos is a warehouse addon that takes the form of a large, dome shaped room. The walls and ceiling of the room are covered with white tiles, with giant roots sticking out here and there.  There are for more roots sprouting from the walls near the ground, which is mostly void of the tiles. The ground is mostly made up of blackened soil, with more roots here and there in lesser numbers. There's a massive pool of perpetually molten lava in the center of the room. At the back is the source of the roots, a massive, tangled wooden ""tree thing"" with a large pit at its base. The purpose of the room is obvious, sowing life. When a lifeform (whether person, beast or plant) is buried in the room, an incubation process begins that slowly warps whatever was planted into a kind of demon. If it was buried in the soil to incubate, its default body will warp mostly, like a bat winged demon. If it was left in the lava to incubate, it will transform into a stone or lava based demon. When needing to bury especially large lifeforms, you may climb into the pit in the back of the room, causing your consciousness to transfer into the ""tree"". While possessing the wooden monstrosity, you may manipulate its branches like two massive, strong arms great for digging holes or pulling up large demons from earth or lava. The incubation process may take anywhere from several weeks to a few months depending on how ""thorough"" you want the transformation to be, with a full incubation even warping the soul. Beings of the same race, species, type, etc, will generally turn into the same type of demon, and can propagate this new type of demon species themselves if created in large enough numbers."
1196,,500,"""Firelink Shrine""",Dark Souls 3,Domain,"There have been many Firelink Shrines; representative of those Undead who wish to Link the Fire, the Shrine is a place of rest for wanderers and outcasts of all stripes. Although you may call Firelink Shrine home during this Jump, purchasing this will allow you to take a copy of the Shrine with you into future worlds. A large, temple-like structure, the Firelink Shrine of Lothric features five great thrones meant for the Lords of Cinder as a way to open the way to the First Flame. As a hub for wanderers the inhabitants of the Shrine vary from time to time, but usually you can find a few adventurers, wandering scholars, and travelling merchants here. There is only one individual that is a constant fixture to Firelink Shrine; a Handmaiden, who helps to maintain the space and sells adventuring necessities. Although her wares are limited at the moment, with only basic supplies that can be found in this world available for sale, if you bring her the ash of slain individuals she will increase her wares, selling items related to that person. The ashes of another merchant might expand her stock considerably with all the items they could have sold you, while the ashes of a warrior may allow her to sell their armor and weapons, refitted to better suit you. Her prices are fair, and she’ll even buy unwanted items from you. The Firelink Shrine of this world is a bittersweet place. The spluttering First Flame fades with every passing day until only dark will remain, and with it the Age of Fire finally draws to a close to usher in a new, unseen age."
1197,,500,"""Painting Worlds""",Dark Souls 3,Domain,"Those who aren't ken to fire cannot paint a world. Those absorbed by fire, must not paint a world. You are the sole exception, a painter not ken to flames. Via this perk's purchase, you have acquired the power to create ""Painted Worlds"", though may only sustain one at a time. Any normal canvas works, but your pigments must be laced with your blood and soul before you begin painting. Your brush strokes usually determine the basic scenery, but the emotion and intent behind them will greatly influence the details and world beyond those basics. What was originally depicted will usually be found in the world in some way. The world may be anywhere between the size of a castle to that of a large town, and non-sapient life such as plants and beasts may be born upon the world's creation. These Painted Worlds contain a dark secret though, the fact that they will eventually begin to decay. When the painting begins to decay (usually around five decades after creation, give or take a few years), the world inside will too. Patches of filth and rotten material will randomly begin to grow in the world, corrupting whatever is nearby. Living creatures will grow aggressive and/or diseased, structures and other inanimate objects will warp or crumble and so on. The best and most thorough way to solve the problem is burning the world away and beginning the cycle anew with a new painting. Outside of rot, damage to the painting usually does not translate to the world itself. Even if a strip of the canvas is left, the Painted World will remain whole. That's why to really burn it away, it becomes necessary to do it from the inside. A large vessel found in the core of the world, filled with your blood and set aflame will slowly spread the burn to all else. You as the painter will survive this event, ready to paint anew. If ignored however, the painting will simply decay to the point of crumbling into nothing several decades later. To enter the world, one must simply touch the canvas and be pulled in, landing themselves near the central scenery or structure depicted in the painting. To leave is confusing at first, but there is always a way, and most will know when they've found it. (Extra details in notes)"

Piscine yet humanoid, eternally rotting yet preserved, whether another demigod shared Godwyn’s tragic fate or some strange aberration once naturally looked like this it appears there is now a second font of Destined Death equal to the original one spreading Death Blight throughout the Lands Between. Soon, deathroot will be seeded across the land. The dead shall rise twice as fast and surely as they originally had, whether as rotting corpses, ghosts or stranger things and in time may amalgamate or alter into things barely resembling the living they once were. This place is itself sacred to the mystic forces of death in this land, empowering your death-based magic greatly; even a dragon of this world could be corrupted in mind and nature by the intensity of the rot here, and this would be a fine place to enact rites like contemplating the dreams of a long-dead demigod in order to embed the principle of life within death back into the Golden Order. By the same token however, there is no place that Those Who Live In Death and similar undead beings would feel nourished both mystically and spiritually. There is no greater horror to be levied against the Golden Order, but perhaps that is your intent after all.

In future worlds, if you wish not to unleash plagues of undeath you may choose for this to be confined as a property behind a door of damp, mouldy wood in your Warehouse."
1199,,500,Golden Haligtree ,Elden Ring,Domain,"Though watered with Miquella’s own blood since it was a sapling, the Haligtree ultimately failed to grow into an Erdtree. It seems that whether by his own hand or another’s there was at least one other attempt that has ended in a different form of failure: For whatever reason, despite having but a fraction of its parent’s power it has decided you are it’s “Elden Lord”. Easily the size and scale of the Haligtree itself, it also boasts a vitality and robust health beyond even that of its parent. Blessings rain down from its boughs like leaves as you will it-everything associated with the Erdtree it can recreate, from crystal tears to Sites of Grace to the many weapons, armour and talismans forged from its wood. And while it has not done so to date, it can begin producing a standing force of Erdtree avatars-perhaps a few dozen at the most, along with a couple hundred skilled human-scale defenders similar to those that yet guard the Erdtree itself. A ring of light oversees it-not quite the solid Elden Ring but resembling the circles invoked when incantations display the Laws of Regression and Causality-greatly strengthening any holy powers like Golden Order incantations you possess, while severely weakening those in opposition to you. And finally, it has even produced its own first Finger. Smaller than it’s kindred, it is less ravaged and eager to please you. 

It has also produced a fancy, comfortable throne for you to sit on. You may not be an actual Elden Lord yet, and certainly no Empyrean with this alone, but it certainly feels like it in many ways."
1200,,500,Eternal Refuge,Elden Ring,Domain,"Hidden from the blinding glare of the Golden Order is a sanctuary city once inhabited by those who shunned it’s crushing decrees. The wondrous stars of a sky unseen in the world above shine brilliantly in this darkness. Far below, the stately walkways and haunting long-abandoned stone fortresses house many wonders such as silvery mimics, weapons and armour forged of that selfsame quicksilver material made solid, larval tears greatly valued by those with an interest in rebirth magic and libraries recording much knowledge from those that sought the wisdom of the Dark Moon. The few hundred recluses here, be they Nox, Numen or Nokrom survivors, are well- versed in subterfuge as well as violence and the mystic arts. It seems you are the highest remaining authority recognised in this place, for whether your standing is recognised as that of royalty, a commander, a champion or something else those remaining here heed your commands and most of the dangers within are directed not to attack you. Even the handful of Dragonkin Soldiers still dwelling in misery here are your guardians, not dangers as they are to all other intruders. Who can say what befell this most reclusive of the Eternal City was? Apart, perhaps, from you."
1201,,500,Seat of the Storm,Elden Ring,Domain,"The dragons, though mighty, are long parted from their ruined city. But whether you ruled it in times long past or it was somehow bound to your keeping, you now have a special bond with a great ruined city every inch the equal of Crumbling Farum Azula. With a mild effort of meditation you may bring yourself and any near you as well as willing to it. The stately granite walls, labyrinthine hallways and depictions of dragons all seem to be crumbling eternally-yet never quite fade away entirely, though the raging, ever-distant winds that suspend this ruin out of time afford it tremendous protection from the outside world. Scattered within can be found various treasures from this world’s early days: Piles of ancient dragon smithing stones, relics and manuals that can teach one to channel the power of forbidden forces such the fighting arts of beasts or talismans from the time when dragons rule among other things from before the Golden Order’s rise. There is little unity or organisation among the few hundred or so denizens dwelling here save this: They are all counted among those banished by the Golden Order and yet possessing the might to survive it’s enforcers-be they remnants of the Godskin cult, beastfolk skilled in their ancient arts, strange abominations of this land or forlorn dragons. And they all acknowledge you as their ruler, perhaps their guardian should your might be great enough. The resources are rich but rather disorganised, though there is one more reason to come here: Should any dare come to you with violent intent or approach you against your will, the very storm around you will rage against them. Violent winds striving to throw them off balance, clouds darkening the sky and bolts of lightning from on high striving to smite your foes. You may only be a king of rubble in the end, but the wind remains your most loyal subject.

The city comes with a grand stone throne. While comfortable as stone can be, it’s always sized to fit any shape you wear from a form attained from this jump."
1202,,500,Refuge of the Ancient Dragons,Elden Ring,Domain,"While in the present even the dragons that once struck a true with the Empire fight any Tarnished on sight, somehow or another you have struck a compact with one particular colony. It consists of a couple hundred lesser dragons, dozens of large dragons, half a dozen or so legendary status such as Fortissax and one very large, very tired mother dragon similar to Greyroll. They dwell in an isolated, craggy region and care little for the battle of gods and men-though as a friend, they are willing to lend you aid and support in battle. Dragons are proud and noble beings with great knowledge of both history and magic as well as immense combat experience, as well as being large flying (generally) firebreathing reptiles also capable of wielding red lightning. It’s safe to say that this colony alone makes you a more formidable force to be reckoned with than any remaining bastion of Marika’s realm.

In future worlds, the dragons follow you living in a mountainous region very similar to their ancestral home-which may become a Warehouse attachment."
1203,,500,Kiln of the Fell and Frenzied Flame ,Elden Ring,Domain,"The Frenzied Flame, the fire of the giants’ fell god, resides in a great earthen basin fit to contain all the fury (which can become a Warehouse attachment with a fireproof door). It is the embodiment of all-destroying, life-purging annihilation-it’s violent eruptions seeming like hangs grasping to extinguish all there is and ever will be, the roar of its molten fury almost like the screams of the damned. Why would you want this? Well, it seems the dread force behind the flame has offered you a compact of its own. Take its power, draw on it and shape it as you like, BURN away the dross of the multiverse on your travels. You shall not be compelled to become the Lord of Frenzied Flame, it’s maddening touch will be greatly mitigated in you-and all sorceries and incantations that draw on flame will be greatly empowered by the fire you can draw into yourself from this font of chaos. Greater rewards await those who are willing to risk more. The power to burn down, say, a barrier erected by another god would be maddening indeed-but never irrevocably so, and can you truly overlook the power on offer?"
1204,,500,Escort for the Innocent Dead ,Peter Pan,Domain,"It’s said that Peter Pan will travel part of the way with children who have died so they do not become lonely and scared at the new adventure. You can now find the ghosts and spirits of deceased children (and sometimes those who stay young at heart) and guide them to the next life. You can also interact with them, as they often have interesting stories. If you do not wish to take them to the afterlife(s) immediately, they’re often willing to chat and join you on adventures, assuming you treat them nicely. You also instinctively know how to safely guide them past the intermediate state of ghosts; for instance, you know how to ensure that they get past the often-grim obstacles on the path to the afterlife, and if reincarnation is a possibility you know how to ensure that they get set up with a good new life in store for them.
"
1205,,500,Never Tree ,Peter Pan,Domain,"You now own your own Never Tree, just like the one in and above the Home Under the Ground. Multiple, seemingly normal trees appear on the surface, but they are in fact the “branches” of the tree. Each branch will continue to grow like a normal tree, but the inside of the branch is in fact hollow. In fact, if you measure a certain individual, you can make one of the trunk-branches’ hollow interior just the right size for that person to slip through (any bigger, though, and you’d get stuck). Slip into one of the tree hollows, and you will end up in an underground hideout that encompasses the trunk and the roots. The roots are exceptionally hardy, and can thrive in any location. The roots grow systematically throughout the day, and regenerate all damage. Therefore, you can cut off a table in the morning, slap it on the regrown roots at noon for lunch, and then saw it up again to make room for playing. In any case, you’ll never be low on firewood. Giant mushrooms also grow inside for handy seats and occasional seasoning. If you took Mother Knows Best, you can refurbish and expand the interior “home underground” as you wish. After the jump, it will grow in your warehouse, and you can plant cuttings in future jumps.
"
1206,,500,Jolly Roger ,Peter Pan,Domain,"Your own copy of Hook’s own Jolly Roger, a magnificent galleon armed to the brim for piracy. It has been enchanted with fairy dust, and can be made to fly through the air and through space without the passengers being harmed. If you purchased the Long Tom item, you now own a dozen of the cannons arrayed on the port and starboard sides, each with the special properties the singular item has.
"
1207,,500,Seven League Boots ,Peter Pan,Domain,"These mystical boots change their size to fit the wearer, and grant the subject the ability to jump through the sky almost as if you were flying. Moreover, the boots “grant wishes” through a minor boost to your skills to meet your desires, whether it’s the know-how to make furniture fit for a king or the skill to set a trysail properly like a trained navy man. That said, unless you learn the skills on your own, they will be lost once you shed the boots. Moreover, the enhancements from the boots do not make you perfect, so don’t rely on them to win your battles for you.
"
1208,,500,Truant Seconds Hand ,Ib,Domain,"A bizarre and rather unsettling clock artwork that determines the time in the room, specifically whether it is “day” or “night” depending on the position of the hands. When it is “day,” the floor that the clock is in is bright and sunny. When it is “night,” the area is dark. The time on the clock never changes on its own accord, meaning that it will remain permanently day or night in the room and building until you either switch the hands or turn off the clock. Other artworks in the area will change in title and appearance to match the setting. If certain beings are affected by night or day, they face similar effects now; for instance, breeds of vampires that can only come out between dusk and dawn would suffer as if it had suddenly become the middle of the day, or vice versa could be active within the area’s effect even if it is really daytime. The switch between “day” and “night” only occurs within the building, and does not affect the time of the outside world."
1209,,600,The Ark ,Shin Megami Tensei II,Domain,"Long ago, mankind was cast out of Paradise for its sin against their Creator, yet promised a Thousand Year Kingdom for those who had proved themselves worthy of redemption while the rest would be cast screaming into hell. This is the culmination of that promise – a pyramid-shaped megastructure with a vast garden within. Inside this Ark is all a human needs to live comfortably: food, shelter, peace of mind and sanctity of spirit. Those who willingly choose to live within this paradise will find all doubt steadily erased from their minds as they live in blissful obedience to whatever cause you have preached to them, becoming your chosen Saints in this garden of Heaven. You may toggle this effect off, if desired, but this structure can comfortably house as many who choose to live within it...or those you choose to save.

However, this is only one half of its purpose. It is not just a shield for the faithful, but a sword for the wicked. The Ark can be launched into space and still exist comfortably in a low Earth orbit so that it may fulfill its true purpose: Wiping the world clean of the unworthy. From a laser at its tip called the Megiddo Ark, the Ark can fire at the surface of an Earth-sized planet and wipe out all life in a single stroke. Seeded within its ashes will be the what will become a new Heaven a world with a similar environment to the Ark for your chosen people to settle. At last, Paradise has been won."
1210,,600,Labyrinth Wall,Duel Monsters – The Shadow Realm,Domain,"Traps and minions are wonderful ways of defending your dungeons, but what if the dungeon could defend itself? The walls have a will, or...at least they can, with your touch. By placing certain magical reagents into the foundations and stone of a building, you can animate it to shift and change shape, not enough to kill a person on it’s own...but it could trap and redirect others into dead ends indefinitely. A rule of thumb is that every wall it removes it has to add somewhere else, and vice versa: creating a wall requires it to create an opening somewhere else within its halls. This even allows it to arrange traps at will! Of course, if that wasn’t enough...you can also bind a monster as a guardian within it, a “Wall Shadow” that can move across the surfaces of the dungeon animated with this perk’s ability and attack from any angle! It’s a dungeon that guards its own treasure, what more could you ask?"
1211,,600,The Tower,Kate Daniel ,Domain,You get a tower that will follow you to other jumps. It will be the tallest building in the area it appears in. This tower will work as a center of operation. It works as a battery for any energy you possess and can use that power to broadcast any effect you can produce over the area you can see from the top of the tower. The more powerful and wider the reach the more power-consuming. Can hold enough energy to protect from a god-level threat that will assault the tower for 24 hours straight. The power is provided by the jumper in some way.
1212,,600,Ancient Turtle,Kate Daniel ,Domain,"You have access to an island turtle that has a cottage on its back. The turtle can be entered and survived if done so the conversations within the turtle will be kept private due to the innate magic of the turtle. The cottage comes with a flying pestle and mortar. The cottage is also capable of moving itself due to its chicken legs. The cottage is a magical workshop and amplifier for things like potions, curses, and blessings."
1213,,600,Family of Monsters,Kate Daniel ,Domain,"You were born a monster to a family of monsters. Your family has greater magical ability and capacity than most people. Your line is so pure that you can control your blood to make it into blades and armor. Your line is so long it remembers the first language and as an extension, you may learn it easier than most. Your lineage is one of the kings. You can claim land for as long as there are no powers that have made a covenant with the earth. If there is, you just need to destroy them.

To claim land you have a ritual that lets you claim all the land that the light touches. The magical spear of bloody light that is. This is best done on a high vantage point like a mountain or a tower. This gives you the ability to use the magic of every living being that lives on your land but this is forbidden for your role is to protect not take. You may channel power to the earth you have claimed to invigorate it. And as a side benefit, it will make you magically charismatic for as long as you are channeling your power. 

There is one downside to this: the shar it is a magical compulsion that will drive you to claim more land and provoke you to conflict with any being that has claimed land nearby.

Boosted: You are ageless and can change your apparent age to anything. Your claim will now override and overpower any other claim of being equal to you. Oh yes and for burning claims that are usurped because your land does not just gain in power when you give it the power it will grow you claim more the power the more the claim grows. This also grows your capacity massively.

1214,,600,Shang Tsung’s Island,MORTAL KOMBAT 9-10,Domain,"This island belongs to Shang Tsung! ...or does it? It seems that there’s been a bit of a mix-up, and the host of the Mortal Kombat tournament is now you. This would surely be ripe for exploitation, if you wished for things to go one way or another. The island itself is very large, and has a courtyard for fighting in, a garden, as well as a palatial fortress with a throne room. Although Shang Tsung has moved his prized Flesh Pits away from this place, in anticipation of you taking it over, the island’s most notable feature remains- namely, it serves to connect Earthrealm and Outworld. In any world you go to, travel between other dimensions will be possible from this place (so long as both dimensions have suitable amounts of water for the island to appear in) just by willing it to appear in both at the same time. The island will also retain any modifications you’ve done to it."
1215,,600,MORTAL KOMBAT!,MORTAL KOMBAT 9-10,Domain,"The Elder Gods have smiled upon you, wanderer, and have given you the authority to host your own Mortal Kombat tournaments. The rules for the Mortal Kombat tournament can be found above, and they are much the same. The Tournament can be invoked once per Jump, unless it takes place over a long period of time, in which case it can be invoked once per generation. You will also gain the ability to merge other Realms together; a Realm being a dimension that holds only one planet, or one planet in a dimension (planets in the same dimension cannot be merged). You may do this freely for dimensions that belong to you, but the dimensions of others can only be won through Mortal Kombat. Only one victory is needed for you to merge dimensions, but failure on your part to uphold the rules of Mortal Kombat will render the Tournament null. "
1216,,600,My Mind is the Maze,Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous,Domain,"The lessons of a Demon Lord. A realisation of one of the laws of reality, allowing you to change the fundamental fabric of existence in a specific way. This is the understanding that a prison or maze is only such because you believe it to be. Once you broke free of that truth, it gave you power over such things. Not only can no prison or maze hold you, unlocking or revealing their true path to you, but you can take them for yourself with ease. 

A fortress that imprisons you deep within can be easily conquered from within. Prison guards attempting to stop your revolt find themselves fighting against fate, as if you coming to rule your prison is just the natural way of things. Even mazes of a magical nature can be forcefully taken, placed under your own control as all its’ functions are cut off from the hand of the original master. Even on the least scale, such as spells made to bind your movement or manacles clapped around your wrists, you can easily escape and turn these things on your would-be jailers. You have the freedom of movement to never be held down again."
1217,,600,The Inverted Castle,Castlevania - Symphony of the Night,Domain,"Castlevania is a thing of chaos. More of an idea than a true structure, and heavily dependent upon Dracula to define its shape and give it form. And in a truly unusual turn of events, present twice upon this darkest of nights. You have been given a strange thing, a small translucent model of the castle. When placed somewhere in a structure, it will merge with it for the duration of the jump and will spawn a second copy of the place floating above the original place. Inverted, of course. This place has all the amenities as the original - the laboratories are just as well stocked, the libraries contain just as much lost and forgotten lore, the bedrooms are just as lavish... they’re simply all upside down. Still, if you can work past that then you’ll find that they are in fact better than the originals. Optionally, this place may be invisible to anyone not actually inside of it. Obviously this is meant to be paired with a castle, but you will need to acquire one of those elsewhere."
1218,,600,Soldiers Rest,Castlevania - Symphony of the Night,Domain,"After the era of Trevor Belmont, Alucard put himself into a deep sleep, hopefully never to wake and trouble the world with his cursed bloodline. Sadly, it was not to be and the dhampir is now awake and about once more. Though you are probably not his equal, it seems you have a similar setup prepared, either by the church or by your own hands. A small castle sunken into the ground and hidden beneath a small village, containing a vampire’s coffin - or similar sleeping arrangements, should you be neither vampire nor dhampir - that will allow you to sleep for an eternity if you so desire. Conditions may be set into the mechanisms, awakening you should worst come to pass such as Castlevania’s appearance or Dracula’s rebirth, and a small armory containing a sword, a shield, and a mail of exceptional quality along with other minor things serves both to keep such things out of the hands of prying mortals and to prepare you for battle when the time comes."
1219,,600,How In God's Name?,Castlevania - Symphony of the Night,Domain,"Maria Renard, by any metric you plan to measure her by, has a tendency to be just a little bit absurd. As a young girl, she was able to fight on par with experienced vampire hunters, mowing her way through an army of night creatures with the help of her familiars. Having grown up and acquired even more skill... Well, you get the idea. More specifically, Maria has always been more mobile than her contemporaries, and has even learned to use her animal companions to enhance her mobility even further. But that’s not what you’re here for. While a Belmont would focus on learning to move more effectively, you have learned to move more strangely. With nothing but grit, a dash of skill, and a bit of luck, you can pass through openings that you’d normally need to be able to turn into mist to pass through, or walk down hallways absolutely covered in spikes and other traps and somehow miss every single one of them. To be clear, this isn’t a specific technique, but rather an unnerving ability for you to end up in places that straight up aren’t physically possible for you to reach."
1220,,600,Mithril Mines and Armory,The Lord of the Rings - Twilight of the North,Domain,"There may be older and fouler things than Orcs in the deep places of the world, but there are great treasures and opportunities to be found in those places as well. Dwarven miners know this, and the lure of mithril often proves irresistible. With this, you need not worry about the presence of any Balrog or Orcs, as your veins of mithril shall lie within a mine dropped into a location near to where you start or even just connected to your Warehouse. The great quantities of mithril that these mines make available allow Dwarf-smiths, should you have invited any, to craft marvellously strong and light armor for your warriors or yourself.

More than simply a store-room and workshop for Dwarven smiths, a Mithril Armory is capable of outfitting an entire host in the most supple and strong metal known in Middle-earth. The presence of such materials naturally attracts the finest Dwarven smiths, who may also turn their efforts to forging superior weapons in addition to crafting mithril armor. Armored and armed in shining mithril and dwarf-make weapons, your forces are certain to be fearsome indeed on the battlefield. In future jumps, you will attract whatever setting equivalent to the Dwarves there happens to be. To find work in your armory and lands."
1221,,600,Merkaba,Anima Ark Of Sinners,Domain,The complex within which The Clock is housed. You possess a replica that you may separate from the physical world at will as it shall exist outside regular time. You cannot be reached without your consent when within Merkaba.
1222,,600,Power of Belief,American Gods,Domain,"Welp! So this is really not supposed to work this way. But somehow, due to something with you, it is! You have the power to make your beliefs manifest on the world around you, in a very real way.

Simply by thinking about something, by focusing on it, you can make things happen, change the world around you. This can range from simple things to the stronger ones, and effects both broad and intricate. You could make it snow just by thinking of it really hard, and in time you could rewrite memories by willing it.

Now before you run off claiming to have won everything, a few ground rules. The way this works is that there is a place you can reach with your mind, a place where dreams and reality meet and the effects in one reach the other. And it takes effort to make workings there. Everything you do depends on your willpower and imagination. The only effects you can cause are ones you can actually envision, so unless you can actually see how space would warp or time reverse...

Another concern is mental fatigue. Everything causes a degree of it, and bigger and/or more complex it is, the more it takes from you. Something like causing out-of-season snowing or modifying one man’s memory is pretty easy, but it scales from there."
1223,,600,First Nome,Kane Chronicles,Domain,"The First Nome in Egypt is the oldest and most impressive in the entire House of Life. It has the most extensive library, the largest collection of artifacts, the most members, and the most overall resources. It also hosts the Hall of Ages and the (currently empty) throne of the pharaoh. Now you can bring it with you, importing it into each new setting. As a bonus, the Nome’s membership will include magicians from past and future worlds you’ve visited, its library will include books of other magic systems, and its vaults will include artifacts from the same. The Hall of Ages will detail the history of whatever world it is currently in, with side corridors providing less detailed accounts of former worlds."
1224,,600,Old Foes Made New Again,Castlevania - Order of Ecclesia,Domain,"Hidden away in your warehouse somewhere, lies a large blue doorway with a red gemstone embedded in it’s center. Touching the jewel would see it fade away and the door open, revealing a small waiting room of some kind with several copies of smaller versions of that same gateway waiting to be opened. Behind each one of them lies a number of foes from your past, set into a series of trials and tests of might. Each pathway contains a set of foes, such as a number of powerful monsters found in the area surrounding Castlevania in one, and all the monsters - including Dracula - inside the castle in another. You will not grow here, your skills will not sharpen and your body will not grow stronger. Instead, you are judged. Graded, almost, with a reward awaiting you depending how quickly you pass through the trial. Depending on your score, you will receive a prize. A powerful sword, a unique piece of armor, an accessory with a useful trait, or should you exhaust the list of prizes or perform poorly, an ordinary potion. Dying inside this area does not count, and will see you barred entry for a year and a day."
1225,,600,Exalted of Decay,Warhammer 40K: The Warp ,Domain,"Like Ku’gath, who is the ultimate disease given flesh, you are Nurgle’s greatest expression of decay and stagnation. You are very literally a walking wasteland, carrying the rot of ages with you. Fetid, corroding water rushes from your body and rains for many miles around you, as your body spawns uncountable numbers of carrion plants and animals that spread like locusts. Structures, buildings and the landscape itself break down into ruins and rubble within this area. A thick miasma surrounds your person, where visibility for your enemies is reduced to a scant few metres and movement is slowed to a crawl while their strength, flesh, mind and spirit are gradually consumed by you. Lastly, your powers and abilities are strengthened within this wasteland. This power can be toggled on and off at will by you, so as not to damage anything you do not wish to see ruined.

1229,,600,Deathtrap Of A Castle,Castlevania - Lament of Innocence,Domain,"Any sane mane would refuse to live here. Any sane man must not include you, because you built it in the first place. This castle is not so much a place for you to live as it is a place for you to be entertained. Every hallway, every room, every ledge, every single square foot of land in this place with the singular exception of the throne room is trapped in such a manner that practically defies belief simply from how many there are. Doors when closed automatically trigger summoning rituals, monsters from ancient myth are imprisoned in dark corners just waiting for foolish hunters to stumble across them, and the path to the throne room is long and winding to the point that you'd swear you walked every foot of this place twice in order to get there. At least, for anyone but you, for whom the castle warps and twists to keep safe. In addition, a powerful scrying spell is woven into the throne, allowing you to amuse yourself with antics of potential contestants - I mean, invaders, who would seek to lay you low.

If you possess both Deathtrap Of A Castle and Failed Philosopher’s Stone, you may also activate a barrier that extends out as far as the eternal night caused by the Stone. This will prevent anyone who does not have permission to leave from doing so. No sneaking in and out, they must play the game properly."
1230,,600,Bernhard Family Crypt,Castlevania - Lament of Innocence,Domain,"Truth be told, none of the people buried here are related to you at all, with one possible exception - if you were turned into a vampire by Walter, then most of the women here would be your sisters, and the rest your in-laws. This tomb contains the skeletons, personal effects, and whatever remained of all those taken by Bernhard to serve as bait in his twisted game, as well as those who came to save them and died in the halls of his castle. Each and every coffin is also engraved with runes that serve as the focus of a necromantic ritual - each and every one of your sisters is ready and waiting to be raised from the dead, an emergency option for if someone should get the bright idea to raise an army to attack your 'father'. Additional rituals to raise their lovers as your slaves also exist, but would take a bit more effort to actually use. A good sacrifice of someone fairly pure would probably be enough to bring back one of the stronger knights, maybe two or three of the more common ones. Your 'father' must trust you an awful lot, if he's giving you control of this."

All Dethroned can create a Fortress of Regrets: A network of Laments, each a surreal segment of the Dark World dedicated to reliving their regrets and misery all over again anywhere between the size of a shed and a suburb, symbolically resembling the emotional connections between memories. But so deep runs the taint of Darkness in you, that you have a terrible and unprecedented power: The ability to manifest the Dark World, and the Darkness with it, into other realities by raw power. With a great surge of the Shadows in your soul, you can manifest individual Laments and eventually your entire Fortress into other worlds. Though the effort is great, it offers a bleak miracle: The power to focus and unleash the Darkness’ corruption from your outpost. Innocent lives will darken, succumb to vice and eventually hatch true Darkspawn with an instinctive fear of you as the harbinger of the end.

The air will fill with cloying corruption, and the water will carry Taint for as far as it flows. The sheer suffering you unleash will surely nourish you for all the lives you ruin with your solipsistic nightmare made manifest, and without truly heroic efforts in turn you could taint the world so much it slowly grows the Dark World by worsening the world until it casts Nightscapes: Extradimensional realms where all has fallen to freezing ruin and desolation, echoing the bleak future the Darkness would want to bring about if it could want anything. And while the Darkness knows no gratitude, you’ll find yourself gifted with a similar capacity to bend and sculpt other lands or realms of existence defined by dark forces into landscapes mirroring your tormented thoughts and compelled to re-enact your downfall endlessly-until they are indistinguishable from your original Fortress, and equally blighted by the touch of Darkness."
1232,,600,Dimensional Travel,Hyperdimension Neptunia,Domain,"There are many dimensions in existence, and each is so great, how could you not want to visit them all? By expending an amount of power equivalent to that used in a mid-sized city, you can banish someone randomly through the dimensions, including yourself if you wish. This is easier if you have an anchor however, and with one, you can form temporary or permanent portals from one dimension to the next by expending ten or a hundred times as much energy respectively."
1233,,600,Time Watchers,Castlevania - Judgment,Domain,"Welcome back, fellow wanderer. This little corner of never was and never will be, known to some as the infinite corridor, is a meeting place of sorts for those who wander and watch. It's not exactly our home, but if you ever have a need of my aid then this place can be used to reach me, among a few other individuals of note. I would not call us an organization, we are more like a group of like minded individuals who are all too aware of the consequences of meddling, but our little team can be surprisingly effective when time is short. Additionally, should there be any other wanders of time, this place may be used to grab their attention and hold a private conversation in a place where no ears could possibly listen."
1234,,600,Requiem Of The 13th Hour,Castlevania - Judgment,Domain,"Time’s flow cannot be stopped, not by man or vampire. But... Some people, like you and me, can step aside and allow it to pass us by, if only for a time. My final lesson to you, should you choose to attend, is how to do just that. All my previous lessons hinge on this one, that you possess the ability to control time. By the time I’m through with you, simple things like speeding or slowing your own personal time shall come to you as easy as breathing, and even stopping it outright without the aid of Saint Germain’s Pocket Watch will be within your grasp. Becoming a full wanderer like myself or the count will require something more than this, a rift of your own in all likelihood, but manipulating such a space or who gets dragged into it is no great trial for me - and shortly, it won’t be one for you either."
1235,,600,Blockade of Valhalla,Valkyrie Anatomia,Domain,"Even a God, seemingly almighty as they may be, cannot defeat every foe that faces them, should they all array their might against you. As such, you have gained the knowledge of how to seal off an entire kingdom from the rest of the world. This works both ways; you yourself will be unable to access the rest of the world once you raise the Blockade. This may only be done once per ten years and may last for as long as you or a single item can maintain it. It cannot be held forever though, and the larger a territory you seal away, the more energy it requires. For reference, Odin, utilising Gungnir, one of the Four Treasures which maintain balance in the world, was only able to seal Valhalla for three years. Suitably world ending events, such as Ragnarok will forcibly end this power."
1236,,600,Shrine Battle Fortress,Touhou Luna Nights,Domain,"You have a floating pseudo-fortress containing a pair of yin-yang orbs in heavily stylized sessha, which you can fight from the main “shrine”. It can summon small teleportation holes, enabling you to redirect your ranged attacks into unexpected directions, summon special ofuda shields that can block a single attack each, and shoot out lightning bolts and fireballs."
1237,,600,Luna Dial,Touhou Luna Nights,Domain,"You have a small power over time itself. You can freeze time for everything except yourself, starting at sixty seconds maximum, requiring another sixty seconds to fully recharge, and you can improve this maximum with practice. Be warned that using special abilities and even attacking will eat away at your available time stopped quickly. This does freeze water too so be careful not to trap yourself underwater. It also freezes anything about half a second after it leaves your body; you can exploit this to throw items and create frozen platforms for you to climb. Alternatively, you can simply greatly slow down time for everything else for about ten seconds (again, you can increase this number), turning you into a flashing blur from the perspective of the world around you."
1238,,600,Uchrono Hourglass ,Disney’s American Dragon: Jake Long,Domain,A device capable of traveling back in time. Be careful to not mess with your own personal history. While you have a chance to fix things the Hourglass only has so much sand. Once it runs out it will send you back to the present. Assuming you didn’t do something that would stop you from being born of course.
1239,,600,Interdimensional Portal,Amphibia,Domain,"First developed by Dr. Frakes to replicate the effect of the Calamity Box, she eventually managed to gaze into several dimensions, but, due to the enormous energy requirement to open the portal, Frakes couldn’t maintain the portal for more than 5 seconds. Now your version may connect to any dimension within a setting, the coordinates can be adjusted via sound. Your portals can stay open indefinitely and can be powered by magic."
1240,,600,Calamity Box,Amphibia,Domain,"This music box is embedded with three gems, while their calamity powers have been removed and will not be restored until post spark, you can use the box to travel between local dimensions within a jump."
1241,,600,Horizon Realm ,Mage: The Ascension,Domain,"Many Mages have pocket realms on the Horizon of the Near Umbra. This worlds are fueled by Nodes back on Earth and serve as bases of operation. You have a Horizon Realm of your own design, as large as Horizon itself, the main Realm of the Nine Traditions. It’s the size of a small country, takes whatever form you decide, and empowers certain Spheres of magick that you choose. Plus it has a few advantages no other Realm can boast. It needs no Quintessence to remain functional, meaning it needs no Nodes. Gateways to it are also immune to interference, so when the Avatar Storm/Dimensional Anomaly hits you’ll still be able to use your Horizon Realm as well as ever.

If you bought Deus Ex Machina above you can even install your god as the god of the Realm, giving it substantial control just as the Computer has over Autochthonia."
1242,,600,Caul,Mage: The Ascension,Domain,"A Caul is a place where mages are corrupted into Nephandi. Anyone shoved into here will be corrupted into wanting to destroy the world. But perhaps you’d like a Caul devoted to one of the other Essences than Primordial? A Caul of Stasis would process someone into a Technocrat. They’d be devoted to maintaining Static reality and their powers would begin to manifest in ways that are non-damaging to reality. A Dynamic Caul would make someone into a Marauder, giving them an insanity that warps to force them to break apart Static reality and making their powers run out of control, always warping the world around them while also protecting them from reality’s attempts to defend itself. And a Questing Caul would undo the transformation into a Nephandi or Marauder or similar states of corruption while freeing the subject from any brainwashing or mind control, restoring their free will fully and fixing their powers. And it’s not just mages who this special Caul can corrupt: any kind of person or creature is susceptible to them, though the more powerful they are the more time it will take and the greater the chance they can break out or be rescued."
1243,,600,Clap Your Hands If You Don’t Believe In Fairies,Mage: The Ascension,Domain,"The Technocracy’s strategy to protect the Masses is to eliminate chaotic, dangerous, and uncontrollable elements through removing belief in them from the Consensus. Unfortunately, not everything works that way. Vampires, werewolves, and demons can kill you just as easily no matter how much you insist they aren’t real. But you can finally fulfill the Order of Reason’s dream of a safe world ruled by humanity. When you work to help keep a group of hidden creatures, cutting edge technology, or secret powers from the public eye, they will find themselves suddenly subjected to the force of Paradox. Using their powers in ways that flout the local Consensus, especially in front of mundane witnesses, will cause a backlash just as Traditionalists have to deal with. After a few years of this, the world itself will begin to reject them. They will be pushed into another dimension if possible, only able to survive  on a planet ruled by your Consensus through the expenditure of vast amounts of supernatural energy, much like the Bygones. If not, they will be ground down and transformed into the closest equivalent to available in your Consensus, similar to how Banality will transform a Changeling into a mortal. You may selectively enforce this on certain kinds of Reality Deviants, such as getting rid of vampires and werewolves while leaving a conspiracy of super science cyborgs alone and able to keep operating. Only by coming into the light and convincing society of their existence can they escape this effect."
1244,,600,I Reject Your Reality,Mage: The Ascension,Domain,"The Consensus determines what magick is coincidental and what is vulgar. But no one can tell the Mad what is real. Choose a delusion for yourself. Maybe everything is the same as the modern world except that everyone uses the metric system. Maybe you believe you’re a swords and sorcery tech-barbarian in the postapoclyptic dinosaur filled ruins of Manhattan. Or you could think that you’re a superhero in a crime filled city. Though you aren’t a real Marauder and so don’t actually believe it, magick that adheres to this theme in the area around you is coincidental while anything that openly violates it is vulgar.

But as your magickal talent grows, your vision of the world will overwrite reality more and more. As you learn the Matter Sphere, the world around you will twist, with the Life Sphere causing living things to change, all transformed into equivalents to themselves that fit with the theme of your personal reality. Mind will change memories and even esoteric Spheres like Entropy could make certain patterns of behavior more or less successful. People who enter your reality bubble will find these changes totally normal and only other mages will know that things had ever been different. Things will change back to the way they were as you move away. For example, if your reality bubble is based on the Mahabharata and you go to an army base, the soldiers may become ancient Pandava soldiers armed with bows and chariots and an exploding nuclear bomb may become a divine Astra. As you leave, they will turn back to radioactive corpses of modern soldiers. You may turn this bubble on or off as you wish."
1245,,600,Portal to Inferno,Cereza and the Stray Demon,Domain,"THERE it is! The blasted hole you’ve been looking for, back to Hell sweet Hell. Actually, this one is oddly stable and portable, disappearing and reappearing at your will. Within lies the terrible hellscape of Inferno, replete with terrifying demons and damned souls. All the bounties of Hell are yours for the taking...if you’re willing to brave it’s literally infernal power struggles and unnatural hazards. A skilled smith could make weapons of incredible power with such beasts beaten into submission-or in a pinch, even from their body parts. Leave it open enough and more powerful demons might notice. Perhaps one would be willing to make a contract for their freedom. Then again, without considerable strength yourself it is far more likely one would try to battle you in the hopes of securing the portal for themselves."
1246,,600,Shard of Avalon,Cereza and the Stray Demon,Domain,"A grand work of the fairies is now under your total dominion, one that represents the total effort of their greatest luminaries in the kingdom’s heyday. It could be an industrial marvel like Puca’s own fortress, a mighty bulwark with all manner of magitech within, energy cores and production lines for artifice as well as stellar sanctums where the magic of the fairies is strong. Or like the Sunkissed Lake, it could be a grand illusion of nature that you can freely move through while enjoying all the benefits of a day at the beach. Regardless of its form, the construct is something that can either lead or withstand a grand war among fairies. Not least because of the inhabitants: A massive kingdom of fairies dearly loyal to you as their rightful king, perhaps an eighth of Puca’s own kingdom. These largely consist of typical fairies, small bumbling creatures an Umbran child could defeat with the help of a demon, but it also has quite a few fairies that have distinguished themselves in some way beneficial to the kingdom. And perhaps one or two of almost human seeming, and power considerable enough to contend with Umbran witches of great power

If you purchased the Garden of Avalon item, you may combine the two. With your forces so concentrated, it may be possible to cast a similar barrier as the one protecting Avalon Forest from impure humans."
1247,,600,Emperor's Castle,The Owl House V1,Domain,"Fifty years prior to the events of the series, the human witch hunter, Philip Wittebane, utilizing the persona of Emperor Belos, took control of the Boiling Isles and ended the ""Savage Ages"", an era when witches and demons used magic freely. Following his rise to the throne, he founded the Coven System and built his castle as a symbol of unity, directly upon the Titan's chest cavity. The Emperor's Castle was the home and ruling center of Emperor Belos during his reign over the Boiling Isles, serving as the base of his Coven and followers. And you now possess a perfect copy of this wonderful building. Yours possesses a copy of The Relic Room but with no relics gained in this purchase. Staff in this one is also optional and the throne room possesses a heart with which you can use to summon a dragon that looks just like Belos did in the end, completely loyal to you. There is also that specific place for the Day of Unity, which you could use for the same purpose.

Boosted: The Titan Blood increased what the heart in the throne room is capable of doing. Now, not only can you summon a dragon-like being through the heart, but its powers are augmented, being capable of teleportation on the same level the Item Portal can after being enhanced by the blood. The dragon can also control which spots are going to be corrupted or not, depending on your wishes, as well as having its physical abilities greatly increased. And the place which can be used for the Day of Unity needs merely you to activate the Draining Spell, while branding others is unnecessary, all beings you want to be affected shall be affected as if they were branded. The only requirement that can prove problematic is the necessity of the eclipse.

1248,,600,Library        ,The Owl House V1,Domain,"You receive a perfect copy of The Bonesborough Library. Whether this one will be a public library like the original, or something private, is up to you. Staff is optional, and places of interest include: Front Desk (a large desk operated by a librarian. People who wish to return books must stop by this desk and meet with a glasses-wearing librarian.), Demon Decimal Cabinets (a series of demonic file cabinets containing files of books classified by the Demon Decimal System. Feeding them or making them sneeze will cause the cabinets to spit out their contents.), References (a section of the library dedicated to research. It has various crystal balls that allow visitors to watch helpful tutorials or humorous internet videos), Kid's Corner (a small section of the library dedicated to children's activities. It is located near the Necronomicon section, the manga section, and the encyclopedias), Fiction and Non-fiction Sections (a pair of sections dedicated to the various fictional works and non-fiction literature of the Boiling Isles, respectively.), Amity's Hideout (a secret study hidden behind the romance section. This is a replica of Amity's personal study where she spends time away from her family.) and Forbidden Stacks (a restricted section of the library containing old books, including Philip Wittebane's diary. It is a place filled with echo mice).

Boosted: The Titan Blood modified this sanctuary of knowledge, increasing its internal space and adding all books ever written in both the Demon and Human Realm. The blood also made the books acquire new characteristics, which makes all subjects seem interesting for the reader and increases his/her reading speed.

1249,,600,Home,The Owl House V1,Domain,"Congratulations, you now have what some other people (sadly) don’t have, a house. A place to call yours, not a mansion, but it’s a good place to live. It is already furnished according to your taste. This place somehow seems to be affected by Harry Potter-like magic, making the inside bigger, when compared to the outside. You will also get a demon (like Hooty) to protect your house, though your demon can be based on another animal if you’d like. Oh yeah and your house also has a shield which protects it from boiling rain, though it isn’t strong enough to defend it against strong magic attacks.

Boosted: The Titan Blood altered your home in a way that its internal space is equivalent to the Blight State, the blood also decorated it with jewels, gold, diamonds and such. Your house demon is now strong enough to defeat five Coven Heads and win, while no longer being insufferably annoying. And your defensive enchantment is now capable of both protecting your home against the environment and strong magic, to a point where it would require the combined effort of the nine Coven Heads to destroy it.

1250,,600,Portal        ,The Owl House V1,Domain,"This door allows you to travel from the Human Realm to the Demon Realm and vice-versa (the same applies to the In Between Realm). It will turn into a suitcase when you are done using it. It’s not indestructible, so please do be careful, and also try to keep away from the sight of a guy named “Belos”. You can also put the suitcase in a Pocket Dimension whenever you want and take it out at will. The Item will appear again should it get destroyed, and in future settings, it will allow you to travel to “close” dimensions.

Boosted: The Titan Blood was already used to power the travel between dimensions of this Doorway, now however, the door won't even be necessary. For you see, the key is now the new portal, it is only possible for you (and those you allow) to use it. By wearing the key as a collar or holding it, you get the ability to instantly teleport to anywhere in any of the Realms, looks similar to how Hunter teleports but the light is purple and the range is essentially unlimited. You just need to have been on the place and/or have a good description of it and/or have it within the range of your sight.

1251,,600,A Windswept Isle,Warhammer Fantasy: Dark Elves,Domain,"This small island just off the coast of Naggaroth doesn’t bode well for you, or anyone. Near-constant storms pervade it in all defiance of meteorology, waves crash against shores so jagged they resemble a beast’s horns. Cataclysmic forces have blighted this land, plaguing it with great flows of Dhar’s very substance, the very terrain seemingly warped and twisted by some great calamity. At the centre of it is a temple dedicated to one of the elven gods, and at the capstone of that temple is a shrine. Strangely powerful illusions seem to make that shrine difficult to perceive by any but yourself

Why come here at all? For one thing the island has a thriving population of Bloodwrack Medusae eking out a living upon it. Though still of animalistic intellect, the wretched creatures seem instinctively subservient to you-bowing low to avert their gazes and bringing you nourishment should you require it. They will follow you if you approach the shrine, and if allowed to will guide you to it. In time, sentience seems to slowly return to them if you endure their presence, and while many of them will be reluctant to tell you of the decisions that led to their curse they will let you know Atharti herself has promised the return of their minds at least if they loyalty serve the one chosen to receive this island’s blessing, and curse-and eventually, the gift of changing between their punished selves and former elven beauty without the associated agony. Should you allow them to attend you, they will find these promises are indeed true.

Within the shrine is a great and terrible weapon empowered by divine forces. It is not Widowmaker of course, but it is an artifact of similar enormity and power-if possibly blessed by a different elven god. And even if it is not steeped in the bloodlust that the Sword of Khaine provokes, just as Khaine’s nature overwhelmingly suffuses his blade the overwhelming power of the artifact may prove as much a curse as a blessing. A magical staff wrought by Isha’s power might grant one a keen empathy to the plight of plant life. A spear empowered by Ereth Khial may share the goddess’ mad grudge. But is that not a small price to wield power that could change the world?

In future worlds, the island will host a new artifact of terrible power and consequence in its shrine-equal in significance for its local world to the Sword of Khaine’s in this reality. The Medusae will become your followers, likely coming to wonder what strange fate befell them."
1252,,600,Shadow Cast By Ghrond ,Warhammer Fantasy: Dark Elves,Domain,"Rising high from a mountain spar like a vast, black spear, this is not the famous dark tower of magic ruled by Morathi. But despite its inexplicably lesser fame and influence on the world, it rivals it in both mysticality and decadence; though it lacks the great city protecting Ghrond, it also seems far less attractive to the daemons and followers of Chaos which plague that city. Beneath your tower is found vast enough quantities of jewels, gold and silver- easily sufficient to pay off any tithes Malekith might ask for once it’s existence is brought to his attention. But the true power of this tower is the implements, facilities and troves upon troves of mystic lore within making it an unimaginable wealth of mystical resources. Workshops, stocks of implements and ritual circles dot it’s floors, each as tastefully designed as the actual reception halls, dining rooms and...places of intimate refreshment. The tomes within include those by some written by Morathi herself, but even those not penned by her provide troves of dark wisdom on all manner of magic. The sheer concentration of such power steeps the tower deeply in Dhar’s forces, amplifying magic of all kinds within to the extent that even in nearby snowstorms the secrets of fate and all the mysteries of the world can be gleaned in part.

The many sorceresses within know on a profound level that ownership of the tower is destined for you, swiftly complying to your commands for the right to use it. Most importantly of all, the combined power of the formidable covens is the stuff of mass destruction. Each is as skilled and decadent as their rivals in Ghrond and certainly none would claim they are any less easy in the eyes, but all have either fallen out of favour or left the arena of politics for the personal pursuit of magic and will do much to remain in your good graces. Within, every decadence found in Naggaroth and many distant lands can be found, every level of the vast structure elegantly sculpted for form as much as function, life within much more luxurious than even the Fortress of Naggarond. And with how playful the sorceresses can get, it’s a wonder any magic gets done at all."
1253,,600,Temple of Blood ,Warhammer Fantasy: Dark Elves,Domain,"The Brides of Khaine that oversee the Cauldrons of Blood hidden beneath the grand, fortress-sized temple to Khaine’s murderous bounty are as fervent in their belief the Bloody-Handed God has chosen you for greatness as they are intent on preserving the great secret hidden within its chambers. By itself, this is “merely” one of the greatest footholds of Khaine’s faith, staffed by enough murderous Witch Elves to make up a small army and led by true devotees to the Blood God’s faith. More importantly in a twisted evangelical miracle, in this and future worlds this temple calls forth all the bloody, the vicious, the murderous like a siren song to its halls where bloodshed in all its forms is made sacred-and such is the strength of Khaine’s presence here that they quickly become devout followers of the faith. Rites of all kinds incorporating bloodshed and sacrifice to Khaine are tenfold as successful and potent here than elsewhere, to the extent that should you wish its inhabitants could live comfortably in a state of murderous frenzy-at least, until the blood runs out."
1254,,600,Black Ark,Warhammer Fantasy: Dark Elves,Domain,"Thousands of warriors crew this vast iron fortress, it’s battlements and jagged turrets iconic of Naggarond’s finest architecture. Notably it is both seaworthy and fearsomely fast by the naval standards of this world, powered by great enchantments wrought into its foundations. Fear not for these warriors’ loyalty, or at least fear it less than that of the average Dark Elf, for they have staked their legend and reputation to yours and hope only you will lead them to opportunities where they can prove their mettle. Vast enough to comfortably house thousands of warriors, and carry thousands of slaves in significantly worse condition, these structures are nothing short of seaworthy cities crewed by viciously loyal Dark Elves who view you as their captain-and escorted by terrifying beasts from the deep. Within are not only melee and ranged weapons, but fierce siege and ship-scale armaments fit to devastate all but the most terrible sea beasts and enemy ships. This force is the pride and glory of Naggaroth’s military might, and includes an enchantment allowing it to beach itself thoroughly on solid shores to become a landbound city."
1255,,600,Your Own Personal Hell,I’m The Grim Reaper,Domain,"No place is like home, so you decided to bring a copy of your home together with you along your Chain and everyone knows that the home of a demon is Hell itself. You receive an exact copy of Hell as your personal dimension. It doesn’t include any of its inhabitants, like sinners and demons (with the exception of those directly related to the punishments), being currently empty, but it also has copies of its nine Circles and retains its time dilation. As the legitimate ruler of this Hell, you’re able to teleport to it at any time, regardless of where you’re, and you can send the soul of any sinner, or of anyone slain by you if you have the ability to absorb souls, killed by you or your minions to suffer here. Unless you directly send a soul to a specific Circle, the souls will be automatically judged by the will of this plane itself and will be sent to an appropriate Circle of Hell to receive a fair punishment depending on their sins. As long you’re there, you’ll be able to sense the presence of anyone within this dimension, including any trapped soul, as long as they aren’t using some supernatural ability to hide themselves from the detection. Besides this, the main benefit of this place is the power that comes from all the pain and torment of all the souls tortured in this infernal place. While outside, this comes as a very small amount of energy to fuel your power from each soul and, the more they suffer, the more energy is generated. Once inside this realm, all the energy contained and generated by every soul will directly be transferred to you, granting an enormous increase in your power to the point you’ll be almost invincible if enough souls are being tortured here. About the circles, we still don't know all the nine of them, but the ones that have already been revealed are:

The First Circle of Hell is barely different than the Purgatory, being probably a vast stretch of preserved nature with the only significant difference being its red sky. The sinners sentenced here usually receive punishments that can hardly be classified as such, like being chased by a snail for example, but this is due to the true punishment of this circle being simply loneliness, because it’s so huge that the sinners probably will never run into another one of them.

The Second Circle is a copy of Earth without a single sign of life, where the sinners are locked forever, usually starting on the arctic, meaning that they’ll need to swim to somewhere where they won’t freeze for eternity.

The Third Circle is unknown, but, as described by Dante Alighieri, it’s probably related to gluttony, being a “great storm of putrefaction”.

The Fourth Circle looks like an abandoned city in ruins made of a black stone with a giant statue of an angel of death in the middle of it. In this circle, the sinners are buried in their graves, forever clawing through the mud to escape, but never able to dig themselves free.

The Fifth Circle is a rocky wasteland, filled with demonic birds. The sinners sentenced to this circle are hanged here until the end of time and will have their flesh eaten by the birds, picking them to the bone. Their bodies will hang until their flesh slowly grows back, when the birds will return for another meal.

The Sixth Circle is a red ocean filled with skeletal remains, where the sinners drown for an eternity at its bottom, dragged down by their sins.

The Seventh Circle is unknown, but it’s probably related to violence, having a river of boiling blood and fire where those that committed violence against others, a forest where those that commited sins against themselves are transformed into trees and then fed upon by harpies and lastly a plain of burning sand that is the final resting place for those that committed violence against God, art and/or nature.

The Eighth Circle is unknown, but it’s probably related to fraud, with many diverse punishments due to the varied nature of this sin.

Lastly, the Ninth Circle of Hell is a void of absolute nothingness. We’ll talk about this place later."
1256,,600,Walker of Worlds,I’m The Grim Reaper,Domain,"The Purgatory, a vast stretch of preserved nature where the people who were not particularly virtuous or sinful are sent after their deaths, is linked to the First Circle of Hell, so Brook decided to walk all the way to find and reach Hell. Brook managed to travel from an afterlife separated from the physical plane to another afterlife, essentially traveling through dimensions by simply walking with a destination in mind. Even if you aren’t capable of accomplishing this same feat, you have a similar talent when it comes to interdimensional travel. You have an easiness to find portals that lead to other dimensions, either through searching in person or just using information or even legends that indicate clues and signs of the existence of portals in certain locations. This talent is basically a mixture of luck to find these signs and an instinct capable of detecting the presence of any kind of breach between dimensions, including in this case portals, in the vicinity of a few meters and also knowing when a clue or event actually indicates a signal of their presence or not. This talent also makes it easier to find information about rituals and other ways to open portals yourself, without needing to find one, but they’ll still require specific conditions and resources to open according to the ritual in question.

Boosted: Now you’re closer to replicating Brook’s feat of travelling all the way from Purgatory until he reached the First Circle of Hell. You’re able to essentially travel through dimensions by simply walking with a specific destination in mind, enabling you to physically use interdimensional travel without the need of a preexisting portal. The exact “physical” distance needed to be traveled between dimensions increases the more away they’re currently and more protected they’re. For example, a journey from Hell to Purgatory, due to both of them being connected, would already require around a few years for a normal human to travel walking without stopping but faster beings would take relatively less time to arrive, but a travel between two unrelated dimensions, like Hell and Heaven, would take even centuries instead to a normal human. During the journey, the two dimensions will appear to be merging, with one overwriting the other, until you arrive at your destination and stopping would reduce your progress. Even if you use this ability, you won’t be able to arrive in completely isolated dimensions or dimensions that are blocked from being accessed without some help. Initially, a travel between two dimensions would most times be not worth it, but, considering how fast some Jumpers tend to become, a travel between two distant dimensions could be basically instantaneous and very easy.

1257,,600,The Primordial Dream,Beast: The Primordial,Domain,"While you would ordinarily continue to possess the ability to use powers that require the Primordial Dream to exist, such as the creation of Chambers and having Kinship with monsters, this assures that in all future worlds, you won't lose access to the Primordial Dream. It will connect to other collective unconsciousnesses that humans may be a part of in future worlds, but will otherwise exist independently in dimensions that don't feature them. As a little gift from Jump-chan, the Primordial Dream will be made difficult to locate and hidden behind the Mists without your guidance to protect your Lair from being put into immediately hostile situations in universes where such places aren’t the kind of place you want to be."
1258,,600,Avernian Gate,Beast: The Primordial,Domain,"You’ve been granted a gate to the Underworld. On the other side is a Dead Dominion with laws that are favorable to you. This Dead Dominion is connected to whatever underworld may exist in future jumps. The Kerberos likes you, but is neither a follower or companion, they just manage the Dominion. If no land of the dead exists in a future jump, it instead creates one similar to the CofD Underworld, although it is empty of creatures beyond chthonic things that were never truly alive and the Kerberoi who maintain the Old Laws for when ghosts start showing up."
1259,,600,Faerie Gate,Beast: The Primordial,Domain,"You have come into possession of a portal to the psychoactive realm known as the Hedge. It can take many forms, such as a stone archway or ring of mushrooms. The thorns of the Hedge tear at the soul and are full of dangers, but luckily Beasts can manipulate the Hedge much like changelings and the True Fae do, so it shouldn’t be too much of an issue. The portal opens near an abandoned Hollow with an overgrown garden you can claim as your own. Although it is a bit of a fixer upper, the garden here is perfect for growing any goblin fruit you may find.

Not too far from the Hollow is a Goblin Market known as the Midnight Bazaar, which appears every New Moon. There, you can trade with the local hobs for various strange and wondrous things. You can import this into future jumps, which allows you to always have access to your Hollow, a few dozen miles of Hedge, and the Goblin Market every new moon. It starts out home to a few weak hobgoblins and an assortment of common goblin fruit, but hobs sometimes come and go with the Midnight Bizarre, meaning that the place is never empty. There is also always at least one goblin king in your neck of the Hedge who you can cut deals with. This place also grants access to the Bastions of dreamers in the area, allowing you to use Skeleton Key to enter their dreams."
1260,,600,Locus        ,Beast: The Primordial,Domain,"This grants you possession of a powerful Locus of a spiritual resonance of your choice, defaulting to fear, along with the several miles of Shadow around it. Local werewolves may have a problem with you if they learn you have this without the backing of a pack of your own. The Locus can also be used to enter the Shadow. The local spirits recognize you as the owner of the Locus and are well disposed to you, especially if you let them feed from it.

Do to the Shadow not always perfectly matching up with the material world, you can also choose for any of your other properties to have a reflection in it, with shortcuts leading to your Locus Shadow-side no matter how distant they are from it in the material. Owning a weak point in the Gauntlet won't do you any good without a Shadow, so this grants you access to whatever spirit world may exist in future worlds as well by traveling outside your territory. In universes without spirit worlds, this creates a copy of the Shadow, but everything beyond your territory is a wasteland devoid of Essence known as a Barren. It will begin to very slowly populate with spirits over time as Essence begins to trickle through from the material world."
1261,,600,Tunnel System,Fullmetal Alchemist,Domain,"This tunnel system, if bought with the base, connects together to form a giant transmutation circle the size of the country of Amestris, if not, then this is a series of underground tunnels you know how to enter at any time. Now in this Jump, this simply co-opts the one Father already made, and has a second center meaning if the ritual ever goes off, and he’s in the second circle, you’ll steal half the souls. Now this may not sound impressive, but in future Jumps, the points of the circle will be a bit fluid, requiring you to cause bloodshed in certain inhabited areas that don’t really match up sometimes due to the setting, starting location and other factors. But as long as you prepare the sacrifices and create the bloodshed at the necessary points, this will add the souls of all the people inside the circle to your body, either creating or enhancing your philosopher’s stone."
1262,,600,Silbern        ,Bleach,Domain,"To hide from the Shinigami who intended to wipe them from reality, Yhwach and the other Quincy hid themselves away in literal shadow. Through not entirely known methods, they were able to hide away in a shadow dimension overlapping normal space within Soul Society, the entirety of their race living in a city on the of Seireitei, and of approximately the same size. This ice encrusted city and palace, heavily fortified and intelligently designed for war, operated as their platform for invasion when the time was right. Inhabitants were able to travel back and forth between Silbern and Seireitei, and eventually Yhwach was able to super impose Silbern and the surrounding city onto the space Seireitei once existed. By making this purchase, you will acquire a similar property of approximate size, with a small army and civilian populace of Quincy. In future worlds, you may hide Silbern in the shadows of a location of your choice, giving similar advantages to the ones the Wandenreich had."
1263,,600,Zeroth Palace,Bleach,Domain,"A royal palace of your own, a vast fortress similar to a small city in size. Identical to the five palaces held by each member of Squad Zero, this floating fortress is instead uniquely crafted to suit you. Beyond it’s luxurious furnishings, fitting for a royal location, this structure was designed and outfitted to perfectly suit a particular skill or specialty of your choice. A legendary blacksmith would find a vast forge, capable of holding an ocean of spiritually enhanced water, a furnace to reach the heat of the sun, many supernaturally enhanced assistants and an enormous, replenishing source of materials to rely on. From wildly expensive metals to blank souls ready for the soul forges. Whatever your special skill, be it blacksmithing or cooking or weaving or writing or something of a similar focus, you’ll find this palace has the tools and resources to push it to incredible heights. 

While it is not hidden away in a royal dimension, it still floats high in the air and is concealed by numerous strong Kido barriers. The palace is also guarded by a regiment of several hundred Shinigami, most of a high Seated level of power and a handful even being of Lieutenant ready skill. "
1264,,600,Karakura Town/Jureichu,Bleach,Domain,"The Jureichu, the designation for the point within the human world that hosts the greatest concentration of spiritual beings. This is not a set location, simply the term for whatever place currently meets that criteria, and in modern times that place is Karakura Town. You find yourself in the possession of a town, if not Karakura Town itself, matching this description; either becoming its mayor, or someone of notable popularity that many end up deferring to anyways. 

Acting as something like the Jureichu even in future worlds, many varied and powerful individuals will find themselves attracted to the town, becoming fond of the town, and allying themselves with you as a result. Additionally, as a result of the great concentration of spiritual beings, inhabitants will find their own spirit energy becoming enriched by exposure, slowly awakening their own powers."
1265,,600,Arturo’s Mark,Bleach,Domain,"As a phoenix from the ashes, your wings shine with a terrible flame. A unique development for a Hollow, separate from the path of Resurreccion somehow. Perhaps the sort of thing that would only be seen in a side story. From your back, you are able to project two shining wings of light. The power is fairly straightforward, the presence of these wings significantly boosting your Reiryoku’s strength. As can be expected, the wings also allow for true flight at significant speeds. The wings themselves can be shaped, the energy becoming solid at a moment’s notice, and allows for you to manifest the energy around yourself in other ways. A blade of solid force or a flurry of piercing spears sent at a foe. The energy used this way is denser and more refined than your ordinary cero or bala attacks. The wings are also able to be, temporarily, pushed to a second stage. The light-toned energy becomes darker in this form and the wings expand. As if you had a second Resurreccion to activate, the increase in power becomes quite immense in this state. While it does not drain on your energy to hold, it is physically exhausting and cannot be activated for long battles. "
1266,,600,Flash Goddess,Bleach,Domain,"It all comes down to speed, in the end. The first strike, the power in each hit, dodging everything the opponents try and taking on them all at once. If you don’t have speed, you’ll be lacking in all of them. But if there’s anything you can call your own, it’s that flashing speed. Compared to your peers, your speed, agility and reflexes are completely off the charts. Someone might be able to hurt you in a fight but they’ll barely catch a glimpse of you once you get moving. Dozens of skilled martial artists can barely graze you as you dance gracefully through their ranks. You’ll leave quite a few bodies in your wake too, given the ease with which you enhance your martial arts with that sheer speed. 

Your natural talent for quick movement and agility will see you continually increase it with ease, having a gift for any techniques relating to such things. It’s left you an expert in the enhanced movement techniques of your race, such as Shunpo or Sonido, and even taught you some things that probably shouldn’t be possible, like making solid afterimages to attack alongside you. If you could reach the Reiryoku levels of a Captain, you can even claim equality with the Flash Goddess herself."
1267,,600,Skull Clad,Bleach,Domain,"The favour of Hell is a strange thing to collect and many would question what exactly the intentions of one so deeply connected to it’s Will are. However it came to be, golden light coalesced around your form into an armor made from human bones, shining with sinful light. This armor represents the invested power of the Kushanada, the caretaker’s of Hell, and thus your own authority in that realm. The most obvious result is an increase in spiritual power, reinforcing your soul with the energy of hell, similar to maintaining a Shikai or Resurreccion state while the armor is summoned. 

More interesting are the hellish abilities you have access to. You can travel freely to and from Hell, summoning the Gates to enter the place and then exit again anywhere the realm might have reach. You can both create and command the chains of hell as well as summon the Kushanada. The chains are near unbreakable even to a Captain level opponent and can bind the spiritual energy of others or drag them down into hell, if the Gate is active. The Kushanada are gigantic gorilla-like demons who guard Hell and torment it’s prisoners, each one more than a match for any Vice-Captain Shinigami. The permanent investment of power you have received also gives you the same immortality as the Togabito, slowly reforming in Hell if you are ever killed. Unless your soul is completely destroyed, you will reappear in a few days in your realm. You’ll retain access to the Hell of this world in future, though the sinners of the past worlds will be left behind, and can attempt to claim similar influence over other Hells. If you can convince it’s guards to invest their power or conquer them yourself, at least. "
1268,,600,Weapons of Palamecia,Mobius Final Fantasy,Domain,"A vault located outside of Space Time that holds all the weapons available in Mobius Final Fantasy, it expands endlessly in order to fit in any new weapons that you choose to place in it. Basically just a less versatile Gate of Babylon. For an additional 100 MC you can also store any armors, curatives, or currencies you place in it. Regardless of which version you purchase, the vault will automatically organize everything placed inside to your specifications."
1269,,600,Idle Death Gamble: CR Private Pure Love Train Version 1/239,Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Domain,"Why do I hear boss music? Anyway this is a pachinko-themed technique that is primarily applied through domain expansion. The cursed technique imbued into the domain manifests Private Pure Love Train, a pachinko game inspired by the eponymously named romance manga series. However, you can summon the visual effect indicators of the game such as the shutter doors outside of your domain which you gain for free. It creates an environment resembling a train station that hosts a game of chance. Your primary goal is to line up three of the same numbers to hit a jackpot with only a 1/239 chance of doing so. Hitting the jackpot of Idle Death Gamble grants you a bonus of unlimited cursed energy for four minutes and eleven seconds, the exact duration of the Private Pure Love Train theme song ""Admiring You"", which plays throughout the round. The limitless cursed energy causes your body to reflexively use reverse curse technique to automatically heal any injury, making you temporarily unkillable after hitting a jackpot. The game begins in normal mode, where those inside appear on a neutral stage. As the battle begins, the user can manifest three different types of visual effect indicators in battle: shutter doors, reserve balls, and consecutive effects. Conjuring doors and balls are offensive attacks, but consecutive effects are defensive indicators that redo a sequence to revert damage. Doors and reserve balls come in a green, red, or gold rarity to symbolize a higher chance at a jackpot. Rainbow-colored indicators or four re-doing four consecutive effects guarantees a jackpot. The user can choose which visual indicator to manifest, but their success is up to luck. Generating one or more visual indicators progresses the stage to a riichi scenario and reveals two of three of the numbers needed for a jackpot. There are four riichi scenarios with different chances of hitting a jackpot, with the final train riichi having over an eighty percent chance. Each of the scenarios changes the stage and uses the characters of Private Pure Love Train in a different way. For example, the transit card riichi scenario takes the user and their opponent to a different part of the train station where Yuki must pass through the gate and get to work on time to hit the jackpot. This is a low-chance scenario and is likely to fail without rare visual indicators. The user's opponent cannot obstruct the visualization of the riichi scenarios and must watch it unfold or defeat the caster before it ends. Failure to hit a jackpot within a scenario will revert the stage back to the start. This will repeat until the user wins or runs out of chances to do so, with the number of possible spins decreasing with every missed jackpot. On the first activation of consecutive expansions, the probability of hitting the jackpot is over twenty percent. If a jackpot is hit, the domain disappears, and Admiring You plays out loud around the user, who receives a bonus of unlimited cursed energy for the duration of the song. The user has no restrictions on cursed energy and can receive bonus amounts randomly throughout the round. The unlimited cursed energy causes the body to reflexively heal itself even if the user never learned to perform reverse cursed technique. This prevents the user's body from retaining damage and makes them effectively unkillable for four minutes and eleven seconds. By the end of the song, the user's cursed energy recedes back to normal and their cursed technique has already been replenished. This allows them to open their domain repeatedly as long as a jackpot is achieved. The conditions of the game carry over from consecutive uses as well. If the user lined up three odd numbers, the stage will open in advanced probability rather than the neutral state. If the user lined up even numbers, they will start on a stage with faster spins. There is also a chance for the stage to begin in hidden probability, a pachinko mode similar to faster spins but actually carries an increased probability to hit the jackpot."
1270,,600,Deadly Sentencing,Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Domain,"This domain reflects a small courtroom where the user and their target stand across from one another playing the roles of prosecutor and defendant. There are numerous guillotines in the background with chopped-up debris beneath them. Deadly Sentencing is the type of domain that doesn't contain a can't-miss attack, instead, it forces those inside to follow the rules of the user's cursed technique. The domain isn't constructed to be lethal and implements a binding vow requiring the user to explain the aforementioned rules. The trial-based cursed technique imbued into the domain allows the user to prosecute their target with the shikigami called Judgeman serving as its namesake. There is no violence allowed inside the domain for either side and proceedings begin immediately after activation. First Judgeman will announce the charges against the defendant, which are actual crimes they may or may not have committed. Judgeman automatically knows everything about everyone inside the domain but this information isn't shared with the caster. The verdict of the trial depends only on the arguments presented by both sides. After the accusation is reviewed, the defendant is given one chance to defend their case. They have three options: silence, confession, or denial. If the defendant chooses to deny the charges, they can lie in their statements. The defendant's goal is to dispel all doubt and win a pronouncement of innocence from Judgeman. The prosecutor also only has one chance to make a statement, but theirs is a rebuttal based on evidence submitted by Judgeman for deliberation. The evidence submitted appears as a sealed envelope in the prosecutor's hand. The evidence submitted is not necessarily conclusive and it will not be opened and shared with the defendant until after their statement, but the prosecutor will be informed of the contained information by Judgeman upon receiving the envelope. Once the prosecution and defense have both made their statements, Judgeman will deliver a lawful verdict. If the defendant is found guilty, they are punished with one of what is implied to be several different sentences. Not even the user can be sure of which sentence their opponent will receive. In some situations, depending on the severity of the crime, harsher punishments can be handed out. One sentence the Judgeman will commonly give is ""Confiscation"", which prevents them from being able to use cursed techniques. After the verdict, the domain dispels and the punishment immediately affects the guilty party. However, if the defendant is found guilty without an open confession, they can request a retrial that Judgeman cannot deny."
1271,,600,Tomb of the Star,Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Domain,"This is really cool. It’s a tomb. The tomb Master Tengen resides in. There is only one door leading to the corridor but there are over a thousand doors that continuously shuffle. The correct door opens to a massive drop with tall old trees with no foliage below. This leads to the space between the entrance and the actual tomb. It is an indoor forest area with trees, grass, and dirt. Jujutsu High's cursed warehouse where they store cursed objects is located in this area. Deeper inside is an elevator that descends underground to the main corridor. The main hall consists of a compound of old buildings that circle around a gigantic tree. There is a path that leads directly to the base of the tree where Master Tengen resides. There is also another barrier at the entrance to Master Tengen's shrine that prevents anyone from intruding other than those directly invited. If one were to enter and be rejected, they would walk into an empty white space void of Master Tengen's presence. You are now the master of this place giving you fool control and rights over all the objects and things inside. You can change up the area as you like but it has to keep some resemblance."
1272,,600,JUMPER TECH,Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Domain,You are now the proud head of a Jujutsu School. This school is gonna teach a whole bunch of kids how to fight cursed spirits. It will always be able to churn out a bunch of grade ones and every once in a while about 5 years it will raise a special grade. In other worlds it will churn out the equivalent of a grade one and special grade.
1273,,600,Magical Research Facility,Seven Deadly Sins,Domain,"Perched atop a large hill lies a good sized facility with several floors above the surface and extensive excavated caverns within the hill below it. This is a brand new research facility focused on magic. Filled with artefacts of low to mid power and usefulness, research and studies from wizards across Britannia and even a number of personal notebooks left by Merlin herself, this facility is sure to start off even one with no magic on the right path to becoming a master magician. There are plenty of rooms for carrying out experiments, warded to stop explosions, sound or magic from escaping within a certain level and the caves below the main facility possess some darker secrets. These secrets range from dubiously legal studies on necromancy and other dark magics to even the corpse of a Red Demon, long dead and locked away but still filled with incredibly valuable demon blood. It’ll carry over to future jumps and update the information, notebooks and research it has to those new settings as well."
1274,,600,Druid Sanctuary,Seven Deadly Sins,Domain,"Your own private little hideaway. Only accessible with your permission through a Stonehenge that is located in a place of your choosing, this small pocket realm is a sacred place to all druids and beings connected with the earth or with life itself. The realm is not terribly large, stretching about a few hundred meters across from side to side in a perfect circle. The pocket realm has an incredibly calming effect on any who enter and is the perfect place to meditate and to come into contact with the earth or any spirits associated with it. It has a large lake in the centre of the realm, surrounded on all sides by nature’s bountiful plants and animals in perfect health. At the centre of the lake lies a tower in good condition, with many simply furnished but comfortable rooms and utilities. Across to the far side of the lake from where you entered lies a cave, filled with sealed away monsters. They’re all relatively tame and can be useful training partners, though none of them are stronger than a Red Demon at best. In an emergency, you could releases these monsters to help protect the realm."
1275,,600,Flash  ,Seven Deadly Sins,Domain,"A world in slow motion, stretching out before you to infinity. The Grace of Flash is the power of speed, speed beyond all but the greatest of warriors here to even track, much less compete with. Cross all of Britannia in a single breath or unleash flurries of many thousands of blows on all those around you. Your Grace brings you mundane speed to this immense level, along with your ability to react. To a great extent, your attacks are also empowered by the speed, hitting with far greater force due to their far greater speed. However, as incredible as your Grace is, it is not an invincible ability. While little short of the Demon King, or beings at similar or close levels of power, could actually fight you directly it is still possible for others to predict and counter you. Skill, intelligence and strange abilities are your worst enemies."
1276,,600,Lord of the Night,Seven Deadly Sins,Domain,"The true lord of the night. Perhaps you are the last of your race that you know of but even a race of one is not without a King these days. Other bloodsuckers will know from whatever shrivelled organ they call their hearts that you are the one that is meant to lead them. The powers of night and space that you wield are only proof of such things. You are able to extend an eternal night over several miles around yourself, for all intents and purposes this would count as a natural night and midnight at that too. Your influence over space however, is able to over time warp the land and buildings around you to make a strange landscape that should be impossible. Corridors that lead into rooms that should be on the other side of a castle, stairs that one must walk up to go down, rooms within rooms and doors that only exist from one side. This strange architecture can be controlled and increased by you over time, as your power grows and as you nest in the one place more and more. You also have a strange and quite terrible degree of control over your own body. With time and practice, you could learn animate your veins to extend through the air and suck blood from others, survive as a single eyeball that grows wings or even outright shapeshift to look like someone else. Thankfully you have many years to learn these functions. As a Vampiric King, you will also gain up to 20,000 Power Level as a bonus."
1277,,600,Time Ring,Dragon Ball Super,Domain,"This beautiful wooden box contains one of the most powerful artefacts in the universe. A Time Ring, the silvery, sacred tool of a Supreme Kai. Time Rings allow the wielder to freely travel to the future and back, along with granting limited acausality to their wearers, protecting them from being affected at all by changes in the timeline or other time based effects. They normally cannot travel to the past but the Time Ring you have access to appears to be constantly affected by a strange twist in time, allowing you to travel to the past for a few minutes before being forced back to the present. The last trait of the Time Ring and it’s box is that, for every alternate timeline in your current universe, an additional green time ring will appear in the box. Your Time Ring allows for free travel to alternate timelines and back, provided the green ring representing that timeline is in the box. Once the timeline is destroyed, the green ring linked to it will disappear."
1278,,600,That Place,Dragon Ball Super,Domain,"You’ve got a Place. It’s not a nice Place but it is a useful Place. In fact, even though others are very scared to go to this Place, they can’t even deny it’s very useful to be in. In a location of your choice, you’ve got a gate that lets you travel to this Place, a little pocket realm that appears separated from the rest of reality. This place is perfect for training. Not only does time move much faster in this little realm, a year for every day outside, but the Place always has an environment capable of challenging and threatening you, no matter how strong you become. It can be quite dangerous to be in but it is very worth the effort given the results you get. "
1279,,600,Ship of Fools,Ultrakill,Domain,"It seems you’ve struck a bargain with the Ferrymen, the oft overlooked guiders of souls across the River Styx. Or, well, the Ocean Styx now, given the apocalyptic influx of souls. Put simply, you now have control over a massive cruise ship, sturdy and able to traverse many a sea, be it of water, souls, lava, or whatever weird esoteric seas people are making these days. It is fully furnished and comes with ample space for whatever you might need to do, and room for countless guests, if you wished to host an actual cruise. A single Ferryman works as it’s pilot, and is more than willing to bring you to wherever you need. An excellent mobile base of operations.

To summon it, all you need to do is toss a coin into whatever sea you need to traverse, and the ship will rise from it’s waves, along with a convenient path up to the ship itself. It can be de-summoned in a similar manner."
1280,,600,Pandaemonium,Final Fantasy Type-0,Domain,"The Pandaemonium is also known as the Palace of All Magic, a dimensional construct that is usually only seen as the cycle comes to an end, being Gala's fortress to deploy troops from. After witnessing it once, you'll understand its workings, and be able to conjure up a similar sub dimension of your own.

While not as robust, and nowhere near as large as the original Pandaemonium is, the one you conjure up can be slowly expanded until it reaches the size of a mansion. Once materialized, it remains fixed in the same spot until you leave the realm at which point you may choose to materialize it elsewhere. 

You may freely adorn the rooms - which remember your changes between materialization. Pandaemonium is usually unseen by normal eyes, however it can be temporarily destroyed by sufficient magical force. You may be safe for a little while inside its walls, but it will not withstand attack forever.

Suzaku: The internal rooms are painted in many shades of red and flaming braziers light its halls. Your magic regenerates much quicker while inside here. The first room you receive holds a massive crimson compass. When touched, the compass projects a map of the nearby area and the compass’s only arrow points in the direction of the largest magic source.

Byakko: The internal rooms are all painted white, and futuristic lights line the halls. The first room you receive here is always a complete laboratory facility, with a database that records technology from the realm outside as you expose it to a digital scanner inside the room. The facility also has a synthesis machine capable of recreating objects which can fit inside, though energy is still necessary in order to fuel the process.

Genbu: The internal rooms are all painted in black, and lanterns provide the only light around. Your health regenerates much quicker while inside here. The first room you receive is a luxurious lounge, but what catches your eye is a set of armor hanging on a rack in the center. If you don this suit of armor, it projects illusions of yourself, with an additional illusion for each ally in your vicinity. The armor will vanish in a day if taken outside your Pandaemonium.

Souryu: The internal rooms are all painted in many shades of blue, and glowing water runs along the floor, lighting the halls. When you walk into the first room, a noisy screech startles you. It appears you're in a nursery of some sort - or a hatchery rather. A baby wyrm has hatched from an egg and is now squawking at you. While this wyrm will never be able to leave Pandaemonium, it will act as the hatchery's custodian, watching over any other eggs you may decide to hatch here. Things you hatch within Pandaemonium cannot leave for extended periods however, keep that in mind."
1281,,600,Simulated Universe,Honkai: Star Rail,Domain,"You gain a copy of the Herta Space Station’s Simulated Universe, with a couple of modifications. First, you can upload your own memories or the memories of any of your companions to your Simulated Universe, allowing it to replicate locations, people, or battles from your experiences. This Simulated Universe is nearly flawless, allowing you to accurately observe the actions of enemies, monsters, or even gods. The Simulated Universe will be located in a small lab attached to your Warehouse or another property that you own in future jumps."
1282,,600,Resurgence,Honkai: Star Rail,Domain,"You now possess the frightening ability to gain a massive burst in speed whenever you kill or otherwise completely incapacitate an opponent. These bursts of speed will make time seem to you as if it is moving at a crawl for ten seconds, although to others it will be faster than the blink of an eye. You will not experience any of the drawbacks that physics would normally impose upon one moving at such a remarkable speed, and scoring another kill during these five seconds will reset the timer until your boost ends. With this ability, a competent fighter could wipe out entire armies before they can even raise their weapons an inch."
1283,,600,Water Mirror Dungeon ,Frieren - Beyond Journey's End,Domain,"A dungeon guarded by a powerful monster in the shape of a large jewel located in a sealed chamber deep inside its labyrinthic halls. The most remarkable quality of this dungeon is that said monster has the magic to create exact clones of those who enter the dungeon that it will use to defend itself and the dungeon. These clones are only distinguishable from the originals in that they cannot speak, they are immune to mental magics as they have no real minds of their own and they appear to be made out of water at first glance, but they are as durable and powerful as the real ones.

You have the exploitation rights of this dungeon, and thus can decide who can legally challenge it. If you or someone else manages to conquer it, a hefty mountain of treasure and gold awaits you at the end.

In future jumps, this dungeon can be placed in a place of your choosing. If destroyed or conquered, you can make it reappear in a year."
1284,,600,A Power That Transcends All Logic,Frieren - Beyond Journey's End,Domain,"The power that Priests have discovered from the Goddess’ Scriptures only represents around three percent of the total spells that are believed to be encrypted between its pages. Within them, a primal form of magic from the mythical times that seems to transcend any other kind of power lies, allowing the user to bend the laws of nature to their will through the usage of divine power. While you are not made aware of the full power of the Goddess, it seems that a special spell has been granted to you: Vialathor. By engraving this spell on an durable object, you are able to create a miraculous effect like no other: that of defeating time itself. The one who reads the spell will create an anchor point. Afterwards, when they read the spell again in the same monument, they will be sent back to the past. While in the past, they may read the spell again at the same monument to be sent back to the present once again.

The creation of this artifact will require an immense amount of power from the goddess, as such, you are limited to creating one only every one hundred years or one per jump, whichever comes first. And it will only store enough energy for the trip back to the past and then the return to the present."
1285,,600,Elysium,Virgil’s Aeneid,Domain,"The Elysian Fields are a beautiful meadow deep in Hades where those favoured by Zeus (primarily Romans, of course) may enjoy perfect happiness in the prime of their youth. Their days are spent exercising and socialising in the fields in an eternal state of bliss. Now you have a similar pocket dimension version of this place that can be accessed at will. Anyone taken inside your personal Elysium will be returned to the prime of their youth and they will not age until they leave. While inside they may choose to enter a state of bliss, upon which they will cease to feel any kind of negative emotions until you choose to break them out of this trance, if indeed you ever decide to do so."
1286,,600,Dimensional Rift ,Stranger Of Paradise - Final Fantasy Origins,Domain,"The Dimensional Rift is a staple of the franchise. Indeed it is a sort of dimensional nexus that connects the worlds of the various Final Fantasy games. This grants a replica of that place for your own use. It connects to all dimensions,worlds,alternate timelines etc... each jump you go to which would allow you to easily travel to them. Yours can’t be accessed without your permission however."

1288,,600,Rift Labyrinth,Stranger Of Paradise - Final Fantasy Origins,Domain,The Rift Labyrinth is a mysterious labyrinth that appeared after Nil messed with the dimensions. This replica is an endless labyrinth with multiple floors that allows you to hone your skills and powers fighting monsters taken from worlds you have visited before. It also contains locations reminiscent of past jumps and is guaranteed to always contain gear and items that are useful to you. If you die within you are simply ejected unharmed.
1289,,600,And Builds A Heaven In Hell’s Despair ,Demon: The Descent,Domain,"The Tempters have a very direct interpretation of Hell. It’s a place. Ruled by demons to have fun in forever. Far away from the God-Machine. Now, actually setting it up, that’s...somewhat trickier to do, but you’re onto something. When you claim metaphysical ownership over an area (relevant Embeds and Exploits are always relevant, but so is legal ownership or a GENUINE emotional investment in land that has gone unchallenged), it subtly changes at a spiritual level to suit you over the course of weeks. An estate on Earth might look like a gothic cathedral with weapon caches and hidey-holes. Even a supernatural region like the Hedge, the Shadow or the foreign land of a distant planet would at least be comfortably habitable to you before accounting for how the local forces respond to a demon’s will. The changes must be physically possible for the location inherently and take place whenever nobody is around to interact with them, but otherwise the sky’s the limit. Gradually, over time the whole region becomes something akin to a personal pocket dimension: Cut off from the observation of all but the most powerful supernatural scrying forces, self-sustaining, eventually akin to a very large Bolthole (described below), a pocket dimension with you and those you deign to appoint as fellow rulers lording over it. After years, maybe months with Gadget assistance, your little world will become like Infrastructure permanently attuned to you, gaining theomechanical support structures and supernatural abilities that benefit your way of life. There’s a place for you in Hell alright-it’s called the throne.

Do note that anything larger than an estate will take correspondingly longer for your demonic nanites to corrupt, though."
1290,,600,Flash  ,The Seven Deadly Sins,Domain,A world of motion. Everything moves and all things move at different speeds. And yet you are the fastest of the fast. Everything is slow for you. Your speed reaches unprecedented levels with this Grace. So fast are you that it seems you are teleporting instead of merely moving. Reaction speeds and attack speeds that reach the same instantaneous movement allows you to immediately slay your opponent without them even having the chance to dodge. You utilize this grand speed in every aspect of your life. Your ability to defend thousands of attacks and attack a thousand times in the same breath. Truly you are the Fastest of the Fastest. You are the Flash of Light that will cleave the darkness.
1291,,600,Ocean,The Seven Deadly Sins,Domain,Ocean is an incredibly powerful Grace. It allows you to connect to an entirely different plane made up entirely of an Ocean. A space entirely made up of your Grace. This allows you to trap your opponent within this plane and unless they are stronger than you they will be unable to escape and will be worn down by your Ocean. You also have various other abilities. You can summon this water from your Ocean to attack your opponent with enough force that you could easily crush your enemy into nothing but mush. You can also transform yourself into liquid allowing you to be nearly immune to physical attacks as well as allow you to transform into liquid to escape nearly all possible restraints. Truly you are one who crushes the Darkness of evil under the great Ocean of Justice.
1292,,600,Belialuin,The Seven Deadly Sins,Domain,You are now the king of the Capital of Wizards Belialuin. This capital is a grand city that is filled with mage towers and every single inhabitant of this place is a wizard. This country is a prosperous nation filled with wizards who are all quite powerful but that isn't what's important. You see every 10 years or every jump whichever comes first this capital will birth a wizard or witch that will be head and shoulders above even the greatest of mages. Their intellect is stellar but they will also have an incredible power equal to that of the Infinity held by Merlin. While they may only appear every ten years there will still be a large amount of prodigious children in this capital. This capital will treat all of its subjects humanely and none of them will be turned into guinea pigs. Nobody will ever run away from this country unlike the original because those born here will love everything to do with magic. You are the de facto ruler who will be considered the head of the state and the strongest person around.
1293,,600,A Hidden Manse​ (Tier 5) ,Generic Exalted,Domain,"Now we're talking. You get a Manse, the Manse of course being a piece of land that is somehow magical in some fashion or another. They're aspected towards a certain type of Essence, either elemental essence such as Wood, Water, Earth, Fire, or Air or alternatively they're aspected towards the Celestial elements such as the Sun, Moon, Stars, or even Infernal or Abyssal (which are quite rare normally). Aside from being a spot of land that you now own (as long as you can protect it) a Manse also produces a Hearthstone.

Hearthstones, when socketed into certain weapons/armor/amulets, provide both unique magical effects and act as channels of the Manse itself allowing for vastly improved regeneration of Essence. Did I mention you also regenerate Essence faster while in the Manse? Yeah, you do. Anyways there are far too many Manses to actually list here in this document so we'll just go by price. For 600cp you can get the most powerful manses at 5dots. You can choose any Manse you want from the Core books or official supplement books for Exalted that you have paid the appropriate cost for. 

Of note is that while you can have more than one Manse only ones you purchase here will follow you between jumps, inserting themselves flawlessly into new worlds (or as an addition to your Warehouse, your choice either or). Additionally you will need at least one open hearthstone socket for every hearthstone you have if you want to make use of them. Manse's can range from the size of a small forest clearing to the size of a reasonably large nobles estate (call it 100 acres), you choose what size yours is, the more expensive the Manse you bought the bigger it can be.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
1294,,600,World of Shadows ,Shin Megami Tensei V,Domain,"Another being from a different plane I see. How interesting. I welcome you to my World Jumper. I am Sophia, the Achamoth and sacred prostitute that gives birth to demonic life. The original matriarch and spirit of Knowledge. I am here to guide and aid one imbued with knowledge and capable of changing the World. However a different higher being reached out to me... and after conversing with them I have come to see that you too may require my aid. If you are willing to have me, I will help you on this strange journey of yours.

Did you expect a Magician to aid you in such an art? Well I’m sorry to disappoint you but worry not someone just as capable, and more exclusive, offers their services here. Fusing Shadows, empowering them, using pieces of Gods dignity to grant you miracles, summons Demons you already fused and contracted with, all that is possible here, with the aid of Sophia. As a Nahobino, you may use Sophias services for free and may take her with you as well. None Nahobinos must pay 600 CP. Sophia is unfailingly loyal to you and simply seeks to see what you will become. In future Worlds recipes for beings you slay that are alike to Demons in nature will be added to the Compendium and fusible by you to have them fight for your cause."
1295,,600,Demon Kings Castle,Shin Megami Tensei V,Domain,This Castle is your new Base of operations. It is a Bulwark and any intruder that wants to enter will have to get past dangerous traps and confusing layouts. For you and your allies though it is a place of Luxury. Inside are groups of average powerful but obedient demons (which can not be taken out of the Castle unless you Import them as a Companion) ensuring that any invader and would be Demon Slayer will have to fight their way to you. If you purchase Demonic Allies your allied Demons may roam here to keep serving you when not summoned and on your Person.
1296,,600,Invasion Imminent,Shin Megami Tensei V,Domain,"The threat of Demons grow ever bigger by the day. Soon Demonic forces, the most notable being the Ancient Lahmu, will invade the human realm. Without a warning they escape the World of Da’at to attack and lay waste to man. This is a feat you can share. No matter the reality in question you can shatter your way through the World around you. With this you could move from Da’at to Tokyo without the need of a Leyline Fountain or a Terminal. The boundaries keeping realities separated are no issue for you, though this only works for Realities in the same World."
1297,,600,The Hideout,Final Fantasy XVI,Domain,"You receive a copy of the Hideout of Cid’s rebels. This includes both the original one located in the Blighted lands and the ship relic called the Invincible where they sought refuge following Hugo’s attack, with all the rebels loyal to you. It retains upgrades you make to it and you may attack it to your warehouse or one of your properties in future jumps. Also included is a guarantee that this location won’t be found unless you deliberately lead others to it."
1298,,600,Kingdom of Waloed ,Final Fantasy XVI,Domain,"You receive a copy of the Kingdom of Waloed untouched by the Blight including its mothercrystal though yours doesn’t spread the Blight, with all the inhabitants and knights loyal to you. It retains upgrades you make to it and you may attack it to your warehouse or one of your properties in future jumps."

It retains upgrades you make to it and you may attack it to your warehouse or one of your properties in future jumps."
1302,,600,Arcanex Annulations,The Elder Scrolls - Online,Domain,"The ultimate power is, of course, to strip others of theirs. By sacrificing a portion of your own magical power for a time, you can generate a globe of dark energy over an area of 8 meters that absorbs magicka, siphoning the power from spells and enchantments, violently expelling summoned creatures, and obliterating any magics already in effect. Enemies, even non-magically active ones within the dome’s radius will suffer horrible shock from the abrupt and invasive severance of their connection to the flow of magicka. In time, you can augment this further and learn to direct the flow of the siphoned energy, either turning it back on the caster, or leeching it away to restore the vitality of yourself and your allies. Not even Daedra are immune. Make no mistake; a single well-placed casting of this field of suppression can easily destroy those who rely too heavily on magic."
1303,,600,Walker of Worlds,Greek Myth,Domain,"The messenger God Hermes walks easily between Olympus and the Underworld without fear of danger. The effects of all environmental dangers are greatly mitigated by this perk to the point you could easily traverse a desert without fear of burns or swim the oceans without drowning. Harsh environments and difficult terrain are the same as paved roads to your feet and you can easily travel at your top speed through them. Wild animals and beasts will never interrupt your travels with attacks. Even if you should have no means to get somewhere like Hermes as he runs through the air you may simply walk there given enough time. The greatest boon of this perk however is that you may reach even places that are sealed off or impossible to travel to, your feet could stand in the Elysium fields in the day and Tartarus during the night. It is like you are one of the four winds which may travel anywhere without fear. Be warned however this does not stop others from taking action against you if you are somewhere they do not want you to be or going somewhere they do not want you.

Boosted: Walker of Worlds gains the ability to lead others between places just as Hermes carries the souls of the dead to the underworld. So long as you are leading a group in their travels they shall be able to follow you wherever you are going enjoying the same benefits you do. As well they gain the abilities to find things. While the normal Walker of Worlds can bring you somewhere given enough time and walking it cannot bring you to someone or something. Now however both people and objects can be moved to.

1304,,600,Roots Of Cosmic Fantasy,Fate/Grand Order Part 2,Domain,"Designed by Marisbury, created by the Alien World CHALDEAS, implemented by the Alien God, the Trees of Fantasy are one of the most impactful inventions in modern times, perhaps even the whole of human history. Looking like titanic white trees and seemingly containing a conceptual model of galaxies within, these massive trees have a variety of functions, the least of which is generating significantly more magical energy than even Holy Grails, being only one or two orders of magnitude lesser than the total output of the Sun itself. Those connected to it, or who eat the tree somehow, can tap into this energy generation for truly absurd amounts of magical energy. And while the amount of energy generation is the same regardless of its state, the Tree of Fantasy does have some form of growth, slowly fragmenting the trunk to show the galaxy within, spreading its roots across the Planet it is on, and slowly covering the sky with its branches, and going from roughly being the size of a skyscraper to very quickly growing larger than mountains, and only becoming larger and larger over time.

When fully grown, a Fantasy Tree’s branches will cover the entirety of the Planet it is rooted in, completely blocking cosmic rays and absorbing them for extra energy, as well as preventing anyone from leaving the planet. Thanks to the rules of this World this doesn’t prevent the day/night cycle from existing, even with no sun in the sky, but that may not be the case in future jumps. Additionally, it can serve as an incredibly potent vessel, with a fully grown Fantasy Tree being capable of giving you a Celestial Rank vessel, although a freshly planted one might be a couple Ranks weaker. Additionally, while growing, it can generate about a dozen seeds for itself, flying things tougher than steel that look like a sphere attached to an upside down circular pyramid. These either patrol the surroundings of the Fantasy Tree or hunt down whatever the Tree deems a threat.

And of course, it is capable of simulating a history according to ‘what-if’ parameters and manifesting it into reality as a Lostbelt. The Lostbelt itself will be separated from the rest of reality by the Storm Walls, powerful storms that require not only dimensional travel capabilities but also some way of drilling through them, and which are very lethal for most life to be near. Additionally, the borders of the Lostbelt itself will be determined by how much the Fantasy Tree’s roots have spread, potentially covering an entire Planet. If it reaches such a global scale, it’ll be able to fully replace the timeline, no longer needing the Fantasy Tree to exist. If you would like some control over your Lostbelt, and be capable of carrying one to future jumps, please refer to the Return Of An Abandoned Fantasy section below. "
1305,,600,Qliphoth,DMC 5,Domain,"You have the ability to create a Qliphoth tree, which when sufficiently nourished, grows a fruit that imbues anyone that consumes it with divine demonic power. The demonic fruit created, depending on how much blood the tree has absorbed, is strong enough to make one equal to Mundus himself. Anyone who eats the fruit will become similar to Dante and Virgil in that they keep their base form, enhanced with immense power and regeneration, but also become able to use Devil Trigger to take on a demonic form. Should one already have this, then it will simply increase your power even further, perhaps even granting a new even more powerful form. It also able to heal any damage one has suffered. You and others can keep on taking fruits to increase your powers forever. Like Vergil, you have full control over the tree, and when you are finished with having it devour, you can make it disappear at will, until you call forth a new Qliphoth tree. Luckily for you, the tree won’t smell rotten and disgusting no matter how much blood and flesh it devours. The tree won’t take a thousand years to develop a fruit, instead taking around a month if left to gorge on an entire city. The tree also possesses the power to fuse the two different Worlds into one, like the Human World and the Demon World into one whole."
1306,,600,MY Velvet Room,Persona 5 Royal,Domain,"Don’t worry the MY doesn’t stand for a mad God. This is YOUR Velvet Room.

The Velvet Room is a place between dream and reality, mind and matter. Time has no meaning in this place. You could plan and fuse Personas for hours and in the real World only mere seconds would pass.

Its aesthetics revolves around the Heart of its Guest. It could take the form of just about anything ranging from an elevator, a limousine, or a prison maybe? It is always somehow related to your struggles or problems.

This truly is a strange place, but an incredibly powerful asset as well. With it you can interact with your Personas. You can fuse them to create new ones, strengthen them via sacrifices, put them in solitary confinement to cover their weaknesses, itemize for powerful equipment and tools or resummon ones you once wielded. There is also a button that allows you to activate a fusion alarm once per day through a ritual. During a fusion alarm, the Velvet Room will change from blue to red and an alarm will sound for the first seconds. In this state, all activities are enhanced. As such sacrifices will yield stronger stat boosts, itemization can create more powerful equipment etc.

However, an accident according is more likely the more actions you partake in during the alarm. Once an accident occurs or you press the button again, the alarm will deactivate.

The alarm can activate from alone as well after battles you have. You will gain an uneasy feeling whenever it appears so you know when to go.

There is also an area accessible where you can challenge yourself in special battles to hone your skills.

Lastly, you can summon the true Igor Post Jump. He may not aid you directly but is a good listener and will seek to guide you as best as he can with his advice should you ask him too.

The Velvet Room is accessible via a door in your warehouse but you can also open more gateways in reality with some effort. Only you and whoever you allow it to will be able to enter your Velvet Room."
1307,,600,The Light That Guides Mankind ,Persona 5 Royal,Domain,"Reality is unfair so you have decided... you will CHANGE it. Defy this cruel World so everyone can have joy, THAT is your Rebellion.

You have the ability to form your own Palace in reality. Only those with an extraordinary amount of Willpower, defences against illusion or reality-warping, will be able to see that Palace in reality aside of yourself of course.

You can design this Palace to take whatever shape and form you desire. Inside it will be a Treasure that when someone makes you aware of wanting to steal it will materialize. When its stolen the Palace will collapse and you will be unable to use the Power for the rest of the Jump. At will you can have the Palace be teleported into a different dimension away from prying eyes but to truly use its power you must bring it forth to reality. What is its power you ask?

If this Palace overlays with reality you can change reality itself. Raise the dead, change fates, it’s all possible here. Make existence eternal happiness if you so desire.

But... is happiness that never ends truly something joyous? Or is it more akin to the death of individuality, dream, change and humanity itself? 

Use that power wisely Jumper.

Boosted: The Power over your Palace has grown even greater. It may take much time, effort and research but your hold on reality can grow much further and your realm of the Collective Consciousness can grow to be as tall as Mementos itself, one day maybe even being able to hold all of humanity. You can now also easily summon and control Shadows in your Palace to do your bidding.

1308,,600,Sealing Mountain,Journey To The West,Domain,"The Five Elements mountain was used to seal Sun Wukong for wrecking Heaven, and it was later renamed to the Double Boundary mountain due to being on the edge of China. Should you have another uppity monkey you can’t otherwise deal with or just want a way to seal particularly troublesome individuals, you may have your very own Five Elements mountain. It doesn’t really exist until you call it down on someone, and through some strange trick you can transport anyone to anywhere you wish when you call it down, being able to trap someone under a mountain in the Southern Continent even if both you and the person you sealed were up in Heaven, for example. After this, a special paper will appear at the top of the mountain, which is what gives it its sealing properties in the first place. It’s fully resistant to natural weather, and will stay on place without issue indefinitely. Unlike how it looks, it’ll also be impossible to remove unless you allow someone to do so.

The mountain is also weirdly resistant to damage while the seal is in place, so you won’t need to worry about someone tearing it apart to free the prisoner. As a side note, it doesn’t really matter what abilities someone has, as long as they do not match or surpass you in power, they won’t be able to do anything once sealed. You can also let them be beneath the foot of the mountain, with their head and maybe their hands sticking out. This won’t compromise the security of the seal in any way, but it does let the prisoner talk with people who come near.

A few caveats. You only have one mountain, and it only works on one person. Any more sealed beings will be able to escape without much issue. You cannot move the mountain once it’s placed without lifting the seal, it’ll stay pinned in place for better or worse. The seal does nothing for its prisoner’s needs, so they may well starve if not fed. Undoubtedly not an issue should it matter. The mountain isn’t particularly big, but it’s still a mountain. If you drop it somewhere populated it will crush anyone in its radius. You cannot summon the mountain without a target to seal. And finally, once the mountain is summoned, you cannot unsummon and summon it again immediately, you must wait at least a year."
1309,,600,Rewriting The Book Of The Dead ,Journey To The West,Domain,"When one dies, they go to the Underworld to be judged by the judges of the Ten Kings, maybe by the Ten Kings themselves. Now, the Underworld has what is called the book of the dead, more of an archive really, that has the names and appointed lifespan of every living thing. Or, nominally every living thing. As you might expect, Immortals are scrubbed from these records, as they are in fact immortal. Now, even if you’re not Immortal yet, you’re able to benefit from this system to a limited degree.

Once per jump, when you die, you will find yourself in the Underworld, where an unimportant functionary will apologize to you, give you a tour of the Underworld that lasts for about an hour, then lead you back to where you entered the afterlife, at which point you’ll fall unconscious and then find yourself back in your body, alive and well again. Or at least where you died, should your body have been torn apart. During this tour of the Underworld you’ll have an opportunity to look at the book of the dead, and will be able to quickly find the names of anyone you know that is not ageless. In such a position, you’ll have the opportunity to tamper with or erase one name from the book of the dead, any more and the people supervising you will realize what you’re doing and stop you.

Scrubbing the name of someone from the book of the dead grants them eternal youth, given that they will stop aging at their prime and never die of ‘natural causes’. They’re still capable of being killed just fine, but death will never come to them on its own. You could also just give them a greater lifespan, able to give more years of life even to those who are already dead (in which case said person will be politely escorted back to the world of the living), or shortening the lifespan of someone you dislike. This is quite a lot of power over the dead, just make sure the Ten Kings never find out that you’re doing this, they’ll be quite angry, and they won’t let you look at the book of the dead again for the next 9 visits of yours."
1310,,600,Merkabah,Generic Angels and Demons,Domain,"The original Merkabah can be described as a divine vehicle, made of pure light in the form of sacred geometry shapes and capable of feats far beyond any machine built by mortal beings, that is used as God’s Chariot or even as His throne in some versions. By taking this item, you’ll receive a replica of this Merkabah. Your replica will also be a divine “space ship” made of hard light and, as it was designed to be used by equally divine beings, it’s large enough to transport comfortably a little over a hundred people. It’s also unbreakable to almost every attack from both inside and outside, with only beings like the Devil himself could theoretically have enough power to damage it. Despite needing no fuel and having seemingly no propulsion system of any form, your Merkabah has the ability to move at incomprehensible speeds, allowing it to almost instantly travel any distance, traveling even from one end of a universe to the other in a few minutes at most. Additionally, the Merkabah can also travel through the boundaries of the dimensions, allowing you to travel to other planes (being restricted only to those within the local multiverse until post-Spark) and even beyond the physical plane to ascend into the higher layers of reality."
1311,,600,Power of the Storm,Heroes of the Storm,Domain,"The Nexus holds great power and opportunity for those who embrace it’s design. Wouldn’t it be a shame to leave it behind in future worlds? With this, a lesser vortex of the Nexus’ power will coalesce around you, letting you channel and unleash it to recreate similar conditions and harness it’s transdimensional energies. A mundane man would have little power and precision-perhaps being able to glimpse other worlds and briefly create “rips” in reality that overlap a small patch of terrain with that world’s environment, bring a handful of heroes from another world or empower a trusted ally with the “experience” granted by the Nexus to reward it’s champions. 

And yes, with some effort you may be able to recreate or channel the power of the Dark Nexus. Be careful not to unleash what you cannot control.

But as your overall personal power grows, so too will your control over the Nexus energies vested within you. With the power and experience of a seasoned archmage or extremely gifted psion, you may be able to rip numerous heroes from other worlds to your side or even summon those from the original Nexus, augment all the heroes called to you by the Nexus in more refined ways and resurrect both others and yourselves from true death with its power-even tamper with the behaviour of the true Nexus, amplifying or dampening its unpredictable forces with your will.

The astounding feats of beckoning forth entire worlds to overlay the reality you are in, or shaping realms with your will complete with their own Singularities will likely take millennia to master without extremes of power unknown to the Nexus. Many more applications likely await your discovery, as you explore the boundaries between space and time."
1312,,600,Portal         ,The Elder Scrolls: Dovah,Domain,"There are few permanent portals that remain, especially after the Oblivion Crisis. Though originally a privilege allowed only to Alduin, you now own a portal into a chosen Realm, be it the eternal feasts of Sovngarde, or one of the many Daedric Realms. No inhabitants can cross over to your side without your express and willing permission, so that should ease some of your worries."
1313,,600,Large Island ,The Elder Scrolls: Dovah,Domain,"The island of Solstheim is a remote place, it has a long history of habitation by other races, but it has traditionally been primarily Nordic in influence. The southern half is relatively temperate, and houses the town of Raven Rock, as well as Fort Frostmoth. The northern half is more arctic in nature, with constant snow and large glaciers. In the center is a mighty temple, built around one of the six All-Maker Stones that dot the island. You are this island’s new master, with all who inhabit it bowing to your rule. Should you desire it, the southern half of the island may better resemble Morrowind, like it was after the eruption of Red Mountain."
1314,,600,Infinite Colour,D.Y.N. Freaks,Domain,"A golden eye implanted in place of one of your existing eyes. The Fragment of the Key and the Gate, Yog-Sothoth. One of the greatest of the Outer Gods confers one of the greatest prizes, granting you an incredible degree of control over the time and space of the universe you are currently in. You can warp time to extend a moment for infinity, create endless spaces between spaces, travel through time or just tear people limb from limb by warping and fragmenting the space that they find themselves in. It is impossible to keep you detained anywhere you do not wish to be, save for the use of the Silver Key."
1315,,600,Vein Revitalization,Final Fantasy XIV,Domain,"You’ve seen too many mines stripped bare, too many miners forced to migrate in search of another place to work, but even as minerals are being deprived, the crystals are revitalizing veins elsewhere in the world. So why can’t you harness that power as well?

You’ve worked around these crystals for so long that a portion of their power has rubbed off on you. With a massive sacrifice of magical power, you can infuse the earth around you with magic, revitalizing all of the veins nearby. However, the over saturation of magic in the affected ground will mean that the affected veins can’t be renewed with the same magic again for quite some time. Hey, at least you got a bit more out of the land that you did before."
1316,,600,Dark Glass,Horus Heresy: The Primarchs,Domain,"Within a hollow, planet-sized shell of reflective material lies an early prototype of the Imperial Webway Project. It contains a throne, similar to the Golden Throne on Terra, which any psychically gifted individual can seat themselves upon and open a door into the Webway. By studying this you can most likely understand how the miracle of the Imperial Webway was constructed, and perhaps even create your own Webway portals in future worlds without them."
1317,,600,Fortress of Crafting ,Elder Scrolls Online – The Vestige,Domain,"A large building containing several facilities that will help you create all kinds of items, magical or not. What kind of facilities? Well, the Blood Forge, a copy of a Dwemer Animunculatory, and similar places that will greatly increase your ability to infuse magical effects on inanimate –and not so inanimate- matter. Can be fused with the Estate to staff the facilities with Followers. In future jumps, new facilities will be added to the building, copies of the best research and technological facilities in the setting."
1318,,600,Secret Location,Elder Scrolls Online – The Vestige,Domain,"Your own personal pocket dimension, Jumper. By itself it is a copy of the isle of Artaeum, the very same where the Psijic Order is located, but you can change it to better suit your tastes if you want to. The place is cut off from the world unless you use a portal opened by a key that only you can use, and no force is able to breach this dimensional barrier. It also contains a library filled with arcane lore and several instruments that will help you in the study of magic, and any magical training done here will skyrocket your competence."
1319,,600,Alien God,Fate/Tale Of The Beasts,Domain,"It seems you were even more powerful than I previously thought. You’re not just a Beast anymore, but something similar to the Alien God itself.

Firstly, your body is incredibly durable. You could take a direct hit from a meteor from outer space and it wouldn’t even break your skin, much less actually hurt you. You're incredibly strong and agile as well. You could face all seven Grand Servants and come out with only some damage. And your power is so great that with great effort you can incinerate 99.99% of humanity.

You also have the incredible skill Gravity Manipulation, giving you a couple of abilities. Levitation is child’s play to you, and making building as light as a feather is easy. Furthermore, you can create blackholes with hardly any effort, and can even make them as big as the earth.

Secondly, you have the ability to create Fantasy Trees. Fantasy Trees are giant tree like constructs that maintains and allows a Lostbelt to exist. Your Fantasy Trees are extremely tall, extending far above the clouds and up into the atmosphere.

As the Fantasy Trees mature, they are able to shoot out Fantasy Tree Seeds. These Seeds have body’s harder than stone, can heal themselves, shoot off magical beams of energy, and explode if needed. The seeds help defend the Fantasy Tree. Though you will find that the Fantasy Trees are incredibly durable already, nearly impossible to destroy by most beings. Blows that will split mountains will barely break the skin of a Fantasy Tree. Though these trees can be weakened by events that happen in the Lostbelt, allowing them to be destroyed.

The Fantasy Tree’s also help overwrite proper human history and chooses the highest authority in the lost belt and turns them into a Lostbelt King. Being a Lostbelt King greatly increases one’s power and gives one the ability to help control the Lostbelt.

You can create a Fantasy Tree using Magical Energy, it will take a bit to make a Fantasy Tree, about a 1⁄4 of your total magical energy this perk gives you.

You can choose who becomes the Lostbelt King of your Lostbelt, you can even make yourself the Lostbelt King if you choose. People you choose to become Lostbelts King will feel a slight loyalty to you, but beware as they are very capable of betraying you.

Once a Fantasy Tree is fully grown, it does two things. Firstly, a fully grown Fantasy Tree will provide you with more magical energy, increasing the rate at which you receive magical energy.

Secondly, as long as a single Fantasy Tree remains standing, you will be immortal and impossible to kill. Just like the other Immortality granting perks, it doesn’t matter how much one damages your body, you’ll come back right as rain as long as one of your Fantasy Tree’s remains standing.

Lastly, In this case that you die this perk also serves as an extra life. Upon your death you are split into 4 copies. Each not only being as powerful as your original self, but each copy also has great control of Fire, Water, Earth, and Air respectively. Your copy of Fire has enough control to burn down a city, while your copy of Water can cause great floods and tsunamis. Your copies share all senses with each other, allowing them to share knowledge of what each other see’s and their situation no matter the distance.

In about a year's time as long as one of your copies is still alive you can return to your original form and can use this one-up again. And with some training you can split into your elemental copies without using the extra life if you desire."
1320,,600,The Unbelievable Jumper ,Marvel: Age of Krakoa,Domain,"If imitation is the highest form of flattery, then... I don’t know where I’m going with this. Anyway, this perk gives you my reality-bending powers at the level they were at in my first solo ongoing. That is to say, you can find the “edges” and “invisible walls” in reality in order to travel into a personal reality, a sort of blank white void, with pathways that you can use to travel through time to a limited but ultimately arbitrary degree in order to set up closed time-loops or be in two places at once, or you could use it to swiftly travel to other locations. Or just flat-out tear-open portals to the same if you’re desperate. You can also create constructs of people based on their earlier history or alternate versions of themselves, and get a vague idea of your potential future via some means available to you in your personal reality. I call mine gutter-space, access it by perceiving reality as a comic book, the pathways are comic issues which are also how I see my vague futures, and my constructs are made of comic book pages but yours can be anything that makes sense to you. And unlike me, you don't have to worry about an author turning these powers off midway through a series so you don’t outclass the rest of the team. Lucky bastard.

Boosted: Jumper Strikes Back 

Ah, yes, the purposefully overpowered version. Does this even make sense as coming from that Capstone Booster? Anyway, this gives you my powers circa the time I may or may not have accidentally retconned my own Origin story. In addition to all of the above in a form that we’ll just arbitrarily say is an order of magnitude stronger than before since exactly how strong I am is never made clear, you’ll also get the ability to “retcon” reality. When I do it it’s as a flashback but again, it can be whatever makes sense for you. In short, you just... Imagine something happening in the past and it happened. Now don't go crazy, you’re not changing actual history, you’re just adding to it, and the more “narratively significant” something is the less you can do to alter it. It’s also not 100% clear how permanent this is, I used it to kidnap the Hulk once but he found his way back to where he was easily enough. As a rule of thumb, the hard limit is how believable it is. Anyway, I’m gonna hand you back over to whoeveritis now.

You now have ownership of a replica of this paradisiacal island. Fruits that are able to grant eternal youth, cure ailments and bring back the deceased grow aplenty, and the food bowls and wine glasses here refill themselves. Exquisite gems grow on trees here, and the palaces on this mountain are made from gold and platinum. This isle follows you wherever you go and is always nearby, while being undetectable and unreachable through mundane means. Restores itself in your warehouse two months after being damaged or destroyed."

Within this mountain-fortress, hundreds of lesser demons and yaoguai are at your beck and call. This fortress contains a self-refilling food storage, full residences, barracks and armoury. Will be restored in your warehouse a month after destruction, with all its inhabitants intact."

This is stored as an attachment to your Warehouse for future jumps, though it can be brought out. Reconstructs itself two months after damage or destruction in your Warehouse.

And that is exactly what you did with this Item, being the proud owner of your own Sinner redeeming Hotel. It comes stacked with all amenities you may need and a self replenishing supply of food and water. Plumbing and electricity are of course included. It comes with a staff of followers that keep it clean and functioning in your absence. Should it be destroyed by your enemies, it will within 24 hours repair itself and be even greater as a result.

But of course the most important aspect of this Item is the goal of redemption. Its existence will quickly become common knowledge in any world you enter. Those seeking redemption or even just having the capacity too will seek you out. Some may do so just for the free room or to spy on someone but that won't stop them from being affected by the Hotel and yourself. Because in here, anything with the goal of getting to know someone better or helping them overcome some personal issues will be amplified noticeably. Redemption is possible here, if the guest in question really tries even on a cosmic and metaphysical level.

As a final note, any guest of the Hotel may become a follower or be made into a companion at your choice. 

Synergizes incredible well with Perks like Redemption."
1325,,600,Throne Worlds,The Destiny Universe,Domain,"The ultimate trump card for the Hive and the followers of the Sword Logic, Throne Worlds are areas of the Ascendant Plane carved out as pocket dimensions by those strong enough to do so. These areas are governed by laws chosen in totality by their creators, and are used as the refuge of the souls of their creators, ensuring that even should they die in reality, they can return to their Throne World to regain their strength and return to life. Depending on how powerful you are, this process can be quick, or it can take a very long time, the exact secrets, mechanics, and functions of the Throne World are known only to their creators, but it is known that ritual sacrifice can accelerate your recovery.

Your kind are the most well known creators and users of Throne Worlds, though it has been seen that other races have been capable of doing it, with Mara Sov even constructing hers out of a combination of Eris Morn’s Hive Magic and the Ahamkara Riven’s Wish Magic. By practicing the Sword Logic, you can become ascendant once you’ve gathered enough strength, and from there you can build your own Throne World. Your Throne World scales in size to your overall power, and increases in size as your power increases, without an upper limit - by achieving the requisite strength, you could very well create a planet-sized throne world, or perhaps even go further beyond and begin creating solar systems in the ascendant realm. While this is effectively a form of immortality beyond even what your Worm can provide, as it is a protection against death as opposed to a simple extension of life, it must be understood that should your enemies discover a way to enter your Throne World, they are directly attacking your soul - and dying while inside your Throne World is permanent, a chain-failure lacking other 1-Ups.

By purchasing this perk with CP, you automatically gain a Throne World without needing to carve one out yourself through the Sword Logic. Build it how you wish, from its base construction to its aesthetics to even the laws of physics - this realm is one primarily formed by your mind, and you are its master. Furthermore, you shall be granted a consistent recovery time for your Throne World - regardless of how strong you are, by spending five years in your Throne World, you will emerge fully healed, and at full strength. The caveat to this is that, much like death and resurrection by way of Ghosts, dying and being sent to your Throne World ‘freezes’ your Jump timer, and only by emerging from it will the timer resume. This does not extend to voluntarily entering your Throne World yourself - should you do so without having died first, the time spent inside still counts against the time you have left in your Jump. Finally, you will be granted a defense force charged with protecting you during your recovery, and the Throne World itself during your absence. While in this Jump, this defense force will initially be appropriate to your race and origin, or by Taken should you have that ability, following this Jump, you can import any armies or followers you may have to populate and protect it.

Boosted: Evertion                                         

Amongst the pinnacle strongest Hive, some have been known to completely evert their Throne Worlds, taking them from the Ascendant Realm and bringing them into reality. This was best seen from the Taken King, who, after killing his Worm God, converted its corpse into his venerable dreadnought, and then everted his Throne World inside of it, effectively turning his ship into his Throne World and ensuring that, even in death, he could still interact with reality and command his forces. This was further seen when the Lucent Brood attempted to do the same to Savathun’s Throne World, attempting to evert it in the Scarlet Keep on Luna, though they were prevented from doing so by the forces of the Last City.

You now have the knowledge and strength to perform this act without the enormous and combined efforts of an entire Hive Court. Anywhere you so choose, you can evert your Throne World and establish a beachhead on reality itself - and furthermore, you have the unheard of ability to reverse the process. With this ability, you can bring your Throne World with you anywhere you wish, be it in the shifting tides of the Ascendant Plane or within the very fabric of reality itself. Finally, by acquiring this ability through the capstone boost, this ability is given two more layers. Through an application of the Sword Logic, should you conquer territory in reality after everting your Throne World, your Throne World’s territory will expand to encompass this new area. Next, any territory you claim by successfully everting your Throne World, becomes a part of that Throne World upon reversing the process. Should you successfully conquer an entire planet, and then bring it back to the ascendant plane, that planet is yours, a permanent addition to the Throne World. Much like the size of the Throne World itself, this has no upper limit but for what you can take.

1326,,600,Spaceman,Miracleman,Domain,"Humanity knows more about the surfaces of Mars and the Moon than it’s own oceans. But do you know where the real final frontier is? Humanity itself. You’re a psychopharmaceutical astronaut, exploring the internal mindscape in your head. In a chemically induced meditative trace, you can enter your mind as if it were a physical location. Entire continents dwell within, ripe for exploration and discovery.

Becoming a Spaceman allowed you to view your mind and the greater reality in total clarity, achieving enlightenment as a sort of ‘super-sanity’. Almost nothing can be hidden from you, and you can see the future playing out as easily as most see the present. One glance at a person can give you detailed insight into their entire life, and you’d know exactly what advice to give them to change their lives as well as the answer to almost any question they could ask.

Actually conveying your answers and advice is another matter. Your speech is on another level, and even when you intentionally limit yourself you’re almost incomprehensible. You fit too many ideas into a single sentence for them to easily understand, using a modified version of English that’s more connotation than definition. Speaking normally is still possible, but very difficult, and you lose so much in translation that your words are ultimately meaningless, if grammatically correct.

Seeing the truth in reality isn’t all you can do. As your mindscape can now be physically reached, you’re free to alter your own mind as you wish, through long effort in reshaping your mental landscape. Manually removing bad habits and addictions, installing psychic defenses, meeting and interacting with any other identities and visitors in your head, viewing and editing your memories, and so on.

However, I must warn you; being dismissed as a lunatic isn’t your only concern. This wisdom and knowledge comes with significant dangers, as does any frontier. Spacemen have a high mortality rate. Many have become hopelessly lost deep within their minds, never to be heard from again, and an unlucky few made it back out...through the wrong exits, ones that didn’t lead to anywhere we would recognize.

Having an exceptionally strong sense of self or willpower, or vastly higher than normal intelligence or self-awareness, would allow you to traverse your mind free of the usual risk, as well as speak more easily with those that have less awareness than you."
1327,,600,Omniversal Travel ,Epic of Leviathan,Domain,"This is a rather simple ability, but one that has potential surpassing many of the other powers listed here. This power allows the user to freely travel throughout the Omniverse. During this jump you will be able to freely travel to any universe that you desire. After this jump you will be restricted to your local multiverse until you acquire your spark. At this point you will be able to travel to any reality that you dream of again."

Given the number of them, I'm sure no one would mind if you took one. The 600 CP option allows you to claim a single multiverse. This multiverse will be based around a single world and its numerous variations. You could choose one of the canon multiverses or you could create your own. The second level is to take this one step further."
1329,,600,We’re in a Comic Right Now,Epic of Leviathan,Domain,One of the reasons that characters like Deadpool and Gwenpool are loved by fans is their fourth wall breaking abilities. Gwenpool however was able to take this power a step further and after she realized that she lived in a fictional world. By taking this perk you can acquire her ability called Medium Interaction. You gain the ability to turn your life into a comic book. Some examples of what you can do are reaching across panels and interacting with other versions of yourself on the same page. You will gain access to a dimension called the Gutter Space. While in this space you can move to previous pages essentially traveling through time and allowing you to grab people and artifacts from the past. An example of what your upper limits are would be retconning yourself into another dimension to avoid being killed off. There is a link in the notes providing more information on this power.

The soil of this garden will grow plants even if a plant needs specific requirements to grow and survive. The crowning feature of this garden is the apple tree that grows at its center, as this tree produces golden apples that have the power to restore someone to their prime and increase their natural lifespan."
1332,,600,Gaia’s Swamp ,Kult: Divinity Lost,Domain,"This particular doorway leads you to a true archipelago, girded by stormy seas which lead straight back to the island after a few dozen miles and an extraordinary sky lit with all manner of dynamic celestial phenomena. The moon shines forever over the onyx temple it leads into, where flowers hang heavy with nectar nearby. Fit for an Enwildened God’s needs, the peace near this building is unique-for elsewhere, all the bounty and fury of Gaia rages around you. Howling abominations battle each other for precious flesh. Certain plants threaten to strangle any lifeform that stays still for too long. Dreamlike visions can see you physically floating through the sky, as galaxies whirl, sunder and reform above you. And all around you a pervasive, primal aura makes you in tune with nature: You feel strong, potent and powerful in this land, wounds fading swiftly-while your libido and will to dominate are stoked ever higher, easily making you drunk on the testosterone pounding in your veins.

The supernatural fauna and flora you could harvest here have applications as varied as their dangers; even the sentient tumours or parasitic worms that infest some animals can be harvested for serums that bestow unnatural regeneration for example, and treated correctly the water of some pools can bestow life as easily as it takes it. Perhaps most valuably, when you hunt (or at least, enforce your dominance on the environment) and reproduce with extraordinary success you may draw the attention of Gaia as her greater consciousness lumbers around in the worlds beyond. Though atavistic and unpredictable, the boons that could be solicited from her are the forces of nature elevated into the realm of divine will."
1333,,600,The House That Hell Built ,Kult: Divinity Lost,Domain,"Priests of a sort to the Death Angels’ divinities, the nepharites are widely feared for their ability to create what is known as a purgatory: An extradimensional personal realm custom made to inflict suffering on a specific individual, and often a nightmarish experience for anyone else caught up in it. Whether or not you are a nepharite, somehow you have become the locus of a particularly elaborate purgatory which you may deploy at will which is tied to you personally-though those already immersed in suffering such as the mentally disturbed are easier to suck into it. Within you have immediate awareness of any intrusion into this realm, and all demonic powers or those otherwise allied to Inferno’s principles of suffering are empowered by the sweet, sweet torment that resonates in this personal dimension. You are also greatly empowered in all mystic arts that create similar pocket realms, especially those that similarly have an element of torment and punishment woven into them.

Though all powerful nepharites can create purgatories at will, your particular purgatory is especially elaborate, encompassing truly grand scale and having just about any mundane luxury you could desire-as well as all the mundane torture instruments you could ever want. Even a small army of other nepharites has gathered here, who seem to regard you as their lord and master with the obedience of those who know disobedience means excruciating agony beyond mortal imagination. Each is bound to this purgatory as if to Inferno, and are willing to try and catch your soul to painstakingly, agonisingly save you (or perhaps others, if marked by rituals) from all but the most dire deaths by reforming you here."
1334,,600,The Shard of Heaven ,Kult: Divinity Lost,Domain,"This particular door in your Warehouse leads to somewhere inexplicably beautiful, yet undeniably within true reality. A pleasant, vaguely Mediterranean archipelago-like land with broken marble buildings and crumbling pale statues, a close examination will find that it’s verdant greenery does not grow and there seems to be an ominous air hanging about this place. The great mists that veil it’s outermost boundaries lead straight back to where you walked into them after a short stroll in their shadowy dampness Was it a kind of diorama the Demiurge built to mock the human conceptions of Heaven? Or a genuine refuge he constructed for humans he took pity on?

Angels of all kinds seem to flock to this place in uncertain, bedraggled droves- enough to make a small army. Their numbers vary, but when they dip below a certain amount sooner or later new ones come stumbling or flapping in from the mists, freshly disorientated and traumatised from their lords’ absence or infighting. Curiously, whatever choir they used to be all seem to be of a form appealing to your desires-everything you would want from a loyal guardian, dignified herald or worshipful supplicant. Upon seeing you, all flock to you with the manic desperation of the faithful whose prayers have been answered. The Demiurge’s last order, they claim, was to obey the word of the first being to visit here and sit upon their throne. Desperate for a purpose in life, they will practically beg for you to be that being-offering all aid to fly you onto that giant marble throne and back again if need be, so you can qualify by technicality. So anointed, they will serve you with equal zeal in other realities despite what wounds or burdens they suffer.

Oh right, the throne. The crumbling marble throne at the centre of the archipelago stands several miles high, and is guarded by four comparatively small angels who are each nonetheless the size of skyscrapers each stoically positioned in four cardinal directions. To most, it emanates a sense of profound lost. But oddly, though it has no other special powers once you sit on it those within sight of the throne are filled with a soothing, saintly contentment. Truly it has no other great gifts and isn’t even particularly comfortable to sit on, but it can’t be denied you look damn good on it despite any possible size difference."
1335,,600,A Temple and a Labyrinth,Kult: Divinity Lost,Domain,"You wanted security? Prosperity for your people? Alas, the cosmos is not kind and the only thing the Children of the Underworld can reliably gather in quantities is nothing. Literally. Here and in future worlds will you gain ownership of a black temple of iron, rock and steel with the true purpose of being a seal against nothingness. No light can be lit nor any flame burn in the oblivion that wafts up even into this structure, and so distorted are the laws of physics that even gravity and acoustics can become unreliable. Pass the temple into the labyrinth below, and witness time and space itself begin to dissolve. Everything is slowly reduced to a grey, depleted mass possessing neither color nor shape, shifting in spiral movements as it slowly pours into the sinkhole at the bottom of the universe. Memories fade. Reality is quietly torn and shredded. Long before you discover what waits below, if you come without protection you risk losing more than your life.

Why would anyone want this desolation? Perhaps because as destruction in its purest form, all powers of death and the void surge in strength when performed within it, drawing on the devastation that Achlys promises. Furthermore, it is at the heart of this place that She Who Waits Below can be contacted in dreams. Her forms are as numerous as they are unsettling: A glowing eye in an amorphous chaos, tender leaves floating on dark water, a fetus with its umbilical cord tight around its neck, a bloated female body reclining in the dark or other unsettling aberrations. In all forms, she calls for those with emptiness to come to her and works towards the cessation of all existence-though she is in no particular hurry. You are, you intuit from your nightmarish visions of her, something akin to a saint or high priest to her. Bring sacrifices down to the labyrinth below and you will be rewarded with power from the void. Like the Ones Without Names, who can discharge annihilating nothingness within themselves discharged as a black flood. Even as dark pacts go this relationship is fraught with risk-but then again the mere reputation of your working relationship could cow many in this world."
1336,,600,A Taste of Metropolis ,Kult: Divinity Lost,Domain,"Atop 7,777 hills rests humanity’s primordial home: Dead, empty and quiet. From horizon to horizon, a shadowy sprawl of dark urban wonders winds out in an endless maze of architectural wonders-equal parts decadent villas and grand temples, as well as often built on grander scales than mortal men were made for. The sun never rises to clear it’s blue-grey, dusky light and the black stone and metal of this realm carries with it a great weight that lies beyond time itself. It is the archetype of all urban development that humanity has tried to recreate over millennia within the illusion imperfectly, and much of it adheres to no physics seen in the Illusion: Shadows move by themselves while feeling deep and cold to the touch, falling from tall buildings can see gravity and inertia lose their hold on a traveller midway through the fall to land safely and in some parts buildings seem built upside-down towards a sky below them. And whether you are an usurper, interloper or reclaimer it seems that a great section of Metropolis has been apportioned off into its own plane of true reality under your sole sovereignty. A doorway in your Warehouse opens up to a mere slice of Metropolis. A plane of true reality with uncertain exterior boundaries approaching those of several among Earth’s largest cities, but one unquestionable yours and yours alone.

Every earthly luxury and many forgotten from human memory can be found somewhere within this segment of the Metropolis-though be warned, many entertainments made for gods may prove too extreme for the mortal mind to bear. Several species of skilled servants have been maintaining everything in top condition and fending off what dangers were not so powerful as to overlook this plane entirely and through some mix of fear and broken, conditioned loyalty heed your wait on your every word-the warriors among them on par with the likes of Azghouls while the entertainers are as beautiful as Azadaevae or the Ephoria before their beauty rotted. Certain specialists may resemble the biomechanical Curatorids who measured human slaves, the slumbering Magistrates and the mechanical Constructors.

The city itself has a profound, deep influence on visitors-though the security of your ownership ensures you will never be changed in ways you would dislike. In time you may learn to exploit its existence outside time and space to use this plane as a shortcut to other locations and eras in lower order realities such as those resembling the Illusion, but the true prize lies in the infrequent but easily spotted temples scattered throughout your city. Each contains an incarcerated god laid low by mankind and sealed away so thoroughly into the city, that they cannot be freed unless another were to liberate them from their sealed vaults or gift new life to the tombs in which their bodies ache with desire. To bargain with such beings is fraught with risk despite the ravages to their minds and bodies, but they would surely be grateful to any who saved them from such agony-or perhaps, deeply cowed by whoever laid them there. And whether or not this is a sinister hint at why they were bound to begin with, such beings tend to be of a form, nature and endowed with powers you would find desirable."
1337,,600,A Distant Vortex ,Kult: Divinity Lost,Domain,"A majestic whirlpool of chaotic images, emotions and impressions bares itself to you in your dreams, whorls of transient human spirit intermingling with chaotic images, emotions and impressions. At least, it does when you perform the simple rite before slumber that permits you egress to this notional realm. This is the Vortex: The nucleus where mankind’s collective unconsciousness comingles the souls of all humanity, and a font of endless wisdom and insight. It is a place of great power, in which higher dimensions can be more easily perceived and restrictions such as the Demiurge’s shackles can be better unlocked. Knowledge from previous existences rewind and flicker here, and in times past new life was kindled into forlorn beings yearning for attention-but to come too close to the Vortex is to risk being torn asunder, extinguished or transformed into an insane dream creature by humanity’s burgeoning power. Still, from the ruin of a dream-world bound to your imagination you can safely observe the Vortex from there is much you could learn, and master over time. Both powerful supernatural beings and masters of the Lore of Dreams could gain much from the lost knowledge of dreams.

In this world you merely have a safe vantage point to learn amidst the bickering of the Dream Princes and the dangerous beings spawned by humanity in its divine state. But in future worlds a mere spark of the Vortex will follow you containing all that you have learned and dreamed without the danger of Dream Princes or insane beings to harm you. Instead, the Vortex-sherd will gather strength from the dreams of sentient lifeforms in other worlds-through which you can safely parse their knowledge, spirit and innermost expressions of their hopes and dreams."
1338,,600,Incarnate Oubliette ,Kult: Divinity Lost,Domain,"The Citadels of the Archons in Metropolis are the nodes of their power, a kind of broadcast for the system of principles they form the Illusion out of and what can be considered each Archon’s true form all at once. You’re no Archon but something about you has allowed you to apply a similar principle. When you build (or supervise the construction of closely) a large structure imbued with iconography and symbolic representations of yourself, it becomes a divine symbol of your power and influence-amplifying it like a radio signal to subtly but constantly bend reality in your image. Praise and submission to your person nourish you better than finest meat and trick, bolstering your supernatural powers beyond mortal measure. Within your influence is much more direct, such that you could bend space and time into all manner of non-euclidean structures with your will alone-or weaving complex rituals at will, and creating powerful divine defences only partially comprehensible by mortal minds.

At the most basic level it functions as a kind of subliminal indoctrination, reweaving thoughts and tilting senses towards submission to you. But given time those behavioural compunctions become as immutable as any law of nature, and can even interfere with abilities or forces that contradict the principles they express. While such structures are far from the Illusion-defining Citadels in power they could still cover many miles in broadly stated telepathic commands, manipulate the weather and create simple structures serving your purposes overnight. Furthermore, within the building’s chambers you share the Archons’ dirty little secrets: The oubliettes of oblivion through which you can devour souls. Those deeply bound by their loyalty to you may have their souls banished to these rooms, where in diving into their own memories to escape the void they unwittingly feed you a steady trickle of the divine power that strengthens the Archons as their experiences rise to the forefront and are consumed by you. Should you be merciful though, at will you may designate another destination in your pseudo-Citadels for them to arrive at instead, or redirect them to another afterlife you have sway over-or simply cancel the binding altogether.

Boosted: While some deific beings may be more well-known than others and have specialities others lack, all are considered moderately powerful for their kind-for now. You may define your divinity through the lens of certain extensive investments you have made here, gaining advantages your peers likely lack as described below:

Incarnate Oubliette: Look upon your works, ye mighty, and despair. While previously you could only build pseudo-Citadels, glorified amplifiers meant to crudely emulate the Archons’ divine power, you’re now much closer to their cosmic stature. With a complex ritual, you may bind yourself to one of your pseudo-Citadels, abstracting your physical form into its foundations to truly merge with it. While you lose your physical traits in this state, your supernatural and mental abilities are amplified such that nearly all of them can be emulated; moving your building-body between realities would be easy, and as it gathers strength for you it may become more elaborate, complex and full of useful facilities to you in accord with your values. Your spirit and construction will continue to merge and unlock new powers related to the literal bastion of your divine power. In time, you may learn to transcend the need for a physical construct altogether and simply recreate your Citadel-body around you-though it would take far greater effort and influence to wield such power over the Illusion as the Archons themselves enjoy.

Henceforth, no seal or restraint can so much as touch you without evaporating like morning dew exposed to the rising sun. With a simple rush of the resolve to seize your freedom, locked prison doors open soundlessly and straightjackets loosen. Even seals as great as the principles of the Archons or the inertia of the Illusion can only stifle your powers for months without your active effort and investigation, and when you strive to learn the truth your fetters may erode in days. It may still take some time to actually leave the institution imprisoning you or navigate the realms beyond reality’s veil, and you may yet face the consequences of your gaolers’ displeasure if they discover you. But be assured that henceforth, your volition is preserved against all forces that would stifle it.

Humanity Unchained: What good is freedom with nobody to share it with? Henceforth you may liberate others from seals, illusions or constraints of other kinds simply by sitting and talking through their issues. This is no mundane feat of escapology, but a combination of psychology and ritualism that empowers others with a fraction of your own internalised liberty to find their own escape or reclaim their inner potential. Even a prisoner shackled by ball and chain, behind iron bars, on an island in the middle of a stormy sea could be guided safely to freedom if they trusted you enough.

White sand beaches surround this Mediterranean paradise, and powerful illusions protect it from sight unless you will them to dim. The animals here are a varied and numerous lot that are also incredibly obedient to you, and at the centre of the island rests a palace of marble more luxuriously furnished and decorated than any in the mortal world-spanning more than 3000 years of craftsmanship. Immortal servants of your choice on the scale of nymphs of incredibly skilled immortal humans attend your every whim, and some may have unique powers such as the Fate-reading powers of a sibyl. Yet all of that is put to shame by the divine power that runs in this island’s fauna and flora. Any non-pantheon specific Purview application can, eventually, be duplicated through the correct mix of ingredients into potions from this island- though naturally, more powerful effects will be take more complex potions. Furthermore the wood of this island can be hewn into a wand capable a powerful transformation on touch, such as reducing mortals to animals permanently-or even divine beings without great endurance and inner strength. Such items function for you alone, and have no magical properties outside your grasp. This land is not just a palace for you, but also very much your lair and killing ground."

The vast laboratory complex hidden thousands of feet below a location of your choice you now own is an exemplar of the many projects she sows throughout the mortal world, seeking to create ever greater monsters (though mercifully, having never recreated horrors on par with her children by Loki). The complex includes enough supplies and modern weapons to outfit a small army, even a giant army should you wish, and indeed a small army (again, one composed of the more common giants if you wish) takes orders from you while guarding it. However it’s real prize is the wealth of biological horrors within. Vast fluid-filled tanks and cocoon-like sacs vary in size from human to blue whale. Organic vine-like tubes riddle the facility, and great supplies of nutrients and unknown chemicals suitable for augmenting Titanspawn or even combining their traits into ever more monstrous forms are regularly shipped in by a mysterious benefactor at your behest. Within weeks, along with a deep knowledge of biology it would be possible to produce everything from giant acid-spitting lizards with human heads, to whale-sized masses of melded flesh every inch the equal of a Hekatonkhiere-and while this facility does come stock an extensive supply of relevant reading material, one prominent shelf in particular contains instructions on various conditioning techniques to keep your creations loyal. With time and skill, it may be possible to overrun the mortal world with monsters-although conquering the Overworld with them is probably far harder."
1342,,600,The Keys to Durance Vile ,Scion ,Domain,"That foul, wretched place. Do you really want that responsibility? If the Colossus is the Touchstone that stands for freedom, than Durance Vile is the Touchstone born from the Tower of London, the Bastille, every salt mine and concentration camp there has ever been. It personifies the place where men go to Hell while yet living, and resembles a small, rocky island like Alcatraz. No swimmer can reach the mainland vaguely visible in the distance, and the island’s air ranges from as hot and heavy as the Devil’s island to the chill of a Siberian gulag. Fences of stone, concrete or barbed wire cross it at random. And at its centre squats a lumpen quadrangle maze of a building, filled with all the tools of interrogation and facilities of every prison there has ever been-everything from medieval torture chambers to equipment for electroshock and lobotomy. Eldritch, inescapable hounds straight out of the Wild Hunt patrol the island, and worse-a cruel warden surveys the prison. His appearances changes between every icon of authority there has ever been, but in every form his eyes are cold, gray stone like his heart. He is a being on par with a god, yet though they sometimes employ him they do not speak of his origins. He is immortal as long as prisons exist, and anything he claps in restraint personally simply cannot break free. It would take powers of interplanar transportation such as a certain Psychopomp power, an Avatar transformation or killing the Warden to free oneself from the prison-and all pantheons are wary enough of the consequences to treat it as neutral ground, for should the unthinkable happen Fate itself would demand another take the Warden’s place.

You, happy fool that you are, have somehow come into ownership of Durance Vile without needing to be the Warden. You even own a set of keys that permits you to enter and exit the place from any door, and a visitor’s pass proving your status. In fact, to the man’s bewilderment he appears to take orders from you now. Be careful with the clout you now wield. This is the place the gods use to imprison their enemies, or their less civilised kin."
1343,,600,The Apples of Idunn,Scion ,Domain,"A wondrous orchard is now yours, full of marvellous trees with precious fruit. While normally the joy and power of the Aesir goddess Idun herself nurtures these beauties, some other force sustains them on your behalf. Thus, you own a supply of the famous apples of immortality equal to the one that supplies all of Asgard. Within seconds of eating one, a mortal returns to the biological state of their early 20s if they’re older than that, and find all their wounds, physical ailments and diseases restored to perfect health. Even gods and other immortal beings are bolstered by the apples; their vitality is bolstered for weeks after eating a single apple, their Legend is completely restored and their will refreshed and the Legend cost to activate the next few instances of any divine power short of an Ultimate attribute or Avatar form is utterly waived. Each apple is an infusion of divine power, and the source of Asgard’s heroic resolve."
1344,,600,Grimalkin,Fate/Faerie Britain,Domain,"A power that once belonged to the lord of Darlington, Grimalkin, but is now possessed by Tam Lin Tristan. But your power is not the degraded version of the Tam Lin, but equal to the original—your movements have taken on the attributes of a cat. That is to say, you can now move with complete silence, your steps have become lighter, and you are faster. But no cat was ever so fast as you, who are capable of circumnavigating the planet in a single day, accelerating to full speed in an instant, and making impossible turns with an agility that defies logic."
1345,,600,Ginnungagap,Germanic/Norse Mythology,Domain,"An empty land, a place all your own, either within one of the nine realms or close by, connected through the world tree. This place is yours, as a mortal it would be a kingdom, as a god, a full realm equal to the other nine. It will start in a state of your choosing with buildings, halls, ports, towns, cities, and natural features however you like. It may even be populated by a race like yours, as a mortal of other skin, as an elf of similar stock, or a new tribe of gods equal to the others depending on what you chose to be. You are free to change the place over time, within your power. You make the laws of this land and can bar entry as you so choose, the people and denizens of this land will never revolt against you or attempt to harm you but they may try to leave and if you kill them all off they won't be able to repopulate. This is a private dimension and like how the asgardians use the bifrost to move from realm to realm you can always open a ""bridge"" into your realm and return to this home, permanent bridges or paths to and from your realm can be established or destroyed at your leisure.

Boosted: Not enough I see, you want your own entire cosmology. You are now a dimension lord with over 9 full dimensions or realms connected through your Yggdrasil tree as you see fit. Like any dimension lord you are safe within your realms and nigh-omnipotent. Each realm can be its own ever expanding universe like our real world, or a fantasy keep disk upon a turtle's back, or simply a floating city any way you like them. They will be mostly mundane, based on normality within norse myth, but with every jump you visit the realms can freely pick up new features as you desire. If you went to marvel, vibranium, adamantine, and uru would be available within your realms or mythril if you went to a Tolkien setting. Any substances you would purchase from those jumps in the future could be provided to you in endless amounts over time. You can not take out anything from your realms into the main jumps that you have created with your nigh-omnipotent gifts within your realms, unless you have your spark. That includes cheating at any part such as just making a bunch of new vibranium bricks appear before you, or even locating the materials in the wild or saying your whole realm is just made of vibranium. As long as you are just using your non dimension lord powers, perks, gifts, skills, and tools from this or other jumps the items or army you craft and build are fair game to take into the normal universes. Your realms can take on properties not just materials, from new jumps, such as dimensions composed of magic particles, or that are constantly suffusing negative matter, but you can not alter it from how those universes actually behave in their jumps without it being counted as using you nigh-omnipotence within your dimensions.

Seriously, open a window or something. The uses of this are that you can skip enemy turns, pause time to get free hits off on people and summon yourself from your own backstory, as well as freeze time completely. The cooldown for this is three seconds out of combat, and three rounds when in combat, or if the current world doesn’t have turn-based combat, eighteen seconds. You also have such powerful farts that you could substitute for an air compressor for the purposes of things such as sandblasters."
1347,,600,Mysterious Floating Island,Cultivation Chat Group,Domain,"You have gained possession of a large floating island brimming with spiritual energy. It’s hidden with formations put in place by a ninth-level sage, making it nearly impossible for anyone to find it without your permission. Additionally, those who try to leave the island without your permission will have their memories relating to the island sealed."
1348,,600,Inner Lotus World,Cultivation Chat Group,Domain,"You have your own inner world, initially the size of two football fields or so with the potential to grow larger. It’s a part of you, an ability as much as a possession. With it, you can stir the power of space a bit, teleporting yourself or others inside it, even before you’re a Tribulation Transcender. Inside it, you’re more powerful, or rather the world is yours and works towards your will. You aren’t all powerful - Cultivation goes against the Heavens after all, and your world is smaller than the Heavens.

The number of ways you can use your world - as a foundation, as a tool, as a refuge - are numerous enough that we can’t hope to list them all."
1349,,600,Your Toybox,A Wild Last Boss Appeared!,Domain,"Much like how the Seven Heroes went to create their own nations, you too are the rightful king of a nation of similar scale. It is quite relevant in the politics of the world, and home to hundreds of thousands of individuals at least. Your capital is quite fortified, as it is needed to stand the attacks of the demonkind nowadays. It is also protected by a powerful monster, who is loyal to you, capable of facing at least some of the weaker Twelve Tyrant Stars for a time, with a level around the 800s. If this guardian magical beast is damaged or destroyed, it can repair itself after some time using the natural resources around your nation."
1350,,600,Jumper’s Tower ,A Wild Last Boss Appeared!,Domain,"A gargantuan construction inspired by the fortress that Ruphas and her followers erected. A black tower that reaches up into the skies, without any entrance in the lower floors, basically forcing anyone but yourself to enter using flight. It is not only stocked with high quality materials and supplies of all kinds, but its interior is big enough that it could size an entire nation worth of people inside of it. It is also quite resistant, as it could even survive the destruction of the planet."
1351,,600,Ophiuchus’ Clock,A Wild Last Boss Appeared!,Domain,"One of the signature powers of the Goddess’ avatar, the ability to manipulate time. Normally this power is so unfair that only the proxy of the Goddess should be able to utilize it, and as such it is a skill that is given a Priority Level 6. Somehow, you have also granted use of this power as well.

It is divided into two skills: First is the [Yed Prior] skill, which allows the user to separate a target’s time from their surroundings’, and then speed up their separated time without an upper limit. Effectively, this skill can age things without limit, and it could potentially bring the target to the end of time itself, transcending it. Albeit there is very little that could survive such a thing.

The second part is the [Yed Posterior] skill, which also separates the target’s time from their surroundings, but instead it is decelerated without limit. At some point, the time flow will stop entirely for the victim. If the user continues to decelerate even further, it will turn into a time rewind, which eventually will rewind the target into the point that they didn’t exist.

If combined with the X-Gate skill, you may also use it to open X-Gates to specific points in time, allowing you for a more controlled and free-form time travel."
1352,,600,X-Gate,A Wild Last Boss Appeared!,Domain,"In its essence, this ability allows for the manipulation of space by connecting Divine and Arcane magic. But its most common usage is the creation of portals, holes in the space-time continuum that allow to instantly connect two distant points in space. Albeit this is not the limit of its potential, for applications such as sealing objects or attacks in the space between worlds via other skills like [Subspace Seal], or escaping outside of space to dodge or hide one-self are some entirely possible applications of this power. Even using the sub-space created between the X-Gates as a stupidly large inventory of sorts it is possible.

The scale of these portals also increases with your own magical power. At some point, you would even be able to transport entire cities, and as your power increases, it wouldn’t be impossible to think of moving the entire humanoid population of Midgard. The only limitation is that living targets must consent in order to be transported.

Normally, the usage of this ability is quite limited in this world, as it requires the usage of both arcane and divine magic, which makes it hard for races that are incompatible with one of the types of magic to use or learn it. Luckily for you, you seem to have gained a compatibility to both at least to the level of being able to use this skill with the same potency as Dina, regardless of what your race was.

The range of the X-Gate is not limited to the world you find yourself in, or even the same universe. If the destination is known, it can even open gates to other universes across the space-time continuum. It should be possible to even open a X-Gate just by having a rough idea of what you are seeking, such as the Hero Summoning ritual, which is just a subspecies of this skill."
1353,,600,Gaia’s​ ​Favorite​,Demon:​ ​The​ ​Fallen,Domain,"Your ties with Mother Nature are undeniable, and She delights in easing your burdens. She may speak to you in some strange wordless way when your flesh meets natural ground, and it is easy to feel Her love, or if She is hurting. She will subtly give you aid in whatever way She can. This can be through the flora and fauna of the world guiding you and offering you gifts, or even the very weather itself slowly changing to suit your needs over time. Once per jump if you call out to Her and give to Her a portion of Faith, all the natural world will come crashing down on an enemy in a way that can only be described as Apocalyptic."
1354,,600,Pocket world,Cradle V1,Domain,"You gain an empty pocket world. Please create this in the traveler’s gate territory creation guide.

1356,,600,Samara’s Ring ,Cradle V1,Domain,"We’re actually selling this? Fine by me. You now own your own copy of the mountain and buildings of the Heaven’s Glory School. While the buildings and land are nice, the really important part is the ring itself, a giant bound circle of light madra that allows you to cycle light aura at anytime of day or night. You can choose to summon the mountain by you anytime, just be wary of where you’re placing a mountain. If it gets destroyed or broken, you can’t summon it by you for a year and a day. This can be part of your warehouse after this jump or will found somewhere in your next jump. Any personnel with the school (students, teachers elders, remnants) and you can upgrade it."
1357,,600,Elder’s labyrinth,Cradle V1,Domain,"You gain a copy of the ancient, possibly endless labyrinth that has entrances everywhere in the world. Filled to the brim with Archlord and above relics from the shallowest depths, it will agitate the Dreadgods if you take anything from here within the jump, but after this jump, you are free to plunder to your hearts content, and it will update with treasures from every world you will visit or have visited. Like a less convenient gate of Babylon. If you can conquer in the ten years’ time, then I will condense it into something more resembling a second warehouse so you can more easily access everything."
1358,,600,Upon the Fields of Avalon,Fate/Hollow Ataraxia,Domain,"As an immortal spirit, you have fought long and hard for your cause. You have earned your place among the heroic spirits, but even then you have earned far more. You may create your own version of an afterlife with this perk. You may design it however you want, but nothing done, seen, nor heard can be taken out of it. This means that, should you exit this “afterlife,” you will remember nothing of what took place while you were in it. You can only enter this afterlife upon death; if you have perks that allow you to come back to life, you may choose to be resurrected when you are done living in your afterlife. Time stands still while in the afterlife if you are not permanently dead (otherwise it’s 1-1 with your reality), so no time will pass aside from what happened once you died to the point that you come back to life. It is possible for others to enter your version of the afterlife, but in order to do so they must qualify for heroic spirit status, and even then... Should you actually die permanently, you may choose to abolish this “afterlife” if you so desire. Every time you end up in the afterlife, you will regain your memories of time spent previously in it (as well as any and all memories you may have forgotten or lost somehow). Note that this “afterlife” does nothing to help bring you back to life (you must already possess a way to resurrect before dying or have someone in the real world resurrect you). This perk does absolutely nothing on its own to prevent your chain from ending. People in your afterlife may leave it whenever they desire but will be ineligible to come back unless they left because they came back to life. To be clear, your afterlife can be most anything that you want (so long as you’re not trying to abuse this perk somehow to gain far more than what is clearly intended).

Boosted: Your custom “afterlife” has now become an alternate dimension instead. While able to function as the above if you so desire, you can now enter and exit it freely. Those who qualify may also be brought along, though the restriction on bringing or taking things from the afterlife still exists. While you won’t be able to remember what happened during your time in this dimension, you will be able to access vague memories through your dreams (this can’t be affected by any perks; the memories will always be vague). Additionally, should you acquire or already possess a full fledged religion of your own, you may make this afterlife an official afterlife of your religion where all of your followers go when they die. You may optionally section off your afterlife into divided spaces based off of whether someone was eligible to be a heroic spirit or not (you may also connect these divided spaces as you desire).

1359,,600,Time Loop,Fate/Hollow Ataraxia,Domain,"You can create a 7 day timeloop at any point you want. You must set a condition that needs to be met in order to break said timeloop. Once set, this condition can not be changed and the timeloop can’t be broken until said condition is met. You and anyone else aware will lose all memory of said condition. You and anyone you specify will be aware of the timeloop. If said timeloop’s condition would be impossible to meet, the timeloop will not trigger. Shorter loops within loops are possible, but the first loop must always be 7 days. No powers, items, or anything can change these conditions for these powers (no impossible infinite timeloops, no longer timeloops, no protecting yourself from the timeloop, etc.).

Note: The longer a timeloop continues, the more people will become aware of it. Those with high levels in things like intelligence, wisdom, or perception will wake up quicker, with those who are experts or geniuses in such things becoming alert almost immediately. Timeloops have a minimum range of the average city size for the world you’re in and can encompass roughly twice the size of the Earth at maximum; time outside of the area affected by the timeloop will be paused, resuming only when the timeloop is broken, and always matching the point at which you leave the timeloop (so if you leave the loop on the 6th day, 6 days will have taken place as well outside of the timeloop, but if you break it on the first day then no more than perhaps a couple hours will have past). Additionally, these loops can not be cast on the same person for a minimum of 5 days, with the exception of the caster themselves. Meaning if you cast a timeloop in a city (e.g. Chicago), unless you remove every single person affected by the timeloop from your radius, you won’t be able to cast a timeloop in that city for 5 days (though you could go somewhere else, so long as there’s no one who was involved in the previous timeloop).

Boosted: You can now create timeloops for anywhere from 24 hours to 7 days and no longer have the 5 day cooldown. These timeloops work the same way as above, with one caveat: You can select only certain people to enter the timeloop (you don’t have to enter), and time in the timeloop will be linked to whatever time is passing for you on the outside. As an example: You lock an enemy in a 7 day timeloop with a condition that can be met to free them (remember, the condition must be able to be met to create a timeloop). They go through the timeloop 4 times. Assuming time is moving at the standard pace for you (it’s based off how you are perceiving/experiencing time), this means that they would appear from the timeloop 28 days later on your timeline. Please note that if you do this, you can only create such timeloops once every 7 days based off of the way you are experiencing time. An entity that is targeted by this capstone version of the skill will have a 5 day cooldown period before they can be affected by the capstone version again (the non-captsone version will still work on them).

Note: When using this capstone version of the skill, the timeloop becomes a sort of alternate dimension that simulates the initial world from before the timeloop. Those targeted will retain any changes accrued during their stay in the loop (things like scars, knowledge, etc. are all retained), but the world of the timeloop disappears. This does not apply should the caster of this skill also be part of the timeloop, in which case the world around you pauses until you exit the loop. This is because the perk is working off of the Jumper’s reality/time.

From this, all things that are came to be, and a small pool of this infinite ocean has come to be yours. By pouring your magical power into this pool, you can cause any object or physical thing to emerge. The value or power of the thing is limited by how much magic you pour into it, though no matter how much you try it cannot produce something that exceeds your own power.

This pool of water is roughly the volume of a large bathtub, and each thing created from it reduces its volume by a like amount. If completely expended, the Waters of Creation take the cycle of the moon to refill the pool."
1361,,600,Grand Temple,Egyptian Mythology,Domain,"This extensive and elaborate complex is the seat of power for any Worldly Neter, arranged with four critical parts.

The Pylon presents an imposing gateway in the outer wall; as long as the gateway still stands, no other godly being may intrude on the temple grounds or exert their power within.

The Courtyard may be arranged as you please, and may serve other purposes such as an informal marketplace, a comfortable and elegant waiting area where conversation and debate are welcomed, a training ground for warrior devotees, or some other area for relaxation, social business, commerce, craft, or learning.

The Outer Temple serves as a place for offerings to be left, and generates an income of gold, silver and other supplies based on your worshipper base. Such offerings might include food, the gathered weapons of fallen enemies, or materials suited to your spheres of influence or nature, such as ingots of copper and planks of rare wood if you were known as a craftsman.

The Inner Temple is a secluded chamber where you may wait comfortably with your priests and most notable of worshippers and supplicants, holding audience with them. You may see and hear what is going on in the Inner Temple at all times, even when you are not physically there, and you may cause your voice to issue from the walls or statues within it, even if you are actually many miles distant.

The Grand Temple attracts dozens to hundreds of visitors, though not necessarily worshippers, on a normal day, and tenfold that on your cult’s holidays and festival days."

Supreme in it, and while in it, you are effectively a god. You can reshape it to your liking, and draw an immense amount of power from it. Most other magicians, sans those of divine heritage, generally tap into the mystical energies of the dimension they’re currently inhabiting. You can do that, but you can also channel all the energy of your dimension into your spells. You may have this dimension merge with others you have or gain (except for the Cosmic Warehouse or its equivalents). To speak about your realm itself, you have a one-time opportunity to determine what it’ll be, starting with the terrain. It could be pretty much anything. A land of high mountains? A giant mesa above endless fog? Endless, verdant plains blooming with life? A roiling sea?

If you look, you’ll discover that your plane has no shortage of beings that live in it. If you are a zombie, so are they - you’re not going to get food that easily.There are various inhabitants of your territory, and all of them are magical beings of some sort. Maybe they’re demons, maybe they’re fae, or maybe you’re a degenerate and have chosen to populate your dimension with catgirls and kitsune that look like they came out of a gacha game. Whatever the case, these denizens have varying levels of power, but they’re all capable of beating several average people in a fight. The strongest could even give a hero some trouble, provided it’s a street-level hero and not someone like Thor. They’re all loyal to you, though it depends on the climate and type of creature. Demons will be much less loyal than magitech automata, for example. You may automatically teleport or generate gates to and from your realm."

However, they belonged to Solomon way back in the biblical times. You’d think that’d mean something, and you’d be correct. One has power over time, and can jump (pun intended) back and forth into the past and future, taking you and a few nearby passengers along for the ride. The other does the same, for space. It teleports you. When you hold both frogs, they synergize. Together, the frogs can accomplish what they can’t alone. You can travel through both space and time, or summon things to you. Their reach extends to other universes, allowing you to go there as well. The frogs look identical. I suggest you stick labels on them so you can tell them apart. I hope you’ve been paying attention. I’ve been referring to the frogs as they, and not just because of plurals. The Frogs may not appear like it, but they are sentient and have minds of their own. However, they are inclined to look upon you favorably. I wonder why?"

The sky and the very heavens above are at your command. If you’re not a fan of limiting yourself to electricity or ice, this is the catchall power for you, as you’re capable of much more than just generating and calling down massive bolts of lightning or blanketing entire areas in ice and snow. You can control air, too, and make winds blow however you like, whether that’s creating great hurricanes or just cooling yourself off, and fly via this method. Like Magneto’s power, this can affect things with precision from far, far away, allowing you to modulate temperature right down to the degree, and the same goes for pressure.

If you try to subject too many people into the prison, you won’t be able to maintain its structure, so don’t just toss people haphazardly inside! If more than ten people reside inside the dungeon, it will forcibly collapse and spit everyone back out. 

The architecture of this prison is in your hands – you may decide where there are dead ends and where there are false passages, but there must be an entrance and an exit. The more chambers you have, the longer it takes to open the portal and the more energy it consumes from your arcane reserves."

While initially this exists only as a secondary plane to whatever afterlife exists in your current world (in that the dead may visit if they wish to) you may also design it in that the departed may choose to reside here instead of whatever their original destination was. In addition, you’ll find yourself able to slowly change its appearance over the course of time, with all sorts of possibilities ranging from a field of grain to the classical fiery pit of hell and torture.

When stabbed and turned to the side, The Unturned Key locks into place and can only be twisted out by you and you alone, immovable by any other means. The key stops the destruction of the multiverse, universe, or dimension you’re in, no matter what that cause is, a sentient force of malevolent darkness consuming the worlds stops in its tracks, paralyzed and unable to move or affect anything anymore, a tear in reality pulling all apart freezes in time and everything that was being pulled falls back to the ground, a supermassive black hole no longer affects anything with its gravity as it stays still in the movement, an army of evil that was about to use a weapon that would destroy the universe would be stuck in place, etc.

This effect is absolute and unstoppable by any means as per fiat, but as a cost of this as you may notice, The Unturned Key stops the destruction, it does not fix or reverse it and the reality of the place The Unturned Key has been stabbed in becomes a bit... static, unchanging. This should be utilized to give you time to fully remove and fix the problem, not be placed forever in the world before it starts going into an inevitable loop.

The dagger itself cannot be lost, stolen, or used by anyone but yourself and it cannot be destroyed."
1370,,600,The River,Black★Rock Shooter,Domain,"It seems a lot of big dramatic things happened here, maybe even your real-self swapped spots next to this riverbed. This swath of the riverbed found within this city alongside the land surrounding it has seemed to become your... property, legally owned by you, not that anyone would remember it, but they do know that someone owns that large portion of it. You may also have it become an attachment to your warehouse and have it be a copy rather than it directly being the original thing ‘stolen.’

While within the area of this river, any soul and mental-based abilities increase significantly in power, making things like scrying or planning fights around this area particularly useful if you’re okay with your foe using such a boost if they have such abilities. The most potent of the river’s boons isn’t the boost to soul and mental abilities but rather whenever someone unlocks or otherwise gains a latent power like their Otherself awakening, or perhaps one’s Aura (from RWBY), the potential and overall strength of that ability rises past to what they would normally get, usually to twice its potential and starting strength though some particularly lucky people might go beyond that.

That portion of the river’s properties cannot be used by anyone but you or your companions and thus you don’t have to worry about your foes somehow managing to get a power-boost by sneaking into here. Post-jump, you may place the riverbed within anywhere in the jump, at the cost of making it usable to those who knows its there... and it also looks out of place cause the river will be definitely be noted that it was once part of a city or town, just without the city mysteriously around it."
1371,,600,Mansion,Black★Rock Shooter,Domain,"You or rather, your parents (if you’re a Student, if any of the others you own it), have a mansion of either a western style similar to Yomi or something more eastern like Saya’s parent’s home. This comes with several guest bedrooms, massive regular bedrooms, several rooms to play around in, attics and basements filled with various supplies, a large kitchen and dining room and filled with basically everything a normally wealthy house from 2012 would have and it all works even if it normally wouldn’t, there is unlimited electricity, and other forms of power to make everything in the mansion to work, including like powering the internet for computers even if there should be no connection and has an infinite amount of basic if tasty food stuffs as well as running water.

The Mansion itself is protected by a high rising wall with optional stairs if you want to make it seem like the mansion is on top of a hill and there is an electronically locked door that cannot have its lock picked by any means and can be opened from inside the house. There is an intercom next to the door that allows others to speak into it along with ringing the doorbell. Those that approach the Mansion even with the intention to sneak in are compelled to ring the doorbell and say hello into it, an excellent anti-stealth strategy for the unwary and even those trained to resist such mental impulses will still have a hard time ignoring it.

If they try to brute force it, they’ll find both the mansion’s own walls and the outer walls to be nigh-impenetrable and unbreakable, either that, or it fixes itself rather quickly, your choice.

Post-jump you can place the mansion anywhere in the world or have it be placed as an attachment to your warehouse."
1372,,600,Connla’s Well,Irish Mythology,Domain,"A hidden well that never runs dry, has tasty salmon living within and hazel trees all about, and serves as a gateway to Tir Na Nog, the sunless land of eternal youth. In future Jumps, this can access other sideways worlds, invisible lands or dimensions, as well as to import old ones to the new setting. May be placed in a Warehouse or as land in the Jump."
1373,,600,Crystallized Perceptions,Slay the Princess,Domain,"The way the world looks and some of its functioning is shaped by how you perceive it, giving way to a variety of unique and occasionally patently illogical paradigms. Perhaps you have a view of the world where stars don't exist? Or maybe one where all the oceans are replaced with chocolate milk? Or maybe one where you march down a cabin basement to slay a princess and save us all? There are as many possibilities as you could care to name."
1374,,600,Sunlit Paradise,Dies Irae,Domain,"It seems like an endless paradise for you, a little world tucked away in a place only you can reach. You’ve got a dream world of your own now, a small dimension that takes on a landscape of your choosing. It’s a few miles wide in every direction from the centre and being here is healing to the body, mind and soul. You can enter this dimension from anywhere with just a few seconds of thought, returning to this home of yours no matter the restrictions. You can then also exit into any place that is not specifically barred against those who travel through dimensions with just as much ease. Despite this method of use, others will find it near impossible to break into here and only someone like the Gods of this world could force it without your permission."
1375,,600,Atlantis ,Hotel Transylvania,Domain,"You get the lost city of atlantis! The ultimate monster vacation destination with all the fixings of a resort, an infinite and renewing buffet, and a powerful Kraken guarding the entire place and providing musical entertainment to guests. Although... If you are feeling less than peaceful there is quite a bit of ancient magical atlantean tools and even weapons if you go digging through it. Heck, the entire place could make for a surprisingly fearsome fortress if someone was inclined to do such a thing. Dang, now that I think about it the place is filled with traps that can be reactivated with the flick of a switch within your penthouse suite.... Weird huh?"
1376,,600,The Ark,The God of High School,Domain,"A great flying ship, shaped like an omega symbol attached to a cross, and at least a few hundred metres long. This is the pride of the Nox organisation, a great ship capable of wiping out whole cities of unbelievers with the innumerable weapons that cover its underside. Able to travel faster than any mundane aircraft despite its incredible size, the Ark also has a sizeable fortress on top of it. This fortress has room for at least a few hundred Nox agents and all they’d need to live, along with the necessary equipment to coordinate armies across the globe. This flying super weapon is also able to easily take on anything the mundane world has to use as weaponry, from a combination of powerful shielding to just being immensely durably made.

Boosted: Contained on your Ark is the beginnings of your own version of Nox. Several hundred Bishop class warriors, individually around as strong as the stronger agents in the above option with a few members that go above even that. While these men are totally loyal to you and will even do very immoral actions in your name, as they view you as something akin to a deity, they come at a cost. Much like Nox, your organisation is deeply connected to the Gods of this world and a significant amount of your followers’ power comes from them. So long as you ensure to satisfy some of the Gods demands, your followers will keep their power and you may even gain favour and influence with the gods. Fail or betray them and your agents will become much weaker, though they remain supernaturally powerful and loyal soldiers. In future worlds, you'll possess a similar organisation with a relation to an existing in setting faction that is similar to the Gods of this world or simply to a group of rich and powerful ordinary men.

1377,,600,Ready? Fight!,The God of High School,Domain,"The God of High School Tournament will be held in enormous arenas across the globe, each hidden beneath the various cities of the world, often underneath landmarks or famous locations. These arenas are huge, equipped with medical facilities well beyond what modern hospitals are capable of and has a full staff of both medical professionals, recruitment agents for finding fighters, security guards and tournament running staff. With the dozens of arenas now under your control, you could easily set up a worldwide fighting tournament of your very own. Beneath every single arena however, is a buried sacred room. In these large cave-like temple rooms, the barrier between dimensions is very weak, allowing for easy communication, summoning and travel between the current world and any other, but particularly the worlds of spirits.

Boosted: The various arenas you own normally have a variety of staff, yet most of these staff members aren't that impressive as fighters. At low levels they're effective but once the actually supernatural enters, they might as well stay home. Now each arena will come with several Agents, men and women with actual power. You'll find them with similar levels of strength to the Agents of Mubong's regime at the start of the story, easily able of taking care of anything short of a Nephilim. Some of them are even equal to the lower Bishops of the Nox group. All-together, you've got a few hundred Agents around the world and they're all very loyal to you, though they are just normal people and will likely protest particularly nasty actions unless you work on them. Similarly powerful people will be found in the Arenas in future jumps too, adjusted for the setting.

1378,,600,Palace of the First Heaven,The God of High School,Domain,"In your hands, or at least your ownership, now is a copy of the gargantuan castle in which the High Gods of the First Heavenly Realm reside. Resting in its own small pocket dimension at the moment it is almost large enough to be called a small city on its own, this vast palace is fully capable of flight at fair speeds and movement on its own. It can transport itself between dimensions with only a minute’s preparation, rather than the unique artefact required for it normally. The castle itself is filled with such luxury that even the most wasteful of mortal Kings would call it obscene, fitting for the almighty rulers of the Three Realms. Staffed by a great number of angels and nephilim to act as guardians, this flying fortress will serve you as an unbreakable throne upon which to rule the world that spreads out beneath you."
1379,,600,"Time, Halt!",The God of High School,Domain,"Time itself is now able to be influenced by you. For now you can merely alter it in certain ways, such as slowing your perception of it up or increasing the speed at which it runs by a small amount, making it pass by faster. As you grow in might, you will become able to slow it down overall or even just slow individual pieces down or to peek into the future to see what might happen. Eventually, nearer to the peak of your power, you will even become able to stop time completely for all but you, albeit only for brief periods when you first unlock it."
1380,,600,Trinity,The God of High School,Domain,"Taking the form of three light orbs that encircle the user’s body and being based on certain Christian teachings, Trinity enables the user to manipulate the weather on an incredible scale. You gain control over both the air and electricity, becoming able to produce and direct both elements, as well as summon many great disasters from the natural world. Whilst they are costly effects, you may create hurricanes, earthquakes, eruptions and other natural disasters, even when they should be impossible to happen naturally."
1381,,600,Longinus Hand,The God of High School,Domain,"Based on a part of Christian mythos, the Longinus Hand grants the user the ability to summon gigantic projects of hands and to manipulate gravity. The projections summoned by the user are giant, transparent hands of energy. Even at the start these are large enough to cover whole city blocks but they will only grow to even more immense sizes over time, and can be used to smash, grab or do anything else a hand could normally do. They do not require the user to see where they are being summoned either and the range of summoning is only dependent on the user’s power, starting at around a few hundred metres and increasing from there with no upper limit. The user can also control gravity, increasing or decreasing it as they will, even doing both on specific areas to change the topography of an area around. As usual, the power of this manipulation is dependent on the user’s life energy. Longinus Hand can also summon cross shaped energy shields in front of the user, so long as the user raises one hand in front of them. This Charyeok forms a cross shaped mark on each of the user’s palms by being contracted."
1382,,600,Cane of the Sage,The God of High School,Domain,"A powerful artefact belonging to the Jade Emperor. Not primarily used as a weapon, it is instead a powerful transportation and clairvoyance magical item. It can open portals to any location in any other realm without the need for meeting the conditions normally required to enter those realms and can even forcibly bring across things from those realms, from people to even bringing over an entire dimension to fuse with the current one, though these feats require a truly monstrous amount of energy to enact. It is also able to act as a scrying portal, locating almost any target with ease, though there are some locations and targets that will be able to block its vision."
1383,,600,Secret library,Gods of Blood and Powder,Domain,"An archive and library holding an incredible amount of knowledge and information collected by a spy organization over several decades. It will update in every new setting, being filled with crucial information about important individuals, sorcerous artifacts, technology and even down to detailed maps and construction plans. Knowledge is power."
1384,,600,Kobeni’s Car,Chainsaw Man,Domain,"The most powerful item in Chainsaw Man and its 7th most popular character. You find yourself with a duplicate taking the form of any car model of your choice (as long as it’s from before 1997 and not a luxury car). While it doesn’t seem special on this surface, this car will always be there when you need it, seemingly appearing from thin air in alleyways or empty fields when you need a getaway. It isn’t that high-performance in normal situations, but it’s fiat-backed to be fast enough to escape any pursuers (inanimate or not) with its handling adjusting to the speed it’s going at (you still need the reactions to steer it). It also seemingly has a mind of its own, adjusting in little ways to ensure your safety and put you on the right path. If you choose, you can pay for it to have Embodiment of Fear (at least Tier 2) and have it be a fully sentient companion. It restores very fast when destroyed but seems to always be durable enough to take a few hits from your opponents. Finally, any harmful effects aimed at you while within the car are converted into pure damage and tanked by the car itself, only able to affect you when the car totals. After its destruction it will revive after 3 days (sound familiar?)."
1385,,600,Head Bitch in Charge        ,Fate/Stay Night,Domain,"It is the duty of the family head to look after and maintain the family's territories. You, as all your ancestors have done, take to this duty with gusto. Across your family's ancestral lands, an area roughly the size of a city, you gain several powers and advantages. First, you are aware of the exact position and layout of all leylines within the area, as well as any other extreme concentrations of magical energy. Second, you have an innate sense for the physical and spiritual health of the land, as well as what needs to be done to fix either if they are failing. While on your territory, your magics become significantly stronger and the magics of those who fight against you become slightly weaker. Finally, you are able to tell when any supernatural being has entered your territory, though no more than that they have entered. In future jumps, this territory can either be set to properties or land that you own, though it does not grow beyond city sized, or be placed in a location of your choice as long as it is either un-owned or you own the majority of the area covered. It can only be placed once per jump.

Boosted: Head Bitch in Charge now has the territory in question begin with a unique sort of Bounded Field around its entire perimeter. This immense ward grants the owner, which is you, two new powers over your territory. The first is that you are now able to cast spells targeting any being within your territory regardless of their actual position in relation to you. Cast fireballs at someone on the other side of a city and have it appear right before their faces, regardless of the dozens of miles between you two. The second effect is a level of control you now innately have over the environment of your territory. You can, with an extremely low magical cost, activate or deactivate any sort of simple machinery or electronics, affect the weather or climate to slowly change to any naturally possible outcome and exert basic mental control over any mundane animal within the territory, none of these effects minding how far as long as it is within the area.

1386,,600,Shardpool,Elantris,Domain,"You have stumbled across a true anomaly; a stable perpendicularity not linked to any Shard. Like the Lake above Elantris, this shallow, self-contained pool is filled with a strange crystal-blue liquid. Just like the Selish portal, this gateway no longer offers reliable travel across the realms. Instead, this perpendicularity allows access to a massive well of Investiture, ready to be tapped. Though any Invested Arts you purchase will function normally in future worlds, powering your magic with this reservoir would put the unbridled power of the Dor at your back. The potential scale and impact of your magical workings would grow by several orders of magnitude. Just be sure not to vaporize yourself in the process.

And be aware, that is a serious risk. Like a constantly-churning ocean of plasma, the unstable nature of the unlinked Investiture beyond this portal carries both great potential and tremendous danger. This is also why travel to the Cognitive Realm through this aperture is nearly impossible.

As a final benefit, this pool can act as a panacea to the injured or infirmed. By immersing a person in this pool you may allow the Dor to flow into them, rejuvenating their bodies and restoring them to health. However, this process is very delicate, as any overexposure to the Investiture maelstrom beyond risks annihilating the very subject you seek to heal."
1387,,600,Evernight Castle,RWBY,Domain,"Mirroring the Castle in the Land of Darkness, where the wicked witch herself resides, this Fortress is awe inspiring as it is terrifying to behold. Decorated by purple glowing crystals and candles that never seem to burn out, this Castle will serve you faithfully as a base of operations. Finding it is nigh impossible for your enemies, while also being a place of luxury for you and any subordinates or allies. Seer patrol the hallways, warning you of any trespassers and a pool of Grimm Liquid is located around it, spawning Grimm, as many as you please. Without any means of controlling them, it might be best to leave these Pools alone though."
1388,,600,Fragment of Ipsen,Final Fantasy IX,Domain,"If you want to toss a twist into the scene, then why not try this little trick out? Emulating the legendary Ipsen Castle on the Forgotten Continent, you can enforce a reality warping field on your immediate surroundings.

However, don’t expect reality to give way so easily. After all, even Ipsen had its origins from another world.

The immediate effects affect people rather than concrete surroundings, skewing the spatial orientation ability of those affected in random fashion."
1389,,600,Reprogrammed Jurisdiction,Inscryption,Domain,"As a Scrybe, your own little slice of the realm is uniquely you-themed, and in fact, you made it so. Any region over which you have sufficient claim is within your ability, to some extent, to mold and shape. Given a source of powerful code to weave in, such as the OLD_DATA, your ability to reshape increases drastically, and your required claim drops to near irrelevance, such that you could incite a near-total reality shift of a large, contested island in a single go."
1390,,600,Forge of Everlasting Fire,Cult of the Lamb,Domain,"A forge that has burned with the flames of the first dawn, only extinguished at the end of all time. This sacred site is a smithy like no other, capable of crafting weapons befitting the gods themselves. For those with the skill and determination, the fires of this forge will allow the user to create any weapon they can dream, imbuing it with great and terrible magic. For those that would challenge the gods, only a weapon worthy to slay one will suffice."
1391,,600,Weapon Space,Final Fantasy VIII,Domain,"Nobody really knows how, but you've figured out a way to store an entire small arsenal of personal weaponry behind your back. As long as it's small enough to hold with your hands, anyway. When you reach behind yourself, you can swap weapons in and out of this space very quickly, allowing you to rapidly switch between firing a machine gun and a rocket launcher without having to worry about petty things like weight, volume, or logic. Unfortunately, it's only weapons, nothing else really works, not even spare parts, and only ammo within the weaponry itself can be stored in this way. What you pull out is determined by your will, and all it take is a single thought to decide what you wish to wield. While weapons are all stored in the same 'place', they're not stacked together or in any danger of interacting or malfunctioning while there."
1392,,600,Dungeon Key,Solo Leveling,Domain,"How convenient. Much like the dungeons created by the Architect and the Shadow Monarch's power for the growth of Jin-Woo, you too now have the chance to train yourself to new heights by challenging level appropriate dungeons! These dungeons will always allow you to explore new ways to use your powers and at least will pose a minimum challenge to you. When creating the dungeon, you can choose the size of the dungeon and the final difficulty of it.

You can create these dungeons by sticking the key into any surface, and once created, they will remain accessible for a month. The same time-dilation effects from regular dungeons still apply. Damage done inside the pocket dimension that host the dungeon won’t spread to the outside world, and dungeon is guaranteed to never experience a dungeon break, disappearing after a month.

The size of the dungeon, gate and number of monsters will escalate in relationship with the difficulty."
1393,,600,World Training,Solo Leveling,Domain,"Fearing the destruction of a low-magical world like Earth from the surviving Monarchs’ attacks, the Rulers decided to introduce magic in the World in order to help it defend itself. However, said process was not an easy one, since the Earth needed to be hastily prepared for the upcoming war by increasing its overall mana, and the new magical humans needed some experience with their abilities. For that, not only the Rulers gave magic to humans, but also used the captured elements of the Monarch armies to train the humans, in preparation of the enemies that were to come.

Now, you have gained the ability to do the same with other worlds. At the start of each jump, you can introduce magic to the world you currently are by activating this perk. Once the process has started, it cannot be turned off. At first, the number of ‘awakened’ people will be small, and their general levels as well as the level of the dungeons that appear will be low. But as time passes, the number of dungeons and awakened people will start to rise, until the appearance of S Ranked Dungeons is not uncommon. Finally, to seal the world, a large dungeon portal with the armies’ equivalent to that of a single Monarch will open, a boss of the level of a Monarch waiting inside. You can decide whether the dungeons that are created via this perk draw magical beasts from this world or appropriate monsters from the local universe.

You can also choose to use this on already magical worlds, but it won’t increase their strength above what’s demonstrated in this series."
1394,,600,The Age of Jumper,Fate/Grand Order,Domain,"When the King of Magic died, he took the Age of Gods with him. He was the final marker for that great Age and all the wonders and terrors within it. Imagine what the world would be like if that King came back and brought his Age with him? Well, you’ll be able to see both now, though the latter is more your choice. You have a unique ability that allows you to exert influence over the Age or Era of a setting. You can halt progress out of this Era or speed it up to bring it to a swift end or even slowly bring it back into the world around you. Any defined period of time, whether it be the Age of Gods or the Roaring twenties, can be affected in this way. The stronger you are, the swifter these changes can be done but they shouldn’t take more than a year unless the changes you are making are truly outlandish. It should be noted that if you are bringing an end to an Age, you have no control over what Age may appear in its place.

Boosted: You’ve got the ear of God himself now or so it seems. When a new Age is about to appear, naturally or through your own power, you have a large amount of influence over what that Age will bring. As with the base perk, the stronger you are the greater the changes you can make. At a base level, you will be able to bring about decades of scientific advancement in very short time or grind it to a halt or even reverse it. You could alter the tone and atmosphere to be much lighter and more peaceful or much darker and more brutal. As you get to incredible heights of power, you may even be able to turn worlds into Sci Fi Utopias in a few short years or bring magic to an entire world that had never experienced a single spell.

If the mind is healthy, the body will be too. So it only makes sense that the king being healthy will make the country healthy as well. What you rule may as well be a living part of you. Your country grows and succeeds as you do, whilst failing or being damaged as you are. Your life is linked to all that you rule. By eating your fill, your country will find itself with more food. Starving yourself will starve your country too. The effects are not translated directly between the two of you but it is a close thing. Your death will not destroy all that you rule but it will severely diminish it, perhaps to the extent it can never recover. 

Boosted: Your country itself now reflects its own benefits back on you. Nothing made by this perk counts but any independent positive growth will result in similar positive, and proportional, growth back on you. Doubling the size and power of your army will double your own military power. But negative effects also negatively affect you, though not translated directly.

The Finger Bow-Bell is an event where the Fingers get together to discuss how they would carve up the Backstreets and manage their territory, you currently are the owner of the property that they use for that purpose. The reason why your land was chosen is thanks to a strange effect that drives people away from fighting there and forces negotiation, people can still attack each other but it takes extreme willpower to do so and if someone is harmed, the perpetrator is now an open target for everyone else. This place can be imported into an already owned property and if you don’t, it’s a large warehouse with basic furnishings, which just so happens to be your Warehouse which means the forced neutrality effect can be selectively applied anywhere inside."

Though if you wanted justa place to enjoy, your Room or the Room of Fantasy would be just as good or better. No what makes this better is that its not only a collection of the rooms which you can enjoy as you want but you have the ability to effectively impose them on reality or drag people around you into these rooms at will, regardless all of these rooms have a major time dilation to a rate of 1 day in these rooms is 1 second out of them(aging and needs are also reduced to match the dilation), even if imposed on reality, the effective part would be cut of from the rest and affected by the time dilation. While you have control over these room you can use their natures to target others such as Room 430 have an endless army of automatons to fight, 385 having to deal with a sci-fi army, 366 being a smoking bar to experience or even 330 being a nymphomaniacs dream having to enjoy the place. You can use any of these Rooms how you see fight but if you deliberately trap someone in a Room they can escape by completing a thematically appropriate challenge which can be default challenges, set by you or you can have the challenge be thematic but change on the trapped. The Rooms are places to both enjoy and harm others with, though the overall power is dependent on your own power as no room can be more that 50% as dangerous as you at your max, though the danger can change depending on the Room. You can even make it so that they have to go through each Room to escape but each Room's danger is locked to 10% you max danger if you do that and still beat each Rooms challenge."

But it has a benefit for starters, being in the room flat out stops your needs and keeps you in good condition, second any form of training done in this room is 5 times as effective as it should be since you recover quickly and are influenced by the natural desire to be better. Third, the room is time dilated at a rate of 10 to 1 so 10 days for 1 day all of which would be 5 times better training. Fourth you can bring people in to train with you allowing them to benefit as well though you can only bring up to 100 people at a time. Fifth the room subconsciously wants you to be better so it motivates all who are in to want to be better and keep improving themselves. Sixth, anyone who trains within the room will find that they can train to further their limits so if they already seem to be at their limits out of the room, then training in them can break them and allow them to keep improving past their limits. Due to the passive healing effects nobody would need to eat, drink or sleep but can if they want. Only you can change the environment and make things though. Nobody can truly die in the room either and any form of death would simply put them in an isolated part of the room protected from the room's effect and fully heal them physically and mentally. You could train people in this room by simply killing them over and over again till they learn to dodge for example."

A careful eye would be needed to fully decipher this trove of information, but few among Gaia’s citizens are more worthy of inheriting it.

1401,,600,Ark of the Sea Dragon,Kurohime,Domain,"In short, this is a boat. To expand on that, this is a boat made from the bones of the Sea Dragon, also known as the Spirit King of Wind, Seiryuu. It is a fairly large ship on the outside, but it is even bigger on the inside due to distortions of space and time, and has enough room to hold the population of multiple cities. Although this ship has a mast, it has no sails, and needs none; it generates its own propulsion, and is able to move in even the most inhospitable environments. A sea of acid would be nothing to it, although it would hardly need to worry about such a sea in the first place, considering it can also fly.

Being the body of the Spirit King of Wind, it generates its own air, pressure, and gravity, allowing it to travel through space. It can display a feature the Sea Dragon once showed, allowing it to distort time as it moves; regardless of how long travel takes, to those inside the Ark it seems as if barely any time passed at all, allowing for subjectively nigh-instant travel (even of objectively it may have lasted for eons). The ship isn’t quite sentient, but it is semi-pseudo-aware, and can make decisions to ensure it arrives at a destination safely, if no one is actively piloting it. In space, it is capable of traveling at a significant fraction of the speed of light, but within an atmosphere it is limited to the speed of the wind."
1402,,600,Like Seiryuu’s Gullet,Kurohime,Domain,"The Sea Dragon—also known as Seiryuu, the Spirit King of Wind—was not merely the spirit of the incorporeal wind, but also other immaterial things... such as time. As such, in his avatar known as the Sea Dragon, he was able to swallow even time, and if he cared to, he could take a person into this swallowed time. The end result of this being time travel. Now, you won’t be able to make changes—attempts to do so simply result in you being flung back to the present—but as a tool for gathering information, this time travel is invaluable.

And of course, you will find that your journey backwards in time was part of the proper timeline all along, and all of the actions you took while in the past were/are/will be part of what makes up the present. So while you couldn’t, say, kill someone you know to be alive in the present, you may find that the other actions that you took while in the past are all smoothly integrated into proper history.

That said... if you were willing to sacrifice your life, it would be possible to make a major change to the past, although you would die in the process. But as Asura showed, it is very much within the range of possibility if you’re willing to make the final sacrifice."
1403,,600,Smash Dojo,Super Smash Bros. Brawl,Domain,"A special gateway has appeared either in your Warehouse, or on a property you own. By passing through it, you can travel to a strange, dojo-like complex. 

Around the dojo are various doors. Each of these are connected to a touchscreen computer. These doors each lead to a space resembling a stage shown in Super Smash Bros. Brawl, which can be used for Smash Bros.-style fights. The computers allow you to alter the rules of these fights, as long as those rules are something that exist in Super Smash Bros. Brawl. AI controlled versions of Fighters canonically appearing in Super Smash Bros. can be added to matches, but cannot bring the total number of participants in a match above four. True death and chain-failure can never occur in these spaces. 

You will never be able to bring anything out of these spaces that you did not take in, and anything you bring in with you, be it items or people, will never be lost within these spaces.

For an additional 200cp (undiscounted), the Dojo has additional door, with attached touchscreen computer. The door is presently inoperable, however by using the computer you can create custom stages, at which point the door becomes usable. The appearance of the custom stage must be something reasonably close to something you would be able to create within Super Smash Bros. Brawl. If you somehow have a copy of Super Smash Bros. Brawl, the computer has an import function to allow you to choose your custom-made stages within that game. Whilst the door can only lead to one stage at a time, the computer can store as many saved custom stages as you would like it to.

In future worlds, you may choose for the gateway to the Smash Dojo to be attached to your Warehouse, or to be placed on a property you own."
1404,,600,The Jumpspace Emissary,Super Smash Bros. Brawl,Domain,"You have gained access to your own personal realm.

To begin with, this realm is a featureless mess of swirling purple energy, about the size of a small city. You may travel to your realm at any time; doing so will create a glowing, spherical portal about the size of your person in your previous location. Others will be able to enter and exit your realm via this portal. You can immediately leave your realm at any time, returning to this portal. Should no one else be in your realm, the portal will then disappear; if not, it will disappear once everyone inside the realm has left. You may only control one of these portals; if a new one is created, the previous one disappears.

Should you have purchased any of the items that can create Subspace rifts (Subspace Bomb, Isle of the Jumper, Subspace Gunship), any time they create these rifts you can elect for them to connect to this realm instead. Rifts created in this manner are represented in your realm as ‘bubbles’ of the area consumed by the rift. You are able to arrange these bubbles in any way you like, linking them together or to the realm proper in order to create mazes of your own design. The rifts created outside your realm will allow you or others to move to and from your realm.

At the end of each jump, you have the opportunity to close any of these rifts linked to your realm. If you do so, you may choose whether you lose the associated ‘bubble’, or retain a copy of it. Even if you choose not to, rifts left in past jumps will be inaccessible until the end of your chain. Post-chain, you will receive this opportunity every ten years. If at any point you die, all non-copy ‘bubbles’ will vanish from your realm, with the associated rifts automatically closing.

Should you collect enough of these ‘bubbles’, the realm proper will expand in size appropriately to comfortably house them all.

Only you, your companions, and your followers may remain in the realm at the end of a jump. All other sentient beings are automatically ejected. You may choose to have any inactive companions stay here if you wish.

Should you already possess another personal dimension, or a similar ability, you may import it into this option, granting it all of the advantages offered here."
1405,,600,Rabbit(Fluff) ,Miraculous Ladybug,Domain,"Concept: Evolution

Form: Pocket Watch

Tool: Umbrella

Power: “Burrow'' - Creates a portal to a personal subdimension known as the Burrow. This is the only Miraculous whose power is not once per transformation even if the user is not an adult because “time works weirdly” (although using it this way seems to have odd temporal side effects on its user post transformation). The Burrow is a golf ball-like sphere with a platform with dozens and dozens of inactive portals along its surface. These portals lead to various locations throughout space and time, and can be opened and manipulated to show different places in space-time only by someone using the Rabbit Miraculous. The Burrow also allows people inside it to resist paradoxes and other temporal effects for a time. Rabbit Miraculous users can cause their time traveling to be non-disruptive (not change anything), working in a bootstrap manner. They can instead choose to change things in a disruptive manner (changes events) in Jumps which allow for it (this one included). Warning though, other Rabbit Miraculous users will be using the Burrow as well, and you’re likely to run into them (especially the current user if you haven’t replaced her). Try not to make any enemies among them, especially by messing with time in a disruptive manner..."
1406,,600,Mountain Retreat,High School DxD,Domain,"Someone has booked you for a stay at a nearby mountainside resort, Jumper. For the rest of your life, even! This is a comfortable retreat out in the wilderness with a fully stocked hotel and several outdoor camping spots. It even comes with an onsen. Funny enough, when you train or exercise here, you’ll find your gains from such will increase to at least twice their normal rate - three times if you really push yourself. And it has an onsen. Because of course it does. It can comfortable keep all of your companions fed and relaxed, and inactive ones can hang out here. Post-jump, this can turn into a Warehouse attachment or be dropped somewhere safe in a world you’re in."
1407,,600,Private Pure Love Train,Jujutsu Kaisen,Domain,"Your technique inherently comes with a Domain known as Idle Death Gamble, which has effects and an appearance based on the pachinko machine Private Pure Love Train. It’s incredibly complex in its functions, with several different elements, mechanics, and probabilities involved. In its simplest terms, the Domain is a gamble: the user hopes to get three of the same symbols, similar to a slot machine, by going through some short scenes of Private Pure Love Train’s story. If they fail to get three in a row, the Domain resets to the beginning and they can begin again.

If they succeed, though? They hit the jackpot, and the Domain ends. By hitting the jackpot, the Private Pure Love Train theme song plays around you, and for its duration (4 minutes and 11 seconds) you have unlimited cursed energy. Though its output is not limitless, you could fight without any regard for running out or overexerting yourself for that duration. In addition, this unlimited cursed energy comes with a fully automatic reverse cursed technique, granting you a regenerative factor so potent that it could heal severed limbs or large holes blown through your abdomen in an instant, rendering you nigh-unkillable. Though you can’t have the jackpot and Domain going at the same time, you’re capable of activating your Domain again the moment the jackpot ends.

While theoretically you only have a 1 in 239 chance of hitting the jackpot with each spin, in practice the probability seems to be much higher than that, with several effects and hidden probabilities that can raise your chances. It has been seen go up to around 1 in 5, though even in spite of that this works best with a lucky user. Aside from being based on the whims of fortune, the main flaw with the Domain is that each “spin” of it takes time. Because of this, and that it doesn’t come with an auto-hit attack, any opponent drawn into Idle Death Gamble is capable of continuing to fight the user as normal, trying to defeat them before the jackpot is hit.

There are also several abilities of this technique that can be used without activating the Domain. The user seems to be able to conjure certain elements of Private Pure Love Train into the real world. They could, for example, conjure the train shutter doors that feature heavily in it around their opponents, using them to crush or restrain them, or pachinko balls they could send flying towards them as a projectile."
1408,,600,Sky High ,Jujutsu Kaisen,Domain,"You have the ability to manipulate space by treating the “sky as a surface” – quite literally grabbing hold of the space around you and manipulating it with your hands, causing the world around you itself to warp similar to how a lens causes distortion. This is quite easy to do as well, space itself seeming almost like a sheet of sorts that moves to your will without resistance. For example, if someone tried to punch you, you could grab hold of the space in front of their hand and pull, causing their arm to follow the direction you pulled in and become distorted in the process. Ranged attack can likewise be redirected just by grasping the space before them and twisting around, sending them off in a different direction of your choosing. This technique doesn’t warp space permanently, though – everything returns to normal once you let go of it.

It's not just redirecting attacks this can be used for. By treating space as a surface using your technique, you’re capable of levitating by standing or sitting on it, or even flying in a sense by grasping hold and using distortions to propel yourself through the sky. It can also be used offensively: by hitting the surface of the sky before your target instead of the person themselves, you can break that surface as if it were thin ice. This causes the sky to temporarily shatter, striking whoever was on the receiving end of the blow with far greater force than you’d usually be able to muster."
1409,,600,Barrier Master ,Jujutsu Kaisen,Domain,"Despite being a foundational aspect of jujutsu, and one all sorcerers are capable of, very few learn more than the basics of barrier techniques. It’s mostly just the most simple form of protective barrier that is used, with some learning Simple Domain, and a talented few figuring out how to use a Domain Expansion. It’s a shame, as the potential of barriers is higher than one might think – it’s the barriers created by Tengen that allow jujutsu society to actually function, after all.

You’re one of the rare, genuine masters of barrier techniques, having skill on the same level as Kenjaku and Tengen. It’s not just that the barriers you create are stronger and can cover a greater area than normal, but also that the versatility of what you can pull off is far greater. You’re capable of creating Pure and Bon Barriers, superior versions of regular barriers that help to suppress the proliferation of cursed spirits, as well as Empty Barriers, a barrier made of hexagonal panels that can not only change its structure at-will but its appearance as well, allowing you to create anything from a constantly shifting maze of corridors to a perfectly functional house or cinema with a thought. Naturally, you’re also completely aware of anything that happens within your barriers, and if someone else tries to erect a barrier inside your own, your skill is such that you could analyse and completely dismantle even the most skilled user’s attempts in a matter of seconds.

If you have a cursed technique, you’ve also already figured out how to use Domain Expansion with it. The pinnacle of jujutsu, a Domain Expansion involves manifesting the user’s Innate Domain – a sort of inner world shaped by the user’s mind, soul, and jujutsu – into reality within a barrier, within which your cursed technique is guaranteed to hit its targets. The power of a Domain cannot be understated: with the right cursed technique as a basis, they’re capable of everything from flooding the minds of those within with endless information, overloading their brains, to attacking every cell in their bodies if they don’t move in a certain way. The drawbacks, though, are that they cost an incredible amount of cursed energy to use, such that only the greatest sorcerers can use a Domain more than once per day, and will cause the user’s cursed technique to become temporarily ‘burned out’ the user’safter the Domain ends, rendering it unable to be used for a while.

You’ve pushed this further, however, and figured out how to create a so-called barrierless Domain, manifesting your Domain Expansion directly into reality, a feat only two other individuals are capable of. While this does mean there’s no outer wall, and thus others can freely enter or leave your Domain, a barrierless Domain is both far harder to interfere with and can cover a far greater area. While a regular Domain Expansion may cover several tens of metres, a barrierless one can cover several hundreds.

You don’t need this perk to learn how to use Domain Expansion – it just skips the step of having to figure it out yourself. What this perk does do, however, is give you the possibility of producing effects analogous to one using your other supernatural abilities, using the same principles as described above. This will likely be incredibly difficult to figure out, and take a lot of time to perfect, but it’s undeniably a powerful tool in anyone’s arsenal."
1410,,600,Materia Mine,Final Fantasy VII,Domain,"Materia takes an awful long time to form and it's unlikely you'll see more if its ilk in future worlds. Well, in most cases, anyways. To compensate you have received a natural cave formation that contains a pool of Mako. It will generate a small number of Materia each week, usually the more common Magic and Command types while occasionally providing more powerful ones such as Summons. No personal labor is required on your part, you need only pluck the newly-formed Materia from the spring with your hands or any tools you have on hand. In addition, splashing yourself or someone else with the waters of this place will completely restore your health and energy. This effect only exists while near the fountain, unfortunately...bottling this will only gain you slightly nasty-tasting water. Note that the more rare and powerful an individual Materia is, the more unlikely it will be created. Still, it will happen...at least, eventually."
1411,,600,Welcome to My World ,Final Fantasy VII,Domain,"An interesting quirk of Summon Materia is that the majority of the more powerful ones will usually trap their chosen targets into a temporary alternate dimension, where they're free to unleash their destructive power with no fear of causing damage to Gaia or the casters' allies. Through some miracle of the Planet, you can do this too. When unleashing some sort of devastating attack on your enemies, you may temporarily transport them to an alternate dimension with an appearance of your choosing, though it will lack any special properties beyond being out of reach of normal space. Your attack is then unleashed on your enemies, causing whatever damage to your foes it would normally inflict while causing no collateral damage to yourself, allies, or the nearby environment. Once the effect ends, your enemies will reappear where they were originally, though likely much worse for wear afterwards. This may be used as often as you like with any powerful attacks you use, or toggled off if you don't feel like sparing the world from your wrath."
1412,,600,The Immortal Bastion        ,Legends of Runeterra,Domain,"The great fortress, as tall as a little mountain, built by Mordekaiser and the heart of Noxus’ power. You now have a similar fortress, and like the original, this one is specifically attuned to the necromantic arts. It will make any ritual regarding souls easier to perform and immensely more powerful. Furthermore, while you’re inside the fortress, you’re wrapped in an area of unholy terror, able to frighten even the most brazen of your enemies and inspire awe in those who serve you. It’s also, of course, an absolutely massive fortress with all the defenses it implies. An idea starts for an aspiring conqueror."
1413,,600,Arcology City,Legends of Runeterra,Domain,"Deep in the jungle of Ixtal there is one last city inhabited by the natives. This is not that city, but it’s as good, if not better. Use of powerful elemental magic grants the city free heat, cold, light, water and air control, it can build any kind of structure with ease thanks to earth magic, and with plant magic it can grow anything you may want in a fraction of the usual time. If you don’t have elemental magic on your own, that’s pretty much all it does. If you do, however, it will act as a focus for your own magic, drastically increasing your ability to control and produce elements while inside the city."
1414,,600,Dojo,Legends of Runeterra,Domain,"All Masters need a place where to teach their discipline. This dojo can be as little as a single room where kids go to learn after playing or a sprawling temple as big as a mansion, and it can be right in the middle of a city or hidden in a faraway location so only those invited (or extremely persistent) can reach it. In any case, anyone you train in this place will see their skills grow by leaps and bounds, and you’ll be able to transmit even your Perks, at any fraction of their full power, including 100%. It also possesses an aura that makes people completely focus on their training while inside."
1415,,600,Ornn’s Forge,Legends of Runeterra,Domain,"Congratulations, you’ve now obtained Orrn’s forge! Well, a copy of it, unless you want to fight the God of the Forge for it. This literally mountain-sized forge, whose heat comes from the very heart of the planet, is the best place for crafting on all Runeterra. Assuming you have any idea of what you’re doing, you can forge pretty much anything, using any kind of materials, even ones impossibly difficult to work, and your creation will automatically be infused with power, making them the absolute best at whatever they’re supposed to do. Which is the reason Orrn’s never forge weapons. See the Great Cauldron for an idea on what your creation could do."
1416,,600,Petricite Forest,Legends of Runeterra,Domain,"Petricite is a fantastical material. A bone white fossilized wood that can absorb magical energy to the point of protecting from the power unleashed during the Rune War. Now, you too have a small forest of Petricite trees that you can use to infuse your armor, weapons, and buildings. The exact technique to do so is a national secret, but I’m sure you can find a way. Just remember that you must grind the stone before mixing it with anything. The forest itself grows at a steady rate until it’s completely recovered, so you don’t have to fear depleting it, even if it will take a week or so to recover if you take all the Petricite in a short amount of time."
1417,,600,Jumper City,Legends of Runeterra,Domain,"Remember the fact that Bandle City is located somewhere in the Spirit World? Well, now you too have a little corner of the Spirit World to use as your own. It could be empty or there could be a city or a fortress inside, and it can be a new or an ancient place, at your choice. The only thing it’s not is inhabited. The only thing inside are plants, and even those are fairly mundane. Aside from that, you’re free to personalize your little pocket dimension."
1418,,600,Death’s King,Legends of Runeterra,Domain,"Mordekaiser spent all his life fighting to gain a place in the Hall of Bones and sit with his gods. Only to find out that when he died that there was no great palace to wait for him. And so, enraged, he managed to return to the world of the living and forge another great empire before being killed... but even that was part of his plan, for now all the souls of those fallen under his domain were in the afterlife to serve him. By taking this Perk, you can emulate Mordekaiser’s feat. Not only will it let you return to life once per Jump (or once every ten years), but when you do return to life, you’ll also leave a little pocket dimension when you can accumulate souls to build your personal afterlife. Where you get those souls and how you will catch them is up to you."
1419,,600,Walk in both Worlds,Legends of Runeterra,Domain,"The veil between the Spirit Realm and the material world is this as paper in Ionia, but that doesn’t mean people can just enter it. Spirits can, but mortals just cannot travers the barrier unless brought there from a spirit. In fact, you cannot even see the spirit world, despite being so close. Except you can. With minimal concentration, you can open your eyes to the Spirit World and even step inside it. The Spirit World is not any safer than the material one, if anything, it’s worse, but just being able to do so gives you great authority among the spirits, for you’ll be able, with time, to develop a control over the Spirit Real, enough to banish any spirit that tries to be too rowdy, or invoke the power of the Spirit Real to empower you. Use this ability wisely."
1420,,600,Portal Master,Legends of Runeterra,Domain,"Teleportation is not unheard of on Runeterra, but long range teleportation is kind of rare. So, the ability to open portals to any corner of Runeterra gives the Yordles an incredible advantage. Now, you have that advantage too. You can summon a portal to any location of your choice. The portal opens too slowly to let you dodge attacks in a fight and while you can vary the size of the portal, it cannot have more than a two meter radius. You also need to know where you’re opening the portal, either by already having seen the location or knowing the coordinates."
1421,,600,Dark Maana,Fate/Legends - Servant Universe,Domain,"That’s no moon! It’s the Dark Maana! That huge dark orb in the sky is a massive space station, constructed with cutting edge technology and a core of primordial mystery from the previous universe. That mystery provides immense power for the station, letting it run all the technology and facilities found within. The fortress itself is almost unbreakable due to this construction, holding up to anything less than a powerful Noble Phantasm without a scratch.

It’s literally a city inside, able to house the headquarters of a galaxy spanning evil organisation, and already has the thousands of minions needed to run the space station itself. A fleet of over fifty powerful warships patrols the sphere, only a portion of what the station could dock as there are multiple airports and launching pads throughout. The base itself is heavily guarded, externally and from within, letting it serve as the perfect homebase for any kind of faction. 

Additionally, due to the way it was made, the Maana is an extremely potent site for all magical rituals. Not only does it act to vastly enhance the power of such things, it can even alter their parameters, changing targets or the rules to be significantly more in your favour. A ritual to resurrect a primordial goddess could instead focus all her power into a suitable host, leaving out the unneeded personality. "

Yet, regardless of your place of origin, you get the same benefits. You are immune to direct modification of your existence, and can navigate and traverse the Sea of Quanta, bubble universes, and other dimensional constructs extremely easily. Furthermore, the Honkai does not innately resent you, and will mostly leave you alone unless you instigate it or are in the wrong place at the wrong time.

Boosted: You are able to create dimensional constructs with effortless ease, and can manipulate dimensions extremely easily, allowing you to create, sense, access, alter, and destroy imaginary spaces, bubble universes, etc. effortlessly. Even the Sea of Quanta listens when you command.

So what does it say about someone who wants a chunk of that dire continent to follow them around? With this, you now own some of the monster infested grasslands known as the Veldt. During your time in this world it will be of little use to you as the Veldt will stay right where it is. However, when you leave, you will discover a small island’s worth of the grasslands has followed you. [Note 5] It will set itself up somewhere in the ocean of the world you find yourself on and continue its tradition of attracting monsters of all sorts from the current world. The Veldt will actively resist all efforts to build more than a temporary camp on its shores by sending monsters to demolish any structures.

If for some reason your current world does not offer monsters, it will instead become a popular tourist destination due to its untouched nature. A perfect spot for a beach episode."
1424,,600,Bifrost Eyes ,God Of War (2018),Domain,"You must have been considered a great friend to the Jotunn, for these eyes are given only to their greatest allies. With these eyes one can create portals between realms and use them to view things that are happening within other realms. No barrier can keep these eyes from creating a portal there, the only requirement is that you know it exists. While they cannot take you to previous jumps or even out of your current jump, they can take you to any connected dimension or alternate universe. However should one or both of your eyes be stolen then you will find two new eyes within the next month."
1425,,600,Wisdom of the Jotunn,God Of War (2018),Domain,"The Jotunn have proven that they are skilled at barring access to those who they do not wish to enter and hiding the only entrance. You too have found a prodigious talent in creating, and learning how to make, both magical and physical barriers. Whether they be wards, walls, even hiding the gate in a place it’s not supposed to be, all of this is possible with time and the right resources. At the beginning you would be at Faye’s level in creating magical barriers, being able to hide an entire forest from the sight of the gods along with keeping them from entering. Similarly for physical barriers you start on par with Thamur, though with dedicated practice and experimentation you can eventually create wonders equal to the Jotunn’s greatest works. Like hiding an entire realm from the gods."
1426,,600,Might of Garm,God Of War (2018),Domain,"This perk comes with two benefits, first bening the ability to tear open holes between neighboring dimensions, or realms. For example you could tear a hole from Hell in Supernatural to the human world, though you would not be able to reach another universe. Furthermore you are able to keep these holes open for as long as you desire, though someone of greater power would be able to close them. Furthermore this grants you a similar amortal nature to that of Garm, allowing you to repeatedly bring yourself back from the dead. Though this perk does have its limits as it only works so long as you have a body to bring back, and if your soul is replaced with another then that could be a problem. Regardless, go forth and rip and tear to your heart's desire!"
1427,,600,Pool of Gold,Thailand Mythology and Folklore,Domain,"What a sparkling pond. For some reason, you’ve found a small pond full of a golden liquid, that might be molten gold. However, it seems to be pleasantly fresh instead of red hot, so perhaps it’s some other kind of material. It’s a few meters wide, and two deep, The wise and learned would be able to tell that it contains very potent energy of some kind. This pond is quite magical, see, and does one specific thing; It gives those who completely submerge themselves naked into the pool, the Golden Body, a blessing that allows a mortal man the might of the gods themselves. Unfortunately they’ll only be able to give this blessing to one person per jump or millennia, whichever comes first, as its energies are exhausted for a time. Still, it can be a powerful boon to trusted subordinates, or perhaps just something to use immediately. If you don’t use it yourself, make sure to guard it well, otherwise someone might sneak past you and attain the Golden Body without your permission."
1428,,600,A Slice Of Heaven,Thailand Mythology and Folklore,Domain,"Heaven in this world isn’t technically an afterlife. It’s the realms where the gods live. The fact that sufficiently virtuous people are reborn as a Devyata/Deva in their next life is beside the point. The Heavens are quite idyllic, as you might expect, but the continent of Uttarakuru approaches their level of quality of life quite closely. So, with this purchase, you’ll obtain a unique blend of both. It’s about 100 km from one end to the other, and somewhat circular. It has bountiful flora and fauna, with the wild animals never really hurting anyone, even the predator, who don’t die of starvation somehow. The water of its rivers and lakes are clean, clear, and can be drunk from directly with no issues, being as pure as very thoroughly purified mineral water would be. There’s a small population of 300 people here, who are healthy, strong, virtuous, and quite long lived by human standards, living a few hundred years instead of just one.

The soil is so fertile that anything grown on it is already fully prepared for eating, even cooked if that’s how it’s eaten. In the center of this domain lies a palace worthy of any Deva, being incredibly luxurious, with furniture and walls of supernaturally tough gold and jade, and other valuable materials like jewels. This palace is filled with dozens of beautiful servants of whatever your preferred gender is, diligent, loyal, and ready to follow your every command as they maintain the palace in peak condition. In this world it’ll be somewhere in the lowest Heaven, and while getting there is up to you, in future worlds you’ll be able to insert this paradisiacal domain somewhere you wish, or simply access it through your warehouse. It’d be quite easy to live an indulgent lifestyle equal to the gods themselves with this."
1429,,600,Hallowed Abode ,Thailand Mythology and Folklore,Domain,"Some wise monks make homes for themselves away from vulgar civilization. Usually in caves or islands. You’ve settled on an island, a large and lush one, which has a few barriers added to it, likely by you. On top of being a natural paradise, filled with friendly wildlife and delicious fruits, it is a hallowed place, where evil beings, mortal or spirit, cannot set foot in. They may lurk just beyond its coast or stalk its skies, but they won’t be able to approach your island, with any attempts at remotely causing damage simply sliding off. It would take an attack able to obliterate the island in one go to crack the island’s shields.

There’s also a nice fully furnished cave within one of the island’s mountains, letting you live in moderate luxury despite the remote location. Lastly, the island’s barriers also prevent misfortune from striking too much, letting even the clumsy live a mostly blessed life. You could hide from the world here, provided nobody knows where your island is, and you likely wouldn’t find much danger to yourself. In future worlds you may choose where to insert the island, or simply to have a door in your Warehouse leading into it."
1430,,600,Kalpavriksha,Thailand Mythology and Folklore,Domain,"The continent of Uttarakuru is truly blessed, and a certain tree is a large part of the reason. Kalpavriksha is closer to a massive pillar of white wood than a tree, being 1500 km tall and 1500 km wide. Its absurd size is the least of its traits, for it is known as the wishing tree. While you can’t wish for absurd things like godhood or living beings, it provides all the wealth that anyone could ever need. One needs merely to approach the tree while thinking of what kind of wealth they want, and how much, and it’ll appear next to the tree, among the forks of those roots that crawl above ground. Silver, gold, gems, exquisite cloth and fabrics, delicious food or crystalline water, as long as someone wishes for it, they’ll obtain endless wealth from it. You could vainly attempt to keep all of it to yourself, of course, but Uttarakuru was made a paradise in the mortal world by allowing all of its inhabitants to obtain wealth from the tree. Or perhaps that only worked due to the people of the northern continent being universally kind and compassionate. Either way, you have another example of such a tree close to wherever you begin, and in future jumps may decide where this tree appears."
1431,,600,Guardian of the Land,Thailand Mythology and Folklore,Domain,"A rather common feature of this world is that of spirits with domain over a location or region, who can rightfully demand taxes from those who pass over their territory. You can be one of these spirits, with this purchase. How this works is that you can attune yourself to a place, taking seconds for something like a small house and months for a whole region, which lends you great magical and/or spiritual influence over the location you attuned yourself to. After doing this, you can set a toll, and those who pass through or live on your land, be they living or dead, mortal or god, will have to pay a tax to pass through or remain. There’s no guarantee that they’ll be able to pay or that they’ll like the tax, but if you’re not too demanding then it’s unlikely that it’ll pose much of a problem.

The payment is merely in terms of value, and can be paid with anything of equal value, be it currency or goods. Of course, the amount of supernatural influence you hold over this place depends on your magical and physical might, and if you spread your claim too wide without being strong enough to make up for it you won’t be able to enforce your tax as well, but for the sedentary this could be a nice source of stable income, depending on where they set down shop."
1432,,600,Castlevania Yggdmillennia,Fate/Apocrypha V1.4,Domain,"Yeah, best not to let Lancer of Black hear about that nickname. Whether this is some backup to Black Faction, a clerical error with the construction company or just fiat-backed jump-nonsense, you have a reasonably sized castle-town with magically enhanced fortifications and wards. It’s well equipped with surprisingly modern amenities for any ‘classic’ Magus and has plenty of room for any staff or allies you might have. There’s even space for a series of workshops spread throughout the facility, and a very large but currently empty heavily fortified storage area that could contain something valuable. The castle has some manner of anti-air defences, which could perhaps come in useful someday, and seems to be able to accommodate a wide range of usually non-compatible areas of magical study – even the dreaded magic-vs-tech issues don’t seem to crop up here if that would ever be an issue. While there’s currently an empty basement you could store quite a lot of things in, if you need some sort of manned defence there are a number of automated factory-rooms that can churn out sizable armies of high-quality golems at a rapid pace, and the machines that make them can accept any improvements or alterations to the designs you might have. This place is so well equipped and spacious, if you were to send out invitations for disgruntled Mages you’d get more than a few enthusiastic replies and attract some genuine talent away from even the more established institutions. Maybe the potent lay lines the place is built over help too, if you have a way to use them? In future jumps this place will retroactively fit into the landscape in such a way it doesn’t actually change anything, and defaults to a pleasant location in Romania. Otherwise you can just access it in a pocket dimension via the Warehouse or specify where it appears once per jump. Appearing out of mist during a red moon eclipse is optional."
1433,,600,Building Site,Fate/Apocrypha V1.4,Domain,"You have land to build on, one that could fit a good-sized fortress on, hidden from the surrounding area by trees and general isolation. Isn’t that enough? No? Alright then, this is fiat-backed prime real estate for building. Namely, you can build absolutely any structure here. So long as you somehow own the materials, or at least are able to immediately pay for them with your own money, you can construct pretty much any building you know how to construct, the material somehow disappearing from its place of origin and appearing here, with further costs to you varying for any specific construction approaches. Nobody will find this strange unless you point it out, and while there is a paper trail if you need one for any reason it will also become impossible to track down if that’s more convenient. Curiously, time of construction only appears to be instant for those observing, as from the construction’s perspective it seems to take as long as it would to realistically occur. If unoccupied, the structures within this Building Site can be modified in a similar manner, such as adding extensions or other improvements. If you want, willing people can share this perspective, though they don’t physically change or age with the pseudo-time passing so it can’t be used as some sort of time-accelerating exercise chamber, but could be used if someone happens to enjoy building work and ordering around ghostly construction workers. While this might seem oddly specific, it could be useful for structures that get more powerful the more time and effort is invested into them. Additionally, while the properties of the Building Site only apply to structures within it that are on the ground, there’s nothing stopping a structure intended as a building from being moved out of the Building Site by some means..."
1434,,600,Tomb Hideout ,Fate/Apocrypha V1.4,Domain,"Sure, it’s not some floating pleasure-palace or intimidating fortress, but you know what this is? Subtle. Rather well hidden. This place is surprisingly liveable and spacious, and if you happen to be interested in Necromancy there’s a good number of bones in boxes here – if that freaks you out, this place is empty of that sort of thing. The ‘main’ entrance is an easily overlooked and locked gate in a graveyard, which has the same corpse/no corpses stipulation as stated earlier depending on preference. If you were interested in that sort of thing, you’d find that if you do want corpses to be present, they happen to have belonged to notable families, making them valuable components in any sort of necromancy you might carry out, or if you really wanted to blackmail someone with their Great-Great-Grandfather’s skull. If you had the talent, you could even exploit this not-so- final resting place to call up a sizable ghostly defence force, though these pale in comparison to even the weakest Servant there is the value of quantity over quality. These barely-visible spectres would make pretty good spies too. This place won’t get flooded or affected by earthquakes and natural cave-ins, maintains a comfortable climate, and the main rooms are deep enough underground that it could tank some of the less devastating Noble Phantasms. It’s also nigh-impossible to get tracked down to this hideout even if people are looking for you, though this doesn’t strictly protect against bugs and other monitoring measures placed directly onto you or anyone you bring in – that’s on you to sort out. Despite having several entrances through a series of tunnels leading into the surrounding area, any attempt at invasion will only come from a single direction, allowing easy escape if it is somehow found. Additional features include some camping equipment to make it a bit nicer to sleep in, enough non-perishable rations for three months, a method of communicating with the outside world of your choice that can’t be intercepted or tracked back to your location, a passable Magus Workshop for whatever specialities you have, and a clearing in the graveyard above seems to be ideal for summoning a Servant. Best to do that outside, some can be a bit temperamental at first."
1435,,600,Home Field Advantage,Fate/Apocrypha V1.4,Domain,"What, did you think the Big Bad stayed in their base just because it was comfortable? When you have established a territory, such as building your own base, owning land, etc, you gain certain advantages based on your own specialities. Maybe you’re physically stronger and more durable? Maybe your opponents are weakened? Maybe your spells are more effective? Either way, you’ve just become very good at playing the defensive game. Just be aware that you’ll lose these advantages if you leave, or something is able to overwrite it.

Boosted: Oh, well, that’s even better. Your advantages in your territory have considerably increased and can continue to increase the more resources and time you invest into that territory. Invest enough time and resources into your fancy floating palace and even a physically frail Caster can generate magical shields that can block an enraged Saber, rapidly cast spells that would usually require rituals, and mentally coordinate and control any defences you happen to have.

1436,,600,Have Fun Storming The Castle! ,Fate/Apocrypha V1.4,Domain,"And you will, because for some reason attacking the heart of enemy territory, their strongest fortress, their seat of power, it’s your speciality. You have a preternatural talent at siege warfare and direct assaults where this is concerned, enough to covertly lead a strike force into the heart of enemy territory, or direct an army of minions to directly confront the defending force with practiced ease. You even know the layout of an unfamiliar maze-like fortress like the back of your hand and can easily spot any traps or intruder countermeasures. You’re not unstoppable with just this, and you’ll need some force to bear for it to count for anything, but you’ve certainly got a knack for using the resources you have for such approaches that would scare a self-proclaimed King of Conquerors.

Boosted: They mock you approaching them? Don’t they know you have to get close to hit them? Whether or not they actually do, they’ll quickly find themselves significantly less smug once they realise that advantages of territory don’t seem to be so effective against you. In fact, your resistance seems to scale with proximity to their seat of power to the point that a queen in her throne room will find herself no more potent against you than they would outside on the battlefield. Their best defence just isn’t as good as your best offense.

1437,,600,Isenstein ,The Song of the Nibelungs,Domain,"You are now the lady or lord of a mighty and vast fortress with 86 towers, three grand palaces and a big and beautiful hall. In this jump it is located in Iceland, but in future jumps it will integrate wherever you want. This fortress comes with enough servants to keep it clean, the stoves running, the animals tended for and the walls defended."
1438,,600,Invasion of Fantasy,Witch on the Holy Night,Domain,"Pity Flat Snark, king of fantasies, enslaved by the witch of eternity. It seems like that great Ploy, you have a little divine blood in your ancestry. Enough to work one specific miracle. With this, even an ordinary boy could release a surge of divine magical energy higher quality than any reproduceable by mages in the current era on the scale of an amusement park. Within it, fantasy overwrites reality as defined by your will, and the world starts to run on a kind of fairytale logic rather than conventional physics. Bring mascots to life, turn ordinary offices into Escheresque mazes or make the reflection of a mirror into a tangible location anyone can pass into. Your ability to manipulate reality isn’t unlimited, but something on the scale of vast armies of humanoid soldiers as well as gigantic automatons to attack somebody while cutting off the area with a barrier that would challenge even powerful mages is well within your reach-and you have a great discretion to shift your form and position within the territory. Your power over illusions and perceptions is even greater; disguising yourself as the actual moon while “merely” hovering somewhere high in the sky would be easy. It goes without saying this divine magical energy can be used to empower your own abilities greatly. Best of all, the scale of your magical realm grows over time-the power of fantasies unleashed feeding back into you like a perpetual fairytale reactor. Let the strictures of the modern world collapse. Cry havoc, and release the dogs of fantasy"
1439,,600,The Communists Have The Music,HighSchool DxD,Domain,"There are many bounded fields, pocked dimensions, or hidden locations where the supernatural lives freely without hiding their magic from humanity, while some are very difficult to access, most of them have some sort of physical gate or entrance somewhere. This is a simple set of keys and a map. Except of course, the map has highlighted all of those entrances in the human world, as well as a feature to auto-update with useful information or whenever a new gate is made or destroyed. Likewise, the key acts as a masterkey to allow access to those realms. Can’t do much if the place is being guarded by someone, but I’m sure you will think of something. On that note, these two will update again every time you enter a new world."
1440,,600,Beyond The Sun,HighSchool DxD,Domain,"Olympus, Heaven, Valhalla, Tenkai, etc. There are far too many of those godly realms where the strongest beings live, with the strongest gates lie, the most elite soldiers defend it, the most sought treasures wait within, the fairest of maidens, and so on. Something unattainable by mortals and thoroughly enjoyed by the Gods above. Here’s your very own heavenly realm, up to standard and unlikely to be less luxurious or powerful than any other. Comes with free infrastructure, no matter how weird or alien it would normally be, as well a ‘staff’ of your choice, but no afterlife system unless you have one of those already. You will always have a way to access it, even in other jumps. Feel free to design the looks and themes of it."
1441,,600,Pieced Together ,HighSchool DxD,Domain,"Ajuka didn’t make the Evil Pieces out of nothing, no, he used the materials lying around in Agreras, a floating island that hold both ancient technology and magic artifacts from the age of the original Maous and an astonishing reserve of resources with unique properties – including the crystals that are needed to make the Evil Pieces and Saint Braves. This island is a copy of that one, and holds the same resources, including the yet undiscovered ones. As a bonus, this island will ‘refill’ its resources once a year, so if you’re good enough at it, you might be able to get the full value of this year after year. I wouldn’t let others know you have this."
1442,,600,Armored City Berlin,HighSchool DxD,Domain,"Not only devils, but many supernatural creatures like to claim human territories as their own hunting grounds, while the treatment varies between species, what this usually entails is that no other supernatural being, or member of a foreign faction, can roam around there without your knowledge or approval, otherwise, it would be on your rights to deal with them as you see fit without any repercussions. What this gives you is a deed approved by several important figures declaring that one human city is under your jurisdiction when it comes to the supernatural. Sure, you can select Kuoh if you want to. You can select a new city each new jump as well."
1443,,600,The Underworld,God of War,Domain,"From the idyllic Elysium to the dreaded Tartarus, the dead will find no shortage of places to rest when their time comes. Perhaps you desire a realm of the dead of your own, or maybe you want to bring some comfort to those in future worlds whose souls have nowhere else to go. Regardless, the end result is the same. You are now in possession of your very own afterlife, a Warehouse attachment that is constantly expanding to fill all the dead you allow within. You can be as picky as you want with who is allowed within, but all the spirits within will answer their Master's call, no matter what you may have them do."
1444,,600,Hellenistic World,God of War,Domain,"What is a king with no kingdom, a god without a land to worship them? Wonder no longer, for you now find yourself as the master of all the greek mainland, or at the very least a very convincing copy. This Warehouse attachment houses the entirety of Greece, as well as its people. They will see you as their lord and master, loyal followers and worshippers to the last."
1445,,600,Aegean Sea,God of War,Domain,"The sea is as beautiful as it is dangerous, hiding just as many wonders as there are horrors beneath the waves. How fortunate, then, that you find yourself as the master of a sea of your very own. In addition to the vast amount of sea life and numerous islands you now have access to, you may also find the ruins of an ancient city once known as Atlantis, all its wealth and wonders lying untouched at the bottom of these waters."
1446,,600,Chariot of the Sun,God of War,Domain,"The personal ride of Helios, this chariot is drawn by two immortal steeds, flying through the air as gracefully as any bird. Not only will its speed scale with you, ensuring that it will remain a viable mode of transportation, but it is simply too bright to be looked at directly by anyone who isn't you. Additionally, it will greatly improve all light and fire abilities you may possess, making you as resplendent as the sun itself."
1447,,600,Jumper’s Gulch,Final Fantasy III,Domain,"A large mountain range, seemingly impassable. Within the range lies a valley, and within this alley lies a village. The village is populated by Gulgan sages, going about the business of being sages and oracles. These Gulgans are loyal to you and count as followers, but cannot leave the village. They are wise, and if presented with any manner of scholarly or philosophical question will work tirelessly towards finding you an answer. Post-jump the mountain range and village can follow you from world to world or become a warehouse attachment."
1448,,600,Castle Jumpune,Final Fantasy III,Domain,"A large, beautiful castle with aesthetics of your choice. The interior is very complex, almost like a dungeon in a video game, and is fully furnished. It also comes with tons of statues of knights, which can come to life to defend the castle from intruders. These statues are similar to the ones made with the False Soldiers perk. Post-jump the castle can follow you from world to world or become a warehouse attachment."
1449,,600,Nautilus,Final Fantasy III,Domain,"A high speed airship designed to resist even the strongest of winds, and is easily one of the fastest airships around. It also bears an enchantment allowing it to dive beneath the waves to explore the further depths of any ocean. "
1450,,600,To Hades and back,Xena - Hercules,Domain,"People may die, legendary objects may be stolen away to the furthest corners of the world, but there will always be heroes willing to go forth and quest for what has been lost. After setting forth on a lonely journey, you will find a path to a grim and cold realm, be it the underworld of Greek myth or a stranger realm more suitable to a different Jump. Here you will be presented with trials layered in symbolism and difficult to overcome, no matter the powers, tools, or knowledge you possess. If successful on your quest, you may return with something once destroyed or lost to the world - the life of a loved one, a forgotten bit of knowledge, or perhaps an item once sundered now made whole. You may attempt such a journey only once per jump."
1451,,600,Homeland Advantage,Fate/Apocrypha,Domain,"Fame is incredibly important for Servants. Beyond the fact that their legend has to be known to be able to be summoned, existing within their homeland, within the land where they are most famous, grants them an incredible boost in power. With this purchase, you’ll be able to experience that first-hand, as for whatever reason, your legend has come to be known in Romania, to the same degree as Vlad III is known in the small nation. This fame boosts your might, such that even as an average Servant you could fight great heroes evenly. Not only will you have greater physical and magical might to bear, your abilities and Noble Phantasms will grow significantly more powerful and versatile. To use the two tiers of purchase in this jump as an example, it could let you reach the level of the 500cp option if you’ve taken the 300cp option. And if you’re already a great hero, well, your power will truly be a sight to behold. Of course, the moment you leave this land, or perhaps enter a space which counts as somewhere else like the Hanging Gardens of Semiramis, the boost to your power goes away. In future jumps, you may choose a small nation or piece of land, relative to the world at large, where this fame boost will apply to you."
1452,,600,Neo-Jumper Temple,Fate/Strange Fake,Domain,"Praise be to you, Jumper. The greatest and most fantastic of beings that walks this Earth! Dedicated entirely to you, this is a massive building. While not the size of a skyscraper, it would certainly be considered one of the largest buildings of the ancient era. Decorated in a way that matches your religion or or that of your era and region of origin in this Jump, this massive construction exudes a mortifying feeling to any outsiders, making any who seek to hurt you feel the pressure of your power, and welcoming those who would worship you.

The temple has three functions: first, it will gather the mana from the local leylines and use it to empower both you, the owner of the temple, and those you designate as its guardians or priests. Secondly, if you were to be a divinity, it would raise the quality of your Divine Core and powers.

But it is its final function that it’s the most terrifying: if used by a sufficiently powerful divinity, this temple can be used to rewrite the current texture of the world. This can cause the world to recede back into the Age of Gods, a time when Mystery was prevalent and the will of humanity was not the one deciding how the planet should be run.

This temple can be summoned at any location, but it will take at least a day for it to be set up. Whenever it is summoned, the local area will start to revert back into the Age of Gods as well, increasing the density of mana around, and connecting to the old Textures of your region of origin."
1453,,600,SNOWflake ,Katana Zero,Domain,"Sometimes, though...you need a lighter touch. You’re not some indiscriminate samurai, though, you have a bit more class than that; and oh boy, you are very good. Zero would have a hard time killing you even if you were just a normal person in all other respects, with how skilled you are with a sword and how you can teleport to any distance in a flurry of flower petals (your choice on which flower) in an instant. Just be mindful that it will make a very audible noise once you arrive, it’ll take a few seconds for this blink to recharge, and that those petals are fucking sharp. Oriental theming is optional."
1454,,600,Even Miracles Take a Little Time ,Out of Context: Disney Princess Supplement,Domain,"You are now able to set yourself a form of proportional time bubble that allows you to reduce the amount of time any actions would normally take up to 1/100th so the amount of time it would normally take. Through this you can among other things make an object, travel a distance or throw a punch will be 1% of its normal time. Keep in mind this is not super speed and your individual actions will have the same external effect as if you had done it in real time."
1455,,600,Lair,The Little Mermaid,Domain,"Built into the corpse of a leviathan (or, if you prefer, a big cave or an ice fortress) is a safe haven just for you, where you can plot and practice your dark magic. There’s a nice garden area to grow potion ingredients, a potion-making area (sans cauldron and ingredients), a dungeon, as well as all the necessary living arrangements for you and your minions/companions. More importantly, this lair boosts your magical abilities and can even assist you in small ways. Self-cleaning, regulating the temperature, self-repairing, etc. Can either attach to your warehouse or will be placed in the jump, under- or near water."
1456,,600,Atlantican Castle,The Little Mermaid,Domain,"A gleaming, golden castle at the bottom of the ocean, surrounded by a small city of merpeople. Staffed by a mixture of sea creatures (where appropriate) and merpeople. Any air-breathing guests will find that they are perfectly safe and comfortable while here (though this does not extend outside the city limits)."
1457,,600,Castle By the Sea ,The Little Mermaid,Domain,"A beautiful, fairytale-esque castle with its own private beach and dock. Comes in a style of your preference (or defaulting to brilliant white stonework). Fully staffed by dutiful servants and brave guards. There is also a small fishing/farming/etc village nearby who will pay a not insignificant amount of taxes each year. Will retain any upgrades/changes you make and can be attached to your warehouse or placed somewhere near water in the jump."
1458,,600,Tunguska Sanctuary,Fate/Legends - Baba Yaga,Domain,"Imagine, if you may, a world untouched by humanity where only creatures under your rule exist. This Sanctuary is one such realm. Taking the form of a Reality Marble that persists in its corner of reality, this place is closed off from the rest of the world. The natural laws of the world are useless in this domain, denying human history itself and would cause summoned spirits to weaken and fade away, only living humans and heroes being unaffected. Only non-human spirits could properly manifest but they will find they are not alone in their inhumanity. Within this Sanctuary is a copy of every animal and Beast you have personally captured, devoured or otherwise gained the data of. As mindless familiar they guard this realm and are an animalistic army, mirroring those of beasts you tamed or studied to completion. They can be mass produced and set to patrol certain routes but by themselves do not mate, obtain experience or transform. ‘Birthing’ new creatures from your own knowledge is more than possible, even making new hybrids or otherwise enhanced beasts. One such new creation, the War-beasts, already persist in a special area inside of the Sanctuary known as the Dead Zone, gun wielding animals able to use the weapons better than mankind itself could and are exceptionally good at killing humans. Its mirror, the Life Zone, meanwhile only holds sentience lacking innocent creatures. Lastly, this Sanctuary features its own ecosystem but also its own atmosphere, being capable of surviving a trip through space in case you want to go as far away from humans as possible, without needing the aid of a Servant qualifying as a Grand to become an Egg launched into Space. What will you do with this small world?"
1459,,600,Larval Beast,Fate/Legends - Baba Yaga,Domain,"Among the many enemies of humanity, few are as terrifying and dreadful as the seven Beasts. Each one represents an existential threat to humanity and some kind of Sin like Pity, Regression, Comparison, Taming or any other Sin. However new Beasts can also develop to try and bring about their own version of the end, a certain Spirit having become a Larval Beast as a result of Cath Palug stepping down in a certain timeline. You however do not necessarily replace a Beasts spot, perhaps becoming your own distinct Beast... one day. This Perk does not make you humanities most dreaded enemy just yet but it does give you some of what makes them so dangerous.

By itself this bring two great benefits. Independent Action and Independent Manifestation. With these skills you can prevail in the world all by yourself, even as a spirit not requiring any other energy source or vessel to remain linked on the physical plane. This also grants a certain degree of travel capabilities, leting you cross the borders of dimensions and even timelines, if the opportunity presents itself, without any risk. You could not Jump from timeline to timeline just with this but should multiple timelines end up being somehow in the same physical space separated by dimensional borders, you could freely pass through them. Though not as potent as a proper Beasts Independence, it is still an invaluable skill."
1460,,600,The Genesis Seed,Godbound,Domain,"The world is, by and large, a disappointment to even the most compassionate divinity. But it need not be so, when one invests their power into forming a new one. By channelling large amounts of Dominion, the seed can creates an entire Paradise, a pocket realm where you decide the rules of reality(including death and life), and is extremely receptive to souls. In worlds without a defined afterlife, you can funnel the slain into this space of your own accord and easily use your Apotheosis abilities within it, with all changes you make being of greater ease within it. You can decide the size of the realm upon its inception by devoting more Dominion into it. Things created within or brought into the Paradise besides yourself or your companions will be difficult to remove once they’re there, requiring a price of Dominion to do so. 

Further information on Paradises can be found in the notes section."
1461,,600,The God-King’s Resplendent Barge,Godbound,Domain,"God-King Zereus was an ancient theurge of great power, and impeccable taste. This barge is one he would have deemed worth owning, being a flat-bottomed vehicle of shining bronze metal, perhaps seven hundred feet long and three hundred feet wide. A multi-levelled structure at the back of the barge provides housing for the occupants and the heavily- guarded control room where a mortal pilot sits on the golden throne that commands the barge. While the God-King himself could have easily helmed the ship, his business below had him delegating the work to his most trusted minion, a trust encouraged by the will-sapping effect of the barge's controls.

The barge is capable of carrying a thousand passengers in relative comfort and can fly at a speed of twenty miles an hour, ignoring all but magically-empowered ill weather. A passenger may be replaced by up to five hundred pounds of cargo. The pilot of the barge may sap their willpower and life force (or divine energy for those who have it) to repair the vehicle. The weapon systems allows the barge to shower down a hellstorm of solar flames, with enough power to slay armies and lay waste to fortresses easily."
1462,,600,And Unto Thee Was Given Dominion ,Godbound,Domain,"How proud the mortals are for using the limitless power of pure creation itself, for the same purpose an ape might use an especially sharp rock. You are a perfected conduit for the divine creative forces you channel, and when you exercise esoteric, world-shaping forces like Dominion the forces you unleash could curse or cure entire provinces with the same efforts others enact on villages. Mundus wards crack before your will and can shatter if you turn your focus upon them, while the efforts of others to revert your Dominion with their own divine powers are blunted as if spitting in the winds of a hurricane. When the angels raise their new creation from Uncreated Night, you could do much of the heavy lifting.

Moreover, as you exert your will on the world with Dominion the metaphysical principles imbued in you as Words or similar divine powers have a powerful influence on the natural laws of the land you command. The concepts they hold sway over spread rapidly through your area of influence, creating anomalous phenomena, entities and even events which instinctively act to strengthen your hold on the land. To spread War might spawn soldiers created from the base material of the landscape on patrol around your boundaries, while to spread Fire erupt pillars of magical flame from deep holes in the earth endlessly. Never harmed by the expressions of your own divinity, the benefits of all worship and faith-based acts centred around you is strengthened such that the Dominion you reap from a city alone would be the envy of entire pantheons of veteran Godbound, while your supplicants and subordinates gain visions showing them how to cultivate your sacred land or spread further outward gradually with rites and acts of devotion. It is always far easier to shape the world with your divine powers once it has been claimed in this manner; the impossible becomes merely improbable, while the improbable becomes plausible. Just remember that all expressions of the Words you exemplify are amplified on this land, and that it may be wise to erect wards before your divine rivals realise their powers are just as supported as yours."
1463,,600,Chosen By The One,Godbound,Domain,"It is said by some that the One intended for the Godbound to mend a world torn by human hubris. You stand as testament to that, for it is by your works the world could see a new age of splendour. All that you set up with your own power and vision not only has a great endurance against all adversary, but seems to become grander and more wondrous with time through coincidence. Shattering your grand towers inspires your devotees to raise more in your honour with new defences. Musical compositions you play could inspire entire genres given enough time, and even in the short term result in such inspiration that others invent new pieces of music sampling tastefully from your work. Even esoteric forces that do not pay you homage somehow and interdimensional incursions are greatly suppressed; no Night Road will ever open on your land without a truly staggering feat of theurgy, all spirits that encroach on it are instinctively compelled to obey your laws and hostile magic finds a great resistance against enacting any kind of malignant change. The wisdom of the ages itself seems to be easier to rediscover, and both you and your citizens are all but guaranteed to retrieve mighty treasures and once-lost resources if any are available in a world you live in.

Best of all, when your worshippers use or pay tribute to such works regularly they are considered shrines sanctified in your honour. You may target miracles and Gifts you can already use through them, lavish blessings on your creations resonant with your own gifts or even briefly manifest yourself through an avatar of divine energies to soothe a devotee in need, should you sense their pain. This harmony with creation brings with it a unique power: The capacity to create new Celestial Shards by channelling the devotion of your faithful into theomechanical systems. It will not be easy; it would take a very devout village or a somewhat devout city regularly praying to a system capable of accepting their faith over the entire area just to churn out a dozen Shards every month. But those dozen Shards are half a dozen more than any other deity save One can possibly accrete in a month, and both your divine control over a terrain as well as the bliss and love of your devotees can increase this. In a region you have set yourself up as an arch-deity mass production of Shards may soon become viable, and one can only dream of the heights you may reach upon attaining a Paradise of your own. Let your reign be marked not by the hubris of the Former Empires, but by the promise of salvation many believed the One would deliver unto them."
1464,,600,Smash Castle        ,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Domain,"A giant castle has come into your possession. For now, it has appeared somewhere close to your starting location. 

The castle prominently displays the Super Smash Bros. logo. It will expand as needed, allowing it to, at a minimum, properly house you, all of your companions, and all of your followers. You may allow non-active companions to stay here, if you wish.

Somewhere within the castle is a large room of doors. Each of these are connected to a touchscreen computer. These doors each lead to a space resembling a stage shown in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, which can be used for Smash Bros.-style fights. The computers allow you to alter the rules of these fights, as long as those rules are something that exist in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. True death and chain-failure can never occur in these spaces. There are also two additional doors; these allow you to play a Race to the Finish-style Bonus Game, as well as Home-Run Contest whenever you want.

You will never be able to bring anything out of these spaces that you did not take in, and anything you bring in with you, be it items or people, will never be lost within these spaces.

If you also have Stage Builder, you may place it in this room, overriding its normal placement rules.

Starting from your next jump, at the end of each jump, the room will gain a new door, featuring a Smash Bros.-style stage based on an iconic location from the setting you have just visited. It will also retroactively do this for jumps you had visited prior to this one.

As if all of this wasn’t enough, the castle is regularly visited by various people you have encountered on your chain, each wishing to battle in the special spaces. You will never be able to get anything out of them, barring some pleasant conversation, and battling them in the assigned spaces. This goes both ways; these visitors will never attempt to harm anyone else in the castle, or each other, and they will never get anything from you other than a nice talk or the fun they get out of fighting you.

In future jumps, and when you finally return home (whether via Spark or not), this castle may either be connected to your Warehouse, or placed somewhere near your starting location, in each new world you visit."
1465,,600,World of Jumper,Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,Domain,"You have gained access to a personal dimension. Starting at the size of a small city, it will naturally expand over time. You may also ‘feed it’, further increasing its size, provided you have a means of consuming the land around you, or are willing to provide your own energy to it. As the dimension grows, it will naturally develop features and landmarks found in settings featured in the Super Smash Bros. series as well as jumps you have visited. The appearance of the dimension is twisted to suit your personal ideals. If you are an Embodiment, this will have a strong influence on the appearance of your dimension. You are able to draw power and energy from your dimension, the larger the dimension, the more power and energy it will grant you. While you are drawing power or energy from your dimension, it will not be able to grow and expand in size.

You may open and close portals to your dimension at your leisure. You may also travel to your dimension at any time, without opening a portal. Should you do this however, a portal to your dimension will appear where you once were (counting as the portal you took to your dimension), allowing others to follow you inside. You may leave your dimension at any time, causing you to appear at the same portal you used to enter your dimension.

Only you, your companions, and your followers may remain in the dimension at the end of a jump. All other sentient beings are automatically ejected. You may choose to have any inactive companions stay here if you wish.

Should you already possess another personal dimension, or a similar ability, you may import it into this option, granting it all of the advantages offered here."
1466,,600,Jumper’s School of Witchcraft & Wizardry,Wizarding World,Domain,"Magic is much like any other part of the universe the people call home. And like any other part of the universe, there will always be those willing to study it and they in turn shall pass on their teachings to another. In the beginning, such lessons were passed on through relationships between masters and apprentices but as time went on and humanity expanded across the world, it became clear that this practice would be... insufficient.

And so, institutions of learning were formed, institutions that you may now know as schools, universities, colleges, academies, and the like. With this, lessons could be passed onto more and more students, ensuring that the knowledge of the world can never truly be lost so long as there are those willing to teach and those willing to learn.

You have chosen to carry on this proud tradition, having established for yourself your very own school for any young magical souls so very willing to learn. While it may not be as prestigious as the eleven Great Wizarding Schools, you’ll find that others still view it as a respectable, if not entirely prestigious, center of learning.

But more importantly, you’ll find that teaching here is far more effective than it would otherwise be elsewhere. Your students learn faster, they retain more information, and surprisingly, they’re more behaved than they would be. Not enough that they won’t actually pull out of doing pranks, but enough that they keep the aftermath contained and they’ll actually clean up the mess.

Most importantly however, wherever you plop down your school, it will be legitimately recognized as a legal institution, regardless of how out-of-place it may seem. Even in places where magic is hated and despised, your school will remain as a completely legal safe haven for any aspiring witches and wizards."
1467,,600,Pride Lands,The Lion King,Domain,"Your very own copy of the Pride Lands. Everything the light touches (and that you see in an official canon movie/comic/show in the Lion King franchise) is yours to take with you to future Jumps. If you’re struggling to figure out how much that is, assume a decent chunk of the centre of Africa. If you bought Pride Rock as well, you are automatically the uncontested ruler of this land and all who dwell in it. If you did not, it is essentially just a chunk of land you own, but the inhabitants don't have any real allegiance to you. If you bought the Oasis, the land will gain the effects of the Oasis, in that those who wish you harm will struggle to find the Pride Lands. If you bought Rafiki’s Tree, divination magic and rituals will be strengthened while in the Pride Lands. If you bought the Elephant Graveyard, those who attempt to invade your lands will be filled with dread and their resolve will crumble after prolonged exposure. You can have it as a Warehouse Extension or import it into future jumps, either as its own island or part of an existing landmass."
1468,,600,Angstrom Levy,Invincible,Domain,"You were born with the powers to open portals to step between realities. You can open portals to travel within the local multiverse of every setting you enter and can simply move from one to the other. The only problem with this would have been that while every setting has this local infinite multiverse and you’re are able to open portals to travel through it, you do not know where you are in the multiverse or where you are precisely within each universe. However thanks to the grace of jumpchain you now possess the equivalent to knowledge to what Angstrom Levy would attain through gathering up all of his copies, that of knowing innately where you are in both universe and multiverse as well as the general features of the universe in question. Thanks to this the portals that you open to parallel realities no longer have to be in the exact same physical location as where you are standing. This knowledge updates in future worlds. You are also able to open portals to other parallel dimensions should they exist naturally in the setting, such as the Never Never in Dresden files, Heaven and Hell in DC, or parallel realities in Marvel for example. You are limited to the local multiverse until post-spark, upon which you can go anywhere."
1469,,600,School-Appropriate House,Wizard 101,Domain,"Naturally, you’ll have a dorm room set up for you during your time at Ravenwood, but for some a simple dorm room isn’t enough. With this purchase you’ll be able to take up residence in one of the many smaller islands in the Spiral, carefully designed to fit the aesthetics of your school. For an extra 200 points, you may freely redecorate your home into any of the homes the game had."
1470,,600,The Jumper House,The Owl House,Domain,"Eda isn’t the only one investing in magical real estate. You gain a comfortable and well-furnished home built to your specifications. This isn’t anything as grand as the wealthier houses on the Boiling Isles, like the Blight Estate, but there’s enough space here for a family to live together without driving each other insane. In fact, there seems to be a bit more space inside than should be possible given the outside geometry of the building. And that isn’t the only magical benefit included with your new home. You also get a built in security system in the form of a “house demon” like Hooty. Of course, yours can be themed after any animal you wish. Finally, the house is equipped with a defensive enchantment that protects it against the environment. This won’t keep out an artillery barrage, but you won’t have to worry about acid rain or any other wild weather phenomenon."
1471,,600,Doorway,The Owl House,Domain,"Earth and the Demon Realm are kept separate most of the time. Occasionally, a cryptid or some other supernatural strangeness will bleed over into our world, but for the most part the Demon Realm’s inhabitants are locked away. Of course, that’s not very helpful when you make a living selling human junk to the people of Bonesborough. You now have a replica of Eda’s portable portal, a physical doorway between Earth and the Demon Realm. When not in use, this simple-looking door folds away into an easy-to-carry suitcase. The doorway is still vulnerable to physical damage and requires protection. And you should protect it; Emperor Belos will stop at nothing to secure this artifact or its twin.

Much like a witch’s staff, this suitcase can be summoned or dismissed at will. If this item is destroyed, you will receive a replacement at the start of your next jump. In future settings, this item can create stable pathways to any “nearby” dimensions native to the setting. See the Notes section for details.

This doesn’t allow travel to alternate timelines or distant worlds, it bridges nearby dimensions that normally overlap. You couldn’t jump from the Boiling Isles to your favorite comic book universe, or travel to an alternate timeline where Belos never rose to power, but you could hop between the Human and Demon realms easily enough. In future worlds, this would allow you to pass between similarly close realities but not visit other Jump settings or alternate histories. A Jumper in the Dresdenverse could travel between the Mortal World and the Spirit World, and so on."
1472,,600,Enchanted Castle,Beauty and the Beast,Domain,"Want to leave the provincial life behind? There’s no better way than by moving into your very own castle.

This large castle is quite similar to the Beast’s Castle (after the spell was cast over it) in terms of size, layout, and general aesthetic. Portraits of the Beast and his family have been replaced by those of you, and those you are travelling between worlds with.

In order to maintain the castle, and look after you, this item comes with a small army of servants, well-trained in their intended roles. However, these servants are all animated objects, with forms appropriate to their designated role. This change is permanent, and independent of the spell the enchantress cast over the Beast’s Castle. You may decide their appearance, gender, and personality on a general or specific basis if you like. They count as followers, but cannot be made to leave the castle. Inactive companions may stay here as well; they too must remain inside the property.

While this spooky aesthetic may appeal to you, and the animated object servants do have advantages over humans in some respects, be warned: the people of this world (and perhaps others you might visit) will not take kindly to the existence of your castle, should they discover it, and may even choose to attack it to defeat the “evil” inside.

In future worlds, you may choose for it to be attached to your Warehouse, or to be placed somewhere appropriate, close to your starting location.

Should the castle be destroyed, a replacement will appear in the same location after 24 hours. If it was placed out in the world, and that location is no longer viable, it will instead become attached to your Warehouse."

1474,,600,Forbidden Mountain,Disney’s Sleeping Beauty,Domain,"What evil overlord could call themselves as such without an evil lair, an ominous fortress, a sinister castle? Not one that’s any good, erm, evil, that’s for sure! Luckily, you are a proper evil monarch, and as such, you have a dark domicile of your own. Much like Maleficent’s lair, you have a large, jagged, dead mountain, on which is the unholy palace that you call home. It is dark, dreary, and a perfect fortress to repel the forces of good from. Even the most idiotic minions could put up a proper defense, assuming the other side doesn’t have fairies helping them. And it comes complete with everything you might need, from a throne room to a dungeon to a tower on which you might overlook the land...this is your kingdom of shadow Jumper. Rule it as you see fit."
1475,,600,Ash Lake ,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Domain,"This hidden lake lies at the bottom of The Great Hollow and is a seemingly endless expanse of black water and towering Archtrees, and is thought to be where all life originated. This ancient, timeless place houses a few hydras underneath the waters, as well as various other creatures that bow before your draconic might. While under the protection of the branches of these stone trees, you and your allies will find that all of your draconic abilities will be vastly improved."
1476,,600,Ringed City ,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Domain,"A walled city built for the pygmy lords who would aid the Lords in their war against the Ancient Dragons, a prison disguised as a gift. But it does not have to be such, as despite its disingenuous beginnings, it is a well defended metropolis that could reasonably last until the end of the world, no matter what may attempt to siege it. You and any allies will find that your abilities related to dark and shadow will have been vastly improved. It will be guarded by a number of those aligned with dark, but whether it is populated or not beyond just them is up to you, though their loyalty will always lie with you."
1477,,600,City of Izalith,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Domain,"A beautiful city of stone, carved deep in the earth in order to be closer to the lifeblood of the land itself, and the home of the Witch of Izalith and her children. It can be perilous for those not careful, due to the flowing rivers of lava, but it does add a level of protection seldom unappreciated and difficult to maneuver around. While within the bounds of this stone metropolis, you will find all of your and your allies’ abilities related to fire and lava have been vastly improved. It will be guarded by a number of those aligned with fire, but whether it is populated or not beyond just them is up to you, though their loyalty will always lie with you."
1478,,600,Tomb of the Giants,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Domain,"A dark, underground mausoleum the size of a metropolis filled with the venerable dead that fought in the war against the Everlasting Dragons. Not only is it a confusing labyrinth filled with numerous traps and deadly falls for even the most seasoned of explorers, but it is protected by hordes of mindless skeletons that you can command and direct with ease. Any powers and abilities related to death and decay will be vastly improved when used within these hallowed grounds."
1479,,600,Anor Londo,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Domain,"The soon to be legendary city of the gods, and the seat of the Great Lord Gwyn’s power. Made of beautiful marble and intricately designed by the finest minds of the ancient deities, not only do the thick walls of this metropolis offer a great amount of protection, but you and any of your allies will find that, when within the city, all of your divine and lightning related abilities will be vastly empowered. It will be guarded by a number of those aligned with light, but whether it is populated or not beyond just them is up to you, though their loyalty will always lie with you."
1480,,600,The First Flame ,Dark Souls: War of the Ancients,Domain,"The source of the souls which gave the Lords and their subjects life and clarity, a fire eternal. Set within a massive stone kiln, lies the First Flame, or at the very least an everlasting copy of it. It will act as an infinite reservoir of souls, constantly producing around five thousand souls an hour, though some will be more powerful than others. Once a month, there will be a soul of exceptional strength, fit for many of the stronger beings found here. Once a century or so, though, you will find something truly exceptional, a soul fit for a Lord. These souls are blank slates, and can be molded for any purpose you desire, whether that be enhancing yourself, creating items of great power, or using them in arcane rituals."
1481,,600,Hellsing Estate,Hellsing Ultimate Abridged,Domain,"You don’t run the world’s premiere monster-hunting organizations out of your parent’s garage; you work out of a classy joint like this. This expansive country estate features acres of rolling fields and dense forests, all surrounding a fortified mansion that would make Bruce Wayne green with envy. Made up of several buildings, this complex features not only a positively palatial residence, but also office spaces for administrative work and board meetings, comprehensive training facilities, and a helipad for quick escapes. Additionally, this headquarters is fortified to withstand both a tactical assault and full-blown siege; wait out your opponents with extensive supply caches, stimie their advance with a devastating minefield, and punish their aggression with numerous machine gun and grenade launcher emplacements. Just be careful when you walk your dog on the lawn."
1482,,600,Deus Ex Machina,Hellsing,Domain,"The pride of Millennium, their flagship weapon and command centre. An almost kilometer long
Zeppelin capable of significant speed, sheathed in metal armor tough enough to withstand missile attacks, and with a quite bizarre amount of storage in the carriage section. A massive war room to command from at the bridge, a large treasury and expansive laboratory, room for hundreds of soldiers to live and store their equipment in as well as a vast armory that stores everything from thousands of modernized military weapons to a full sized U-Boat, Panzer tanks and numerous other strange Nazi inventions. 

Attached to the carriage are numerous launchers, able to fire V-1 Flying Bombs. These cruise missiles, numbering in the hundreds, can cause huge fireballs and explosions where they land, raining chaos down below the Zepellin. The same catapults can also be used to fire off individuals or small vehicles at range, flinging vampiric soldiers miles across the battlefield to wherever they are needed. 

As an accompaniment, the Deus Ex Machina is staffed by a hundred loyal vampire soldiers, all artificial in nature, that man the ship’s various functions and act as a personal defence force for the owner of the ship. All are sworn in deepest loyalty to the owner. "
1483,,600,Keepers of the Flame ,Marry Poppins Returns,Domain,"Every city has secrets, and now, with this elegant set of twelve golden keys, each lovingly emblazoned with a stylized flame, you can use those secrets to give yourself an advantage. By planting one of these keys beneath an artificial and stationary public installation (statues, streetlights, etc.), you can create a concealed, underground pathway leading into any building in a five mile radius around the point where you initially planted the key. If you planted any other keys within that same vicinity, the tunnels created by both keys will automatically connect with each other, with clearly labeled signs to help you make the best out of the complicated tangle of underground tunnels which are sure to become plentiful. Best of all, however, is the fact that the constructs formed through the effect of these keys are completely undetectable to anyone without specific knowledge of what they’re looking for. You get one set of keys every ten years, or at the end of each Jump, depending on which comes first, so make sure to use them wisely!"
1484,,600,A Breath of Fresh Air ,Marry Poppins Returns,Domain,"This elegant and masterfully crafted umbrella is the perfect accompaniment for any prospective traveller. In addition to being able to fly at fairly high speeds, the umbrella is also capable of conjuring and manipulating the winds with the skill and grace of a conductor leading an orchestra. From gentle breezes to hurricane-like squalls, the types of winds which can be conjured through the use of this umbrella are theoretically limitless, though it should be mentioned that anything larger than a powerful stormwind (~157 mph) will require significantly longer periods of time to achieve. With proper knowledge and training, the umbrella can also be used to impact meteorological phenomena within its range, conjuring and dismissing enormous hurricanes with nothing more than a few simple gestures. Of course, the umbrella also flies, with its average flight speed clocking in at approximately 160 mph, and seems to nullify any inherent dangers which come with flying on such transportation. As with all potentially destructive items with few set limits, we ask that you fanwank responsibly when it comes to the usage of this item - your cooperation in the matter is very much appreciated."
1485,,600,The Repo Man Cometh,Marry Poppins Returns,Domain,"It’s always good to exact some collateral from those in your debt, and you’re even better at it than most. From now on, whenever someone tries to scamper out of debt which is owed to you through a legally binding transaction, you are capable of repossessing a single object that they own. This object must be inanimate and proportional in value to the debt you are due, though factors like time and injury sustained may also play a role in determining which objects can and cannot be repossessed by virtue of this ability. Upon repossession, the object in question is immediately transported to a pocket dimension inaccessible to the outside world - and yes, that includes you. The repossessed object will then remain, perfectly preserved, within the pocket dimension until the debt is repaid, at which point the previously repossessed object will then reappear at the exact location from which it was first taken."
1486,,600,A Caretaker’s Magic,Marry Poppins Returns,Domain,"There’s a world of adventure out there; all you need to do is find it! Perhaps an elegant porcelain bowl hides a fairy-tale forest full of talking animals and delightful song? Or does a freshly drawn bath hold an underwater adventure, replete with pirates and treasure? It’s easy enough for children to embark on these flights of fancy - rather, it is adults who cannot quite return to the worlds of their imagination. That’s where you come in. By drawing these fantastical realms to the surface, you can transform any household object into a portal that leads directly into a short, surreal adventure tailor-made for the subject in question. These adventures are more akin to highly realistic escape rooms, forcing their victims to complete a series of reasonably complex puzzles to escape. The time necessary to complete an entire adventure is ~30 minutes, though slight changes to individual escape times may vary depending on the individual involved. Just as above, please fanwank responsibly."
1487,,600,WizTech ,Wizards of Waverly Place,Domain,"If nothing were to change, in the near future, Justin is meant to become the next headmaster of WizTech, the premier school for magical studies for the young Wizards of the Wizard World. But now, it seems the deed of the school is under your name. You own the school... how that may be possible if you are not a wizard is up to you, maybe your great great great great (after a couple of dozen greats) great grandfather owned the land where WizTech is located, or maybe you won it in a pool game against a drunk wizard, anything is possible in this world."
1488,,600,Training Ground,WRECK-IT RALPH,Domain,"Heroes aren’t just born, they’re made. And this area can help you make yourself into a far better hero than you might otherwise have been. Modelled after the Hero’s Duty Tower, there are a hundred levels for you to fight your way through. You can access it via a door in your Warehouse, and if you should happen to die within, you’ll respawn back at the base of the tower, none the worse for wear. Cy-Bugs will feature as the default enemy, but you can select any race or enemy type that you’ve ever encountered to populate the tower for you to fight through. Either way, the enemies will be unable to leave the Training Ground, even if you leave the door open or accidentally carry out one of their eggs."
1489,,600,Unskippable Cutscene ,WRECK-IT RALPH,Domain,"It is always a little annoying to have a short movie play out while you’re playing a game, where you can’t affect the action, but now it will be working in your favor. Once per year, you can ‘assume direct control’ of the area around you, and choreograph the actions that will occur within that area for up to a minute. You can only control the actions and/or words, not the thoughts and desires of those being manipulated, but if the choreography is subtle and generally in line with what a given character would do, they’ll play it off and come up with an internal justification for why they acted the way they did. If the effects are more blatant, then they will recognize that they have been manipulated. This effect only works on a local level, up to an area roughly the size of a small city block."
1490,,600,Hacked Character,WRECK-IT RALPH,Domain,"Your ‘glitchiness’ has manifested into a set of strange abilities. You aren’t quite bound by code in the same way that other characters are, and you can project this effect, to a degree, into the code around you. To start with, you’ll be able to disrupt active effects, like disguises or barriers, stun characters that you glitch with, and shift your position slightly in a form of short-range teleportation. With practice and time, you could learn to clip through solid object, shift over long-ranges, and even edit attributes of yourself and others, such as altering outfits up to granting power-up effects without the actual power-up. Just be aware that higher level usages will be much more draining to you."
1491,,600,Firelink Shrine        ,Dark Souls: Covenants,Domain,"An ancient shrine that honors the Great Lord Gwyn, built around a bonfire and offers a safe place for those wandering this harsh land. It is a magnet for the wandering and wayward souls of the world, a peaceful place where the weight of the world can be alleviated, if only for a time. It also seems to connect to many areas in future worlds, being a central hub kind of area for travelers. With this shrine, a number of fellow clerics from the War of White will join you on your journey, offering their services as your new followers."
1492,,600,Anor Londo,Dark Souls: Covenants,Domain,"The legendary city of the gods, and the seat of the Great Lord Gwyn’s power. Made of beautiful marble and intricately designed by the finest minds of the ancient deities, the vast majority of gods have abandoned the city, leaving primarily the Silver Knights that still roam the streets, all of whom have agreed to become your followers. Not only does its thick walls offer a great amount of protection, but you and any of your allies will find that, when within the city, all of your divine and lightning abilities will be greatly empowered."
1493,,600,Ash Lake,Dark Souls: Covenants,Domain,"This hidden lake lies at the bottom of The Great Hollow and is an endless expanse of black water and towering archtrees, and is thought to be where all life originated. It houses a hydra who slumbers beneath the waves, as well as an Everlasting Dragon, possibly the last one in existence. With this dragon comes a whole host of draconic disciples, those who desire to become dragons themselves, all of whom have agreed to become your followers. Any draconic abilities possessed by you and your allies will be greatly enhanced if used here."
1494,,600,The Catacombs,Dark Souls: Covenants,Domain,"A dark, underground mausoleum filled with the venerable dead ranging from the recently deceased to those who fought in the ancient war against the Everlasting Dragons. Not only is it a confusing labyrinth filled with numerous traps and deadly falls, but it is protected by both the undead skeletons and a number of necromancers, all of whom have agreed to become your newest followers. Any powers and abilities related to death and decay will be greatly improved when used within these hallowed grounds."
1495,,600,Darkroot Forest ,Dark Souls: Covenants,Domain,"An ancient forest that rests near the city of the gods, a lush and vibrant place that heavily contrasts the rest of Lordran. Not only is it difficult to navigate for the underprepared, a twisting maze of trees and ferns, but it is filled with all manner of hostile plant life that will attack any trespassers who enter uninvited. This is not including the grand lake found within the heart of the forest, which is home to a deadly hydra. You will also find that a number of these plant creatures, as well as a few Forest Hunters as well have agreed to become your followers, ever diligent in their protection of the gravesite found within."
1496,,600,New Londo,Dark Souls: Covenants,Domain,"These haunted and dark ruins are modeled after the original kingdom of pygmies, built underground in order to be closer to the Dark, now only home to cursed souls and Darkwraiths. Such an environment is useful, though, because not only is it well protected by both limited access points and spirits attacking any you don’t allow within, but all dark abilities utilized by both you and your allies will be greatly improved when used within. You will also find a number of Darkwraiths have agreed to become your followers, ready to spread the Dark to future worlds. You could optionally take this city in its prime, before it was ravaged by flooding."
1497,,600,Lost Izalith,Dark Souls: Covenants,Domain,"The lost city of Izalith was once a proud city, made up of temples inside a massive cave but has long since been flooded with lava, and numerous demons guarding it. It is a treacherous area, though one that now sees you as its new master, filled with a number of demons who have agreed to become your followers. While within the bounds of these ruins, you will find all of your and your allies’ abilities related to fire and lava have been greatly improved. You could optionally take this city in its prime, before it was ravaged by the Flame of Chaos."
1498,,600,Kiln of the First Flame ,Dark Souls: Covenants,Domain,"A massive, ancient stone structure, meant to contain the very thing that gave the Lords their power. This kiln contains the First Flame, or at the very least an everlasting copy of it.

Once a month, there will be a soul of exceptional strength, fit for many of the stronger beings found here.

These souls are blank slates, and can be molded for any purpose you desire, whether that be enhancing yourself, creating items of great power, or using them in arcane rituals"
1499,,600,Dark Abyss,Dark Souls: Covenants,Domain,"Long ago, it is said that the kingdom of Oolacile almost fell to ruin due to the spread of the Abyss before it was beaten back by Artorias the Abysswalker. But such an Abyss, while twisted by Manus’ madness, is the natural environment for humanity. You are now able to cover an area in a deep darkness, all the way up to a city, where you and those allied with you are more potent. This is especially noticeable when using abilities related to darkness.

Boosted: That dreaded Abyss that once threatened Oolacile was not the only of its kind, for now you have the potential to repeat that ancient crisis, only in a more controlled manner. Covering an entire kingdom in a pitch black Abyss, which is capable of corrupting and even mutating any within at your discretion. If Oolacile almost fell at the height of Gwyn’s Age of Fire, then how will this failing age fare?

1506,,600,Death’s Abode,Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,Domain,"While we never are brought here Death has to spend his time somewhere when he isn’t gathering the souls of the fallen. This realm is a territory within a hidden dimension. It is both your home and a gathering place for the souls of the fallen that you reap. Any being who dies that you have a claim on will be brought here. Currently this place is small and empty, but given time it could grow to become a proper afterlife. If you are a god of death then this realm will automatically collect any beings not claimed by another god of death like Hades."
1507,,600,The Land of Far Far Away ,Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,Domain,"The Kingdom of Far Far Away is a magical continent in which the story of Shrek takes place. This is also Puss’s home and the location in which he seeks to return to at the end of his quest. If you wish you may take this realm of fantasy with you if you are willing to pay for it. The kingdom is filled with hundreds of fairy tale figures including Shrek, Cinderella, Arthur Pendragon, and many other famous figures. This option will grant you control over the land and the authority as its owner. All of the inhabitants will acknowledge this and respect your authority. Though their willingness to obey will still have some limits so no going cruel overlord just because you bought this."
1508,,600,Atlantean Colony,Atlantis - The Lost Empire,Domain,"It’s a little known fact that Atlantis has made contact with many cultures throughout the world, both as would-be conquerors and as bringers of knowledge and healing; however, it seems you’ve stumbled onto something special indeed- the remnants of an Atlantean colony, hidden somewhere beneath the earth, with its own Heart of Atlantis! Although isolation from Atlantis and the outside world has stagnated and even regressed their technological development somewhat, this colony of roughly one thousand has still managed to eke an out existence thanks to something special- a crystal that is akin to the Heart of Atlantis, albeit much smaller in size. Like the Heart of Atlantis it takes sustenance from the emotions of its people, and in return grants them enhanced lifespans and physical attributes, along with a nigh-infinite source of power. For whatever reason- perhaps because you were able to reunite them with Atlantis, or even because you found a way for them to return to the surface world- these Atlantean colonists see you as a hero and leader, honoring you with a position akin to royalty. Although the lack real technological knowledge, and have in fact lost much of their vehicles, it’s possible that you can help them on that front, too. Their Crystal will grow in strength as their civilization expands, and in time you may rediscover the secret to creating the crystals so commonly worn around Atlantean necks."
1509,,600,Crafty Cottage,Brave,Domain,"You’ve come into the possession of this small cottage.

It has been enchanted so that two spaces exist inside. The space that can be accessed via the door can be changed when you, or someone with your permission, snaps their fingers (or claps) while meaning to change the space. Those inside the inactive space can still leave through the front door as usual, but if they were to immediately enter through the door they would find themselves in the active space. All in all, a useful trick to keep parts of your life hidden, or to simply make efficient use of the room available to you.

In future worlds, you may choose for your cottage to be attached to your Warehouse, or to be placed somewhere appropriate, close to your starting location.

Should the cottage be destroyed, a replacement will appear in the same location after 24 hours. If it was placed out in the world, and that location is no longer viable, it will instead become attached to your Warehouse."
1510,,600,Chosen,Moana,Domain,"One of the forces of nature has chosen you and will answer your call, as long as you are in a place it can reach. The ocean will protect you from drowning and part at your request. The storm will ravage and rage where you ask. The wind will blow as you ask. The sun will blaze or temper its brilliance at your whim. As you grow more confident, as long as you are respectful, the range and power of what you can command will likewise increase, though you’ll only ever have pull with your chosen force. Furthermore, thanks to your chosen status, your will is indomitable, as you have come to learn that there is little you cannot accomplish if you put your mind to it."
1511,,600,The Den of Darkness,Disney Villains Victorious,Domain,"A proper villain doesn’t scheme from a dusty storehouse or the back of a cheap hovel - If you want to be taken seriously, you need a sanctum that demands respect! A proper keep, fort, or similarly imposing structure has been provided to you, with all the atmosphere you’d expect from a lair of evil and a number of guards provided free of charge! Similarly to “Hakuna Matata”, it’d take a determined pursuer to find this place and a rather skilled one to breach its walls."
1512,,600,Forgotten Citadel,Aladdin,Domain,"There are many lost and ancient ruins in these lands. You just so happened to find one. This hidden Citadel is a bit run down, but nothing some hard work wouldn’t fix. But the real beauty of this place is the fact that it contains a library and apothecary containing everything a sorcerer of this world would need. The items will refill, if used, at the beginning of each jump. You can import an existing property for this if desired and place it in future worlds."
1513,,600,Black Market,Aladdin,Domain,"Stealing is all fine and dandy, but having a place to sell your loot is just as important. You now run an underground black market. In this case it is quite literally underground in some long forgotten ruins. Don’t expect best items to come through, but you would be surprised what can be found if you look hard enough. Two great advantages of this place are that everyone knows you are in charge with “rent” being paid by the merchants and they know that this is a “peace zone” with fighting strictly forbidden. So you can walk the streets without worry of being shanked. But outside of the black market is fair game. This place will follow you to new worlds with the wares being updated to whatever one could expect to find in such places. A special merchant will specialize in items of past worlds."
1514,,600,The Vanishing Isle,Aladdin,Domain,"Well, it isn’t the true Vanishing Isle, but a smaller cousin to the other. This giant sea turtle swims without a care in the world. Although it does have a small city on its back, the place is unoccupied for now. You may also import a previously owned city or island to bind it to the turtle, thus populating this place. The turtle travels where it wishes, but will not dive under if there are people on its back. The Vanishing Isle will appear swimming in the oceans of future worlds."
1515,,600,Fisher King,Aladdin,Domain,"It is said that a king and his land are one, but most are just people ruling over the land. With this you may select to become a fisher-king. Feared and loved. You will become connected to any land or property you own and they will become reflections of you. If you like you can be linked emotionally. With weather changing just as fast as your mood it is advised that you learn to control any serious emotional outbursts as it could lead to massive destruction. With the emotion link, the land and weather will change too fast for the people to adapt and can lead to disaster. Tornadoes and volcanoes are not uncommon sights when you anger. Likewise, bountiful harvests and all the plants bursting with life is common when you are happy."
1516,,600,Diamond In The Rough,Aladdin,Domain,"Just like Aladdin, you are more than you seem. He was able to enter the Cave of Wonders, a place forbidden to all but one. You have now gained a similar power. You bypass magical restrictions for entrance or item use. As long as you can reach a place, you can enter it. You still need to open the Cave of Wonders if you want in, but after that the sand panther will let you just strole in. use any item linked to good or evil to your heart’s content. Hell, You can even ride a unicorn."
1517,,600,Forsaken Castle,Bloodborne: Covenants,Domain,"Situated in a cold region, lies this monstrously massive castle. How lucky you are, to call such a storied structure your new home. In addition to its aesthetics being entirely up to you, it offers potent protections, as well as a general layout that can easily be used to help defend in the event of a siege or invasion. This is helped by the swirling storm that hides the castle from all that aren’t explicitly invited or loyal to you. It will be guarded by a retinue of combatants on par with the Healing Church’s hunters, all of whom have pledged their undying loyalty to you."
1518,,600,Hunter's Dream,Bloodborne: Covenants,Domain,"In a city as consumed by madness as Yharnam, it is only fitting that the only truly safe place can be found in a dream. You are now the owner of a copy of the Hunter’s Dream, a place you can travel to through various lanterns you’ll encounter along your journey. It has everything one could need on this longest night, such as a weapon workbench, an altar to engrave Caryll Runes into one’s mind, ritual altars, as well as Bath Messengers you can trade supplies and materials with. Only you and your Companions can access this safe haven, where the moon watches over all."
1519,,600,Dream Walker,Bloodborne: Covenants,Domain,"Dreams and nightmares may seem inconsequential, but through the power of the Great Ones, they have become all too real, becoming actual places that one can visit, provided that they meet certain conditions. You are different, though, capable of entering and traversing through dreams and connected dimensions with minimal effort. Even those being blocked or protected can be entered with just a bit of effort on your part. What you do in these dreams, though, only you can say.

Boosted: You have elevated your thoughts closer to the Great Ones, still not on their level but granting you great power. The blood flowing through you allows you to create dreams of your own, pocket dimensions designed to your specifications. You can even place down certain points that people can use to teleport to and from your dream, should you allow them. 

Boost Requires Blood of the Great Ones to Activate"
1520,,600,Spirit Tree Sapling,Avatar: The Legend Of Korra,Domain,"It may not look like anything special, but this small unassuming plant it is actually brimming with spiritual energy and possess many interesting supernatural qualities. The tree can slightly move in response to danger and certain spirits may be attracted to it if they’re nearby. Additionally some individuals with spirit or nature based abilities will be able to sense and see things through the tree’s roots, and any vines harvested from this plant will contain powerful spirit energy that can be harnessed to power mechanical devices. If you plant the sapling somewhere it can prosper then it’ll eventually grow to a towering size and create a city sized forest spirit flora around it. However it would take decades for the tree to reach it’s adult height and at least several centuries for a full forest to develop."
1521,,600,Château de Tiffauges,Symphogear,Domain,"This floating castle is a megastructure composed of multiple Relics. It has all the research facilities an alchemist could want, including all the resources to build Autoscorers and Homunculi, minus the necessary memories. It’s also a World Destroyer that could disintegrate the entire planet and store it as data. That is if you had some leylines to work with. And four cursed songs. And a power source. And a frontend interface. At least the castle’s pretty resilient, able to remain somewhat functional even if the disintegration system overloads and you shoot it with a giant laser."
1522,,600,Norn Stone,Marvel Magic,Domain,"The Norn Stones are a collection of mystical artifacts primarily employed by the Asgardians sorcerers Loki and Karnilla, the Norn Queen. The various stones grant a number of different powers, each potent in some way. The one that you have gained is particularly suited for one such as you. This Stone allows the holder to easily pass unnoticed between different realms and realities, slipping even past barriers that would normally prevent such passage and not triggering any alarms. Any dimension or world known of can be easily accessed, though this will not allow passage between different jumps until your chain is finished."
1523,,600,Star Forge,Marvel Magic,Domain,"Great Mjolnir, the hammer of Thor, was forged using the heart of a dying star, cut from the place it hanged in space by Allfather Odin himself and placed within an enchanted forge. This forge and the mold for Mjolnir was stolen and used by Loki to make a legion of brother hammers to Mjolnir during the final Ragnarok. This mould and the lesser hammers were -- or perhaps will be -- destroyed by Thor and channeled into an attack. But now you have come into possession of something similar. This forge, which takes the form of a special room connected to your warehouse, contains within it the heart of a dying star. This is, of course, a powerful tool, but most beings would be unable to use it directly without suffering near instant death. You are not most beings and I have the utmost confidence that you will think of something."
1524,,600,God of Thunder,Dial,Domain,"Wield the might of Thor and become a God of Thunder. With this power you can wield the immense might of lightning and storms. By tapping into the elemental forces of the universe, you can summon bolts of lightning at will. With a simple gesture or a mighty swing of your weapon, you channel the raw power of thunder, directing it towards your enemies with devastating effect. The crackling energy courses through your body, empowering you and granting you heightened physical abilities. You command the forces of nature, creating thunderstorms that rumble across the sky and rain down chaos upon your foes. Your connection to the storm allows you to manipulate lightning with precision, striking your targets with bolts of electrifying power. Your enemies tremble in fear as they witness your godlike command over the elemental forces, making you an unstoppable force to be reckoned with."
1525,,600,Citadel At The End Of Time ,Loki,Domain,"It seems you have your home-away-from-everything. Located on an asteroid in the end of time and carved in situ from the black stone with gold vein embellishments, from here it is possible to see the Sacred Timeline pulsating as a tangible force in a vast circle around it. You can choose whether yours is in partial ruins like the residence of He Who Remains or is more intact. In this location, it is impossible to perform actions that would create branches, such as the ones detected by the Time Variance Authority, nor does anything here age. You’ll find it quite a secure location too, as it’s impossible to get to this Citadel using means such as a TemPad due to lack of anything for it to lock onto. Along with other features you might have already seen, this one includes a vast display room where you can keep any artefacts you acquire, as well as something akin to a holographic security system that can be used to recreate a selection of the greatest warriors from across the timeline to defend you from any intruders. Just be aware that the latter has limits, as the main defence of this facility is its nigh-unreachable location. In future Jumps, you can choose to have your Citadel appear in a similarly secure location outside of conventional time and space or placed somewhere a little easier to access."
1526,,600,Eden,Marvel Primal,Domain,"Your very own paradise! Teeming with life, some preserved from the time of Dinosaurs. You may design whatever fine details you like, and whether it is open or concealed from the world."
1527,,600,Gate Above & Below ,Marvel Primal,Domain,You know of a hidden cave which can lead to the celestial and infernal realms. In future Jumps it will have connections to any afterlife or associate dimension.
1528,,600,Quarry of Creation ,Marvel Primal,Domain,"The graveyard of gods, full of the most fertile soil imaginable that could terraform a world with a few pounds of dirt. Trials may be taken here to gain divine or superpowers. If you can dig deeply enough, and overcome its Celestial guardians, you will find the First Firmament, source of Infinity Stones."
1529,,600,Hell Dimension,X-Men the Claremont Years,Domain,"Your own copy of Limbo. This hell dimension has a rather unique relationship with time existing outside of the common flow of time, and where the rules of reality are much more notably looser. Your magical powers are boosted here and the world itself recognizes you as its master like the original Limbo recognizes Bellasco and would eventually recognize Illyana. A home to many varied and vicious demons, most of the demons will obey you, but the more ambitious and powerful might get other ideas especially if you do not seem to be paying attention to the dimension.

Possession of this realm allows you to summon mystical armor formed of promethium about your body when within it, or - if you also have the Limbo Sorcery perk - when wielding your soulsword."
1530,,600,Abbey,Marvel Midnight Suns,Domain,"You are the heir and owner of the Abbey, its extensive grounds and the pocket dimension it rests inside. It acts as a teleportation nexus; Babs will always be in the Forge and the Mirror Table can read any place not protected against observance among other things. Once per jump and every decade you can choose to move it like Lilith and Sara did from Tansia to Salem."
1531,,600,Holy Ground,Moon Knight,Domain,"A perfect copy of the Great Pyramid. But it is not just one of the most wonderous works in the World, inside is a Chamber meant for you and any you deem worthy. You can assemble and allow entrance to this Place to anyone no matter where they are in the Jump you are in, if you let them in they will quickly find a way inside. While in this Pyramid, any Rituals you perform will be more potent, this place practically brimming with power of the ancient."
1532,,600,Weather Manipulation        ,Marvel Civil War,Domain,"You have the ability to raise or lower temperature levels, direct air currents as hurricane-force winds, create a pressure dome that can deflect attacks, maneuver yourself through the sky, excite electron particles to call down lightning bolts, fire electrical blasts from your fingertips, and summon clouds as fog cover or in order to bring forth precipitation such as rain, snow, sleet, and hail. You can also alter your body temperature to compensate for weather conditions."
1533,,600,Gamma Reactor,Heroes Reborn,Domain,"This one doesn’t contain the rift in reality, but it doesn’t mean it’s without power. First off it’s a functional gamma reactor, able to power an entire city, or a high tech base, seemingly indefinitely. Secondly, with a bit of sorcery, you can shape beings from the memories of yourself or another creature out of its energy, pulling them forth and manifesting them as real. These beings will be 2nd rate copies at best, and require more time and energy for the closer to the originals you want them to be, but you could pull supervillains from it time and time again as long as it had energy and you had a clear memory of them. Finally, while it does not work as a portal between Earth-616 and Franklin’s created world, it does serve as a place where the boundaries of reality are weakened, and it is easier to travel between them."
1534,,600,C.E.O. Of Hell,Helltaker,Domain,"You now own Hell. In-jump it means Lucifer respects your opinion and considers you an equal but post-jump it allows you to bring this version of Hell to other jumps. Ownership of Hell gives you basically infinite Bone Demons (but they can’t leave Hell), and allows you to throw in here anyone you see die; whether to torture them or to keep their soul nice and comfy depends on you. It’s also a great place to be, as you have practically unlimited space and demonic freemasons to build whatever you want as long as it’s made of the materials available in hell and you supply the blueprints. Also, anyone who tries to enter it without your permission will be either pushed back or trapped permanently in an impossible puzzle until you allow them to leave."
1535,,600,This is my Home,Dr Strange Multiverse of Madness,Domain,"This is your original reality and the universe you lived in. There do not appear to be many inhabitants in this world, but the area is incredibly large and houses many unique features such as floating mountains and other special areas. You will be able to freely travel to this area whenever you are. The area will remain hidden from anyone else and can not be located. Even beings capable of multiversal travel will be incapable of locating this universe no matter how far they look."
1536,,600,Multiversal Travel,Dr Strange Multiverse of Madness,Domain,"This is the power that everyone is after, the ability to freely the multiverse. This gives you the power to create star shaped portals to other universes. You also can use this energy to enhance yourself. For example when America channeled the energy she was capable of matching Scarlet Witch temporarily and injured her. This energy can also be used as a powerful attack capable of cutting through space. There are few beings capable of surviving a blow like this. Lastly you will start out with proficient control over your abilities. You will be capable of opening and closing the portals at will to your targets. The power will be limited to your local multiverse however until you acquire your spark. At this point you will gain the ability to travel anywhere in the Omniverse."
1537,,600,Space Gem,Marvel Cosmic,Domain,"Now to the last of the Infinity Stones/Gems. The Space Gem gives its wielder the ability to manipulate space as they see fit. Teleport anywhere they desire, go as fast as they wish, manipulate gravity, and even create black holes. The stone can even manipulate the distances between objects and other normally physically impossible things. The feedback circuit sees it empowered by the Power Stone and it further empowers the Time Stone. Is usually blue or purple."
1538,,600,Norn Stones,Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Domain,"The Norn Stones are powerful Asgardian artifacts, each one connected to one of the nine Realms, capable of facilitating travel between different planes of existence and parallel dimensions by opening portals. You have a full set of nine; one for each of the Realms, and while your set doesn’t have any other abilities they are able to be used more freely (and the Musphelheim stone can be used without breaking the seal keeping Surtur trapped). You get a new set whenever you go to a Jump with different planes of existence/parallel dimensions; a stone for each one. While the older stones can’t be used outside "
1539,,600,Teleportation,Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Domain,"You can teleport; the longer the distance, the longer it takes to teleport. Short distances give you Nightcrawler style teleportation, where you can teleport multiple times within a few seconds; longer distances vary based on the distance traveled. You need to know where you’re teleporting, requiring either having been there, having exact coordinates and an idea of its general direction, or being in your line of sight. You can’t telefrag."
1540,,600,Ancestral Fortress,Fate/Zero,Domain,"Your very own magical fortress. It might look like some luxurious palace, and it is indeed that, but make no mistakes. Nothing short of the Clocktower Queen and her personal legion would be able to penetrate this bastion of magical protection. The castle itself is already one of the largest and sturdiest in the world, with hundreds of rooms and vast grounds surrounding it but the magical protections far surpass what it offers on a physical level. Immense wards surround it in every direction for several kilometres, strong enough to prevent even expert mage hunters with great skill in taking down wards from getting in, even with years of effort. Large numbers of advanced combat familiars and homunculi prowl the grounds and the castle itself, each easily lethal enough to butcher a squad of elite soldiers, though those with magic may fare better. The castle itself is reinforced with many powerful magical effects, chief among them being reinforcement applied to every stone of the castle to make it easily able to hold up to even strong magical assaults. At the centre of it all is a fully aware and totally loyal artificial intelligence, bound in the form of a humanoid golem that will manage and direct any and all defences and affairs within the castle for you. This can be imported into."
1541,,600,Ability Wings ,Toaruverse,Domain,"Wings made of an Espers ability are a common usage for level five’s along with helping them use their abilities a lot better and faster. You gain the ability to form wings based on and related to your Esper ability where it automatically calculates the needed process and steps to use the ability for you and makes it instinctive and easy for you to use. Its effect on other abilities are removing their limitations no matter how hardcoded it is like making you capable of using spells and magic that normally needed incantations and imaging instantly as it does all the incantation and imaging for you along making any magic system that you use from rigid and inflexible to smooth, flexible and easy to use. Another is the wings automatically block attacks no matter how fast it is and is as durable as steel which can be increased with no upper-limit as you gain more control and experience using your ability. The wings can also be used for flight with the flying speed of one hundred meters per second and you gain a scaling reaction time and thought of process to fully utilize your flying speed and with experience and training the flying speed can be increased with no upper-limit. Even as a level one you can form these wings and maintain it for a long time without problem."
1542,,600,Globe’s Void,Ragna Crimson,Domain,"A hidden base similar to the one created by Crimson, it is a complex of interconnected pocket dimensions created with space magic. The pocket dimensions can be accessed by entering a central hub and teleporting from there. Each pocket dimension is distributed to be close to different points of the globe, having a physical exit in basically any major location of the planet, as well as having a larger base on the Moon. These pocket dimensions are now empty and range vastly in size, ones being small store rooms, while others being large warehouses with several rooms. In your future jumps, these pocket dimensions will similarly be distributed through the planet, with one of them being at least in the planet’s moon if such a satellite exists. Much like the previous item, the central hub can be accessed via any door using a special key imbued with space magic."
1543,,600,Barrier Master,Ragna Crimson,Domain,"An incredibly powerful and versatile magic, it allows for the construction and control of ‘barriers’. These barriers aren’t merely ‘shields’ that protect you from enemy attacks, they can also be deployed in any space you want for a myriad of effects to apply over the beings trapped in them. A barrier that periodically ‘erases’ a certain amount of people from the world. A barrier that stops the movement from those inside of it. Those are just some of its uses, and perhaps with time you may even discover more.

Not only that, but the Barrier Magic also allows for dominion over space, allowing you to teleport and create your personal dimensions by putting barriers around the ‘space’. It allows you to detect space anomalies such as other pocket dimensions and breaching through others’ barriers, including the ones that shield such pocket dimensions."
1544,,600,Quantum Transition Energy,Trinity Wonder ,Domain,"The portals between worlds developed by Sylvia’s father utilised quantum transition energy to make a passage between worlds. So why should you not be able to use mana or ki to do the same? By releasing large amounts of energy into the atmosphere and spinning it in a certain pattern, you would be able to stir the quantum energy of the world and create your own personal wormhole to another world. The size of this wormhole can, and often will, vary according to the amount of energy you feed it. Naturally, larger portals require not only more energy to produce, but also more energy to keep open. Different worlds resonate differently, so changing which world you are travelling to is simple. Similarly, once you have the coordinates of a world, it is easy to establish wormholes connected to that world. As a package deal with this, you are rather good at remembering world ‘coordinates’ so that you don’t keep losing yourself in the multiverse."
1545,,600,Bandlewood Seed,Arcane,Domain,"Long before the Yordles called Bandle City home, there was only a tree. No one knows why, or when, but it grew to fill the space behind reality, unfurling its branches into the Spirit Realm until it had no clear beginning or end—it only was, and had always been. Its fae magic reached into Runeterra through swirling portals, and in time the Yordles came to call it home, building Bandle City amidst its branches and venturing out to learn more about the world beyond the great Bandlewood Tree.
 
Somehow, you’ve discovered a seed of the Bandlewood. Within this jump, the seed won’t grow, but it will give off a soft glow which intensifies the closer you come to one of the portals to Bandle City. Once you find such a portal, it’ll ensure you can get through, and its aura will assure the inhabitants of Bandle City won’t be hostile to you unless you give them good reason to be - though they might play a prank or two!

After this jump, however, the seed will be ready to sprout. If planted, it’ll grow quickly into a beautiful, gnarled tree, but if you pass down under the roots, you’ll enter a similar spirit-realm to that of the Runeterran Bandlewood Tree, growing larger with time as the tree grows. With time, its roots and branches will stretch out, creating new portals across the world, and even into other realms of existence (if they exist in that setting). By traveling to the Bandlewood’s heart you’ll be able to control roughly where these portals open, to a degree of precision within about a city’s size, and will be able to lock them, set conditions to open them, or close them permanently if you see fit, as well as channel the tree’s great spiritual energy.

And finally, when you move onto a new world, your tree will give you another seed to carry with you in turn."
1546,,600,Castle ,A Throne of Glass,Domain,"You now own a massive fortress, great enough to be the seat of power of a continent spanning empire. You can have this castle be formed of any normal material from glass, to stone, to great trees, regardless it is equally as durable. This castle is made of strong fortifications, has innate protections to protect it from long range magic, naturally replenishing supplies, and will be garrisoned by enough NPC followers to ensure that it’s grounds and walls are both protected and taken care of, you may chose the races of these followers upon purchas; Demi-Fae, Fae, or Human. You will find the defenses and followers of this castle upgrade in each new jump you import it into, to the peak defenses & staff you could find in the residence of a head of state. If not imported this castle and its staff can be a warehouse attachment."
1547,,600,Oakenwald Forest,A Throne of Glass,Domain,"This is a copy of the Oakenwald Forest, as it was in its prime, that may be attached to your warehouse or imported into new jumps. This is an ancient, magical and wild forest, inhabit by not just normal and magical animals but Faeries, the Little Folk. They are a magic folk that possess magic and are vindictive when offended. They think kindly of children, and will protect them if a child is lost in the forest. Unlike the normal Oakenwald Forest ruled by the King of the Forest a powerful Dryad in the form of a stag with a crown of flames, you are considered the King of this Forest. As the King the Faeries within will obey you, and generally be helpful, they will also support any of your descendants they may come across. Should you decide to import this forest it is so large as to fill 1/3 of a continent the size of North America."
1548,,600,Torre Cesme,A Throne of Glass,Domain,"The Torre is a massive building, and house of healing in the capital of the Khaganate, Antica. You now possess your own copy of the Torre that you may keep as a warehouse attachment or import into new jumps. When imported into new jump the medical knowledge and tools of the Torre upgrades to be cutting edge, and retains upgrades. The Torre is a 12-story cylindrical tower that is wide enough to be called a keep. At its base just below the ground is its library, the greatest repository of healing knowledge found in this world, below that is the network of tunnels called Silba’s Womb that contain a section of naturally heated pools perfect for a good soak. If you navigate your way to the deepest point, you would find yourself in an Ancient Fae treasury full of weapons, gold, and artefacts that would have a value that would stagger the Khagan himself."
1549,,600,Three Towers of Wyrdstone,A Throne of Glass,Domain,"You now own three massive Wyrdstone clocktowers, that may be imported whenever you wish into a setting or left as a warehouse attachment. These towers act as anchors and magnifiers of enchantments, allowing spells to effect massively increased areas at no extra cost. If you were to place these towers at 3 different points that blocked off the majority of a continent, they would be able to affect a spell that would affect the entire content, even beyond the strict triangle laid out between them. Should you place them far enough they would even allow a spell to affect the whole world. These are like the towers that the King of Adarlan used to raise a null-magic field over the entire continent and stop magic in its tracks. While these towers are far stronger than granite, they are still destructible, and should even one be destroyed any spells they radiate disappear. When connecting spells between these pillars you must be capable of casting the spell in some way for the pillars to broadcast it. These towers come innately imbued with a spell to turn off magic, but may have further spells attached should you wish.

1550,,600,Tropical Island & Port City ,A Throne of Glass,Domain,"You are now the proud leader of a tropical island and port city, the city sitting on the edges of a beautiful bay full of many wonderfully tasty and abundant sea creatures. This island can be kept as a warehouse attachment, which includes the sea up to a mile out from the island, and can be imported into future jumps. The city can survive independently based on solely on the food they grow on the fertile land of the island, along with the bounty of the sea. However should you import the island you will find that it either quickly becomes a hub for sea trade or piracy, which direction it goes is completely at your discretion as the leader. This island upgrades to meet the standards of an average trading port of the setting every time it is imported, and maintains all upgrades going forwards"

This whole manor screams subtle wealth, and high-class taste. More than that however this manor is protected by a great yet ornate fence and a series of traps that would catch unwanted visitors. This house can be a warehouse attachment or imported into future jumps. Whenever it is imported, the manor is upgraded to the very peak of luxury and non-military defensive measures that exist in the setting, and maintains all upgrades going forward."
1552,,600,I Walk In Eternity,Ben 10,Domain,"Let me guess, you fell into a time portal stabilized by a ring of quartz crystal? Or maybe you’re just especially obsessed with the time-space continuum? Regardless, you have gained an in-depth understanding of time and space, so much so that you can manipulate it at will. Your body no longer ages, frozen in your prime (or an age of your choosing). You can stop, slow down, or speed up time relative to yourself as an act of will, as well as travel back and forth in time itself by simply walking out of sight of others to take a ‘shortcut’ up and down the timestream. You can also transport and change the age of people and objects with you, should you wish to.

You’re completely insulated from changes to history, always remembering what the original version of a timeline and still existing even if circumstances leading to your ‘enlightenment’ or even your birth were prevented by an act of time travel. Keep in mind, some events are key to the flow of history and risk unforeseen consequences if you meddle with them, though you can thankfully recognize these important events on instinct alone and know how to set things right if something else meddled with them, as well as how to avoid paradoxes in general."

So try not to go insane or your land may take on your more chaotic designs. No matter where you are you know exactly where any beings of human intelligence or above are in your realm and how many. As the land is a reflection of yourself you may teleport anywhere in your realm after a short ritual taking about five minutes, also at any crossing within your land be it a bridge, a river, or a wall you may issue either a sign or a person asking up to five questions answering the questions right allows safe passage answering wrong brings an ill effect of your choosing. You can change these mentally. Finally you can slowly mold the land to be shaped to your liking. Which would be quite useful in making natural defenses against enemies or simply making everything look nice."

It has ancient books on just about every subject under the sun, even books that delve into creatures of the night and magic. In all future worlds, this library updates with extensive information about all of the world’s supernatural creatures, their types and varieties, strengths and weaknesses, and all that. It even acquires specific weaknesses any such creatures may have, and explains them in lurid detail, enough to turn even random peasants into capable hunters."

Aligned with your powers and nature, it obeys your will on a magical, cosmic level. But it’s not just territory. You also get a fortress-palace like Arctis Tor complete with the protections and luxuries of it, more mortal wealth than you can reasonably ever spend, cities and palaces and castles. All around a theme you get to choose. Are you a demonic warlord, a fey prince, a god, something else entirely… all up to you. Whatever you choose, you get all the infrastructure of a gigantic Nevernever kingdom oriented around that choice, but none of the people."

Not only do you find it easy to navigate its treacherous and chaotic terrain, you're also damn good at figuring out what a place's resonance is, which lets you figure out where it might connect to. You can also use this trick to identify any latent Genius Loci you might come across, and your talents also make it far more likely you'll manage to pull off the difficult Sanctum Invocation needed to tie you to one."

It’s a very large, snow-capped mountain near your starting location that you have special powers on. When on the mountain, you’ll be able to exert control over the weather around the mountain, summoning up blizzards or causing huge amounts of ice to form where you will. The mountain even has a rather fancy ice palace pre-made at the top. If you happen to have element or weather based powers, being here will greatly increase their scale and power."

Known advantages, albeit not very significant ones. You however, are able to command fire’s hold on reality in a way none other can. On purchase, when resting near a bonfire, time and space bends around you and others resting at it offering a variety of benefits at your discretion. It is as if you and the others sit inside a dimension with the fire as its origin and you with minor control, untouched by the outside world. With you in control, wounds heal at a far accelerated pace, equipment mends itself before your eyes as if returning to how it once was, you are able to think many times faster or accelerate time to pass the days or nights away in seconds. Needless to say, you can tend to your Bonfire and related abilities while inside this bubble. On the flipside however, you also cannot interact with the outside world until you get up from your fire’s side. A sufficiently sized campfire can replace the role of a bonfire if need be, transforming to take on one’s qualities as long as you sit beside it and excise the power of this perk."
1559,,600,“Invasion”,Dark Souls 1,Domain,"Space and time are strange and convoluted in these lands. Travel between parallel worlds by willing and unwilling inhabitants isn’t rare, but it is notable. This perk allows for you to move through dimensions to arrive in parallel worlds nigh identical in nature much of the time. Your body in these parallel worlds is a proxy, not holding the full extent of your vitality, but definitely holding the full extent of your power. If you die in these alternate worlds, no big deal, it wasn’t your body anyways. However, if you were to kill an alternate version of someone existing within your world, such events would likely mirror back on yours, only no one can trace them dropping dead back to you. Convenient, right? The perk continues to work at full capacity in later worlds as well, allowing you to visit parallel realities of the one you exist in to torment or slay enemies, or otherwise run amok before leaving."

They’re real as anything else, just existing in another space, oft created only in a concrete state by otherworldly and powerful beings. Not one of them, but yet you have such a power too. 

You have the ability to create your own dream, making a distorted land in another dimension resembling a location you’ve visited previously; nestling it amid steep cliffs and a sea of clouds. You may freely travel to this place, and back from where you entered it, dragging others along if you have time. 

You may only sustain one dream at a time, but can expand it with up to two additional areas past the first. You may also further twist and distort it in impossible ways; a midnight coastline placed over a sunny city district, with those who swim too deep in the ocean above falling from the sunny sky below.”

Boosted: Bloodborne + Sweet Dreams: “With the combination of Bloodborne and Sweet Dreams, your dream may become a nightmare. You may populate the areas of your created dreams with threats based on entities that existed within those visited areas. Men may act like beasts, beasts may be warped into monsters, and the dead may yet rise. 

These are simply phantasms of consciousness and not the genuine article. They will not attack you, but will otherwise act aggressively towards those around them. You may also erode the barrier between realities for a moment, exposing those near you to visions of your constructed nightmare juxtaposed over the waking world. An enemy from your nightmare may be summoned in this way, one at a time.”

1561,,600,Dream Walker,Bloodborne,Domain,"“You were pulled into the Hunter’s Dream, and then sent out to end the Nightmare consuming Yharnam, but it won’t be that easy. You will be forced to travel to lands beyond the material plane, through abstract and dangerous means. . .or possibly not. 

Ordinarily, you would need to rely on higher beings or specific circumstances in order to gain entry to a given dream, or nightmare, or some other otherworldly plane of reality. All this really requires is the acquisition of a sort of key, which you tend to be able to recognize on sight.

If you can find an object displaced from the original dream or nightmare it’s native too, or the body of someone whose mind is trapped within that dream or nightmare, you can then send yourself to that place. Think of it as just needing to establish a connection, and then landing on the shore of that place. 

You also obtain the power to manifest special lanterns housing blue flames, having the Messengers drag such constructs out of the ground in front of you. By having at least two active at a time, you can stand by one, and focus on the other, transporting between the two as if falling asleep and waking up. 

These lanterns can be placed freely in the waking world and dreaming lands alike, as many as you like, though only one can be grown in any general area at a time. Navigation is now no issue for you.” 

Boosted: Bloodborne + Dream Walker: “Your blood now acts as a psychic conduit for the cosmos, causing those splashed with it to become lightning rods for eldritch knowledge they can't hope to process or understand, essentially causing Frenzy build up. The more someone else is soaked with your blood, the more information pushed into their brain. 

They can recover and safely dump the knowledge if given time, but too much at once is similar to too much air in a balloon, and can cause incredible amounts of brain damage. If desired, you may toggle this ability off and on.

Although mysterious how you learned this, despite not being among those lost ranks of the old hunters, you are privy to the Art of Quickening. This skill, this talent, allows you to move in bursts of remarkable speed, such that untrained eyed swore you disappeared and reappeared.

It’s linear, taxing at first, and relatively short range; so why is it so effective? It is one of many truths, that understanding does not create opportunity. As such, most will be unable to contest the blade they do not see, even if they know where it will be.”

Boosted: Bloodborne + The Art of Quickening: “Allows you to apply ""Quickening"" to your blood, allowing you to accelerate a bullet in mid air, or slice enemies with blood you’ve applied to an edged weapon, as just a pair of examples. Swipes you take with blood covered weapons also leave trails of blood behind that hang in the air for a few seconds. 

Additionally, you may ignite your blood as if it was accelerant, setting both it and anything it's currently in contact with up in flames at will.

1564,,600,The Sunken Ruins,MtG - Ixalan,Domain,"A city that once stood proud with Azor’s visit still lingering in living memory, it was known for having talented and wise mages who specialized in mimicking the Lawbringer’s arts and gained insight and magical energy by tapping into the land’s natural power - directly sapping its power to permanently enhance their youth, health, and knowledge. However, the people of this city had pushed this for too long, learning a method of sapping a land past its limit - blighting it into a wasteland, but gaining a phenomenal bit of power in the bargain. This had already incensed the River Heralds, but upon learning that they planned to drain the Immortal Sun and Orazca of its energy - the city was assaulted on all sides by powerful storm and tsunami elementals summoned up by the River Heralds in anger, destroying them overnight as the River Heralds converged as one. The city still retains these secrets deep within, as well as a phenomenal wealth of enchanted treasures and simply normal mind-boggling wealth - easily retrieved by those capable of navigating the waters and willing to search through the ruins manually."
1565,,600,Winged Temple of the Golden City,MtG - Ixalan,Domain,"A towering temple, the climb is quite difficult for most due to the howling winds often threatening to fling a weak individual from its steps, but those who scale it will learn why - the Temple has a powerful storm-generating device within, which, if fueled with mana tapped from the world, will enshroud whoever bonds with the temple in a powerful “Storm armor”, allowing them to fly and granting their strikes the might of a hurricane - with this armor starting at just large enough to cover them, to becoming large enough to strangle a King Tyrant lizard with a single hand and the match to do so with the simplicty of snapping a twig. Though the storm armor grows smaller and weaker over time, at its largest size it would last an entire day as the enchanted winds die down..though by that time, you would have surely conquered whatever stood in your way, right?"
1566,,600,Vault of Catlacan ,MtG - Ixalan,Domain,"A Vault meant to store gold used for the operation of the Gold-Forge Garrison, it has a number of automatic defenses utilizing spellfire and lightning.

However, its greatest feature beyond sturdy walls and defenses is the capability of “drawing” mana from the gold and treasures within, creating a blue pool of mana in the center of the vault that grows deeper and brighter the more and more gold, jewels, and other fine arts are kept here: turning the pretty baubles into potential magic engines. Perhaps this gold is best kept in the vault after all..."
1567,,600,Temple of Aclazotz,MtG - Ixalan,Domain,"The temple of the Bat God of Ixalan, a predatory and cannibalistic god of the night...and the source of the secrets of the Dusk Legion. This temple has, inscribed in its walls, the various secrets of Aclazotz’s priests, which if studied in great detail, would allow someone to learn the magical arts behind “Glorifier” and “Condemner”...though, these arts are weak and difficult to use for those not already undead or otherwise skilled in necromantic and bloody rituals. Finally, the land’s blessing of a dark night god allows for villainous and bloody magics to be empowered by the mana drawn from its “hallowed ground”...a useful for one who works with shadow, similar to that of a swamp."
1568,,600,Cradle of the Sun ,MtG - Ixalan,Domain,"A paradisical valley filled with dinosaurs surrounding a central elder tree, this place is a treasured place forthe shamans and druids of this land, as its very essence is infused with powerful amounts of invigorating and life-encouraging mana that allows for great fertility and growth - the same associated with forests. In fact, one could perform a rite at the elder tree to draw mana from the creatures within this valley, the mana coalescing and becoming tangible within the elder tree - creating many times that more magical power concentrated within it, waiting to be tapped into."
1569,,600,Cave of Eternity,MtG - Ixalan,Domain,"A mysterious cave, said to be where the leylines of life converge, and where the transmigration of souls is at its most potent. Those who are diseased, wounded, of old age, or otherwise unhealthy and closer to death are the only ones capable of entering the cavern. Those who do, however, will find themselves a miraculous transformation - the old, sick, maimed, and wounded will be given a new body, transformed into a young and healthy form. However, those who use this more than once will be attacked by the reanimated bodies of those who had come before - potentially even their own body reanimated - and those killed by the revived forms will remain dead. You know the place where this cavern awaits, and you are gifted a stone from the Cave of Eternity as well as some bones...Placing these in any cavern will transform it into a new Cave of Eternity, though the nature of the Cave will still reject those who do not live on the edge of life. For those already undead, their new body will be living, and their former form rejected - a way to “cure” the vampires of Ixalan if one were to be dragged to this place. In addition, the land is suffused heavily with mana, and is extremely valuable in providing mana for many kinds of magecraft in this world. "
1570,,600,Sanctum of the Sun,MtG - Ixalan,Domain,"A chamber fit for a palace, this sanctuary is very similar to the one at the deepest parts of the city of Orazca. Some of Azor’s tools are replicated in this, perhaps it was a redundant workshop? In any case, if one were to work with the facilities here, they could use the amplifying artifacts here in combination with magical amplifiers, and broadcast an artifact’s effect to take root across the entire world (a planet at most)...though the artifact itself has to be rather powerful for this to be noticable, as even with amplifying abilities of the artifacts here, the power dilutes across a wide enough area. One could replicate the act of turning Ixalan into an entrapping plane, if one had an artifact comparable to the Immortal Sun. In addition, one could “reverse” the Sanctum’s might an tap into a monstrous amount of mana, drawing a small amount from across many locations in the world...though doing so directly into yourself could cause the sheer power to overwhelm a weaker mage’s body and soul."
1571,,600,Gold-Forge Garrison ,MtG - Ixalan,Domain,"A strange foundry from the time of Orazca’s construction, it has the facilities to use molten gold as a reagent to create powerful combat golems that serve their creator's commands. While not necessarily made to be a defensible location, the sheer existence of the golems in both their numbers and strength - enough to easily slay most intruders where they stand, other than the most fierce of dinosaurs...and with enough of the towering golems, even that is a simple matter. In addition, the forge of this Garrison grants twice the amount of mana that could normally be tapped into by this world’s mages. "
1572,,600,Planeswalker,MtG - Amonkhet,Domain,"You are one of those rare few blessed with a planeswalker’s spark, meaning you can, with a moment of concentration and an effort of will, move between planes of existence. It will also make you a talented and powerful mage of whatever sort attempt to learn, and provide a degree of resistance - not immunity, but resistance - to distortions of realities, dangerously alien dimensions, and plagues, mystical or otherwise. This is most emphatically not the same as an old walker’s spark, and will not allow you to travel beyond the local multiverse - you cannot exit the jump. go to other jumps with this spark, or travel to unrelated worlds, no matter how you upgrade it or yourself. Post-Chain, this restriction is loosened and it will allow you to travel to your jumps or your original home world, but not to unrelated worlds or jumps you never did. If you want to do either you’ll need an old walker’s spark, and this isn’t that."
1573,,600,Fabled Passage,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Domain,"They say the Wilds can act as a route to anywhere in Eldraine...what they scarcely know is that were it not for the Blind Eternities, such a place of wild magic could genuinely lead anywhere. This is a faerie gate, a portal in a strange yet tranquil pond that can act as a crossroads across the entire plane - while the route itself may not be direct, as you can expect this passage to send you the ‘scenic’ route, through this strange tree-like portal, you can explore not only Eldraine but eventually in other worlds any manner of world - the gate acting as a way to access the local multiverse of wherever you go, and as a strange subspace to wander the world aimlessly."
1574,,600,Roving Keep,MtG - Throne of Eldraine,Domain,"Castles are a constant symbol of the Realm and its mightiest creation, massive bastions against the wilds and havens of safety. While you are not in possession of a place quite like the legendary courtly castles, you have one that’s...unique. A massive stone keep with all the amenities, this castle also has the ability to move on its own - while somewhat lumbering, it can get up and walk, even potentially fighting off an invasion, with its size and might capable of beating down powerful dragons on its lonesome. The only thing to keep in mind is making sure you and your belongings are...secure before you decide to relocate."
1575,,600,Great Grove,MtG - Homelands,Domain,"The Great Wood grew and flowered due to the influences of the mana rift, and later the Ban laid by Feroz to become incredibly lush and fertile. Adding on top of that is that the amount of creatures and monsters within the wood kept most of the other survivors of the Great War clear of the forest, so the place was mostly left unmolested by outsiders. 

This particular section of the wood seems to have decided you are an exception to that though, as you are allowed to roam this great grove at your leisure. The bears, monstrous spiders, mammoths, and other monsters and animals of the forest won’t bother you and will even follow your directions, within reason. You’ll also be allowed to cut the lumber here, a privilege normally only granted to particularly favoured folks from An-Havva.

Moreover, this part of the woods is so thick with mana that the entire massive grove is made incredibly, magically healthy and fertile. Trees and plants here grow at a remarkable rate, to the point that you could grow a twelve foot pine tree in less than a year and the existing trees have become huge colossi. To say nothing of the wildlife. There also seems to be some sort of presence in the grove, as you can sometimes catch glimpses of a gossamer-clad beauty appearing in misty air to lead you away from danger or otherwise aid you."
1576,,600,Koskun Keep,MtG - Homelands,Domain,"The Koskun mountains are riddled with tunnels and family caves, but one site has become the center of goblin civilization. Behind heavy wooden doors and thick stone, the largest and strongest families used to rule the tunnel warrens of Koskun Keep. But generations ago, an immortal human instead took the throne and named himself king of the goblins.

Now it’s your turn to become goblin king, or at least the lord of your own keep. Regardless of whether you deposed Lord Eron and took Koskun Keep itself with all the murder and intrigue ruling that city implies, or if you just decided to expand another network of tunnels into a tributary or rival warren city, you’ve been put in charge of a sprawling subterran keep with about two dozen expansive families swearing their allegiance to you.

By default the labyrinthine tunnels of your keep are inhabited primarily by goblins and a smaller mix of rogues from all races, but if you prefer you can fill them with whatever race you choose to be in the races section instead. Either way, the keep almost magnetically attracts criminally minded elements and outcasts from all over, so you can expect a wide variety of folks fleeing persecution to end up on your doorstep"
1577,,600,Castle Sengir,MtG - Homelands,Domain,"A massive, black castle looming over the broad valley below. A gothic citadel abandoned by its dwarven builders (who may or may not have been slaughtered to a man). From atop its balconies it grants an impressive view over the saltmarsh of the barony, and its gargantuan size and thick stone walls makes it almost entirely impervious to sieges.

Within its dark halls, this ill-gotten castle is decorated with tasteful, if bleak, decor fitting for a true Dominarian gentleman (or woman) of class. Large halls and bathing pools, luxury for hundreds, metal shutters over the window slots. Truly the perfect place to invite people for dinner, lulling them into a false sense of security with discussions of political theory only so they can be lured into... a stroll along the battlements while you talk philosophy.

Aside from a grand dining hall, the castle also contains many secret passages within its ancient hallways and stone corridors. Most notably a hidden stairwell leading from the throne room to a huge dwarven city deep beneath the ground. This beautiful, abandoned city is filled with dwarven-constructed artifacts and machines to generate air and light. Reopening the old mines the dwarves once worked down here could yield truly great wealth. Or you could simply use it as a place to house an army of bloodsuckers and other undead."
1578,,600,Floating Island,MtG - Homelands,Domain,"Not literally floating, the island is simply called that because of the lack of shallows around the place. Ships can be brought within a few lengths of the ""shore"", and anchored safely, even when winter storms bring huge waves to pound against the cliffs of the island.

There is a small dwarven-build port on the island and set apart from the wooden port is the main structure that dominates the island’s landscape, a huge castle-like school. Here you’ll find everything you would need to start a second wizard’s school of your own.

Its stone halls are filled with rooms that could easily serve as sanctums and laboratories for apprentice wizards. Perhaps more importantly, the library contains a number of magical texts on white and blue magic as well as clockwork artifice to start with. In addition to those, the library’s collection is further expanded to include (relative) easy to understand texts detailing whatever magic you know and would like to teach. If you were so inclined, these would form a perfect basis to begin teaching your own apprentices how to wield magic. Or to leave them with just enough to figure it out for themselves with just the tomes held here."
1579,,600,Paradise Island,MtG - Homelands,Domain,"Located across the ocean, out in the dead zone where the earth would normally sap the very life from people, is this place. A small island infused with an abundance of mana, making it a beautiful and fertile place despite its isolation and distance from the continent. Incidentally, this mana stream could also allow you to fuel some truly powerful spells.

But aside from the isle’s natural beauty, you’ll find a great villa built overlooking the deep blue of the sea. A luxurious and comfortable building fit for the home of a god, built from great blocks of granite and marble. Besides a great view, the villa comes with great standing columns, shallow reflecting pools, and a magnificent garden directly linked into the mana stream that fuels the island’s lushness. There is even a small dock with a set of skiffs powered by spell batteries if you’d like to sail the waves and visit the mainland.

A particularly observant visitor might note that the plants and creatures of the island are largely not native to the homelands. Brought in from faraway worlds like the very stones of the villa itself, this is an eclectic collection of pets and creatures from a variety of planes, chosen for their beauty, friendliness, and how well they would live on the island."
1580,,600,Ruler of the Woods ,MtG - Homelands,Domain,"You are a force of nature, an elemental incarnation of the forest's power and living avatar of nature itself. Being one with the woods and nature, the creatures that live amongst the trees are living extensions of your will and you can only be personally affected by spells that also affect the woods with which you share your life.

As the personified will of the woods, you have great powers beyond commanding the existing creatures and monsters of the woods like the native badgers, huge arachnids, and hungry mists. Using the mana of your forest, you can create creatures within the bounds of your forest like entire hosts of faeries to watch over the woods, spectral bears to serve as guardians, and human-like avatars to be extensions of your will. While those are the main aspects of your power, transforming people into lizards to punish transgressions, or the use of spells of healing and renewal are also well within your power at the moment.

However, your power waxes and wanes with the state of your forest and the flow of mana, growing more powerful if the forest is flush with life and weakening if the mana dries up. The opposite is also true to an extent. If you somehow increase the mana available to yourself and the forest, it would be able to grow more lush in response.

While here you draw your power from the Great Woods, either taking on the mantle of Autumn Willow herself or sharing the power and rule of the forest with her. In other jumps, you may select another forest to embody, whether that’s one that already exists in those worlds or just one that you purchased to take with you."
1581,,600,Feroz’s Ban ,MtG - Homelands,Domain,"Though Feroz did much to establish the wizard’s school, personally teaching the first wizards as the mysterious First Master, his greatest feat is one they never knew. On the night of the solstice, when the flow mana is at its strongest, you may replicate Feroz’s Ban. Casting a single mighty spell to seal the world off from other planes, letting a great shield sweep out across the entire globe. Gateways vanish. Camouflage rises against scrying and detection. Shields protect creatures from being stolen away by summoning spells, and prevent mana from escaping the world. A barrier is erected to defend against all trespass.

It would be as if the world you stand on had never existed, shrouded and protected from the rest of the multiverse like a ship in a bottle of volcanic glass. This ban is self-sustaining, powered by the mana of the world instead of your own, and consequently even a mighty planeswalker would have difficulty unravelling it from the inside. From the outside, they would have no chance of breaking through, assuming they could even find it.

Of course as its creator, you personally do have the ability to undo the spell and lift the Ban without having to overpower the mana of an entire plane. Your familiarity with it also allows you to bypass the shield while still keeping it otherwise active, letting you travel to other worlds unhindered. At least if you already had the ability to travel beyond the world."
1582,,600,The Grand Barrier,MtG - Shandalar,Domain,"The Rogue Plane is kept safe from extra-planar intrusions and threats by a planar barrier of immense power, formed by Sahrmal ages ago and maintained by the imprisoned spirit of the necromancer Lim-Dûl. Barriers possessing this level of power are mighty enough to bar access even to Planeswalkers - arguably the most powerful individuals in the multiverse - unless it is broken from the ‘inside’. And now... now you know this ancient and lost art, and are capable of building new barriers similar to the one protecting Shandalar. Each of these barriers will prevent all magical effects from passing through, and seals the warded area off from any kind of interdimensional travel (but not communication) regardless of method or underlying principles. Typically anchored to either an immensely powerful enchantment or a mighty artifact, the size and power of these barriers depends both on their design and, most importantly, their source of power. Though the spirit of Lim-Dûl is chained to maintain the Grand Barrier, lesser sources of energy might be suited to protect individual cities or other such modest points of interest. You will need to find your own means to power any barriers you establish, though... and though you’re not forced to use a necromancer’s soul, you’ll still want to find something potent."
1583,,600,NOVIJEN/ZAMECK,MtG - Ravnica,Domain,"The Heart of Progress- The unnatural pressures of life in Ravnica are best withstood by lifeforms that adapt with unnatural swiftness, and Novijen is where you’ll find those lifeforms. The laboratory for the Simic to perfect their experiments, it is a hybrid of living matter and stone, held in place by thick cables. If you arrive after Project Kraj unceremoniously makes Novijen its head, the guildhall is instead Zameck. Neither ceremonial nor celebratory, it is simply a huge cleared space for the speakers within Zonot Seven. The roof contains many openings to the sky covered over with algae and plax to create opalescent skylights, which sometimes makes the chamber seem to be underwater."
1584,,600,VITU-GHAZI ,MtG - Ravnica,Domain,"The City Tree- In the autumn she casts her seeds across the street below, and come spring, her children rise in service to the conclave. A towering tree almost as tall as New Prahv, there are many buildings within it, shaped from wood and connected by swaying bridges and ladders. There was a cathedral within the centre, in worship of nature. At night it is lit by the light of fireflies. Depending on your time period, Vitu-Ghazi has been through a lot, taking damage throughout the years in many different ways."
1585,,600,SUNHOME ,MtG - Ravnica,Domain,"Fortress of the Legion- The stalwart shield, the towering sentinel, the seat of justice. A combined fortress, barracks, and place of worship, Sunhome serves as a symbol of the military might of the Boros. It is also the base of operations for the League of Wojek, Ravnica’s official law enforcement."
1586,,600,SKARRG,MtG - Ravnica,Domain,"The Rage Pits- Skarrg isn’t a conventional guildhall, as the Gruul aren’t exactly a conventional guild, but it is a centre of activity periodically when the clans converge on it. Built on the remnants of a once great palace, a great bonfire burns in the middle, and it is guarded by beasts and phoenixes."
1587,,600,SVOGTHOS,MtG - Ravnica,Domain,"The Restless Tomb- Once an Orzhov cathedral, the Golgari brought it to life, and it is said that when Golgari territory moves, it follows the centre. The inside was once elaborately decorated, but now it is cold, damp, and heavy with the stench of staleness and decay. The inner chamber once held rot gardens, but when Vraska ascended, she replaced it with statues of her petrified victims. Whether you keep these is up to you."
1588,,600,RIX MAADI ,MtG - Ravnica,Domain,"The Dungeon Palace- Even miles away, if you put your ear to the sewer vents, you can hear the screams and tempestuous laughter. Located in the undercity beneath a large mountain, over a lava pit where Rakdos normally sleeps. Criss- crossed with flowing streams of magma, and filled with places to entertain and maim, torture devices and stages fill it’s large and dimly lit caverns."
1589,,600,NIVIX ,MtG - Ravnica,Domain,"The Aerie of the Firemind- Both Niv Mizzet’s genius and vanity echo through its mirrored halls. Surrounding Niv-Mizzet’s central tower, Nivix is many things. A haven for researchers. A heavily guarded maze. A health and safety violation. Niv-Mizzet considers Nivix’s towers and constant experiments part of one larger experiment. Now that it’s yours, it’s up to you what you do with it."
1590,,600,DUSKMANTLE,MtG - Ravnica,Domain,"The House of Shadow- In a space where there is no room, in a structure which was never built, wherein meets the guild that doesn’t exist. Located in the undercity of Ravnica, this dark and shadowy house is positioned over murky waters, and is shielded with potent memory wards. Few ever find it, and even those who do might have trouble proving its existence. The original was lost after Szadek’s demise, so Lazav recreated it in another part of the undercity. It may or may not be identical to the original one, but no one remembers enough to tell."
1591,,600,ORZHOVA,MtG - Ravnica,Domain,"The Church of Deals - The only church where you should pray before you go inside. The Cathedral Opalescent is lavishly decorated with spires and soaring ceilings, with the aim to make those who enter feel insignificant in comparison. A true testament to the wealth of the Orzhov, it is filled with statues, and stained glass windows. Beneath the church lies a bejeweled catacomb, which houses the bodies of the ghost council. The magic sustaining it is so old that even The Guildpact’s magic does not affect it."
1592,,600,PRAHV/NEW PRAHV,MtG - Ravnica,Domain,"Prahv, the Spires of Order- Where much work is done to make sure nothing is accomplished. Where laws are made and mandates instated. This large, white, marble castle is the seat of power for the Azorius. Due to the accidental meddlings of the Boros legion, in the Return and Guilds time periods, Prahv has been destroyed. Instead, New Prahv marks the highest peaks on Ravnica, it’s immaculate, perfect spires representing the power and authority of its owners."
1593,,600,RADIANCE ,MtG - Ravnica,Domain,"Unity can be a double edged sword, and you know this only too well. Whenever you either share a common aim with your allies, or attack a group with a strong centre of unity, both strength buffs and damage dealt is shared. When one of your enemies is hurt, the whole group feels their pain. When one of your allies receives a surge of strength, their allies are strengthened too. The ties that bind you and your group together will grow ever stronger because of this."
1594,,600,Who Endures,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Domain,"High above the city of Towashi, roots circling around and through the tallest structures the city has ever produced lies the great tree of Boseiju. No matter how tall the city attempts to build, the tree always grows taller. Thanks to an old bargain with the Kami, the city cannot grow outwards, only upwards - or in the case of the reckoners, downwards. The city, while thriving, and just as much a monument to the forward progress of society and the traditions that tower over them, is not what is important. No, the city is surrounded on all sides by a forest, and deep in those forests lie a number of Jukai bases. Small pavilions meant to cultivate rare fruits, expensive herbs, and other exotic goods. Empty beaches and dark caves, where the next generation of caretakers are taught their lessons. And deep in the woods are five dragon eggs, currently made from stone, but containing the potential to see the five dragon Kami reborn should they fall. Or to create a new set of five, if you have enough energy to spare. You may choose between having a position of authority in the city itself, or in the Jukai forests."
1595,,600,Crucible of Defiance,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Domain,"Deep inside the mountains where the Oni once resided, lies the citadel of Sokenzanshi, home to a thousand and one artists, craftsmen, blacksmiths, metalworkers, and even a few musicians. No matter what you might need to wage war, either you can find it here or you can find someone to make it here. The city sits in a valley between the mountains, making it difficult to invade or even to reach under normal circumstances, not to mention that it’s outright built into the side of a dormant volcano. A very defensible location you’ve somehow come into, but that’s not all it has to offer. Sokenzanshi is also home to the Asari Uprising, disgruntled samurai, ambitious Akki, Kami and other spirits just looking for a halfway decent excuse to let loose, and much much more. It is, quite frankly, everything you would ever need to find, build, and arm a veritable army of society's outcasts. The only thing missing is a passionate commander to bind them all together."
1596,,600,Abandoned Mire,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Domain,"In truth, Takenuma is a portion of Kamigawa that damn near everyone seems to be willing and able to utterly forget about. Once the largest source of black mana on the entire plane, that title now rests in Towashi’s undercity, the largest metropolis in all of Kamigawa. Outside of a handful of small villages set at its outskirts, Takenuma is largely abandoned, even by the Kami who once possessed shrines within its borders. There are, however, remnants. A thousand corpses, hidden beneath the muck, ready to be turned into zombies. More than a few ancient shrines that could be brought back to life in order to earn favors from the Kami that once presided over them. Wizards, spirits, and other creatures that only come out at night, just waiting to feast on unwary travelers. Plants, both medicinal and poisonous, grow in abundance here. There is no civilization within the bounds of the mire, but that does not mean that there is no life to it. If you dare to brave within its rotting heart, I’m sure you could find something of value with relative ease - there is one among the Reckoners who uses a poison so potent that it grows black flowers from the inflicted wounds. Perhaps something similar could be found here?"
1597,,600,Soaring City,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Domain,"High above Kamigawa sits an entire city of Soratami, the Moonfolk. It soars through the clouds like a man would across the plains, rarely ever in the same place for more than a few days as it travels with the wind. Most of the time it rests above the oceans, though it does occasionally drift around the entirety of Kamigawa. Each of its “Islands” is a small town unto itself, supporting hundreds of people - and more importantly, since Otawara is primarily a scientific city - and their laboratories. A thousand and one projects are undergoing testing at any given time, and twice as many research studies are being put through their tests at the same time. There’s even a small clan of ninja that make their home here, specializing in discretely acquiring the scientists anything the Empire won’t fund. No matter where you go, this place is sure to be a center of progress and understanding, a way to see the future in your lifetime."
1598,,600,Seat of the Empire,MtG - Kamigawa : Neon Dynasty,Domain,"Roughly one fifth of the land known as Kamigawa rests in the great plains known as Towabara. It sits in the center of the other districts, and in its own center lies Eiganjo Castle and the throne of the Emperor. An empty throne, for now. However, in the castle itself, and surrounding it, lies the vast majority of the Imperial Army - an army that, in the absence of the Emperor - is nominally under your control. Samurai by the hundreds at the gates, a dozen squads of moth riders defending the skies, more than a few mechs of various kinds that were deemed acceptable and allowed to serve, and at the center of it all, a very loyal dog. There is something else, however. In the center of this castle there is a small garden, and in that garden lies a fragment of the worldsoul. For now it is Kyodai, the Emperor's companion, whom none have the right to speak to or look upon, let alone entreat for aid. Who knows what it will be later?"
1599,,600,Divine Intervention ,MtG - Kamigawa,Domain,"You are, by your very nature, a symbolic and conceptual anchor that allows others to tap into a power that you represent. You and those who pray to you may gain slight powers in the vein of your Symbolic Links abilities, you and those who devote their days to your worship will find their own powers and magics emboldened. Shrines raised in your name will actually be holy/unholy at your bidding and grant benefits and curses as you wish, within the boundary of your chosen Symbolic Links. Whilst these powers can never be greater than city wide effects at their most advanced they are up to you to decide.

Boosted: When taken with Jumper of Flesh and Spirit this power extends to the point where you can create avatars to represent each of your Symbolic Links, forming a pantheon of Kami who serve you as lesser reflections of your Kami-self. Whilst this pantheon is limited to purchases within this Jump they allow for a great amount of delegation.

Boost Requires Jumper of Spirit and Flesh(MtG-Kamigawa)"
1600,,600,Glen of Faeries ,MtG - Lorwyn,Domain,"In the heart of Lorwyn’s mountains lies this mystical valley, protected by glamers and guile, and twin to the legendary and elusive Glen Elendra that harbors Oona, queen of the fae. It is not a large place, barely a hundred acres of gently curving hills covered in a thick blanket of trees, shrubs, and grasses. But in the daylight the glen is rife with blooms and blossoms of every size and color, and the air is filled with birdsongs.

At sunset, the glen's beauty is quieter, but perhaps even more breathtaking than it is when seen in normal daylight. Jasmine flowers bloom, catching and reflecting the light, as silver-white moths flutter between the vines. Sparkleflies and will-o'-wisps flicker everywhere, wreathing the misty grounds and the towering greenery in a festival of light.

This obvious exterior beauty is all any non-fae will ever see of the place, unless invited to enter the glen by yourself. Countless layers of the most powerful glamers ever cast by the fae, and therefore the strongest magic in the world, conceal it. Anyone who happens by or seeks the glen out instantly forgets about it as soon as they drew near. Even a ranger with a map, two cuffhounds, and a guide cannot hope to enter this sacred place. His map would change to confound the trails, his dogs would bolt off in seperate directions, baying after tantalizing hares; and his guide would lose his memory and all sense of direction."
1601,,600,Blessed Graf ,MtG - Innistrad,Domain,"A mausoleum attached to your warehouse. It is eternally well kept, with flowers blooming and and tombs beautifully preserved. Anyone interred here cannot be raised from the grave in any way. On Innistrad it is considered relaxing to rest near loved ones in their eternal rest, and while here you will be able to remember any you have lost fondly without bitterness."
1602,,600,Helvault,MtG - Innistrad,Domain,"Your own personal Helvault. One way and inescapable to any being you are capable of defeating in single combat, even if you couldn’t kill them for some reason. After all, that which cannot be killed must be sealed. You personally cannot be sealed into this, but companions can, and you’ll need to free everything to get them out. Any non-companion sealed for more than a year will be unendingly hostile, and will do all in their power to harm you, and your plans, even if you were friends previously. Any beings you attempt to carry to other jumps will be locked into the deepest parts of the Helvault, which cannot be accessed until post-chain."
1603,,600,Unending Growth,Magic The Gathering - Iconics,Domain,"The triumph of those Planeswalker’s who embrace Green, is not destroying the unnatural, but instead, fostering life. If you wish you can take this lesson to heart, quite easily in fact. At will you can accelerate the growth and evolution of creatures and plantlife in an area around you even without the input of any of your spells, as if you yourself were a walking leyline and part of the world.

This starts at roughly double the rate at which the process of evolution would normally go, however the rate of growth and evolution increases quite quickly if you stay there for long periods of time. Living in a single medium-sized forest for three year will see that forest grow to the size of some nations with vicious predators that could tear apart small groups of heroes with ease, extremely tenacious herbivores that could stand up to the might of small armies and unique plant life with their own special qualities. This not only lets you cultivate new powerful creatures to summon, that are easier to summon due to being constantly exposed to your mana, but such creatures are even more receptive to your spells allowing you to further enhance their strength, size, and speed than you would otherwise be capable of."
1604,,600,Waxworks Museum ,Skulduggery Pleasant,Domain,"This waxworks museum has seen better business, but it seems like no one wants to come around now that all the famous sculptures have been shipped to other branches. That’s perfectly fine by you though, as the real value of the building is what lies beneath it; your very own Sanctuary building. This facility has everything you’d need to run a magical government, from squads of Cleavers to offices full of mages working administrative jobs to special investigators and agents to a specialized vault for storing rare or dangerous magical items to a jail that can hold even the strongest of magical captives. Of course, technically you only own the building (unless you also bought the Elder perk), but everyone working there has taken this to mean they work for you too. As such, you can order the people working there to perform tasks on your behalf, whether that means investigating your enemies, throwing your enemies in jail, or just helping you with your research. The people inside are NPCs, and will likely have commonplace varieties of whatever the local Jump’s superpowers are. If you bring it to a Jump without superpowers, they will have lower-end magic from this setting. The exception is the Cleavers, who remain the same throughout."
1605,,600,A Place in the Stars,Sinbad Legend of the Seven Seas,Domain,"Sometimes Earth just gets a little bit too hot to handle. The Gods and whatever hero may be down there are just moving and shaking a bit to much for you to be comfortable. It would be easy to say that space doesn’t have this problem, but that wouldn’t be necessarily true. It just cuts down on the majority of issues. Either way you now have access to a pocket dimension that you can enter at any time. This pocket dimension is not inpentrable and people can brute force there way into it. It may take any form that you like, but no matter what the purchase of this pocket dimension adds a constellation that looks like the shape of your jumper. The stars of this constellation will shine brighter when the door to the dimension is open."
1606,,600,Dungeon,Magi: The Adventure of Sinbad,Domain,"Somehow, you’ve got yourself a Dungeon of your very own, appearing as an enormous stone tower, its exterior covered in detailed carvings and bas reliefs. Upon stepping through its entrance, though, you’ll find yourself whisked away to an enormous complex much larger inside than its exterior would suggest. Filled with all manner of traps, puzzles, and powerful hostile monsters, it’s guaranteed to be a challenge to even the hardiest of adventurers. Whole armies could march inside and end up perishing down to the last man, all without making any significant progress into its depths.

Once you enter, you cannot escape except via powerful teleportation or dimension- travelling powers, or by actually reaching the end of the Dungeon. If you do manage to conquer the Dungeon, however, its treasure will be yours – wealth beyond measure, an enormous chamber piled high with all manner of magic items and mundane treasures, surrounding the grand prize – a single artefact of immense power, among the greatest and most coveted items in the world.

By capturing this Dungeon, all the treasures within are yours to keep. What’s more, it’ll restock in each Jump you visit, containing treasures relevant to each setting you visit. In this world, the grand prize will likely be a Djinn and their Metal Vessel, though who knows what it’ll be elsewhere? It’s worth noting, though, that the Dungeon’s difficulty scales with the overall power level of each Jump, and it’s likely to be a deadly challenge to all but each setting’s toughest warriors.

In case you’re worried about somebody claiming this Dungeon’s treasures before you, worry not – its entrance will only open to your touch, refusing to yield to anyone else no matter what method they use. Of course, once it’s open, others will be able to follow after you and potentially claim its treasures for themselves."
1607,,600,Cathedral District,Magi: Alma Torran,Domain,"The Cathedral serves as the headquarters of the Orthodox, though its name is incredibly misleading. It’s more of a whole city unto itself, filled with countless towering spires, with an enormous palace complex at the very centre which serves as the home of the Elder Council and David himself. However, it also wouldn’t be inaccurate to say that its function as a city is secondary – its true purpose is to be a Magic Tool of unmatched proportions, the only one of its kind, at least until you
came along.

You too have become the ruler of a city similar to the Cathedral. On a merely physical level, it’s a worthy capital for any empire: Even the smallest buildings are constructed with stunning architecture, the wall that encloses it is perfectly circular and strong enough to rebuff almost any terrestrial foe, and the palace at the centre, your personal residence, is the height of luxury. The citizenry want for nothing and heed
your words with zealous obedience, though, as mentioned, these things are only secondary matters.

The true draw can be found within the great sanctuary at the apex of your palace complex – a dimensional distortion opening up to a realm of pure magical energy which, conveniently enough, only you can see or sense in any way. What’s more, the city has been constructed for the sole purpose of allowing you to tap into this distortion as an energy source. So long as you remain within the city’s walls, you may draw energy from that dimension to gain access to an unfathomably-deep well of magical power, empowering your magic to heights otherwise impossible within this world, even when using a Divine Staff.

If you wished, you could also make use of the anomaly’s energy to power all sorts of Magic Tools and devices that would otherwise be too energy-intensive to be feasible. One such tool has already been installed, allowing you to project a nigh-impenetrable dome of magical force over the entire city at the flick of a switch, making defending the whole place a breeze.
"
1608,,600,Moonlit Castle,BlazBlue: Phase Zero,Domain,"Clavis Alucard’s castle, his home… That I have no idea where is. It’s either on the dark side of the moon or in it’s own pocket dimension. Then again, the castle is cloaked in an eternal night, with the only light being the moon, so… Does it really matter? Moving on, time inside the castle actually moves slower than the real world, a week inside is a month outside. As for the castle itself, it’s appearance changes depending on your mood and health. In Clavis’s old age, it was just a tad bit crumbling and covered in ivy. Once in Rachel’s care, it was spotless, ivyless, and had gardens filled with black roses. For you, who knows? Additionally, the castle is not defenseless - anyone who breaks in will have to contend with the Mirrors Edge, a magic formula that creates a perfect illusion of the intruder and forces them to defeat themselves."
1609,,600,Magic City Ishana,BlazBlue: Phase Zero,Domain,"The Magic City of Ishana is the home base of the Magic Association, as well as where their school for magic is located. Sitting on an island in the middle of the atlantic ocean, the island has a magical shield on it that prevents the non-magicals from finding it, detecting it, or even seeing it, as well as defending it from the Black Beasts excessive amounts of magic. Though it may be only a single island, make no mistake, it’s a fully fledged city - it has its own airport for crying out loud. For you, who I assume to be a graduate of the magic academy, it has everything you’d ever need in a workshop in the sub basements. Though a word of warning? The city is ruled by the Ten Sages - such as Nine, one of the six heroes - you’d probably best be wary of the rest. Seven and Eight tried to kill Nine’s sister for the sake of science, and One is Relius Clover aka one of the three responsible for the Black Beast."
1610,,600,Sacred Temple of the Gods,Campione,Domain,"As one would expect of a God of your level. A temple between the Netherworld and the mortal realm. You can shape it as you want, following your favored aesthetic. While you are inside, your divinity and ‘will’ are increased in volume and control, letting you exert your influence far wider and boosting all your powers exponentially. It can also be used in reverse, if you will, hiding your divinity and presence from anyone trying to find your location and also grant a boost in regeneration while you’re inside resting."
1611,,600,Charles Patricius,Fate/Extella,Domain,"The flying fortress of a dream-like hero, hovering softly before you. A mix between a base camp and a high tech airship, Charles Patricius is capable of moving at very high speeds, flying around the virtual world to easily reach any zone in minutes. It’s difficult to detect even with powerful sensors and well protected by magical shielding. The top of the fortress is an open garden, where three sizeable buildings rest. A personal room for the owner or leader to rest and conduct magic in, a War Room that significantly increases the strategic aptitude of those within and a large dormitory able to comfortably house several dozen Servants or other warriors. The fortress generates it’s own fuel and supplies, letting those riding live in comfort without worries. 

An additional secret has also been found, passed down from the more mature Carolus Patricius. A Fascimile Servant Generator, able to create shadowy and obedient copies of Servants that you bring into the generator room for scanning. It requires large amounts of magical energy to operate but most Servants would be able to support a ghost being created each day, with powerful ones allowing for several. The copies are significantly weaker than the actual originals but much stronger than ordinary attack programs.

If you also purchase Personal District, you can instead combine it with this option to upgrade it to the scale of Carolus Patricius, the fortress of Karl der Groebe. The flying fortress gains the scale and defences of the personal district, becoming a city sized flying monstrosity covered in artillery guns and containing a small army of defenders. A second Servant Generator is added if this is the case, along with an impressively large throne room and intrusively long staircase to said throne room."
1612,,600,That’s Not How Math Works,FateExtra CCC,Domain,"Imaginary Number space is quite the strange thing. It has nothing to do with the mathematical concept of imaginary numbers (who knows why it’s named that), but rather you can think of it as the ‘space’ outside of reality itself, in a manner of speaking. It is not truly nothingness, but maybe a better metaphor would be to consider it the garbage dump of existence. Well, however you wish to picture it, you now have access to it in some way. Whether by walking through a specially prepared door, teleporting there, or something else, it’s your choice of how you access it.

Within Imaginary Number space you can find things that were lost. Unwoven, obliterated, sealed at the farthest reaches of existence, erased completely from reality, or perhaps even those who die without an afterlife to head to when they pass on. Should you manage to navigate this seemingly uniformly purple and dull place, you’ll be able to find things that would otherwise never have been regained or recovered. You are likely going to need some form of ability or program to detect, identify, and lead you to your objective, as space and time are a little weird here, but with enough preparation you’ll be able to find anything that is truly lost, and bring it back to reality with you. Beware of the terrible things that lurk at the edges of this space."
1613,,600,Labyrinth Creation,Fate/Extra,Domain ,"The Moon Cell creates entire Reality Marbles to simulate each area in the Grail War, including the Lunar Seas where Servant Battles take place. While you're not able to replicate this incredible feat, you can being to create Lunar Sea like pockets of your own. While you can always decide the general theme to the dungeon and it's enemies, at first, these will be small dungeons, perhaps only a dozen rooms and connecting hallways, and filled with weak fodder that will only drop cheap items. As you grow more experienced, all these parameters will expand. Eventually you could create grand labyrinths with multiple floors and dozens of rooms a piece, enemies will grow in strength and their item drops will increase to match. You do not have any more control over this however, at most you may simply choose the general size and strength of each dungeon, nor will the enemies within ignore you."
1614,,600,Devil Mountain,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Domain ,"A fitful home for any barbaric demon lord. This massive mountain is a place of supernatural power, calling Oni and youkai to it in droves. Towering unnaturally higher, it is constantly wreathed in dangerous weather and filled with supernatural, lethal plants and animals to make approach all the more deadly. Home to a loyal but rowdy band of Oni one thousand strong, it is also the site of a personal palace of pleasures for yourself. A huge temple converted into a den of debauchery waits for you near the peak, filled with any lurid desire you could hope to fulfill. Most of your powerful tribe of Oni spend their time here, drunk and feasting and fighting. The mountain’s terrors don’t bother you or the tribe, making it easy to defend, and the Oni are all too happy to accompany you down the mountain for raids on humans or anyone else that can give a good fight. A intelligent and fiery Oni with blonde hair manages the tribe when you are away, too drunk to care or just not interested, trying to keep them on a track you’d approve of. The mountain will appear in future worlds, becoming ever more dangerous to intruders as it adds more natural hazards to it’s terrain."
1615,,600,Shrine of Love,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Domain ,"Among the largest and most impressive holy sites across Japan is this temple, located some distance
away from where you begin. Concealed by nature and difficult paths for those who don’t know
where to tread, this large temple is a site of great devotion to your chosen religion or gods. Holy
rites would doubtlessly be far more powerful here and the imbued faith has erected many powerful
wards across the complex, enough that even Shuten Douji or another great Youkai would take many
days to breach with force. The abundant nature surrounding the shrine provides more than enough
food and water to make long term accommodation comfortable.
 
The temple has the curious property of allowing certain friendly supernatural beings through these
protections now and then. Now and then, you may wake up one day to find visitors, strange creatures from across Japan that have great power and a very favourable disposition to you. Often
seeking a quiet home to stay in, they make for easy allies. First for protecting the new home should
you allow them to stay and quickly in aiding you personally, as they appear quite eager to bond and
make friends. These magical beings have a strange tendency to be attractive members of a sex that
you prefer as well, which is probably just a coincidence. Those longing looks, deep blushes and
constant remarks on how they will protect you from anyone no matter what they have to do are all
the signs of a good friend."
1616,,600,Dun Scaith,Fate/Legends - Land of Shadows,Domain,"A dark land, one where monsters roam and the great hermits that grew beyond the mortal world
have come to call home. The Land of Shadows has granted access to you and unlike many of it’s
inhabitants, you may come and go as you please. You posses an enormous castle in this sunless
dimension, one the size of a small city in the world of mortals. Not that anyone else lives there but it makes for an impressive home. There are many strange beings in this land that unlike normal, avoid
you unless you go looking for them. Mighty beasts with which to hone your skills and power against, ancient and immortal hermits with almost no end to the skills and knowledge they could dispense
should you prove an interesting disciple. Perhaps even a travelling partner could be found here, a
woman who seeks something to spice up her life after so many years of only wanting it all to end. For a supposedly dead land, there are many great resources to be found. Additionally, you also have
the ability to summon the Gate of Skye, a massive ghostly projection that leads to and from the Land
of Shadows. Unless they come with your permission, being in the presence of this Gate when it
opens is a terrible idea, as it sucks away the life force of those caught in it’s vicinity in just seconds, requiring immense magical energy reserves or supernatural luck to avoid such a thing happening. This cannot be imported into. The occupants, monsters and people, of this land are new in each
world, fitting to where you find yourself."
1617,,600,Crystal Palace,Fate/Legends - Vive la France,Domain,"It’s not every day that even a high class noble comes upon a home as gorgeous as your home. The
Crystal Palace, named for the British creation of later years, is a sprawling mansion estate in one of
the more lush regions of France, finding equal chance at warm summers and wet winters. The
mansion itself could easily house hundreds of guests in luxurious comfort, along with the horde of
servants that currently make their homes here in service to the estate and yourself. They’re needed
for certain, as beyond the palace is a massive garden and hunting range. There are even
supernatural benefits, as your presence in this palace will see a enormous increase to all of your
parameters, from the physical to the magical, while you are present. This options true use comes about from what you can do while outside of it, however. At any time, you are able to call upon the spirit of your home and fashion a dress or outfit for yourself based on
the property. This dress holds powers drawing from your property, not just allowing you to benefit
from counting as being within the home but gaining new powers, such as manifesting crystal
weaponry to damage foes and spread your statistic increases to your allies. Should you import
something into this or import this into something later, you’ll find the dress mode will update to
properly represent your current Crystal Palace.

Additionally, though it can be turned down nor or in future times considering the state of the
revolution later on, the ownership of this palace can confer a royal title on your person. Whether it
be as a princess or as the actual queen of the country you find yourself in should it be currently
lacking, it’ll be a position that is either by birthright or royal adoption. Such titles will be available to
you in future worlds, under the same conditions."
1618,,600,Wizard’s Tower,Fate/Legends - Garden of Avalon,Domain,"Avalon is the land of the fairies, an almost unreachable realm that has only seen a handful of human, partially or fully, visitors in all of time. Within Avalon, there can be found smaller realms, such as the one that Merlin will eventually come to be imprisoned within. The realm you find yourself with
access to is similar to that realm but does not imprison you. This place, a small dimension measuring a few miles across, is filled with a field of gorgeous flowers. In the centre of the dimension is a tall wizard’s tower. There are many rooms, workshops and laboratories within this tower, filled with extremely rare materials, resources, reagents and magical curios, as well as a fair few creature comforts and luxuries. Many of these resources will replenish in time too. There are even a great deal of books written on various magical subjects, some by Merlin himself and some by those much older than even him. You may enter this realm with just a thought, through all but the most powerful and thorough of preventions against dimensional travel, and exit out into any location without those most powerful protections. While others can potentially invade your dimension should they find out about it, the tower realm has protections against invasion on a similar level to the sheath Avalon does when activated."
1619,,600,King In Your Own Right,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Domain,"You’ve taken charge of your own kingdom in full. While it may not be an equal for mighty Rome, it is no backwater kingdom either. You rule over a sizeable, wealthy and fairly powerful kingdom, one similar to the more powerful states of Greece or a smaller district of the Roman Empire. Your kingdom has a high propensity for bringing about heroes of varying levels as well, more often than not ones quite loyal to your kingdom. Someone like Heracles isn't likely to show up more than once a few generations but lesser heroes are quite common. While small now, the kingdom may be expanded and improved through your efforts and will retain those changes as you bring it forward to new worlds, where it will slot in to the world, fitting into history or appearing from nowhere."
1620,,600,The Holy Church ,Lord El-Melloi Case Files,Domain,"The Holy Church is the supernatural underbelly of the Roman Catholic Church, utilizing holy mysteries and to a lesser extent magecraft to both protect humanity and support their mundane counterparts. In case you feel the need to bring them with you, the Holy Church can be made to follow you into future worlds. In modern jumps it simply integrates itself into the Catholic Church of that world. In jumps where there is no Catholic Church one will appear retroactively as a major world religion. Members and holy items will take on local forms, identities, moralities, and magical or holy abilities, if applicable, though you may instead import them in their original forms if you desire. These are followers, not companions, so individuals do not carry over from world to world. The Church will never become hostile towards you unless you give them legitimate reason to, and they’ll even ignore less legitimate reasons to dislike you, like you using magecraft or not being a Catholic, as applicable. They are also extremely willing to help root out unholy and demonic creatures of the night to defend humanity. For 800 CP instead, you are considered an important and trustworthy member and leader of the Church, though if you try to do something directly contrary to their mission like wipe out humanity or kill God (without first convincing them it is not truly God but an imposter) they will side against you."
1621,,600,Lostbelt King,Lord El-Melloi Case Files,Domain,"Wait, what? How did - nevermind. I’m sure Dr Heartless will be glad to have you on board, because it seems you have somehow circumvented one of the dangers of actually changing the world in this setting, specifically that the Quantum Time-Lock and Pruning Phenomenon may decide that your timeline is outside of acceptable boundaries, and eventually delete it entirely. You don’t need to worry about it, because you have a power no one else does: when your timeline is about to be erased, altered, or deleted, a sort of mystical alarm goes off in your mind, at least a day in advance, and you may declare yourself - or a major or defining figure of the timeline a the timeline’s “king.” Upon doing so, the timeline is henceforth a “Lostbelt,” over which the king gains a sort of Divine Authority. So long the Lostbelt’s king remains within it, and alive (or alive-adjacent) it will persist, any problems caused by its mere existence will simply not occur, and any attempt to alter it will simply result in additional timelines spawning. Departing for a new jump or Going Home does not count as leaving, and post-Spark, you no longer need to remain within your claimed timelines to preserve them. In the case of competing claims, the more defining figure of the timelines or the most mystically powerful becomes king."
1622,,600,Brunestud ,Tsukihime,Domain,"Crimson Moon Brunestud. The Ultimate One of the Moon, who made a pact with Gaia in order to create a race - the True Ancestors - to corral humanity. But this luminous being had its own agenda, wanting to make a suitable vessel able to exist within Gaia’s laws and possessed enough purity for it to take over and then enact his own will upon the world. There are three suitable vessels on the planet - Arcueid Brunestud, Altrouge Brunestud… and you. Whether your body had enough ‘purity’ for Crimson Moon to consider as a candidate for being their vessel or you were some misbegotten attempt at replicating the True Ancestors, a ‘fragment’ of Crimson Moon exists within your soul. However,unlike the others, this fragment holds no particular sentience or power over you, and is only a small piece of what Crimson Moon’s power would be.

First, you are able to manifest a copy of Millennium Castle Brunestud, a piece of Type-Moon’s Reality Marble where his influence is the strongest, at will (curiously, even if you lack MarblePhantasm) and dwell within it. You may change the interior of the castle to your will, making anything from a luxurious manor to an eldritch hell only a monster could find comfortable. Your connection also causes your power, even those not tied to your nature as a True Ancestor, to wax and wane with the phases of the moon - during the night of a new moon, there is no change, but during a full moon, your strength and powers are magnified several times over. And when you dwell within the Castle itself, your power is always at its peak from this boost, functioning the same as the night of a full moon. An ordinary human (as miraculous as it maybe) with this could lift a tank one-handed on the night of a full moon. The might of a True Ancestor is likewise increased even further than before in the light of the moon, letting you outmatch others of your kind save for your two ‘siblings’. Perhaps in a few centuries, this fragment’ could grow into something matching the original...though that night is far, far away.

If you prefer a more...’talkative’ source of power, you may take the exclusive companion for this perk ‘The Moon’s Shadow’ for free.
"
1623,,600,Living Workshop ,Kara no Kyokai,Domain,"A workshop to make any Magus peer of yours jealous but combined with something much more valuable, at least to the less scrupulous Magi. You own a sizable building, likely a large apartment complex or mansion or mall of some kind. The main requirement is that it has space for a large number of people to live, or at least be stored. This is because that is the case, with up to 64 families living in the location at once. If they are not kept as cattle outright, the people here will be none the wiser as to what is going on. With the many secret rooms present in the building, it’s easy to hide whatever you desire to do to them, and the building itself has some sort of effect that makes any resident extremely reluctant to leave and very easy to mould as you please. 

But the second and more valuable step to this is that the entire structure is your workshop as a Magus. The most immediate effect is that, due to incredibly unique enchantments and links to you, you are able to instantly teleport anywhere within the building and retain a near-omniscient awareness of all space and events within it. In at least one of the secret rooms of the building, if not several, you will find a fully equipped Magus Workshop of great value to a Magus of your skill and specific specialties. The tools, reagents, materials, peer research if any exists and more will be found. While rare consumable materials will be understandably rare and truly exceptional things for your level will not appear, the Workshop will slowly grow as your mastery of magecraft does and slowly resupply whatever might be used up that the Workshop itself spawns through this option.
"
1624,,600,New Agency ,Kara no Kyokai,Domain,"What is there for those who have no interest in reaching the Root, who look at the goal of all Magi and think it’s just a big waste of time? There’s money. Turning magecraft to mundane profit can be quite lucrative, as can be said for psychic powers or unnatural talents. You have a business of some sort that’s well suited towards your particular talents in this jump or will come into the ownership of one in adulthood. It’s already got a building to itself, some four storey and relatively well furnished if dusty location. A storeroom, a nice office and space for workshops if you have the time to set one up. It might be a private investigator agency, a mercenary outfit, an ancient antique shop or a exotic animal store. What makes the business special is the employees, rather than the location itself. The business naturally attracts employees in situations that have great need of employment outside of the usual channels. More importantly, they often have quite unique abilities. Usually moderately powerful psychic abilities, Demon Hunter heritage or even lesser non-human creatures like a few fairies that spy on others in exchange for sweets. Every few years, you’ll be able to take on a more valuable ally. Someone with a powerful pair of mystic eyes, a Dead Apostle that wants to live among humans or some other powerful entity. They’re easy to get along with and gain the loyalty of, potentially even coming along with this business as followers if you can gain their trust and devotion.

If you merely desire an ordinary business without the penchant for attracting unnatural allies, you can buy one that otherwise works the same as the above for 300CP instead, still discounted to students.
"
1625,,600,That Did Not Happen ,Generic Magical Girl,Domain,"With a supreme effort of will on your part, you can use your power to prevent the damage caused by battles with the forces of evil – by locking the battle into a barrier field where the damage won't affect the outside world. Once you've defeated the enemy, you can release your barrier and the world will revert to what it was before. Normal people will be sealed outside the barrier, and won't notice anything going on inside, but people with magical abilities or powers may be able to walk right into it, suddenly finding themselves in the middle of a war zone. Also, be careful - if you lose the fight, your barrier will collapse, and all of the damage will suddenly appear in the real world. Typical barriers start out around the size of a football field, but with practice you can probably get them to cover a square mile or more. 
"
1626,,600,Tower of Fate ,DC Occult,Domain,"A replica of the Tower of Fate reserved for use by the eponymous Doctor Fate. This tower is as big as it needs to be and rests outside of the bounds of the multiverse. If all of creation were to be cast into oblivion or warped into a sea of chaos, this tower would remain untouched. Only you and those you welcome inside may enter and any inside may be ejected at your leisure. While you are inside the Tower, your power is amplified many times over. Even as a normal mage this would be enough to allow workings of magic comparable to Doctor Fate himself.

You may choose to have this tower manifest inside any dimensions or pocket realms you own, which also allows you to take advantage of the tower's benefits in a radius around the tower.
"
1627,,600,Library of Eternity ,DC Occult,Domain,"​An incredible enchanted library is added onto your warehouse. This library is an artifact of immense value that was long thought to only exist within myth and legend, for within it is all the knowledge of mankind. This infinite library will absorb all written knowledge in every jump that you visit. The only exception to this are singularly unique and important books such as the Book of Eternity or the Necromicon. Of course, you’ll have to find the books you want to read, first. Luckily if you enter the library with a specific topic in mind you’ll tend to find yourself in the right area with only a few minutes wandering around.
"
1628,,600,The House of Mystery ,Justice League Dark,Domain,"This mansion, appearing as a relatively normal large house from the outside, has existed in some form or another for at least as long as mankind. On the inside, it is much larger than the outer appearance would suggest – how large? That is unknown; perhaps it’s infinitely so. – and constantly shifts to accommodate your Desires.

But that isn’t what makes this house truly special, nor is it the fact that it is filled with entire societies, or that it is alive and bound to you. No, what makes this house truly unique and of singular value is that it is a crossroads of reality. The House is connected to every single point in space and time and this gives it the ability to slip between the layers of reality and appear anywhere you wish, be it a planet on the other side of the great black beyond or another dimension altogether. There are few places the house cannot go and it'll be all too happy to do So.

The final noteworthy abilities that the House possesses is that it can be summoned to your location with nothing but a mental call and that in a similar way, anyone who accepts your invitation into the House can be summoned back into it at any time you wish. Couple more things worth mentioning: this house cannot be permanently wrested from you; your bond may be temporarily blocked to prevent you from summoning it, but no one else can usurp it and you may allow inactive companions to roam inside of it.
"
1629,,600,Shadow Jumper’s Trinket​ ,The Gods Are Bastards,Domain,"The magic system of Shadow is currently inaccessible except through indirect methods, such as through infernal magic. This trinket bypasses such requirements, allowing you to directly access Shadow magic and thus “Shadow Jump”, teleporting impressive distances by wrapping the shadows around you. Uniquely, this form of teleportation will be completely untraceable, as the more common methods of accessing Shadow Magic do so indirectly, leaving the signs of the magic used to access it."
1630,,600,Temple,Warhammer Fantasy: Amazons,Domain,"One of the great Amazonian temples has come into your possession, either rightfully as a Priestess or by right of discovery out in the wilds if you are not a Priestess. The Temples are mighty fortresses, easy to defend and equipped with many magical defences. However, the real draw of them is the treasures contained within. These temples hold great arcane secrets and technologies, from tomes describing some of the greatest spells and lores of this world to ancient weapons capable of slaying even the mightiest beasts of the jungle in a single shot. Many of these artefacts may be difficult to figure out the uses of, as there are hardly any instructions lying around, but almost all are useful, powerful or important. In future worlds, your temple will appear in a location of your choice or an isolated place in the wilds, holding similarly old, important and powerful magic or technological marvels.
"
1631,,600,Crystal of the Floating Isles ,Dog Days,Domain,"A large blue gem which can be used to make a portion of land float up high in the sky when implanted in the ground. Over the course of a year, a second one will grow out from the first implanted one, letting you slowly increase the number of floating isles. Each crystal can float an island of diameters around 500 meters. Each additional one planted will increase this size by the same volume.
"
1632,,600,Rejection of the Supernatural ,Golden Sky Stories,Domain,"There’s a difference between seeing the paranormal and accepting the paranormal, and for some people, they would much rather forget the paranormal once seen rather than accept it as a part of reality. Perhaps you are amongst these people – an individual who would rather have peace and quiet than ghosts and magic.

At will, you can manifest your wilful ignorance into a field around you, and both magical and supernatural phenomena will occur at a distinctively reduced frequency – if it occurs at all. Don’t want ghosts haunting your house? Just pop that field up and banish them away. Granted, this ability won’t work as well in a world where magic or supernatural entities are a norm – but at least it does afford you a substantial level of magic resistance!
"
1633,,600,The Scarlet Devil Mansion ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Domain,"You have a mansion of your own, though potentially a very empty one. It’s designed in a very Western style, standing out from the mostly traditional Japanese structures around here. It contains a good supply of fine china and silverware, as well as a solid wall around it and a good supply of ever-fresh tea leaves. The most valuable part, however, is the library within, which contains a vast quantity of grimoires, books from the Outside World, and magical tomes in general. Unfortunately, many of them are sealed and in encoded languages – to unlock and decipher them would be a full-time job on its own.
"
1634,,600,Cast into Hell ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Domain,"You have a particular ability to send someone you don’t like spiritually into Hell. While they’re in Avici – the ninth layer of Buddhist Hell – their body will be comatose and helpless while their spirit wanders amidst infinite blackness where they shall be unable to touch, see, nor starve or die. Until, of course, they find a way out. For ordinary people, they shall be stuck here until their sentence is carried out – billions upon billions of years – though those of vast power or ability may find quicker ways out."
1635,,600,Eintei ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Domain,"You have a cosy dwelling out of the way in a bamboo forest, that you may customise the aesthetics of. It’s warded by all kinds of protective spells that will ensure all but the most powerful people will simply manage to pass it by, unless you specifically wish to let them in. Additionally, for some reason, youkai rabbits seem to keep popping up here somehow.
"
1636,,600,A Secret World ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Domain,"You have an entire small alternate dimension to customise and play around in. By default, it takes on the form of a featureless blank void stretching across an area the size of a small village, though you can reshape it according to your whims, perhaps turning it into a nice house. Additionally, you can create doors leading into it nearly anywhere, as long as it is on the back of something such as someone’s back, the back of a statue, and similar backs."
1637,,600,Dreams of Neverland* ,Peter Pan,Domain,"The Neverland is composed of the dreams of countless children, but the certain island you are on is primarily driven by Peter Pan, with other dreams being filtered into the mix time-to-time. Within this jump, you have the ability to pull the visions of dreamers closer to the island, until their imaginations blend to become an extra addition to the island. In any following jumps, you can create a new “Never Land” hub for dreams in that world, allowing the imaginations of children and the like of that universe to coalesce together into an island. However, each dream world is bound to the universe of that jump, and it must stay behind when you go. Also, while you can be selective on which dreams are the key pieces of the island, you cannot apply your own dreams to the Never Lands. Moreover, the dreams that embody the island are limited to those of childish whimsy, meaning that the creations can be somewhat limited, at least by grown-up expectations. That doesn’t mean that the magic in the dreams aren’t powerful or that conflict there is harmless, but rather that “cool” and “fun” matter more than overall effectiveness. So good luck trying to actually make productive use of that dream about an awesome superweapon...you’re going to need it. Plus, it’s typically harder to impose these dreams outside of your little Neverland hub. If you took the Escort for the Innocent Dead perk, you can guide dead souls into the dream worlds – whether Neverland or a new one of your creation and reincarnate them in a form of your choice in that world; once they have been reincarnated, they are now essentially in between life and death, so they could stay in the dream forever, go to the real world and potentially die eventually under normal circumstances, or eventually let go and pass on to the next life like they were originally meant to.
"
1638,,600,Fabricated World ,Ib,Domain,"Even if you give life to your artworks, they still do not have a place in the world of the real. By sacrificing part of your life, you can create a full-fledged gallery, an elaborate dungeon where all of your living masterpieces can live forever, along with anything trapped inside. Your artworks now exist on two planes: in the real world as inanimate objects, and in another world as living things. The paintings in the real world act as windows of sorts for their living counterparts in the other world, but they cannot physically interact with the real world. The real and unreal are bridged through a special painting, the Fabricated World, which can appear and disappear anywhere in the real gallery at your command; whenever someone stares deep and long enough at the tapestry, you can pull him or her into your other world. Within your painted world, you can give life to your artwork (even without Paint to Life) and use their full magic potential without needing to drain your own reserves (as long as they stay inside the Fabricated World). If you purchased Claimed for Posterity, any person who dies inside the gallery will automatically turn into another of your artworks. These galleries are self-sustaining once you pour in the initial energy. The galleries you create will link together and follow you between jumps and are accessible from your Warehouse when not summoned; you can also continue to add new pieces to and remodel your old galleries as you see fit. You can allow yourself to dissolve and merge into the gallery as a whole to control it at will, place special messages on wall or paper, and exist in that fragmented yet all-seeing state indefinitely; however, you are able to regather yourself and return to normal when you wish. If you fuse your soul to the gallery, you may be able to find ways to apply other powers you have to the form of the dungeon – for example, if you had some sort of control over fire you could perhaps make your gallery’s features resistant to fire or keep the gallery permanently on fire without any of your creations being harmed."
1639,,600,Panthalassa Castle ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Domain,"A replica of Panthalassa’s mansion-like castle. It can travel freely through the ocean, and can vanish into shadows to escape pursuit. The interior is naturally flooded with water, but is enchanted such that air-breathers such as humans can safely live inside; in fact, while you can freely swim about if you wish, it is simultaneously and selectively free of water’s negative effects, to the point that you can eat at a table, bathe in a spa, or even read books in the included library. It can also come to the surface when necessary.
"
1640,,600,House Parent ,Neverland: The RPG,Domain,"You can now stimulate and manage the “growing” of houses you own/live in. At the very least, you can make it so that the building will gradually grow in size over time. Not only will the overall size of the house change, but individual rooms will also grow in size, with internal fixtures like beds increasing in size as well along with gaining additional decorations like extra furniture and nightstands. If they grow long enough, they might even gain entirely new rooms – or entire extra floors. But if you don’t want your house to grow too big, you can instruct it to stop growing (which will halt further growth). Alternately, you can direct it to grow in one main direction such as upward (whether as a tower or as part of a massive tree). In addition, by treating the house the way you would your child, you can teach the home new tricks. Over time, with enough love and care, your home might even gain a sense of devotion towards you, making it hard for your enemies to use the structure against you. Once your house has been influenced by this perk long enough, it can even move about. Maybe eventually your house will in turn become a parent with children of its own, even?
"
1641,,600,Whirlpool Magic ,Neverland: The RPG,Domain,"You can create and enchant whirlpools to become portals between other whirlpools. You can manifest whirlpools anywhere. If you enchant a single whirlpool, it will just take you to the closest random whirlpool in the area, but if you have enchanted multiple whirlpools, you can link them together for specific portals. While you can safely travel through these whirlpools, others lacking strong swimming skills will likely be torn to pieces before they even get through the portal – and then there’s the matter of escaping the second whirlpool on the other side. You can also enchant other forms of water to varying effects, like making a waterfall become a solid wall that unfurls like a curtain when you wish to pass, or enchanting rain to cause sleep, forgetfulness, or wild dancing.
"
1642,,600,Inventory Space,Danmachi,Domain,Allows you access to a spatial inventory with the size of 10 cubic meters x your level. You know everything that you stored inside the spatial inventory and you can store and take items that are stored inside with your mind alone. Tine inside the spatial inventory is stopped allowing you to preserve items and food in the state that you put it in and the only downside of this ability is you cannot store things that are alive inside the spatial inventory.
1643,,600,Personal Dungeon,Danmachi,Domain,A personal dungeon connected via a door inside your warehouse or any buildings you have. This dungeon is designed to test the limits and ability of those who enter it as it scales to their level and experience if they are a group the difficulty would be somewhere where the strongest would still feel threatened and the weakest can still overcome. All the monsters and traps inside of the dungeon are the weaknesses of the challenger as it is meant for the challengers to learn and overcome or eliminate their various weaknesses. Death inside this dungeon only means that you are thrown out of it and unable to challenge it for three days though the pains that you experience are real.
1644,,600,Amber Hill ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Domain,"Somewhere, out in the untamed wilds, there is a hill surrounded by bounty. A small stream runs around the north side of the hill, and a small cavern bores into the south face. Wild game appears in numbers that never seem to truly vanish, and berry-laden bushes grow all about the hillside. Ducks, frogs, and small fish fill the stream, ensuring an ample supply of food from those pristine waters. The cavern is adequate shelter against all but the fiercest storms. Here, you will have no need for the trappings of civilization at all, in this world or any other that the hill follows you to. The whipping of Ghur in this wild place is especially strong, ensuring extensive fuel for your spells. This is your domain, Amber Wizard. Defend it well.
"
1645,,600,Charnel House ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Domain,"Shyish blows furiously over this acre of graveyard earth, but in an interesting way. The art of Necromancy is practiced by using Shyish as a pair of ‘tongs’ to grasp at Dhar - but the Wind of Death refuses the touch of Necromancy in this place, even tearing the animating energy away from whatever mindless undead dare to enter. Perhaps it makes sense, given your Order’s strongly implied ties to the Cult of Morr, but the dead you bury here will be utterly beyond the reach of Nagash’s vile sorceries. In addition, it seems that you will never quite run out of earth in which to bury a corpse, as the soil and Shyish absorb the oldest bodies entirely to make room. Preserve the sanctity of the grave, Amethyst Magister."
1646,,600,Incinerator ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Domain,"This is an unusual construction, perhaps the work of a single mage. This building (and a small courtyard surrounding it) looks to all the world like an overgrown oven and chimney, but it may prove useful to you. Aqshy blows hot wherever there is fire or wherever there is passion and excitement. While the flames within the oven burn pleasantly hot in even the coldest weather so long as they’re fed, they also seem to inflame the emotions of those in the courtyard. This can turn disagreements into arguments or longing looks into a kiss, but the important thing is that the structure is thus perfectly designed to attract and channel the Red Wind. If you wanted more firepower, here you are."
1647,,600,Observatory ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Domain,"Even in an age where the accurate observation of the heavens is commonplace, Azyr’s power would ensure that this observatory will be the envy of stargazers the world over. Likely situated atop a high mountain, its telescope functions through the power of the Wind of the Heavens, such that you could peer closely at even the most distant visible stars without impediment where such feats would normally require a telescope situated outside of the atmosphere. Furthermore, while within this observatory, you may more easily direct your visions of the future. Even an Apprentice in this tower would be able to narrow a vision of future events down to a specific type of event rather than seeing something unrelated. Choosing to direct your vision so will only fail if the vision you would otherwise have is truly urgent; an attempt on your own life, for instance. Finally, as a practical concern, this observatory is a working wizard’s tower in other respects, containing rooms for storage of food and arcane supplies, a bookshelf or two to keep your findings organized, and a small amount of living space for you and any apprentices you have brought with you.
"
1648,,600,Workshop ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Domain,"Either your Patriarch already has such a workshop as this, or he would kill to get his hands on one. Chamon is attracted to metal, especially gold, and so atop a vein of gold that never quite seems to run dry you have erected an alchemical laboratory and forge. Every batch of black powder or blade you produce within this workshop is infused with raw Chamon pulled through the very air into your hands as you work. Any enchantments you lay upon the new work draw even more of the Gold Wind into your creations, ensuring that every spearpoint and cuirass is of the highest quality. If nothing else, remember that an actual gold mine rests beneath your workshop, easily accessed and ripe for the harvesting. Let the State Troops provide their own Faith, yes, but for Steel and Gunpowder they would be wise to come to you. Of course, this workshop will follow you wherever you go."
1649,,600,Phantom Tower ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Domain,"So you have followed in Algard’s footsteps, have you? Very well. This gray tower is, at first, unassuming for a Wizard’s tower. To you, at least, there may be nothing special about it at all, besides acting as a vertical storage space for whatever you might fit inside. However, the structure itself seems to be absolutely saturated with Ulgu, to the point that without your seeking it, the tower becomes insubstantial, fading from reality entirely. Whenever you deign to locate it, it is precisely where you need it to be. Whenever you do not need to access it, it simply does not exist at all. This trait extends to anything you store inside, but only so long as it is stored inside. Do be careful if you intend to build anything around a core that exists less often than that which is attached to it.
"
1650,,600,Henge ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Domain,"You now know the location of a powerful artifact. This ancient circle of Waystones focuses the power of Ghyran to a startling extent. As overgrown with vines as the stones are, the ages will not fell them. More than that, the growth of plant and animal life near the henge is accelerated and improved, causing even barren wastelands to become lush and fertile. This ogham, and the small grove it sits in, is now under your protection. Do not be surprised if this circle begins to spread life outward from itself in even the most blasted lands.
"
1651,,600,Pyramid Vault ,Warhammer Fantasy: Imperial Colleges of Magic,Domain,"Hello, warden. This pyramid is quite special, you see. Staffed by an entire choir of Apprentices and laden with heavy spells of Hysh, this pyramid is a smaller replica of the very structure of your home College. It has but one purpose: to focus the Wind of Light and trap a horrifying power. The Daemon locked within the deepest chamber of this pyramid is guaranteed not to escape without aid. Such a horror may provide useful information while imprisoned. You will find soon enough, especially as the prison follows you, that the trapped Daemon is somewhat versed in the weaknesses of whatever Daemons you may face in your time here. You will also notice an empty cell next to it. This cell will adapt itself to contain any extradimensional entity you defeat and seal within, and it will in turn be compelled to volunteer you information useful in fighting others of its kind. For each Daemon or similar creature you trap, a new cell will open.
"
1652,,600,Eternal Library ,Warhammer Fantasy: Warriors of Chaos,Domain,"Over the course of your life, you will learn so much of magic that it will become utterly impossible for a mortal to fully comprehend the extent of your mind, but with this warehouse attachment you might be able to help others stick their toes into the sea of your knowledge. This massive library can be access by a door in your warehouse that will automatically add books written from your magical knowledge. You could find absolutely every single magical technique you know somewhere in this library, and the library will keep expanding in size to accommodate your swelling intellect. The library will keep expanding and the books will come into existence with no upper limit, meaning that over the course of your adventures this could become the most complete source of magic knowledge in all of the multiverse.
"
1653,,600,Jumper’s Tower of Sorcery ,Warhammer Fantasy: High Elves,Domain,"It’s one thing to seek knowledge alone, another entirely to seek it in concert. Consider this Tower the home of your disciples, your eager acolytes in the matters of the arcane. These ‘acolytes’ cannot leave the Tower, but are provided with more than ample space for all manner of magical research: Laboratories, Libraries with fundamentally infinite space, Alchemy equipment, etc. The structure, like the Tower of Hoeth, is impossible to approach by foot, by all save you. In future Jumps where magic is present, your Tower, and by extension your acolytes, will receive a complimentary ‘download’ of all common magical theory of the new world so they can begin advancing immediately.

1654,,600,Link Between Worlds ,Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds,Domain,"“Yuga discovered that there was a strange crack in this grim slate... Through it, we could sense that there was another world beyond ours...”

Here and in future worlds which involve either a multiverse, alternate dimensions or alternate timelines, you’ll now be able to regularly find fissures in reality, purple tears in space visible only to you and your allies. By stepping into a fissure, you will be transported to an alternate world, dimension or timeline as appropriate. You won’t be able to choose where these portals take you, but their location and destination remains constant, so it should be relatively easy to map out your own routes across the multiverse with enough time and a bit of trial and error.
"
1655,,600,Royal Jewels ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventure,Domain,"Ah, what treasures you have gained, Jumper! In your hands are the Royal Jewels of Hyrule, powerful magical artifacts passed down for centuries, guarded faithfully by the Knights of Hyrule. In the modern time, these gems possess the power to open the way to the Realm of the Heavens, where Vaati and Ganon await, normally beyond the reach of mere mortals. In a similar way, these jewels may form portals or gates to places that might otherwise be beyond your reach, though doing so will expend their magic. This also allows you to bypass barriers that block off locations as well, in case your enemy has blocked the way. But that is not all they can do. For once upon a time, these jewels were known as the Elements, physical embodiments of earth, wind, fire, and water. With these, the broken Picori Blade was transformed into the legendary Four Sword, a magic blade that could rival the divine Master Sword. You may do the same now, uplifting a blade with only a minor enchantment into something demon kings would fear. No matter what you use it for, the magic within them will recharge upon your next jump, or in ten years time if you’re in a longer lasting jump.
"
1656,,600,Palace of Winds ,Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventure,Domain,"The Palace of Winds, Vaati’s Palace. The name has changed a bit over the years, but this is the throne from where Vaati once tried to extract the Light Force from Princess Zelda and achieve ultimate power. Built in ages past by the Wind Tribe to hold one of their artifacts, the Element of Wind, before being taken over by the Mage of Wind, Vaati. Can you sense the theme here yet? Either way, it’s a cross between an opulent palace and a veritable fortress, all floating high above the clouds. Hidden away in its depths is everything the land of Hyrule has to offer on wind magic, as well as tomes describing everything you know about the wind - I’m certain the second is larger. As with the Demon of the Winds perk, you don’t actually have to make this place wind themed, though I do insist that they match elements. No fire powers in an underwater base please. As an added benefit, this place will actually amplify any magics that match it’s element, and suppress any from your foes."
1657,,600,Great Fairy Fountain ,Hyrule Warriors,Domain,"The Great Fairy Fountain appears as a large, stone structure resembling a temple with a vaulted ceiling, magic circle on the floor, and a single, large room. 

Beyond the heavy double doors, in the back of the great room inside, is a pool of crystal clear water that sparkles in the light streaming through the stained-glass window behind it. 

By praying at the magic circle, you may summon a Great Fairy that lives invisibly within the sparkling waters. Request what you will of her, if she likes you she’ll use her incredible magic to aid you in an incredible show of force, though only once a day. 

The Great Fairy could blow away a thousand enemies by dropping a gestalt of bombs, fabricate a copy of Hyrule’s moon just to smash its nose into a dragon or conjure pumpkin soup into existence that could reinvigorate a god like Levias. Fairies are fickle however, so the exact way she helps might vary. 

The Great Fairy Fountain becomes a warehouse attachment post-jump, or may be placed as a structure within future worlds if desired.
"
1658,,600,The Moon ,Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask,Domain,"I... I’m sorry, what? You what now? Why would you ever need this? Fine, allow me to introduce you to one of my three best friends, Mr Johnson, also known as the moon of Termina. He’s... not really happy with the current state of affairs, so maybe if you did something about that? Well, anyways, as you might imagine you now have your own moon and the ability to call that moon down onto the planet. You monster. ALSO, because you might not use that if he has another use, the moon also contains a small dungeon/pocket dimension inside of himself. A nearly endless field with a single tree in the center. Near the tree are four odd children, which seem to map out to any mental issue you may or may not have. Playing with them will make those issues better, a balm on your soul or something like that.
"
1659,,600,Great Fairy Fountain ,Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,Domain,"This hidden underground cavern that will appear in every world from here on out is the home of the powerful magical beings, the Great Fairies - you have their loyalty now and while they may be able to grant you a few boons if you’ve shown yourself worthy they will always freely restore your stamina and heal you fully if you arrive here. The fountain’s water is crisp and refreshing as well, and the Fairies beyond their magical assistance are very helpful, willing to address any need you have within their power - though they remain very much rooted to this secret place."
1660,,600,Hall of Essence ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages,Domain,"If the Magic Potion heals the body, then this is for healing the mind and the soul. You are now the proud owner of a key. The key leads to a dungeon of sorts, much like the Halls of Essence that Link will be making his way through. At the end of the trials it will present you with - and yes, you have to make your way through it’s puzzles and thankfully non-evil guardians - lies a ninth Essence of Time. Presenting this essence to someone will heal any damage to their mind or soul. If nothing else, it can be used as a fountain of youth knockoff, but that's a rather inefficient use of such a powerful object."
1661,,600,Harp of Ages ,Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages,Domain,"Nayru’s own harp, one that should have been left at home before being found by Link. Maybe you have another, maybe there’s time shenanigans. Probably time shenanigans. Regardless, you have what amounts to the Harp of Ages. More importantly, it’s been handed to you along with its third song, the Tune of Ages, something that allows you to freely travel between the two Eras of Labrynna. The harp... doesn’t actually do small scale travel very well. Regardless, it also acts as a massive amplifier for time based magic, and it is capable of following the paths made by other travelers. Please use this harp responsibly Jumper, you wouldn’t want to be like Veran would you?
"
1662,,600,Silent Realm ,Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword,Domain,"In each of the three provinces below the clouds, and on the isle of Skyloft, there exist a total of four hidden dais, each opening a portal into a silent echo of their respective areas. While inside this realm, you have no gear, no weapons, no defenses but your wit and your legs. To make matters worse, there are watchers and guardians in this place, ones that will will happily hunt you down and shatter your spirit. Somewhat literally, since you’re here in spirit and not body. Don’t worry too much, getting caught only kicks you out. That said, you only get one shot per area, so do be careful. In the event that you win, each realm will cough up an item, weapon, piece of gear, or perhaps even a simple spell that will allow you to push past your limits somehow. Maybe literally, in the event that it gives you something that increases your strength, or maybe more metaphorically, giving you an item to help explore a new area. For now there’s only four areas, though later jumps may have more or less depending on the world.
"
1663,,600,Spirit Tracks ,Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks,Domain,"Ah, here we are. The name of the game, the biggest of the macguffins, and the chains that hold down Malladus. I’m not joking about that, by the way. The Spirit Tracks are a single massive sealing system meant to hold the demon king behind his seal and even serve to prevent the demons of the Dark Realm from attempting to cross over into New Hyrule. Mostly. Weak things can still slip through the cracks, as always. But I digress. This country wide set of train tracks can be imported into future jumps in the ‘was always there’ variety, or in any other fashion you prefer, such as having been built manually or flat out falling out of the sky. Once they’re in place, simply power them up and seal away any evil beings that think to test you.
"
1664,,600,Cave of Ordeals ,Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess,Domain,"A dungeon that goes deep into the earth, and features fifty floors worth of enemies. For every ten floors that are cleared, the Great Fairy will make something good happen in the world- it won’t be anything too major, or violent in nature, but it will be something positive that will also benefit you. After clearing the last floor the Great Fairy will appear to you and perform a bigger miracle, as a reward for your actions. The dungeon can be cleared multiple times, but subsequent runs will simply result in the Great Fairy rewarding you with her tears- although she will do so even if you already possess some, for what it’s worth."
1665,,600,Skeleton Key ,The Elder Scrolls,Domain,"A Daedric Artifact of Nocturnal, Daedric Prince of Night and Darkness, this key is her most well known and sought after artifact. The Skeleton Key can open any lock, be it mundane or magical. You can also use it to relock stuff once you're done."
1666,,600,Crafting Shop ,Danmachi,Domain,"A fully fitted and supplied alchemist laboratory and forge along with it having the highest quality supplies and equipment required to make magical potions to weapons and armors up to magical equipment. The equipment will automatically upgrade itself relative to your own personal skill level, so the more skilled you are the better it will be to reflect that. Anything that you made can be magically created by the shop up to your level using the ingredients that you stored inside of the shop giving you an ever restocking item to sell as long as you have the ingredients for it and gain a steady income every month. After this jump it will merge with your warehouse or will appear in the new world in the nearest town to your starting point."
1667,,600,Flipped Cleansing Pool ,Genshin Impact,Domain,"Located deep within the Chasm of Liyue, buried beneath miles of rock and dirt, lies the ancient ruins of long gone civilisation. At the centre of this ruin is a sparkling and serene pool of water. There are two strange yet fantastical things about this pool. The first and most obvious is that it is upside down. The entire thing is located on the ceiling yet the water does not drop in an act of defiance against gravity. The second fantastical fact about this pool is that it has a potent cleansing effect. Just being near this pool is enough to allay most corruptions or curses. Only a curse at the level as cast by the Gods would resist this effect. Curiously this particular pool is surrounded by several devices of Abyss design. When activated, they will amplify the cleansing effect a hundredfold. You can choose where you wish for this pool to be located in future jumps."
1668,,600,World Traveler,Genshin Impact,Domain,"As a Jumper you are one who crosses the Celestial Atlas’. You hop from world to world, wander between universes. Some of that power has rubbed off on you, gifting you a modicum of control over your ability to travel between cosmos. You can find certain paths through the worlds that allow you to cross from the border of one to another. While the bridge between jumps is too great for you to cross by yourself, you will find that ‘closer’ worlds are still within the realms of your ability."
1669,,600,Last Stop Shop ,Konosuba,Domain,"Not every Boss of the demon army is an active general. Indeed, it even suits the Demon King better that some of them stay isolated, safe and unassuming to the adventurers that seek to take them out. You’ve been given a shop to run instead of your normal duties, a shop that reflects the disconnect your superiors have with the normal world. See, your shop is set in the starting town of this world where many adventurers first appear and yet it is filled to the brim with end game equipment. While the truly powerful and unique artifacts won’t be found for sale here, stuff fit for legendary heroes or the greatest warriors in the world is still commonplace. A level 100 warrior or wizard who visited your store would find it more than adequate...even if none of the low level heroes around you can afford or even use your wares. You’d never sink so low as to take advantage of all this powerful, rare equipment for yourself though....would you? The shop will continue to appear in future worlds, carrying high level equipment for each setting in its stock."
1670,,700,High-Rise Apartment Building,Chainsaw Man,Domain,"A twenty story apartment building combining various effects seen throughout Chainsaw Man. It has enough staff to keep everything running in tip-top shape with all profits going straight to you. Underground is a well-stocked room for your use, a base for criminal operations, and most notably a secured floor filled with zombies. There are 100 zombies that all follow your basic commands and are loyal to you alone for some reason despite being creations of the Zombie Devil (whom you can take as a companion for free). You can optionally send the corpses of mundane humanoids you’ve killed or encountered here to be made into additional fiat-backed zombies. The maximum amount is but the room automatically expands to account for as many as you have up to 10,000 and they don’t require any sustenance and are surprisingly clean. For an additional 100cp undiscounted you can take the Eternity Devil as a loyal companion bound to this property. If someone breaks a rule you create within this property or enters without your permission, they will be held in a pocket dimension that is nearly impossible to escape from without powerful dimensional abilities. This pocket dimension takes the form of a copy of the floor they were on wherein electricity and plumbing function but leaving the floor through any means places you right back on the other side you left from. You can freely enter and exit this dimension (when within the building) and any changes made within will be retained separately from the actual property. The Eternity Devil will patrol the grounds and deal with intruders at your discretion, optionally taking command of the zombies you collect to aid in this."
1671,,700,Demonreach ,Dresden Files,Domain,"There were once monsters that lurked in the dark. There still are, but what’s out there now pales in comparison to what humanity has already won against.

Old Gods, Titans, Demons and devils, abominations from the depths of the Nevernever and half-breed creations of mortals and immortals. Things of myth and folklore, of nightmares become real. These are the things that taught humanity to fear the dark. 

Until they were defeated, anyway. Heroes, wizards, knights, saints and gods across the years beat and bound these beings, and as a result humanity was able to grow. But many of these beings are immortal and therefore would need to be contained, not killed. 

That’s where this place comes into being. Demonreach is an unmarked, unknown island in Lake Michigan. This might be that, or a different, similar facility. 

That is, this is a prison full of the worst monsters, abominations, demons, dark gods and nightmares you can possibly imagine. Flip through any mythological book and list the demons in it, and odds are there’d be at least a few of them among the inmates. Six Naagloshi, horrific, monstrous beings that it takes nukes to kill for sure are just the least important of its prisoners.

And now you happen to be its… Warden, Owner, controller… something. Whatever it is that you are, you have control over the island and the prison, having performed the Sanctum Invocation… or having the link anyway somehow. The Genius Loci controlling both the prison and the island answers to you, and you have full access to its Intellectus covering the island and prison, and every aspect of both.

You can order the Genius Loci to raise or lower the defenses, make changes or improvements, or command it to take in new prisoners, which it can do from rather significant distances away, actually. 

You can even make it release its prisoners, if for some godforsaken reason you happen to want to."
1672,,800,Adamantine Forge ,Baldur's Gate 3,Domain,"The legendary forge built by the folk of the deep is in your possession jumper. You have access to a massive smithery that is installed in an enormous cavern room.

This smithery has giant mechanisms and multiple pipes that provide lava flow working the place. Within the center is a giant piston-like hammer that can mold an object to any shape or blueprint you want with just a single strike. You need only to provide the mold for it and materials to it. Hammer itself is magical and can even place enchantments, provided in the blueprints, in these items too.

Speaking of molds, you get an array of various blueprints in the shape of weapon and armor molds that can be used to create extremely well-designed equipment. You get an assembly plant that can be used to create your own custom molds too.

However, the true value of this place stems from the fact that it can work with adamantine. This magical metal is an incredibly strong alloy that can stand extreme heat and trauma. Anyone who uses equipment made of this metal will find it extremely more effective than usual items of similar craftsmanship. Adamantine also conducts magic extremely well, making it very suitable for enchanting. You get a supply of adamantine in the form of mithril ore veins, which can be processed to create these items. You get enough adamantine to create five normal sized items of your choice once you receive this item and get the same amount again at the end of each year as well.

If you are worried about the safety of this forge, your worries are totally unfounded. Within this forge rests an adamantine golem of immense power. Its blows can topple pillars and its fire breath can melt down steel. It is virtually invincible to all kinds of damage and can only be harmed, if it is superheated. It can only work within this forge though and it goes into stasis if taken out in to the world.

Only way to access this place, other than digging the packed earth and stonework, is by following the secret passages that go deep underground. Don’t worry these passages are well hidden and takes a lot of effort to find. You can find these passages anywhere in the world and they seem to magically shorten the distance traveled to this place. At the start of your each jump, you will be given a choice to either attach this place to your warehouse or place this forge into somewhere deep underground within the world."
1673,,800,Arcane Tower,Baldur's Gate 3,Domain,"You gain the administrative rights to a very powerful magical tower. This tower closely resembles that of the famous Ramazith’s Tower, but its design and style can be changed at your whim. It has got multiple floors with teleportation circles you can travel between them and various other utilities.

This tower is a trove of magical knowledge. Any world you are currently in and any world you’ll visit in the future, will have their magical knowledge and arcane history recorded within the giant library of this mage’s tower. Common and uncommon knowledge are simply copied to the library, while rare and forbidden ones may take couple years to get acquired. This includes spells, rituals, notes on magical artifacts, enchantment and potion recipes and many more things that are related to magic.

This tower is magically protected with various arcane locks and magical glyphs that explode or restrain any intruders. You get a squadron of automatons patrolling the house and at the same time acting as servants. If you want to protect your loot or your artifacts, this house has a magical basement that has a labyrinthine protection mechanism with multiple traps that are very hard to decipher.

Any enemies that try to assail this tower will find that it has strong arcane turrets that have endless battery firing at them. Also, at any time you want, you can call up a magical bombardment from the roof of this house. It will open a portal to a location within your line sight from the house and fire its arcane turrets there. This volley is strong enough to devastate an area at the size of a city district. After you call the bombardment, it goes into a week-long cooldown before you can use it again. Turrets still remain active during this period though.

At any time, you can open a stationary portal to this tower from your current location and may open a portal back to return to your previous location. At the start of the jump, you can decide to place this tower on a safe location within the jump world or keep it in a demiplane attached to your warehouse. No one will find out strange that a magical tower has appeared out of nowhere and will act as if it has always been there. If you want, you can hide the tower’s magical nature too."
1674,,800,House of the Damned        ,Baldur's Gate 3,Domain,"You are the proud owner of an accursed residence that seem to be located in a land of fire and smoke that very closely resembles Avernus, the First of the Nine Hells of Baator. In fact, your residence is located in Avernus. Don’t worry about any devils or demons infiltrating it though, you got some protections installed.

Design and architecture of your manor is heavily inspired by Raphael’s House of Hope (don’t let him know) but it is up for renovations, if victorian infernal style is not to your taste. It is located in a cliff face that overlooks a ravine that littered with fiery pits and rivers. You have imps and other lesser devils in the house, working as servants. They number in dozens, and they are completely loyal and devoted to you. But you cannot take any of them out of the house.

Only people you designate can go in and out of this residence and its location is far from frontlines of the Blood War. So, no demons barging in through your front door. Only way to go in and out of this house is via portals or teleportation.

Speaking of portals, you got a portal room in the house that can open up a portal to any location you are vaguely familiar with in the material plane of your current jump’s main world. This doesn’t allow you to appear in any indoor or private locations though. Other facilities provided by the house are also useful (in most cases) and quite luxurious. You got multiple feasting halls and relief chambers along with lovely balconies and terraces. You have access to a private boudoir that contains a rejuvenation spring that can make you as good as new just with an hour of rest along with a shapeshifting succubus/incubus that can entertain you or your guests. An archive will be provided, if you want to display your justly earned artifacts (don’t worry the archives are fully trapped in the case of intruders). Basement of the manor also acts as a minor prison complex that hangs from the bottom of your house overlooking the ravine and has two spectators guarding it along with armed imps. Finally, you get a collection of four soul pillars that contain the souls of thousands of damned (don’t worry they deserve such punishment and they are mostly non-sentient at this point) that can be used to boost your powers to a ridiculous degree, when you are standing near them.

If you are still worried about intruders even after having a cadre of devils and magical protections guarding your house, with just a thought you can summon semi-sentient flaming boulders that will try to immolate and crush any intruders at your behest. Oh, and any attempts at divination targeting the people in the house will simply fail, if that is your desire.

Occasionally dead or lost souls can wander into your house to make deals, if you allow them that is.

You can teleport yourself and any people you like in and out of this house as many times as you want with a simple gesture. Post-jump this house will be relocated to a hell-like pocket plane, or it can be attached to your warehouse."
1675,,800,Nautiloid Vessel ,Baldur's Gate 3,Domain,"How in the nine hells did you hijack this vessel jumper? You are now in the possession of one of the strongest vessels that was ever created in the history of the Realms.

Don’t let its conch-like shell and tentacled look deceive you, this is thing truly awesome. This ancient illithid ship can propel itself through sky and void both with pure psychic energy. It is around 50 meters long and 10 meters wide with a cargo capacity of 17 tons. It has protection against all elements of both space and void and has an infinite air supply with its own gravity. Normally it is manned by 10 to 15 illithids but that is not the case for you. You can issue commands to it telepathically and it is more than capable of defending and piloting itself. Oh, it is semi-sentient alright, being more of a living being than a ship.

Its shell-like carapace is impervious to all but the mightiest attacks. It even boasts a strong magical resistance. If the hull armor wasn’t enough already, this thing can put up psychic shields to defend itself against all external attacks, and boy it can take a lot of punishment before needing to recharge for a brief moment. It can also psychically cloak itself to avoid any sensors and detection attempts, when not in active combat.

You have multiple offensive options. Four great tentacles that extend dozens of meters are attached to the ship’s hull. They can be used for teleporting living beings (no large than an auroch) they touch into stasis chambers of the ship and immediately incapacitate them. Tentacles themselves are also devastating bludgeoning weapons that can knock down large towers. A dozen heavyweight psychic cannons decorate the deck and are capable of raining magical devastation that can knock out adult dragons from the sky.

Inside of the ship is filled with illithid bio-tech. You have stasis pods, bio-computers, incubation chambers for tadpoles (currently empty), a brine pool for an elder brain (also empty), ceremorphosis accelerators, mind domination and thrall making devices, operation units for intellect devourer creation, restoration apparatus and relief chambers. The ship also has a transponder within the helm that can be used for planar travel within your local multiverse. Post-jump this encompasses all of creation.

The ship repairs itself over time and is self-maintaining. It doesn’t need any fuel to move, and it can continue voyaging endlessly. If destroyed completely, it appears back in your care in the next jump you go to.

When you don’t need it, the ship docks itself within a harmless pocket plane. You can mentally summon the ship to the sky with a gigantic portal created by the transponder."
1676,,800,Halls of the Dead,The Silmarillion,Domain,"It is said that the spirits of dead elves are summoned to the West by Mandos, where they gather in his halls to contemplate their lives, and eventually be re-embodied in Valinor, once they have come to terms with whatever sorrows, pains and traumas were inflicted upon them. The spirits of men go there as well, though they linger only for a short while before passing beyond the circles of the world to whatever awaits them, and the dwarves hold that Mahal maintains sections of the Halls for them, where their spirits await the ending of the world, so that they can aid in the building of the new one.

You possess an imitation of the Halls of the Dead, a place hidden away (perhaps in your warehouse, perhaps beneath the earth) and to which you can summon the spirits of any who owe you fealty, or have consented to be brought there. Such spirits can linger indefinitely in the Halls and maintain their cognisance and integrity, interacting with objects there as if they were physical, no matter their normal state. They remain themselves and cannot be destroyed, though they may be traumatised or otherwise psychologically harmed. The Halls will always be large enough to contain any number of spirits brought there.

Furthermore, at the heart of the Halls is a great throne. When you sit upon this, your ability to use Sanwe-Latya is vastly enhanced, specifically with regards to bodiless spirits, as are any other magical powers you possess which deal with such houseless spirits. While sitting upon this throne you could contact spirits across the world to speak with them and guide them, see the heart and true intentions of a spirit brought before your throne. You are, in short, the very image of a keeper of the dead. Finally, while seated upon this throne, you may cause a willing spirit which comes before you to either pass on and leave the world, free from any curse or confinement which might prevent it from doing, or to be reborn and given a new body, with or without memory of its previous life, or regaining such memory at some particular point, at your choosing. By default this happens via the spirit entering a newborn infant, but if you have some means to produce soulless bodies you could reincarnate a spirit into such a vessel instead."
1677,,800,Vision of Primordial Spring,The Silmarillion,Domain,"It is said that in the spring of Arda, when the world was lit as it were a changeless day by the lamps Illuin and Ormal, Yavanna first brought forth the fruits of her thought. There were trees in those days which grew like living mountains, cloud-crowned with their feet deep in a green twilight of their own making. Those days are vanished and gone - but in you there lives a memory which can be brought forth once more.

At your will, lands you cultivate grow strong and swiftly, plants bursting forth eagerly from the soil at twice the rate elsewhere, with no greater need for nutrients or water. This is but the least of your gifts, however. Under your care, plants of all kinds evoke a memorial of those early days in the spring of Arda, growing five or more times their normal size. This growth is more than physical, though. Lands you cause to flourish in this manner grow strong in spirit as well; they are greatly more resilient to corruption and desecration of all kinds, while animal denizens grow larger, stronger and wiser as well. Herbs and plants are more potent, fruits and crops more fulfilling, and any magical crafts which take advantage of them find their results increased as well.

Finally, though, there is the change in you yourself. These bountiful lands nourish you as much as you nourish them. While within these lands, your resilience to injury, disease, poisons and other harms is greatly increased, your stamina and endurance becomes to all intents and purposes infinite, and your strength is magnified twice over. These benefits linger to an extent while outside of these lands, but fade over time; within a week or so the benefits will be lost until you return, whereupon they return at approximately twice the rate.

If you are an ent and take this perk, your ent-form will grow in size regardless of whether or not you are within a flourishing land; you could grow up to six metres tall (twenty feet or so)."
1678,,800,Tyr’s Divine Arena ,Valkyrie Anatomia,Domain,"For an Einherjar, the most important of skills is that of combat, whether personal or mass combat, magical or martial. There is, however, only so much one may learn in a training room – after a point, it is necessary to enter the battlefield. At least, it would be. This arena, created in the honour of Tyr for the usage of all who side with the Aesir is now yours. It allows you to face off against foe of all kinds in a safe, protected environment. Within the walls of the arena, you will suffer neither death nor pain, though phantom injuries may still occur, inhibiting your movements. Neither still may the walls of the arena be shattered – you may use whatever powers you wish here without collateral damage. Most importantly however, you may fight any enemy which a person stepping into this arena has encountered and face them at their fullest strength, or even those people themselves. Even were you unaware of the existence of these people or creatures, so long as another had faced them and at some point stepped foot within these walls, you too could fight them. There is no limit as to how many enemies you may face, with the arena seeming to change size to accommodate, though the external size will not change."
1679,,800,Godless Dominion,Valkyrie Anatomia,Domain,"Many stand above others in the world, and those who do tend to have some way or another of showing off their splendour. Now you too have a suitable means of displaying your magnificence. You now have access to a relatively large building or estate tied to a large portion of land, one roughly the size of a large province or a small country, which, while not so grand that it will seem out of place, will be perfectly suited to the performance of any mundane tasks you may desire, and, while not initially staffed, will easily draw skilled workers or staff to it. It will always have more than enough room for anything you might desire, from guests to money to food. People who become aware of it will quickly develop a respect for you as the skilled owner of such an abode and it has some rather fertile farmland attached to it. Finally, there are a number of devices near the outskirts of it, preventing monsters and Gods. Every month, a safe will provide any earnings from businesses you own or deals you make directly, as well as enough money to pay for a sizeable household staff. Strangely, there never seem to be any attacks by bandits or monsters. So long as you remain a neutral party you will never need worry about harm to this area."
1680,,800,Aura of the King,Bleach,Domain,"A Fullbring, impressive as it is, is nothing but a distraction. They are not the culmination of the power of the Fullbringer, anymore than a Bankai is the sum of what any Shinigami can reach. It is their most basic function, to command souls, wherein lies their greatest power. All things in these worlds have souls or are made of souls. A common Fullbringer could command the air soul to move at high speed with Bringer Light or move small objects with telekinesis by moving that objects’ soul. But to take it further, larger, greater. To command a falling castle the size of a city to hold itself aloft in the air, to heal any wound or sickness by banishing the soul of the wound or commanding an injured spirit to rejoin, even to counter the greatest of Hado spells with the souls of fire and earth twisted into dragon-form. 

Not all Fullbringers could reach this potential. Only those with a powerful fragment of the King, like a large portion of his Soul Chain as you and one other have, can take it so far. But now the power and potential is yours. By expending your own spiritual energy, you can command the spirits around you to act to your will. Almost anything becomes possible through this. Effects that might require a Kido master among Shinigami take a wave of the hand, a thought and power from you. Souls with a mind of their own, like other living beings, can attempt to resist with their own energy. It’s often much easier to crush them from without, turning the skies and seas and lands against them with terrible force. 

The Spirit King organ inside of you has greatly increased the raw Reiryoku you have access to. You have roughly twice as much as the average Captain, similar to Aizen Sosuke at the time of his betrayal to Soul Society. Your training in the acts above is significant, enough to match the original wielder of this power in two or three years of training. Aura Michibane’s feats above are impressive but you still have the ability to destroy, change and repair much of the world around you. It is the finer actions, like making yourself insubstantial or turning ordinary Plus souls into powerful hollow warriors, that will take practice."
1681,,800,Limitless,Jujutsu Kaisen V2.5,Domain,"The divine technique of the Limitless is the ability to manipulate space itself. Although the cost is great, you are going to be able to manipulate not just space but also the divergence and convergence of such things. Convergence in the way of Cursed Technique Lapse: Blue. Where one brings negative distance into existence and space itself is forced to try to fill in the space. But where this converges Cursed Technique Reversal: Red is the divergence of such a thing. It brings in the divergence of infinity into reality causing a powerful repelling force to come into existence. But the greatest technique known only by a few in the Gojo family is Hollow Technique: Purple. Combining both red and blue It represents motion and reversal, a fusion of convergence and divergence that collides both infinites to generate an imaginary mass. The effect takes the target out of reality, instantly erasing everything the technique hits without exception. For it makes a series that both converges and diverges. This is a contradiction that allows him to do the impossible in the case, deleting matter altogether. Only problem is it is nigh impossible to use as the technique would put far too much strain on a normal human to even attempt. You would need a brain capable of processing such a thing. But where could you ever find such a thing?"
1682,,800,Knowledge of Freedom ,Shin Megami Tensei V,Domain,"The imprisonment of this World runs deep into its very core, at the hands of the spatial governing phenomenon known as the “Mandala System”. Lucifer himself has long since longed to be free of its constraints and finally found a way. Now you too have this gift. No matter how absolute a restraint, a prison or a limitation may be binding you to some confines, you WILL find a way to free yourself from it. Being put into bindings, restrictions someone put to nullify your powers, being locked inside a system of Multiversal will... you will always find a way as long as you desire to be free."
1683,,800,Private Island,Marvel: Age of Krakoa,Domain,"Krakoa itself has been cloned and reproduced and now you have your own personal mini-Krakoa. As a bonus, your Benefactor will cover the bare minimum psychic energy to keep it alive and healthy. Your Krakoa junior is rather on the small side by private island standards but will grow over time as it feeds on the ambient psychic energy of any beings living on it. Yours has all the potential benefits of Krakoan flora, is more than accommodating, and will let you establish Krakoan Gates of your own wherever you want, with all your properties having one for free. Any gates placed on a fiat-baked location or property are permanent but anything else becomes inaccessible until post-chain. You may optionally have an island derived from Arakko instead."
1684,,800,Manifold,Marvel: Age of Krakoa,Domain,"This power could easily be confused for spatial manipulation or teleportation, but that’s not quite right... You see, you’re friends with the Universe. And you can communicate with the Universe. While this does allow for the sorts of abilities you would expect to see from a powerful space-warper, like teleporting yourself and others across cosmic distances, opening portals between two points in space, or folding space to contain or immobilize something, it also includes more subtle aspects like always knowing exactly where you are in the universe or turning invisible as well as more blatant things like being able to hold a miniature sun in the palm of your hand. This is an absurdly potent ability, but it has one hard limit: You’re friends with the universe. This means that this power fails to work in other universes. By default this power treats the universe you start in during a given Jump, and any attached realms that are considered part of the same reality, as “your” universe but transportation to another universe or an unattached realm will leave you unable to access any of these abilities. Once your chain has ended, regardless of how it ends, this power will function in any universe that it has previously should you have some means of returning to them and, Post-Spark, treats the entire Omniverse as your Native Universe."
1685,,800,Slice of Hell/Heaven,Hazbin Hotel,Domain,"Quite ambitious aren't we? Having many plans and dreams in store for an entire dimension to call your own? Within your possession is a small dimensional plane, roughly the size of a city block to begin with, that is under your jurisdiction. You can use it to store Souls you have claim to or collect and it starts with a few dozen weak souls already inside. Additionally any property you own now counts as part of your personal Hell/Heaven.

There is one final benefit to this property. Maybe you noticed that the musical numbers of Adam, Charlie and Lucifer are particularly incredible. Interestingly this is only in Heavens embassy on Hell for the former or Hell itself for the later two respectively. You now have a certain control over the reality inside of your properties, able to say make entire environments on a whim. With lots of practice and the more powerful you become the more this will be potent though affecting those beyond you even inside of here is still a fool's errand. 

You can freely decide where your Hell/Heaven is located, if it is attached to your Warehouse or a place in the Jumps cosmology."
1686,,800,A Construct In Miniature ,Slay the Princess,Domain,"Here it is, the cabin in the woods, or at least, that's what it appears like to you. It is the heart of this...’construct’ you may call it, infinite in all ways that matter - infinite realities contained by infinite edges and defined only by the power of the Long Quiet that contains and shapes it. Or well, a more limited version of that - perhaps not infinite in totality, but simply arbitrarily large. The perfect prison for a God. If you want, you may stay here - use it as a second home, experiment with all the variables and the possibilities that functionally countless realities can provide to you, or maybe you just want to throw in powerful undesirables in here - that's fine too. Won't help us slay the Princess whatsoever, but that's just the way things turn out sometimes. ...Or maybe, maybe you just want some place to be free from consequences. I know I wouldn't mind that.

Ultimately though, it's up to you what you choose to do with the Construct. For good or for ill. I certainly cannot stop you."
1687,,800,Limitless Construct,Slay the Princess,Domain,"And so here we are, another shattered mirror that has grown to repeat the same process. The creation of a ‘construct’, a...thing born of enclosing our will against the twisting multitude of the dimly noticed shapes amidst the flow of absolute reality. It is both prison and home - a vast design that encloses an infinite series of worlds within its boundary of infinite edges and sides. Anything placed within the Construct is subject to the laws that govern it, subject to moments stretched onto eternity, an end to the ceaseless mandate of endings. To die within this construct is merely to be sent to another world within it, over and over and over - a true ending is beyond reach for as long as you exist inside its boundaries. 

But you are not the Creator, that man I once was - nor am I. We cannot make a thing so great that it can defy even Gods, as unfortunate as that is. This construct is not powerful enough to bind even a diminished deity, and would shatter like glass in the unfortunate event that you tried to do so."
1688,,800,The Hotel,Hotel Transylvania,Domain,"Not sure how you did it but you are now the owner of a hotel like Hotel Transylvania… On a much smaller scale... Think going from a massive 5 star hotel resort to a good sized 3 and a half star hotel. This hotel can be toggled to draw in various non-human creatures to spend time and relax on vacation and forget their worries. The hotel functions in an area of no conflict and as such it is impossible to fight or kill a guest while on the property. You can still harm each other, though only inside a designated sparring area if you have one.

If you are willing to shell out another 400 CP though you can instead upgrade it to a full 5 star hotel with any and all amenities and activities you can imagine and stocked with the best chefs available and incredibly hard working and loyal staff. Anyone who stays will always find something to their liking and there will always be room for paying guests no matter how many there are."
1689,,800,Corpses Are Talking,Chainsaw Man,Domain,"You are probably closer to being a reaper than the Death Devil given your talent in the art of taking lives. You’re an expert at sneaking around in and out of plain sight, parkour, disguising, and so on but you’re more built for the “kill everyone and escape before anyone notices” route. You’re fast enough to run circles around those who took the Hero of Hell option below and strong enough to compete with high-tier devils. You pretty much ignore the effects of friction when you break into a sprint. Your perception and reactions scale off of your movement speed to ensure you can always act efficiently no matter how ridiculously fast you’re going, and any damage and fatigue that would occur as a result of your speed is massively reduced. You have a unique, self-designed martial art that perfectly incorporates your superhuman attributes (but not powers, yet). Finally, any enemy you could defeat with overwhelming odds (at least 95-5) given a minute or two is automatically sliced to death at no cost or cooldown when you activate this ability within a few meters of them."
1690,,800,Jumpveria,Marvel Magic,Domain,"What? You've never heard of it before? What do you– ...huh. Come to think of it, I haven't either. There's proper documentation for it and there are brief mentions of it in recent history, but it doesn't seem like anyone has ever actually heard of it. The place simply seems to have... shown up one day, filled with people and its own history – much like yourself. How curious.

In any case, – due to either some unexplained series of events or an incredibly unlikely inheritance – you are now the ruler of a small, and somewhat rural but quickly developing, country. Located in a place of your choosing, so long as it is out of the way. Perhaps it's a small slice of Europe or South America. Whatever the case, there is a population in this country, numbering in the hundreds of thousands and all of them admire you greatly and hold great loyalty and patriotism. You wield absolute power and have final say in all matters and so long as you do not blatantly abuse your people, they will continue to hold love for you. The majority culture and belief held by your people is largely up to you, though there will be as much variance as you'd expect. Most of your country is rural, but large population centers are likely fairly developed and luxurious, comparable to most first world cities.

This also comes with a bevy of benefits and advantages you'd expect from being the monarch of a country. In addition to the natural resources and manpower you'll have access to, there is no small amount of money you will be able to spend as you wish – though be mindful that spending it too recklessly may be harmful to your country and people. You will also wield diplomatic immunity in most other countries so, though this can only be pushed so far.

This will follow you in future jumps, appearing as an established country or kingdom, though one without much impact on the history or politics of the world up until that point and likely largely unknown to most."
1691,,800,Magik Movement,Marvel Midnight Suns,Domain,"You have a similar mutation to Illyana Rasputina. Just like Magik you can teleport yourself and others with stepping stones using another dimension like Limbo as an in between.

For an extra 100 CP this dimension is one where you are master and can’t be used by other beings without your express permission."
1692,,800,Sphere of Influence,Marvel 2099,Domain,"You possess a small sphere around yourself - about 3 meters in diameter if you’re human sized - in which you can warp reality, or as the possessor described it “The only natural laws that operate in here are the ones I happen to like.” Within this sphere you can render matter intangible, fly, destroy objects, paralyze people, shrink people, communicate telepathically while preventing other telepaths from eavesdropping, create energy which launches outwards, reverse the flow of time, and theoretically much more. This doesn’t necessarily mean you’re invulnerable within it. Using these powers requires your active concentration and will, and can be both difficult and exhausting; while going intangible or teleporting is relatively easy, doing something like reversing the flow of time even a few minutes to revive someone recently killed will push you to your limit at least at first, and trying to simply heal someone from the edge of death might fail. Even outside of the limits exhaustion place upon you, if you pulled someone in they could still headbutt you and knock you out if you didn’t actively use your power to stop them, and someone capable of controlling or projecting sufficient power could simply overwhelm and even temporarily destroy your sphere of influence; be wary of other reality warpers and even just telekinetics or magic. In the end, however, your stamina and wits will be your biggest limiters within this small sphere."
1693,,800,Access,Amalgam Comics,Domain,"You really aren’t from around here, having become aware during the Brother’s conflict of immense cosmic power. You can open portals to variant timelines of the reality the Jump is in, summon people from them, or even touch two people and produce a third that fuses their personality, abilities and history. You can also recognize any time-travelers or dimension hoppers on sight. You can adjust time a little forward or back when traveling, no going back to see the dinosaurs, but if you wanted to go back a few months or treat a timeline as if it had paused when you left, go ahead. You can also teleport with universal range."
1694,,800,Reality Marble,Fate,Domain,"The rare ability of projecting your inner world onto the surrounding area, this allows you to warp reality in certain ways while this technique is active. However, not only does it require a long incantation, it is also a short term ability, as reality itself tries to remove it's existence. There are ways around this limitation though, but you'll need to find them for yourself. Remember, this is NOT reality warping in the absolute sense, but rather projecting what represents YOU the most. For Shirou, it was swords and allowed him to replicate nearly any sword in the form of Unlimited Blade Works. For Alexander it was his mighty army, which came back from the dead to support him when he used Ionioi Hetairoi."
1695,,800,THE GUILDPACT ,MtG - Ravnica,Domain,"The Guildpact is an ancient spell which reverberates across the entire plane of Ravnica. Originally conceived by Azor I, It operates as a basis for all Ravnican law, setting statutes and ordinances for each guild so that each of the ten guilds have their own place in Ravnica. An example of its power would be the enforcement of anyone who has directly violated a Guildpact law by a Boros officer. If such an act were to be undertaken, even a parun would be unable to break the magical binding force of the laws.

Though the Guildpact has been found to have many loopholes, and has been rewritten and reincarnated a few times, the book you now hold is a true guildpact. You have one of two options. If you wish to wield it, then you may do so. It allows the complete enforcement of societal laws on any particular plane or world. Your other option is to destroy the book. If you do so, you will effectively shatter the laws and regulations of the plane or world you are currently on. Chaos and anarchy will break loose with almost frightening speed, and if those in charge are unable to rebuild what you have broken, you could change a world forever.

If the book is destroyed, you get a new copy at the beginning of your next Jump."
1696,,800,Reality Marble ,Tsukihime,Domain,"The World around you is very much alive,and imposes its own rules upon all who dwell within it. But every person alive is a world of their own, as well. And you’ve learned how to make it so. You may impose this ‘inner world’, usually but not always representative of your personality and desires, upon the physical world around you, changing its laws to match those of the world within. Unlike Marble Phantasm, which is reshaping the world according to your will and its existing laws, your Reality Marble has a set world’ and ‘rules’ behind it chosen when you purchase this perk. Perhaps your body is a collection of various lives and familiars that count towards your own, or you create a fog that feeds off the fear of those within it and making those fears a reality. Either way, you may manifest this world and impose it on The World, keeping it manifested so long as your magical reserves could sustain it before the World re-asserts its normal rules - though a Reality Marble that is only imposed on your own body could be sustained indefinitely, as the World itself does not see it as a contradiction to its own laws.

While most Dead Apostles develop this trait naturally after some time and research, the benefit to purchasing it is worth noting. First, you suffer no degradation (physical or mental) from your chosen Reality Marble - one that requires a particular sort of insanity wouldn’t afflict you in anysort of way, nor would your personality be lost in a sea of various beings contained within it. Second, you may create your own or recreate a Reality Marble belonging to someone else in this world, though practice and effort would be needed to create something akin to TATARI and be able to sustain it for more than a short amount of time with what you start with. Third, it is based entirely on your experiences - so a ‘collection’ Reality Marble such as Unlimited BladeWorks or Ionian Hetairoi would be based on only what you have seen or experienced first-hand one way or another. Lastly, you may decide the suitably thematic incantation (if any) for the Marble yourself.

1697,,800,Sailor​ ​Castle​ ​,Sailor Moon,Domain,"This is free to have during the jump for Senshi, but you must pay to keep it after the jump. The moons that orbited the planetary Kingdoms always watched over the planet. Like guardians. It was for this purpose that they were chosen as the locations of the castles of the Senshi that ruled and protected their world. These castles were fitted with the most powerful technology of the Silver Millennium. So great and advanced was the tech around it, and the architecture built so masterfully that it still stands today, in working condition. As if it was never almost demolished by the dark forces of Queen Beryl. This is probably because of the amazingly efficient self-repairing technology of the palace. It could create matter from nothing. Even when it’s owners were dead, it continued to function for almost a thousand years, off the almost infinite energy supply. It appears to cater to the owner and their guests’ every whim--no comfort is spared here. If you want food, you’ll find that it’ll appear right in front of you.

You can contact other people from this Castle, and it can act as a base of operations. Unfortunately, the Sailor Castle of Mysterious Protectors could not stand the test of time--the massive CP Price is needed to completely repair the castle, as it lacked the self-repairing technology. The price has been lowered slightly for them, as they do still technically own the Castle. And if they buy the Castle, they’ll find that it has been given the self-repair system (plus defunct superweapon) free of extra charge.

However, the castle’s superweapon, the cannon, is defunct. It was never included in th self-repairing system, as there was a chance something could go wrong without manual input and fire off the cannon. Thus, you will still need to buy the superweapon within it to be able to activate it, or fix it yourself.

This castle is appropriately spaced and can act as a warehouse add-on if you wish or can be a floating base located in the setting’s orbit when you go to other jumps. In jumps with “strange” orbits, like a virtual reality world, this will become an add-on. You may change between the two during character creation at a jump. You may teleport here any time you like by simply raising your open palm to the sky with the command “Castle Teleport!.”​ ​Sailor Eris’s Castle is called Discordia.
"
1698,,800,Subspace​ ​Dimension​ ​,Sailor Moon,Domain,"This is free during the jump for Villains, but to keep it after the jump they must pay the CP price.

 It is too dangerous to plot and scheme where you’re vulnerable. You know what you’re up against. In order to have complete security, you must stay in another dimension entirely. Thanks to your dark magic, you have a dark mini-dimension where you live and scheme in peace. This dimension jams most attempts to scry or enter it by someone who isn’t your ally. Inside this dimension is a spacious castle with much luxury and elegance, although the interior can be designed up to your tastes with the mere thought of a command. This can act as a warehouse add-on or a separate place entirely. You and your companions can flee to this dimension anytime you like, and at any place in it from the outside world. With just a mere thought, your companions will have a safe haven. Tracing a path to this dimension is difficult, and this dimension is a challenge to even detect. It would in most cases take a fluke for someone to find this place.

This dimension is not a big one. It is about a large city’s size. It could be perfect as the capital of an evil empire, but it’s pretty dark, lit only by the lanterns that illuminate the halls of your castle. Perhaps you could build something here, but that would require magic or outside resources. But for you, the castle is at least comfy and roomy, and well-lit.

With some experimentation, you can even learn to utilize your abilities with much more finesse, allowing for very specific usage of this magic that not only exerts much less stress overall, but offers far greater utility. Feats such as aging a planted seed to see it rapidly mature into a tree, or freezing a volley of bullets in midair in order to evade it becomes child’s play to you. As a bonus, having power over time means that whenever the passage of time is affected by someone else, you won’t be affected by it unless you will so, and will be aware whenever time is altered. Finally, since time is intertwined with space, after significant progression of your powers, you may find yourself being able to alter space itself by manipulating time in certain ways.

Covering 70% of the Earth’s surface and containing thousands of creatures - some completely undiscovered by humanity - this slice of real estate is definitely worth the price. You have total control of your ocean, able to sense anything happening within it, and can transport yourself across it instantly. It is self-cleaning and pristine, though it is up to you what happens to all the garbage and junk. You may import it into future jumps so long as there is an ocean."

The appearance of these locations can be changed at your discretion, who can enter is up to your discretion but powerful beings, and the cunning/tricky may break a way in or find a way in respectively. 

- Olympus (The Heavens): Home of the gods, resting upon a peak that rises above the clouds and doesn't touch the earth. This land looks over all the earth allowing you a birds eye view of any location that is touched by the air of the living. All the sky is yours to command.

- Hades (The Underworld): Hidden deep in the bowels of the earth, away from the prying eyes of Olympus, and the final resting place of the souls of the world. This land has a few features that will remain even if you edit it those are the five rivers that flow through it (Styx, Acheron, Cocytus, Phlegethon, and Lethe) and a large dark pit (Tartarus) that can be used as a prison for the most vile and worst beings anything in this pit loses access to most of their powers becoming as strong as they would be as a new born baby. In its current state Hades is divided into four regions (not including Tartarus) those being the Elysian Fields (Dwelling of heroes and the excellent), Fields of Mourning (Those hurt by love), Asphodel Meadows (Ordinary people), and the home of its ruler residing at its center. You can choose to have openings leading to your underworld scattered throughout the surface of the world. (Check Note Section)

- Water (Both Fresh and Salty): All the world's water is your domain from the lakes, rivers, springs, and ponds to the oceans. Only the surface is seen by the Heavens but that is not a lot given the vastness of your domain, heck even in modern times there are places that are unexplored and you know all of them, being able to sense when something enters your waters and instinctively know where they are all the creatures that live here know that you are the one who allows them to use your waters as their home and will listen to you and come to your aid.

- Gaia (The Earth) (Purchase Of “Olympus”, “Hades”, and “Water”: Control of all three domains grants you the full dominion of Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades who had decided to share command of the earth as such should you hold control of all three of their domains then it's only right you gain the fourth region (The Earth) for free.

Simply being near it will fill those you deem fitting with supernatural vitality and strength, their wounds knitting before their eyes while curses wane in strength. As the Lord of this tree, you will be provided a throne from which to rule, a sure sign of your authority that only the most blasphemous would seek to go against."
1706,,1000,Wisdom of the Sage,The God of High School,Domain,"You inherited a portion of the King’s Power, the innate Divine ability of the Jade Emperor Ohkwang. This power allows for the manipulation of the Four Fundamental Forces of the Universe. Strong Force, Weak Force, Electromagnetism and Gravity. The King himself was able to fling whole planets around the solar system like pinballs or disintegrate half the bodies of High Gods with a wave of his hand and his true successor, Han Dae-Wi, will be every bit as mighty. You however, have only received a portion of this power. You could fly or destroy whole houses with a thought or construct various weapons and items from thin air but the heady heights of power the Kings possessed are years away from you. As time passes and you practise your power, you will grow in both the control you have, the range of your ability and the magnitude of what you may effect. This ability turns one of your iris’ wholly black, with a golden Omega symbol in place of your pupil, at least when the ability is in use.

Boosted: The Eye of the King is a mighty thing, coveted by all the other Gods. But it is limited in its’ own way, only able to manipulate the mundane world. Your nature has improved it, evolved it. The eye that you gain is now capable of seeing and manipulating any supernatural energy that you yourself possess. The scale it works on will resemble the base Fundamental Force control, possessing a similar growth speed and soft cap. You will be able to manipulate the life energy of yourself and other beings on a massive scale, even just ripping it straight out of other people to use in your own attacks.

1707,,1000,Playing With Marbles,Fate/Stay Night,Domain,"A Reality Marble. An incredibly rare and powerful technique. It is the forcible projection of your inner world, the core part of you, into the real world around you. It creates a dimensional pocket of sorts that draws in all those around you for a period of time, creating an arena of your design in which to fight. In this arena, you also gain a powerful new ability, such as summoning copies of legendary weapons you have encountered, calling past allies to your side, negating any use of magic and so on. Whatever this ability is, it can also manifest to you outside of your Reality Marble in smaller, weaker forms such as only summoning a small handful of the monsters within your inner self, rather than the thousands you might be able to call upon if you fully manifested it. These realms cannot last forever, the World around you exerting immense pressure because of the changes you have made to reality by the use of this. Thus, no Reality Marble can last longer than a few minutes, though experience and skill improves this over time. 

Your Reality Marble is based around a concept of your choosing though no matter what it's base is, it cannot be any stronger then the Reality Marble that one Emiya Shirou eventually becomes able to create as the Heroic Spirit- Archer. Unlike normal users of this ability, your mind will not be twisted or changed in any way through the purchase or use of this. You will also begin with a great deal more skill in the use of the power, the equivalent of twenty years of training in the ability, enough to make it last for a full 30 minutes before you are too tired to maintain the field for any longer and must rest the ability."

1709,,1000,Seed of Yggdrasil,Solo Leveling,Domain,"Possibly a creation of The Absolute, the World Tree is a gargantuan magical tree whose branches are large enough to cover the skies and its trunk is thicker and larger than any mountain. The most important thing about this tree is its fruits. Each of them hosts an unborn Winged Soldier, who will be absolutely loyal to either the owner of the tree or those designated by them. Their power varies greatly, normally being equal to the mass monsters that Monarchs produce, but rarely giving birth to General and beyond Monsters, the mightiest of which may be able to briefly compete with Rulers or Monarchs themselves. 

While the Winged Soldiers of the Rulers lack the variety that the Monsters birthed by the Monarchs, their high numbers and personal power provided an equal balance to the combined efforts of the Eight and then Nine Monarchs’ armies.

You get a single Seed of this tree, which will quickly grow into another World Tree that recognizes you as its sole master, but you may designate others to also benefit from the loyalty of the Winged Soldiers on your behalf. Doing so would make those winged soldiers completely loyal to them instead of you. If used or if the tree is destroyed, you will get another seed after 10 years or the next Jump, whichever comes sooner."

Such is the mantle that now seems to have come to rest on your shoulders. Mayne due to some freakish accident, it seems that a new Nadare has been born, even though the current one has yet to expire. This is also significant as the death of the Nadare that marks  the end of the current cycle, since their demise brings forth an Universal Fall. Or maybe you could replace the current Nadare entirely in this cycle. This choice is up to you, but you will suffer no ill- consequences regardless of what you pick.

Even if it is the title held by a loser who is destined to always fail at the end under the rule of the Avesta, it is not an empty power. In fact, this mantle makes you possibly the most powerful being in this universe barring the Truth herself, as one of her sensories.

This fearsome position comes from the natural ability of all the Nadares: the Fractured World. A power derived from the application of the Law of the Godhead, it confers an Authority-like control over space through the entire universe. From celestial bodies to galaxies, and down to even the space between atoms, everything can be rearranged with incredible precision. Stars can be moved with a thought, beings on the power of the Arch-Demons and candidates for becoming the new Hegemon can be torn to pieces or moved from one end of the universe to the other with no cost.

It is a defense that can make so no attack can ever reach the user, by bending space and causality, so no blade can pierce the user’s strength. One that even those capable of taking down the Truth herself and replacing her as the new Godhead would have a hard time overcoming.

Not only that, but the body of the Nadare is comparable to a universe itself, built similarly to the Transcendence Gods. In fact, it is the only example of such an existence that can be maintained in the deterministic cosmos of the Avesta. As such, your body has the same density as the universe, and to damage it would require a force capable of destroying it. Albeit, this doesn’t grant you much in terms of physical strength or actual skill. 

You also seem to have copied the other ability of the current Nadare, which makes it so any of your enemies have the causality of their actions reflected, making any attack miss. This is however only effective on those who are below your godly scale and can have unforeseen consequences when someone of your scale or above tries to pierce through it.

Finally, this also grants you the ability to summon and control the ship Singularity Angra Mainyu, a majestic spaceship from an era before any of the cycles of the current universe. It grants protection to universal scale effects, such as the Universal Fall. You can control the entire ship with your will alone, as well as to move it freely through the universe. You can also freely forcibly teleport anyone inside, and even institute a no-killing area inside it in which bringing death becomes impossible, unless they have the power of a god themselves.

Finally, due to your special nature, all of these gifts are not tied to the continued existence of the Truth, or her favor."
1711,,1000,Innovate Clear        ,HighSchool DxD,Domain,"This one has the ability to create an ideal world in another dimension, in a way somewhat similar way to what Annihilation Maker and Dimension Lost would seem if used together, the user can enter and create whatever they want in that pocket dimension, it can be even used it to create perfect replicas of people and situations, making perfect predictions of how things would go if the circumstances were altered. However, anything made inside of Innovate Clear's world can only exist in that world."
1712,,1000,Dimension Lost,HighSchool DxD,Domain,"When you’re tired of something, the best place to throw it is in a trash can. And there’s very few better trash cans than the Dimensional Gap. This Longinus has the power to create mist that can block any attack, and can transport anyone or anything within that mist into a displaced artificial dimensional space. It has no direct offensive abilities, but once the mist has finished expanding to the size of a country, it can banish everything within into the Dimensional Gap - where all things lacking magical protection are annihilated in but a few seconds."
1713,,1000,Zenith Tempest,HighSchool DxD,Domain,"Allows the user to manipulate the weather and elemental attributes that exists in nature, which grants them control over fire, wind, lightning, water, earth, and ice. Even control or create weather inside of places where weather conditions do not exist. Such weather control can easily be on the scale of an entire country. It can also create things like giant bubbles to trap others, or alternatively contain varying effects such as stimulating the most precious memories of whoever they touch or inflicting divine punishment on them."
1714,,1000,Full Moon,Elden Ring - Liurnia of the Lakes,Domain,"High in the night sky, all who look up can see a massive celestial object which has made an important connection with you. You are bound to this moon, just as it is bound to you. More akin to a conceptual representation than a giant rock in space, it possesses no gravity unless you desire it, no effect upon the worlds that it gazes upon, it does not have to rely on the light of the sun to let itself be seen, astrologers could even gaze past it like it was not even there, should you desire it. Those whose light it shines upon will find the potency of their spells vastly improved, especially those connected to moonlight and frost, so long as they are either you or someone allied with yourself."
1715,,1000,Superposition,Hellsing Ultimate Abridged,Domain,"“I think therefore I am.” Like the Doctor’s most adorable experiment, you’ve been imbued with a curious kind of self-targeted reality warping, with a dash of omnipresence thrown in. So long as you believe something about yourself, you will be that thing. Schrodinger used this power to be “everywhere and nowhere,” appearing inside secure facilities or back at the Major’s side simply by believing themself to be there. They also recovered from absurd injuries and even death just by believing that they were fine. Should you choose, this power can also be applied more creatively. Want a cat tail for the sake of a throwaway joke? Believe and it will be so. Only two conditions can prevent this power from functioning; the loss of self or the destruction of your soul. Best be careful around True Vampires and other such monsters.

We also need to elaborate on the mindfuck that is Schrodinger’s powers. Yes, their abilities grant you an absurd amount of power. You can teleport yourself anywhere, even into mental spaces like Zorin’s illusions, with just the power of belief. You can alter your appearance and physiology in an instant, and can recover from any injury (even death) so long as your soul isn’t destroyed or your sense of identity isn’t lost. All that said, this power does come with limitations.

In addition to the above weaknesses, this power cannot be used as a shortcut to godhood. You can’t believe yourself to be omniscient or conjure up new information on a whim. If you want the answers to your questions, you’ll have to go out and find them yourself, which your new abilities will no doubt assist with. When in doubt, compare to the source material."
1716,,1000,Hell Lord,Marvel Magic,Domain,"You are no bottom-feeding devil or mouth-breathing spirit. You are a Lord of Hell, a king among the infernal. Your magic and strength are enhanced in power and scope and you have a slice of hell over which you rule. In your own dimension, you are immortal and near all-powerful. If someone were to somehow destroy you inside of it, you would simply reform.

By default it has a rather bleak appearance, fitting for a hell. However, you may reshape the inside of your dimension at-will. It will begin with size comparable to a large city, but buy feeding souls to it, you may increase its size. In addition, you may import any sort of pocket dimension that you already possess into this role and in the future you may even be able to have it devour other pocket dimensions that you gain, merging them together and increasing the size."
1717,,1000,Eternal Undying Paradise,Ragna Crimson,Domain,"The power of the King of Bones, one which warps reality around the user, or any fragment of the user’s body. Any space around either of those gets dragged into a different plane made out of flesh and bone, that counts as both the domain and body of the user. This may be multiple spaces in the case of fragments instead of the main body.

Anything that dies inside of this realm becomes also a part of the user’s body, turning undying puppets from which the user can speak and attack other targets, as well as using their own abilities. No matter the attack, as long as the user or the fragment remains, they will keep regenerating. It is possible, with extremely powerful attacks, to breach these sealed dimensions.

As the user always counts as being inside of themselves, they always count as unable to die. Unless their entire realm is destroyed, they will remain undying forever.

If the user grows powerful enough, their main body may be able to eventually engulf the entire
world and replace it with themselves."
1718,,1000,Dimension Lord ,DC Occult,Domain,"You are the proud owner of a magical dimension. Whether you inherited it from your parent, usurped it from their control, or gained it in some other way entirely, this is a world all your own. It can be something associated with your parent, such as a section of Hell or a slice of Faerie, or it can be a dimension all its own. Whatever the case, within this dimension, your power is increased significantly as you gain dominion over all of the magical power that exists within the dimension. The world can be reshaped to your will, allowing you to change the environment as you wish or control the weather on a whim.

By default, this dimension is roughly 20,000 square miles in size and you may choose to have it be inhabited by residents that are fitting to it. This could be anything from humans to elementals, fae to golems, or a variety mix. Whatever the case, these residents are absolutely loyal to you and can number anywhere from none to several million.

Even outside of this dimension, you may draw on its power, though not nearly so much as while within and it is possible to block your attempts to do so. Drawing on its power outside of it does not increase your power, it simply allows you to recover your pool of magical energy much faster. You may also summon the residents outside of your dimension to serve you.

You may also import another dimension you have to gain these effects. Each new jump you may choose if the dimension remains the same, is a copy of one of your previous dimensions, or if it is in a separate locale based on your desired settings, such as jungle, ocean, mountain top castle, hellscape etc. Should your dimension be a copy of an older one it will be populated by facsimiles of its previous inhabitants, should it be an old one it will have the original beings. Do note that these beings are not companions, and attempting to use the Dimension as a pod will leave whoever it is you tried to bring along in a safe spot in the dimension they entered yours from. You make your choice on if your Dimension is a copy, one of your old dimensions, or a new dimension the first time you access it each jump. Time in inactive dimensions is frozen. Post chain you may merge these dimensions together in whatever way you choose.

1719,,1000,Boundary of Reality ,Touhou Project: Forbidden Hermit,Domain,"You have complete control over all boundaries, such as between distances, night and day, even relatively abstract ideas. You can see into every dimension simultaneously without being affected from information overload. By manipulating the boundary between night and day you could easily create a night that lasts forever. By manipulating the boundary between dimensions, you could travel between Gensokyo and the Outside World, Heaven, Hell or to similar alternate dimensions. By manipulating the boundary of distances, you could travel anywhere easily, including to other planets. Nor do you need to target yourself; you can open (ominous-looking) gaps anywhere you could affect your power or manipulate the boundaries of nearly anything you can perceive. This power’s real limits are your imagination.
"
1720,,1200,Elysian Realm,Honkai Impact 3rd,Domain,"The Elysian Realm. It is an extremely weird place, where you might encounter simulations of the most powerful people of the past era: The Flame-Chasers. The only real people in this world would be the ones entering it from the outside, and Klein, the ELF maintaining this place. While in this jump, you have to decide on a fixed entrance to this place. Post-Jump, this becomes a Warehouse Attachment. If you take this, you can directly learn from the best of the best of the past era. Or, simulations of them, at least. For an additional 600cp, you can also import the Flame-Chasers as Companions at the height of their power and prowess. Be warned, just because they’re your companions doesn’t prevent them from betraying you if you go against humanity."
1721,,1400,Your Personal Multiverse(Upgrade),Epic of Leviathan,Domain,"Given the power of the beings, multiverses are far more common here and there are even multiple Omniverses. Given the number of them, I'm sure no one would mind if you took one. The 600 CP option allows you to claim a single multiverse. This multiverse will be based around a single world and its numerous variations. You could choose one of the canon multiverses or you could create your own. The second level is to take this one step further. If you pay 2000 CP then you may claim your own Omniverse. The Omniverse is made up of countless multiverses. You will be recognized as the undisputed leader of your realm and you may design any realms you desire before purchasing it.

Requires Your Personal Multiverse to Purchase"
1722,,1600,Godstones,Gods of Blood and Powder,Domain,"You get the 3 godstones everyone on at least 3 continents is looking for. Those truly ancient giant obelisks are weaved in potent sorcery making them basically indestructible with the technology and sorcery of this time. They whisper into the minds of people around them, driving people and spirits alike insane if they come too near for too long With the blood sacrifice of a million souls as well as that of at least two-three powerful sorcerers you will be able to unlock the stones, having them open a portal directly into the Else, the source of magic. There you will find an orb of blackness, the essence of gods, ready for the taking. There’s the possibility of other people entering through the portals challenging you for power, so you better guard the stones. Buying the stones here will have them ready with all the necessary blood sacrifices already made, enabling you to immediately take the power yourself, have someone else take it or share it among many. In further settings you will have to make the appropriate sacrifices to unlock the stones again, granting others the power of gods or taking it yourself again to become even more powerful if you wish. In settings without sorcerers to be sacrificed you will have to find other powerful individuals or sacrifice far far more people.

The stones will integrate themselves somehow into your warehouse or be inserted into new settings wherever you wish in future jumps."
1723,,4000,The Worldstone,Diablo 3,Domain,"How...no how do you have this? This was destroyed long ago by Tyrael... Well I suppose I should tell you what this does: The Worldstone was used to create Sanctuary by itself. It was used by both Heaven in Hell in order to create places according to their designs and became poisoned by them both.

It resembles a gigantic red mountain towering over anything in Sanctuary. An impressive size regarding the true size of some powerful Demons. The stone also stops Beings from outside of it’s planted ground to manifest in the same world without very demanding workarounds. It also doesn’t allow teleportation or fast movement (faster than a normal horse could run) of any kind within a gigantic radius around it, so you and anyone else need to approach it by natural and normal movement.

You can create with this stone anything you want with barely any restriction while you are touching it and think of what you want to make. You can create entire structures, fortresses and powerful weapons out of nothing. With enough time and effort you could recreate Sanctuary or maybe even something else using its power.

The pure Worldstone by itself cannot destroy, so you cannot create something, where something physical is already existing in order to destroy it. You also cannot create something midair to let it drop down to destroy something.

You still should be careful, since this power will always be sought after...and using the Worldstone too much will poison it. Also important to note: The Worldstone can be used by anyone who is touching it. I would advise building a fortress around it. (See Notes what the Poisoned Worldstone does) Buying this requires you to take the ‘Owner of the Worldstone’ Drawback for no cp.

This is the only Item you cannot upgrade in any way. You may build Structures around it in order to protect it, but the Worldstone itself cannot be altered without poisoning or destroying it."
